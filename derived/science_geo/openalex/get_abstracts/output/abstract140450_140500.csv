https://openalex.org/W2129936304,"ErbB-2/HER2 is an important signaling partner for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Overexpression of erbB-2 is also associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. To investigate how erbB-2 amplification affects its interactions with the EGFR, we used a human mammary epithelial cell system in which erbB-2 expression was increased 7–20-fold by gene transfection. We found that amplification of erbB-2 caused constitutive activation of erbB-2 as well as ligand-independent activation of the EGFR. Overexpression of erbB-2 strongly inhibited erbB-2 down-regulation following transactivation by EGFR. Significantly, down-regulation of activated EGFR was also inhibited by erbB-2 amplification, resulting in enhanced ligand-dependent activation of the EGFR. The rate of EGFR endocytosis was not affected by erbB-2 overexpression, but the rate of lysosomal targeting was significantly reduced. In addition, erbB-2 overexpression promoted rapid recycling of activated EGFR back to the cell surface and decreased ligand dissociation from the EGFR. Our data suggest that overexpression of erbB-2 inhibits both its down-regulation and that of the EGFR. The net effect is increased signaling through the EGFR system.

Overexpression of each of the receptors (EGFR, erbB-2, erbB-3, and erbB-4) has been correlated with poor prognosis in breast and other cancers (6Bacus S.S. Zelnick C.R. Plowman G. Yarden Y. Am. J.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1813-1821PubMed Google Scholar). Compelling clinical studies on breast cancer reveal that amplification of erbB-2 has a high degree of correlation with disease recurrence and poor survival (9Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A.

Both clinical and basic research studies indicate a role for erbB-2 amplification in initial transformation events and in progression to metastases (10Bouchard L. Lamarre L. Tremblay P.J. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1989; 57: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 11Tan M. Yao J. Yu D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the correlative evidence between erbB-2 overexpression and breast cancer, however, the mechanism by which erbB-2 facilitates cell transformation is unknown. The EGFR has five known ligands (EGF, transforming growth factor-α, heparin binding EGF-like growth factor, amphiregulin, and betacellulin) that directly bind and activate the receptor (12Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Three other ligands, heregulin, heregulin-2, and heregulin-3, bind to erbB-3 and/or erbB-4 (3Chang H. Riese II, D.J. Gilbert W. Stern D.F. McMahan U.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 5Peles E. Yarden Y.

No ligand has been found that binds erbB-2, although both EGF and heregulin can activate erbB-2 in-trans through ligand-induced heterodimerization and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB-2 (14Karunagaran D.

ErbB-2 can be directly phosphorylated by the activated primary receptor (e.g. EGFR or erbB-4) (17Qian X. LeVea C.M. Freeman J.K. Dougall W.C. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alternately, formation of the heterodimer induces a conformation change that activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain of erbB-2 (18Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Bai F. Rose D.W. Leitner J.W.

Presumably, extensive interactions between EGF receptor family members allows for diversification of signaling cascades (21Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L.

Treat. 1995; 35: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The EGFR is negatively regulated by both serine and threonine phosphorylation as well as by intracellular trafficking (23Lund K.A. Wiley H.S. Sibley D. Houslay M. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. 3. John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., Sussex1993: 277-303Google Scholar). Rapid internalization and lysosomal degradation result in short-term as well as long-term down-regulation of receptor activity (24Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Proper trafficking of the EGFR is important for regulation of cell growth (25Wells A. Welsh B.J. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 2751-2760Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Many signaling complexes are thought to be activated by assembly at the cell surface, and internalization has been proposed to negatively regulate this activity (24Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 26Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). Once internalized, occupied receptors are sorted in recycling endosomes and subsequently degraded in lysosomes, effectively reducing the number of activated receptors. Overexpression of EGFR has been shown to impair their down-regulation, apparently because of limiting levels of regulatory molecules that mediate rapid endocytosis and lysosomal targeting (24Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 27Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28French A.R.

Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Although activation of erbB-2, erbB-3, and erbB-4 has been well characterized, the negative regulation of these receptors has not been extensively studied. There are conflicting reports regarding the trafficking of erbB-2 following transactivation with EGF. We, as well as other investigators, have described efficient down-regulation and lysosomal targeting of erbB-2 in three different cell types (20Worthylake R. Wiley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8594-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Kornilova E.S. Taverna D. Hoeck W. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 511-519PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, chimeric receptors composed of the EGFR extracellular domain and the erbB-2 cytoplasmic domain, were not down-regulated following activation with EGF (31Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In another study, down-regulation of erbB-2 was investigated in SKBR-3 cells, which have an amplified erbB-2 gene (32King C.R. Borrello I. Bellot F. Comoglio P. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was reported that although erbB-2 was transactivated following EGF treatment, there was no measurable change in erbB-2 half-life. One way to reconcile these disparate results is to postulate that although lysosomal targeting is normally involved in erbB-2 down-regulation, it is impaired when erbB-2 is overexpressed. To test this hypothesis, we examined the negative regulation of erbB-2 in mammary epithelial cells that overexpress the protein due to introduction of a transgene. We found that overexpression of erbB-2 severely inhibits its own down-regulation. Intriguingly, we also found that down-regulation of the EGFR was inhibited even though EGFR levels were similar between parental and erbB-2 overexpressing cells. Consistent with the findings of other investigators, we found that overexpression of erbB-2 results in an elevated basal level of activated receptors (33Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 34Ram T.G. Ethier S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 551-567PubMed Google Scholar). However, we not only observed constitutive activation of erbB-2, but also of EGFR. These results show that receptor cross-talk is not only important in receptor activation, but also plays a role in negative regulatory processes. N-13 polyclonal antibody directed against the amino-terminal 13 residues of the EGF receptor was a gift from Dr. Debora Cadena. 1917 polyclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal 18 residues of erbB-2 was provided by Dr. Gordon Gill. Ab5 mouse monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of erbB-2 was from Oncogene Sciences. 225 mouse monoclonal antibody against the EGFR was purified from hybridomas obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. RC20 anti-phosphotyrosine/horseradish peroxidase conjugate was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies 13A9 against the EGFR and 4D5 against human erbB-2 were gifts from Genentech. These were directly labeled with Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 dyes, respectively, following the manufacture's protocol (Molecular Probes, Inc.). B82 mouse L cells transfected with the gene for human EGF receptor were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing dialyzed 10% calf serum (HyClone) and 5 μm methotrexate. The human mammary epithelial cell lines MTSV1–7, ce1, and ce2 have been described previously (35D'Souza B. Berdichevsky F. Kyprianou N. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1797-1806PubMed Google Scholar) and were obtained from Dr. Joyce Taylor-Papadimitriou. They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum (HyClone), 1 μm insulin, and 5 μmdexamethasone. Selection for erbB-2 expression was maintained using 500 μg/ml G418. Confluent cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer (36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. First Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), debris was removed by centrifugation and samples were brought to 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein from each sample was separated on a 5–7.5% polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. EGFR and erbB-2 were detected by N-13 and 1917 polyclonal sera, respectively, using125I-labeled protein A as described (20Worthylake R. Wiley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8594-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The concentrations and incubation times with 125I-labeled protein A were in the linear range of the protein load of the gels. The blots were analyzed by storage phosphor plates using the Bio-Rad G250 Molecular Imager. The Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst software package was used to quantify the amount of radioactivity associated with each band. To determine the phosphotyrosine content of erbB-2 and the EGFR, cells were lysed for 10 min at 0 °C in RIPA buffer supplemented with 100 μm Na3VO4. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and receptors were immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of either the 1917 or 4D5 antibodies (erbB-2) or 2 μg of 225 (EGFR) and 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry). The beads were washed several times in lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer prior to gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose. Phosphotyrosine levels were measured by detection with RC20 antibody and the Renaissance ECL kit from NEN Life Science Products Inc. Blots were exposed to film, and analyzed using a Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer and the Molecular Analyst software package. Distribution of both EGFR and erbB-2 was evaluated using fixed and permeabilized cells as described previously (20Worthylake R. Wiley H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8594-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for 1 h with a mixture of 13A9 and 4D5 antibodies directly labeled with Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 dyes, respectively, at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. After rinsing, the cells were mounted in Prolong anti-fade medium (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and viewed with a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope with a ×60, 1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective. Images were acquired as described below. Specificity of the labeling was verified by using control cells (B82) lacking EGFR and human erbB-2. To follow the transfer of EGFR to lysosomes, the lysosomes were first labeled by incubating cells for 15 min at 37 °C with 5 mg/ml fluorescein-labeled dextran (M r 10,000, anionic, lysine fixable; Molecular Probes, Inc.), then chased for an additional 2 h. During the chase period, cells were pulsed for 15 min with 1.5 × 10−8m EGF-Texas Red-streptavidin complex (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and chased for up to 105 min. Total chase time following the initial fluorescein-labeled dextran treatment was 2 h for all samples. Cells were fixed with 3.6% paraformaldehyde and mounted in Prolong. Coverslips were viewed with a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope with a ×60, 1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective. Sets of 3 images at 3 different focal planes spaced 0.5 μm apart centered on the perinuclear endosomes were acquired at 520 and 615 nm (for fluorescein and Texas Red, respectively). The images (12 bit, 656 × 517) were acquired using a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD camera attached to a Macintosh workstation running Openlab software (Improvision, Inc). The image triplets were deconvolved using nearest-neighbor subtraction (37Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Taylor D.L. Wang Y.L. Fluorescence Microscopy of Living Cells in Culture. 30. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 353-377Google Scholar). The deconvolved image of the lysosomes (fluorescein) was then used to generate a binary mask using grayscale values between 700 and 4095. This mask was then applied to the deconvolved image of the EGF (Texas Red) to identify all lysosomal “objects” that contained EGF. The integrated intensity of all of these objects was then taken as the amount of EGF within lysosomal structures. A mask of the EGF image was generated in the same way and applied to the EGF image to determine the total integrated intensity of all EGF-containing objects within the cell. The fraction of all EGF colocalized in lysosomes was then calculated. At each time point, four random fields of cells were analyzed which contained between 100 and 200 vesicles per field. Number of surface-associated erbB-2 molecules was determined by steady state analysis (38Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1981; 25: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). 4D5 antibody was radioiodinated to a specific activity of 4.5 × 106 cpm/pmol (39Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cells were incubated with concentrations from 6.7 × 10−11 to 2 × 10−8m for 3 h at 37 °C. The relative amount of antibody associated with the cell surface was determined by acid stripping (40Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the data was analyzed as described previously (38Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1981; 25: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis of EGF binding to cells used125I-EGF at a specific activity of 1.6 × 106 cpm/pmol and an incubation period of 4.5 h at 0 °C using ligand concentrations from 1.7 × 10−11to 1.7 × 10−8m as described (40Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific internalization rates for the EGFR were determined as described (40Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements were made using a ligand concentration of 10 ng/ml, and each rate constant determination was derived from a 5-min incubation period with ligand. Specific internalization rates were determined by plotting the integral surface-associated ligand against the amount internalized, and the slopes were determined by linear regression (40Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and no bicarbonate (D/H/B) 12 h before experiments. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 0.1–30 ng/ml 125I-EGF for 3 h to allow the sorting process to reach a steady state (39Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with acid-strip (50 mm glycine-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 3.0) for 2 min at 0 °C to remove surface-bound ligand (39Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and returned to 37 °C in D/H/B containing 1 μg/ml unlabeled ligand to prevent rebinding and reinternalization of recycled ligand. The medium was collected at 10 min and an aliquot counted for total radioactivity. Cells were solubilized with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate and the amount of radioactivity remaining was determined. The medium was loaded on a 15% native polyacrylamide slab gel and the intact and degraded EGF was separated by isotachophoresis (41Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying the gel, the relative amount of radioactivity in the bands corresponding to intact and degraded EGF was quantified using a Bio-Rad G250 Molecular Imager. Cell number per plate was determined by counting parallel plates. Fraction of intact ligand was then plotted as a function of ligand in the cells at the start of the chase (lost into the medium + amount remaining) as described previously (28French A.R. Sudlow G.P. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15749-15755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled to steady state (24 h) with cysteine and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) supplemented with 250 μCi/ml EXPRE35S35S from NEN Life Science Products Inc. which contains both radiolabeled methionine and cysteine. Cultures were rinsed 6 times with normal culture medium and chased with medium with or without 100 ng/ml EGF. At 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 h chase, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of 1917 antibody. Samples were then separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and the gels were then dried on 3MM paper followed by quantitation of erbB-2 bands using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager as described above. Ligand binding not only activates the EGFR but also initiates negative regulatory processes. Overexpression of the EGFR, however, has been shown to inhibit this negative regulation. Since erbB-2 acts as a signaling partner of the EGFR, we wanted to determine whether erbB-2 overexpression affected its own negative regulation, or that of the EGFR. We employed a human mammary epithelial cell line (MTSV) and two derivative lines (ce-1 and ce-2) which have been transfected with the gene for erbB-2 (35D'Souza B. Berdichevsky F. Kyprianou N. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1797-1806PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bartek J. Bartkova J. Kyprianou N. Lalani E.-N. Staskova Z. Shearer M. Chang S. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The parent cell line, derived from human breast aspirates, was immortalized with SV40 large T antigen, but is not tumorigenic. Transfection with the erbB-2 gene alters the growth characteristics of the ce-1 and ce-2 cells in that the transfectants grow in soft agar can be propagated as tumors in nude mice, and show disorganized growth on collagen gels (35D'Souza B. Berdichevsky F. Kyprianou N. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1797-1806PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis and binding of radiolabeled anti-erbB-2 (4D5) at 37 °C was used to quantify the expression levels of erbB-2 in these cells. This approach was taken because equilibrium binding could not be achieved at 0 °C due to the very slow binding of 4D5. Steady state binding at 37 °C also allowed us to estimate the relative distribution of erB-2 between cell surface and intracellular pools (38Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1981; 25: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments showed that treating the cells overnight with 4D5 did not appear to alter the cellular distribution of erbB-2 (data not shown). Steady state binding of anti-erbB-2 indicated an accessible pool of 9.8 × 104 and 1.5 × 106 erbB-2 molecules per cell in MTSV and ce2 cells, respectively (Fig.1 A), a 15-fold increase in the transfected cell line. Acid stripping of the bound radiolabeled 4D5 showed that surface expression of erbB-2 was 6.3 × 104 in the case of MTSV cells and 6.4 × 105 for ce2 cells. ErbB-2 expression in the ce-1 line varied between 2- and 6-fold higher than the parental cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis indicated a 23-fold increase in erbB-2 mass in the ce2 versus MTSV lines, somewhat higher than the values derived from the steady state analysis, suggesting that not all cellular erbB-2 readily exchanges with the cell surface. The affinity of the 4D5 antibody for erbB-2 was similar for both the MTSV and ce2 cells at 12 and 10 nm, respectively. The percent of 4D5 antibody found internalized at steady state was also similar at 41% (±4%) and 55% (±14%) for MTSV and ce2 cells, respectively. The number of EGFR in these cells was determined by Scatchard analysis conducted at 0 °C to prevent receptor down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 1 B, both MTSV and ce2 cells displayed similar numbers of surface EGFR (5.7 × 105 and 9.2 × 105 per cell, respectively) of predominantly a single affinity class. The affinity of these receptors, 1.4 nm, is similar to what has been described previously for fibroblasts (43Wiley H.S. Walsh B.J. Lund K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18912-18920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots of detergent extracts of MTSV, ce1, and ce2 cells confirm that they all express a similar number of EGFR (data not shown). Analysis of the Western blots using a molecular imager indicated that relative to cell protein content, ce2 cells express approximately 10% higher EGFR levels whereas the levels of EGFR in ce1 cells was indistinguishable from the parental MTSV cells. These data indicate that the ratio of EGFR to erbB-2 at the cell surface of MTSV cells is approximately 9:1 whereas the ratio in ce2 cells is approximately 1:1. To characterize erbB-2 and EGFR distribution in these cells, sparse cultures were fixed, permeabilized, and stained using directly labeled erbB-2 and EGFR antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, erbB-2 was found at both the cell surface and in a collection of intracellular vesicles. The EGFR showed a very similar distribution pattern with EGFR and erbB-2 both colocalized at the cell surface and in intracellular vesicles (arrows in Fig. 2). These data suggest that overexpression of erbB-2 is not accompanied by any striking alteration in either its cellular distribution or affinity for antibodies. In addition, the number, distribution, and affinity of EGFR do not appear to be greatly altered as a result of erbB-2 overexpression. Because the EGFR transactivates erbB-2, changing the ratio of erbB-2 to EGFR may alter EGF-mediated erbB-2 phosphorylation. Both parental MTSV cells and overexpressing ce2 cells were treated with EGF for 5 and 10 min. ErbB-2 and EGFR were then immunoprecipitated followed by Western blot analysis for phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)), to monitor receptor activation. As shown in Fig. 3, addition of EGF increased Tyr(P) levels of both EGFR and erbB-2. In the case of the parental MTSV cells, very little receptor phosphorylation was observed in the absence of EGF addition. Surprisingly, in ce2 cells, there was a substantial amount of phosphorylation of both erbB-2 and the EGFR in the absence of EGF. Although increased basal activation of erbB-2 as a result of overexpression has been documented by other investigators (34Ram T.G. Ethier S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 551-567PubMed Google Scholar, 35D'Souza B. Berdichevsky F. Kyprianou N. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1797-1806PubMed Google Scholar, 44Samanta A. LeVea C.M. Dougall W.C. Qian X. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), higher basal activation of the EGFR has not previously been reported. Addition of EGF further increased the level of erbB-2 phosphorylation approximately 3-fold in ce2 cells as compared with 9-fold in the MTSV cells (average of three experiments), indicating that the EGFR was capable of transactivating erbB-2 in both cell types. It seemed possible that constitutive activation of both the EGFR and erbB-2 could be due to autocrine production of EGF-like ligands. We tested this idea by blocking EGFR activation using antagonistic EGFR antibodies 225 and 13A9 (45Gill G.N. Kawamoto T. Cochet C. Le A. Sato J.D. Masui H. McLeod C. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol.

Neither antibody affected the constitutive activation of either the EGFR or erbB-2 (Fig. 3), suggesting that overexpression of erbB-2 alone was responsible. To determine whether overexpression of erbB-2 affects its down-regulation, we transacti"
https://openalex.org/W1990771793,"A new member of the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MMP) subfamily tentatively named MT5-MMP was isolated from mouse brain cDNA library. It is predicted to contain (i) a candidate signal sequence, (ii) a propeptide region with the highly conserved PRCGVPD sequence, (iii) a potential furin recognition motif RRRRNKR, (iv) a zinc-binding catalytic domain, (v) a hemopexin-like domain, (vi) a 24-residue hydrophobic domain as a potential transmembrane domain, and (vii) a short cytosolic domain. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of its transcripts indicates that MT5-MMP is expressed in a brain-specific manner consistent with the origin of its EST clone from cerebellum. It is also highly expressed during embryonic development at stages day 11 and 15. Like other MT-MMPs, MT5-MMP specifically activates progelatinase A when co-expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Its ability to activate progelatinase A is dependent on its proteolytic activity since a mutation converting Glu to Ala in the zinc binding motif HE255LGH renders MT5-MMP inactive against progelatinase A. In contrast to other MT-MMPs, MT5-MMP tends to shed from cell surface as soluble proteinases, thus offering flexibility as both a cell bound and soluble proteinase for extracellular matrix remodeling processes. Taken together, these properties serve to distinguish MT5-MMP as a versatile MT-MMP playing an important role in extracellular matrix remodeling events in the brain and during embryonic development.

Highly modular in design, all MMPs share three basic functional domains found in the smallest MMP matrilysin: (i) a signal peptide for extracellular targeting, (ii) a prodomain with the cysteine-switch for latency, and (iii) a conserved catalytic domain built around a zinc-binding site HEXXH as the catalytic core (5Massova I.

Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). The addition of a hemopexin-like domain to this basic design eventually led to the evolution of the rest of the MMP family and confers them with specificity in substrate as well as inhibitor bindings (5Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 6Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). While the majority of the MMPs are secreted as soluble enzymes into extracellular milieu, a subset of MMPs have been identified in recent years to contain additional sequences downstream of the hemopexin-like domain capable of anchoring the MMPs on plasma membrane (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 8Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J.

Named after the putative transmembrane domains as membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1 to 4 (MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT4-MMPs), these enzymes have been proposed to be the master switches of ECM turnover based on the purported ability of MT-MMPs to activate other MMPs such as progelatinase A and collagenase 3: two degradative enzymes widely implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 11Vassalli J.-D. Pepper M.S.

However, MT-MMPs themselves are synthesized in latent forms and activation is required for them to exert any proteolytic function (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

The mechanism responsible for MT-MMP activation appears to be mediated by members of the proprotein convertase family which can specifically cleave off the prodomain at the carboxyl side of the conserved RXRXKR motif sandwiched between the pro- and catalytic domains of all MT-MMPs, a mechanism first demonstrated in stromelysin-3 (13Pei D.

Thus, a proprotein convertase/MT-MMP/MMP cascade could be potentially responsible for the regulation of ECM turnover at the level of zymogen activation. Despite the extensive sequence homology and functional overlap among MT-MMPs, little is known about any functional cooperation among themselves in executing ECM remodeling. Their patterns of expression suggest a complex picture with overlapping expression in both normal and tumor tissues (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M.

For example, breast cancer tissues are known to express MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, and MT4-MMPs individually or together as detected by Northern blotting and in situhybridization (19Okada A. Bellocq J.-P.

Among tissues and cell examined, expression of MT1-, MT2-, and MT3-MMPs seems to correlate well with the activation of progelatinase A, suggesting that MT-MMPs may act cooperatively toward progelatinase A in vivo (7Sato H.

With the expansion of the MT-MMP family, it becomes apparent that the function of MT-MMPs may not be only restricted to progelatinase A and collagenase 3 activation. In fact, purified MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP can degrade fibronectin, laminin, type I and III collagens, nidogen, tenascin, aggrecan, and perlecan (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 14d'Ortho M.P. Will H. Atkinson S. Butler G. Messent A. Gavrilovic J. Smith B. Timpl R. Zardi L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). MT3-MMP appears to be able to degrade denatured type I collagen (gelatin), native type III collagen, and fibronectin based on limited studies (28Matsumoto S. Katoh M. Saito S. Watanabe T. Masuho Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Shofuda K. Yasumitsu H. Nishihashi A. Miki K. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9749-9754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Taken together, MT-MMPs are a subgroup of versatile proteinases involved in ECM remodeling by both activating other MMPs as well as directly degrading ECM components. In contrast to secreted MMPs, MT-MMPs may express their proteolytic activities more efficiently by anchoring on cell membrane and enjoying two distinct advantageous properties, which are highly focused on ECM substrates and more resistant to proteinase inhibitors present in the extracellular milieu (11Vassalli J.-D. Pepper M.S. Nature. 1994; 370: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 30d'Ortho M.P. Stanton H. Butler M. Atkinson S.J. Murphy G. Hembry R.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently, Nakahara and colleagues (31Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) demonstrated that MT1-MMP is localized in the invadopodia of malignant melanoma cells via the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain, responsible for the efficient degradation of subjacent substrates and invasion into ECM in vitro. MT1-MMP can also confer mouse lung carcinoma cells metastatic phenotype upon transfection when analyzed in a tail-vein injection assay in vivo (32Tsunezuka Y. Kinoh H. Takino T. Watanabe Y. Okada Y. Shinagawa A. Sato H. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5678-5683PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, recent attention has been shifting toward the characterization of membrane-bound MMPs and their biochemical properties (11Vassalli J.-D. Pepper M.S. Nature. 1994; 370: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this report, the identification and characterization of MT5-MMP, the fifth member of the MT-MMP subfamily, is described. MDCK cells and COS 7 were obtained and maintained as described previously (17Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 33Pei D. Yi J. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). DNA restriction and modification enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotide primers were made by the University of Minnesota microchemical core facility. COS cells are used for transient gene expression because the pCR3.1 expression vector system is very efficient in COS cells due to the presence of SV40 T antigen, while moderately efficient in cells lacking T antigen such as MDCK cells. For progelatinase A activation, MDCK is preferred because it expresses higher levels of furin, a putative MT5-MMP activator, than COS (17Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The original EST clone EST27028 was obtained from American Type Cell Culture (ATCC, MD). The rest of EST27028 was sequenced by primer-walking using an ABI371 automatic sequencer. The resulting sequence was blasted against Genbank data base and aligned to 321GNFDT of MT1-MMP. The rest of EST27028 contains basically the entire hemopexin-like domain, followed by a putative transmembrane domain and cytosolic domain. Since this gene is homologous, but not identical to known MT-MMPs, it was named MT5-MMP as the fifth member of the MT-MMP subgroup. An EcoRI fragment from this clone was then isolated and used as a probe to isolate the missing part of MT5-MMP from both human and mouse brain cDNA libraries (Stratagene, CLONTECH, CA). From the human cDNA library, at least 10 clones have been isolated and sequenced to find the longest cDNA starting immediately upstream of the PRCGVPD sequence, but missing the 5′ end approximately 100-amino acid residue. Fortunately, out of 7 clones isolated from the mouse brain cDNA library, two longest clones 3 and 17 overlap to give rise to a complete open reading frame. Clone number 17 covers from the 5′-untranslated region to the seventh residue upstream of the end of MT5-MMP, thus missing the last 6 residues. Clone 3 covers the 3′ portion of the MT5-MMP cDNA. Both clones were sequenced by a combination of shotgun strategy and primer-walking from both strands to give rise to the full-length sequence of mouse MT5-MMP. Sequence alignment was performed via Internet using program Multalin version 5.3.3 at http://www.expasy.ch/www/tools.html using blosum62 with Gap weight: 12; Gap length weight: 2. The dendrogram was constructed using ClustalW program. Premade cDNA panels from mice was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and amplified with two primers located at the 3′ portion of MT5-MMP cDNA (5′-GTGCATGCACTGGGCCATG-3′, 5′-TAGCCTTCCTGCACCCG-3′; 2 min at 94 °C for denaturation, 33 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C for annealing and 30 s at 72 °C for extension, followed by 10 min extension at 72 °C). To control for the amount of cDNA used in each reaction, a parallel amplification using primers designed from the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed under the same experimental conditions. The cDNA clone number 17 (missing the last 6 residues) was engineered by high fidelity PCR to give rise to MT5-MMPΔ6 which includes a FLAG tag at its COOH terminus for detection purposes using M2 monoclonal antibody (33Pei D. Yi J. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A chimeric primer, 5′-GTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCCGCTTATAGTAGGTGAC-3′, was designed to cover part of the MT5-MMP sequence at the carboxyl end as well as the FLAG sequence. This primer was paired with T3 primer from vector to amplify MT5-MMPΔ6 from template clone number 17. The resulting fragment was cloned into pCR3.1uni and confirmed by sequencing as described (17Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Full-length MT5-MMP was constructed by using another primer, 5′-CTCATACCCACTCCTGGACTGGCCGCTTATAGTAGGTGAC-3′, containing the missing 6 residues at the COOH terminus to amplify the entire open reading frame with T3 primer from clone 17. The PCR fragment was cloned and characterized as described above. MT5-MMP(E252A) was made by sequential PCR as described previously using the following primers to convert Glu252 to Ala: 5′-GCCGTGCATGCACTGGGCCAT-3′ and 5′-ATGGCCCAGTGCATGCACGGC-3′. The mutant was cloned into the same pCR3.1uni vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing as described (17Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The antibody against human MT5-MMP was raised in rabbit using GST-hMT5-MMP (Tyr125 to Cys538) as described previously (34Pei D. Majmudar G. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25849-25855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA constructs (1.5 μg each) pCR3.1uniMT5-MMPΔ6, pCR3.1uniMT5-MMP, and pCR3.1uniMT5-MMP(E252A) were transfected into COS 7 cells and their protein products were analyzed by immunoprecipitation as described previously (13Pei D.

To isolate cytosolic as well as membrane fractions, cells were disrupted initially by repeated freeze-thaw cycles and fractionated by centrifugation to partition into supernatants as cytosolic fraction and pellets as membrane fractions. The pellets were washed extensively and extracted with Triton X-100 (1%) in Tris-buffered saline as described (8Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Both cytosolic as well as membrane fractions were analyzed by Western blot as described (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For progelatinase A activation, pCR3.1GelA (0.1 μg) was transfected either alone or with pCR3.1uniMT5-MMPΔ6, pCR3.1uniMT5-MMP, or pCR3.1uniMT5-MMP(E252A) into MDCK cells and the conditioned media were analyzed for gelatinase activity by zymography as described previously (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Expression vector for MT5-MMP was transfected into MDCK cells and stable clones were selected and characterized as described previously (13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

The expressed MT5-MMP products were analyzed by immunoprecipitations for both cell and secreted forms as described above. Synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor BB-94 (5 μm, British Biotech, United Kingdom) was added to the serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and allowed to incubate with MT5-MMP cells. The conditioned media were analyzed for MT5-MMP activity by zymography directly, by Western blot after ∼10-fold concentration using Millipore YM10 membrane filtration as described (13Pei D.

A search of the public EST data base maintained in the National Center for Biotechnology Information produced a few MMP candidate genes. One such clone, EST27028 from human cerebellum with homology to stromelysin-3, actually resembles closely the hemopexin-like domain of MT1-MMP in a BLAST search of sequence data bases. To prove that this EST clone is part of a novel MT-MMP gene, the remaining portion of the open reading frame was sequenced to reveal the presence of a putative transmembrane domain and cytosolic domain. The resulting sequence shows strong homology to human MT3-MMP, thus named MT5-MMP according to the current terminology of this subgroup (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 8Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 9Takino T. Sato H.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.5-kilobase fragment from this EST clone was isolated and used as a probe to screen for full-length clones from both human and mouse brain cDNA library (from CLONTECH and Stratagene). So far, a cumulative sequence for the human MT5-MMP covers the entire predicted open reading frame except the pro-domain upstream of the conserved PRCGVPD cysteine switch. A 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends strategy is currently underway to recover the missing 5′ end. However, the screening for mouse MT5-MMP yielded the full-length open reading frame with both 5′- and 3′-untranslated region (Fig.1). The mouse and human MT5-MMP are over 95% homologous, thus, representing indeed a novel gene of the MT-MMP subgroup. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, MT5-MMP possesses similar structural feature as MT1-, MT2-, and MT3-MMPs with the characteristic Pro, catalytic, hemopexin-like, stem/transmembrane/cytosolic domains, maintaining overall sequence identities of 53, 52.1, and 64.4%, respectively. The homology between MT5-MMP and MT1-, MT2- and MT3-MMPs is more significant among subdomains as displayed in Fig. 2 B, with identity scores 71.1, 68.8, and 86% for catalytic domains, 57.9, 56.2, and 67.4% for the hemopexin domain, as well as 23.4, 25.5, and 48.7% for the stem/transmembrane/cytosolic domain, respectively. However, MT4-MMP appears to be as distant to MT5-MMP as the other non-membrane type MMPs, e.g. stromelysin-3 and interstitial collagenase (Fig.2 B). To further establish the relatedness between MT5-MMP and other MMPs, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using alignment from the catalytic domains of 18 MMPs (not shown). As expected, both human and mouse MT5-MMP are grouped together with MT3-MMP as a sub-branch of the MT-MMP subfamily. Consistent with the homology scores, MT4-MMP is positioned between the MT-MMP subgroup and the main branch of collagenases/stromelysins/gelatinases. To gain insight into the possible role of MT5-MMP in physiological processes, normal tissues were screened for MT5-MMP expression by Northern blotting. Both human and mouse MT5-MMP appears to be expressed in minute quantity in tissues examined (data not shown). Mouse MT5-MMP appears to migrate slightly below the 28 S rRNA with an estimated size of 4.5 kilobases. A more sensitive technique, namely RT-PCR, was then employed to analyze the distribution of MT5-MMP RNA in mouse tissues. As shown in Fig.3, adult brain appears to be the major site of MT5-MMP expression, whereas testis is weakly positive. The rest of adult tissues are virtually negative for MT5-MMP RNA transcript, consistent with the Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Since MMPs have been consistently implicated during the development of embryo, MT5-MMP expression profile was also obtained among developing mouse embryos. MT5-MMP expression has an onset of day 11 and persists to day 15 before dropping around day 17 before birth (Fig. 3). Since MT5-MMP is highly homologous to other known MT-MMPs capable of activating progelatinase A (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 8Will H. Hinzmann B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 9Takino T. Sato H. Shinagawa A. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23013-23020Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), MT5-MMP is hypothesized to be a cell membrane-associated activator of progelatinase A. To test this possibility, MT5-MMPΔ6FLAG, an expression vector derived from the clone 17 of MT5-MMP (missing the last 6 residues at the COOH terminus), was transfected into COS cells and the products were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described (17Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Consistent with the presence of a putative transmembrane domain at its COOH terminus, MT5-MMP is detected by immunoprecipitation as a 63-kDa major species only in the lysates, not the conditioned media, of cells transfected with MT5-MMPΔ6FLAG (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and4), while mock transfected cells are negative (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 3). As reported for MT1-MMP (7Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar,13Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), this species may represent the proenzyme of MT5-MMP. In addition, there are minor species slightly above the 63-kDa main species which may represent the minor glycosylated form. Interestingly, a visible protein species around 130 kDa was also detected from the MT5-MMPΔ6 transfected cells, which may represent the dimeric form of MT5-MMP (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). To further clarify its physical localization, transfected cells were harvested, disrupted, and separated into two main fractions: cytosolic and membrane. As shown by immunoblotting in Fig. 4 B, MT5-MMP is mainly associated with the membrane fraction, not the cytosol (Fig."

Using a yeast two-hybrid screening followed by mammalian cell analyses, we identified a novel ligand-dependent AR-associated protein, ARA54, which consists of 474 amino acids with a molecular mass of 54 kDa. We demonstrated that ARA54 might function as a preferential coactivator for AR-mediated transactivation in human prostate cancer DU145 cells. Interestingly, our data also showed that ARA54 could significantly enhance the transcriptional activity of LNCaP mutant AR (ARt877a) but not wild type AR or another mutant AR (ARe708k) in the presence of 10 nm 17β-estradiol or 1 μmhydroxyflutamide. These results imply that both ARA54 and the positions of the AR mutation (877 versus 708) might contribute to the specificity of AR-mediated transactivation. Our findings further demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of ARA54 can serve as a dominant negative inhibitor and exogenous full-length ARA54 can reverse this squelching effect on AR transcriptional activity. Co-expression of ARA54 with other AR coactivators, such as ARA70 or SRC-1, showed additive stimulation of AR-mediated transactivation, which indicates that these cofactors may function individually as AR coactivators to induce AR target gene expression. Through our findings, we have identified and characterized a novel AR coactivator, ARA54, which may play an important role in the AR signaling pathway in human prostate.

Although several studies have revealed how steroid hormone-bound receptors can recognize and interact with hormone-response elements (3Chang C. Saltzman A. Yeh S. Young W. Keller E. Lee H.J. Wang C.

Recently, it has been reported that several nuclear receptors can interact directly with components of the basal transcription machinery apparatus, such as TBP (6Sadovsky Y. Webb P. Lopez G.

A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, specific sets of proteins were recruited by the steroid receptors as coactivators that may function as bridge factors between the receptors and general transcription factors in the preinitiation complex (9Pugh B.F.

Identifying and understanding the function of individual components of these complexes are part of the key to answer how nuclear receptors regulate their target genes. Indeed, several cofactors, such as ARA70 (12Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), SRC-1 (13Onate S.A. Tai S.Y. Tai M.J.

More significantly, recent progress in the study of coactivators further linked the transcriptional activation of steroid receptors to chromatin acetylation. Some of these coactivators, such as RAC3/ACTR (19Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

However, the physiological significance of these cofactors and their involvement in development, differentiation, and reproductive disease remains to be further studied. Prostate cancer is the most common malignant neoplasm in aging males in the United States. Surgical or chemical castration in combination with antiandrogens, such as hydroxyflutamide (HF), has been widely used for the treatment of this disease (22Crawford E.D. Eisenberger M.A. McLeod D.G. Spaulding J.-T. Benson R. Dorr F.A. Blumenstein B.A. Davis M.A. Goodman P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). However, most prostate cancers undergoing androgen ablation treatment progress from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent state (23Crawford E.D. Br. J. Urol. 1992; 70: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indeed, previous studies using transient transfection assays also showed that antiandrogens might have agonist activity to stimulate mutant AR-mediated transcription (24Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Brinkmann A.O. Grootegoed J.A. Mulder E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 25Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer K.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that cellular factors and mutant ARs might contribute to the alterations of the antiandrogen specificity and the development of resistance to androgen ablation therapy in prostate cancer (26Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Huang S. Fugimoto H. Hsiao P. Inui S. Ting H. Nishimura K. Uemura H. Kang H. Chang C. Gronemeyer H. Fugymann U. Parczyk Molecular Basis of Hormone Receptor Function.

Therefore, it will be an important issue to investigate whether AR cofactors are involved in the progression of androgen resistance. Here we report a new AR-associated protein, ARA54, which was isolated from human prostate cDNA library by using a mutant AR, ARt877s (codon 877 threonine to serine), to screen the yeast two-hybrid system. We further provide evidence to demonstrate that ARA54 can function as a coactivator for androgen-dependent transcription on both wild type (wtAR) and mutant AR (mtAR). However, in the presence of 10 nm E2 or 1 μm HF, ARA54 can only significantly enhance the transcriptional activity of LNCaP ARt877a but not wtAR or mtAR ARe708k (codon 708 glutamic acid to lysine). These results imply that the specificity of antagonist versusagonist of antiandrogens could be conferred via the specific configuration between AR structure and different cofactors. 5α-Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dexamethasone, progesterone, and E2 were obtained from Sigma, and HF was from Schering. pSG5 wtAR was used in our previous report (12Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). pCMV-mtARt877a (mutant AR derived from prostate cancer tumors, codon 877 mutation threonine to alanine) and pSG5mtARe708k (mutant AR derived from a partial androgen insensitive syndrome patient, codon 708 mutation glutamic acid to lysine) were constructed in our laboratory (28Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5524-5532Google Scholar). A pACT2-prostate cDNA library (a gift from Dr. S. Elledge) that consists of GAL4 activation domain (amino acids 768–881) fused with human prostate cDNA library was transformed into Y190 yeast cells with pAS2-mtARt877s that contains the C-terminal domain of ARt877s (amino acids 595–918) fused with GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) (amino acids 1–147). Transformants were selected for growth on nutrition selection plates with 20 mm 3-aminotriazole and 100 nm DHT without adding histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Colonies were also filter-assayed for β-galactosidase activity. DNAs from positive clones were recovered from yeast, amplified in Escherichia coli, and confirmed by sequencing. The missing 5′ coding region was isolated by 5′ RACE-PCR according to the manufacturer's protocol of the Marathon cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH). The gene-specific antisense primer used for 5′ RACE-PCR was 5′-ttctgtagtttaattttctgaacctttggc-3′. The specific PCR reaction conditions were: 94 °C for 1 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 72 °C for 3 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 3 min; and then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR product was subcloned into pT7-Blue vector (Novagen) and sequenced. The blot (Fig. 2) containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from human spleen (lane 1), thymus (lane 2), prostate (lane 3), testis (lane 4), uterus (lane 5), small intestine (lane 6), colon (lane 7), and peripheral blood leukocyte (lane 8) was purchased fromCLONTECH and hybridized with an ARA54-specific cDNA probe. A β-actin probe was used as a control for equivalent mRNA loading. The mammalian two-hybrid system used in our test system mainly followed theCLONTECH protocol, with some modifications. To obtain better expression, the GAL4 DBD (amino acids 1–147) was fused to pSG5, which was driven by the SV40 promoter, and named GAL0. The hinge and ligand-binding domain of wtAR were then inserted into GAL0. Similarly, the VP16 activation domain was fused to pCMX, which was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, and named pCMX-VP16 (provided by Dr. R. M. Evans). This pCMX-VP16 was then used to construct full-length fusion of ARA54. The construction junction of each plasmid was verified by sequencing. Lysates fromin vitro translated 35S-labeled wild type and mutant ARs were incubated with or without 10−8m DHT in the modified RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 5 mm EDTA; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 0.25% gelatin). The cell-free translated full-length ARA54 fused to S·Tag protein was incubated with S·Tag protein-agarose beads (Novagen) at 4 °C. The conjugated beads were then washed four times with RIPA buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by STORM 840 (Molecular Dynamics). Human prostate cancer DU145 cells and lung carcinoma H1299 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 5% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (28Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5524-5532Google Scholar). Briefly, 3.5 × 105 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes for 24 h, and the medium was changed to Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum 1 h before transfection. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCMV-β-gal, was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 10.5 μg with pSG5 or pVP16 in all transfection assays. After 24 h, the medium was changed again, and the cells were treated with various steroids. Cells were harvested after 24 h for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay as described previously (12Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The CAT activity was visualized and quantitated by STORM 840 (Molecular Dynamics). At least three independent experiments were carried out in each case. Estrogen, progesterone, and flutamide were able to activate several AR mutants, including the LNCaP AR mutated in codon 877 (25Taplin M.E. Bubley G.J. Shuster T.D. Frantz M.E. Spooner A.E. Ogata G.K. Keer K.N. Balk S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that these mutant ARs may change the antiandrogen specificity and contribute to the progress of prostate cancer from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent stage has been widely accepted. Therefore, we were interested in investigating whether cofactors are required for mtARs to exert this distinct function. A fusion protein (GAL4-ARt877s) containing the GAL4 DBD and the C terminus of mtARt877s was used as a bait to screen the potential positive clones from a human prostate cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. One of the positive cDNA clones, which can interact with ARt877s, was further isolated and characterized. Using the 5′ RACE-PCR method, we were able to isolate a full-length cDNA sequence (1701 base pairs) that encodes a novel protein with an open reading frame of 474 amino acids (Fig.1 A). The in vitrotranslated product expressed a polypeptide that matched the calculated molecular mass of 53.8 kDa (data not shown), we thus named this AR-associated protein ARA54. The middle portion of ARA54 (amino acids 220–265) contains a cysteine-rich region that may form a zinc finger motif called the RING finger, defined as CX 2CX 9–27CXHX 2CX 2CX 6–17CX 2C (29Borden K, L.B. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Indeed, several human transcriptional factors or proto-oncogene proteins, including BRCA1 (30Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eiden D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. et al.Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5330) Google Scholar), RING1 (31Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Lally J. O'Relly N.J. Martin S. Howe K. Solomon E. Freemont P.S.

Freemont P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and MEL-18 (33Ishida A. Asano H. Hasegawa M. Koseki H. Ono T. Yoshida M.C. Taniguchi M. Kanno M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), have been shown to contain this domain. In addition, ARA54 contains a second cysteine-rich motif that has a B-box-like structure located 43 amino acids downstream from the RING finger motif. However, ARA54 does not possess a predicted coiled coil domain immediately C-terminal to the B-box domain (34Reddy B.A. Etkin L.D. Freeman P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 344-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This coiled coil domain is highly conserved among the members of the RING finger B-box family; therefore, ARA54 may represent a new subgroup member of this family. Northern blot analysis showed that ARA54 mRNA is expressed at the highest level in testis but at a very low level in small intestine and blood leukocyte (Fig. 2). Based on quantitation and normalization to β-actin mRNA using testis as 100%, the expression levels of ARA54 mRNA in the following tissues are: thymus, 17.8%; spleen, 16.6%; colon, 16%; prostate, 14.5%; uterus, 13.2%; small intestine, 5.1%; and blood leukocyte, 3.6%. The ARA54 mRNA also were strongly detected in two other prostate cell lines, PC-3 and LNCaP (data not shown). These observations suggest that ARA54 expression may exhibit a certain degree of tissue or cell-type specificity. The major band that appeared at 3 kilobases was present in spleen, thymus, prostate, and uterus. In addition, there was a second band at 2 kilobases that only appeared in testis. Whether the 2-kilobase mRNA is due to the RNA alternative splice or simply the degraded form of longer mRNA remains to be determined. To test whether ARA54 could interact with AR in an androgen-dependent manner, we first applied yeast two-hybrid assay. The results showed that DHT and testosterone, at concentrations of greater than 1 nm, promoted the specific interaction between ARA54 and both wtAR and mtAR (data not shown). A mammalian two-hybrid system with CAT reporter gene assay in prostate DU145 cells was further applied to confirm this DHT dose-dependent interaction between wtAR and ARA54 in vivo. As shown in Fig.3 A, transient transfection of either ARA54 or wtAR alone showed negligible activity (lanes 2 and 5). However, the CAT activity was significantly induced only when AR was co-expressed with ARA54 in the presence of 10 nm DHT (lane 3). Our previously identified AR coactivator ARA70 (lane 6) and SV40 large T antigen (lane 7) were used here as positive and negative controls, respectively. Together, these data indicate that the specific interaction between ARA54 and wtAR is an androgen-dependent process in both in vitro and in vivo assays. To determine whether the interaction that occurred in yeast or mammalian two-hybrid systems was due to a direct interaction between ARA54 and ARs, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed by anin vitro transcription/translation system that expressed various deletion mutants of AR and full-length ARA54 fused to S·Tag protein. The S·Tag-agarose beads used to precipitate the protein complexes were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3 B, both the wtAR and LNCaP mtAR could be co-immunoprecipitated by incubation with ARA54 (lanes 1 and 3), and the addition of 10 nm DHT could further enhance this interaction (lane 1 versus lane 2). Moreover, the data showed that the C-terminal region of AR was sufficient to interact with ARA54, whereas neither the N-terminal domain nor DBD plus τ2 domain of AR (lane 5 versus lanes 4and 6) could interact. Together, these data suggest that the interaction domain within AR could be located between amino acids 652 and 919. Because several identified cofactors could enhance the transcriptional activity of most steroid hormone receptors (12Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1998; 248: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it is important to investigate whether ARA54 could function as a general coactivator on the transcriptional activity of other steroid receptors through their cognate ligands and response elements. As shown in Fig.4, among all the classic steroid receptors we tested, ARA54 could further induce the transcriptional activity of AR and PR up to 6- and 4-fold, respectively. Compared with another AR coactivator, ARA70 that can show higher specificity to AR, ARA54 may represent a less specific coactivator for AR-mediated transactivation. Although ARA54 showed only marginal effects (less than 2-fold) on GR and ER in DU145 cells, we certainly cannot rule out the possibility that ARA54 might be a more general coactivator to other steroid receptors in other cell types under different conditions. It has been demonstrated that co-expression of SRC-1 and CBP could stimulate ER and PR transcriptional activity in a synergistic manner (35Smith C.L. Onate S.A. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In addition, both ARA70 and SRC-1 could act as coactivators for AR transcriptional activation (28Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5524-5532Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested to know if ARA54, together with ARA70 or SRC-1, could synergistically enhance the AR-mediated transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig.5, ARA54, SRC-1, and ARA70 all induced AR transcriptional activity to 3–5-fold in DU145 cells (lane 3–5). Moreover, when ARA54 was co-expressed with SRC-1 or ARA70, an additive, but not synergistic, induction of AR-mediated transactivation was observed (lane 4 versus lane 9 andlane 5 versus lane 10). These results indicate that these cofactors may contribute individually to proper or maximal AR-mediated transcriptional activity. It has been suggested that the interaction domain of coactivators could interfere with the receptor-mediated target gene expression by squelching the endogenous coactivators present in limited cellular concentration (13Onate S.A. Tai S.Y. Tai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 35Smith C.L. Onate S.A. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8884-8888Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal region (amino acids 361–474) of ARA54 isolated from prostate cDNA library has been shown to be sufficient to interact with AR in yeast two-hybrid assays, we were interested to test whether it could squelch the effect of endogenous ARA54 on AR-mediated transcription in prostate PC-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the C-terminal region of ARA54 significantly inhibited AR-mediated transactivation (lane 2 versus lane 6) and the co-expression of exogenous full-length ARA54 could reverse this squelching effect in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 7–9). These results clearly indicate that the C-terminal domain of ARA54 can serve as a dominant negative inhibitor and that ARA54 is required for proper or maximal AR transactivation in human prostate PC-3 cells. Prostate cancer patients treated with maximal androgen ablation therapy showed undetectable androgens but much higher concentration of antiandrogens (as high as 1–5 μm) in their serum (36McLeod D.G. Cancer. 1993; 71: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of interest to us to investigate whether ARA54 can modulate the agonist-antagonist activity of these antiandrogens on wtAR and mtARs. As shown in Fig.7, wtAR responded well to DHT at 0.1–10 nm, and ARA54 enhanced these transactivations by another 3–5-fold (lanes 6–8). However, wtAR responded only marginally to 1–100 nm E2 and 0.1–10 μm HF in the presence of ARA54 (Fig. 7, lanes 14–17and23–26). These results are in contrast to the previous identified coactivator, ARA70, that could enhance the wtAR transcriptional activity in the presence of 1 to 10 nm E2 and 1 μm HF (27Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Chang C. Lancet. 1997; 349: 852-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5524-5532Google Scholar, 37Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7379-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We further extended these findings to two different AR mutants: ARt877a, which was found in many prostate tumors including LNCaP cells (38Gaddipati J.P. McLeod D.G. Heidenberg H.B. Sesterhenn I.A. Finger M.J. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2861-2864PubMed Google Scholar), and ARe708k, which was found both in a yeast genetic screening (39Wang C. The Androgen and Antiandrogen Effects on the Transcriptional Activity of Androgen Receptor.Ph.D. Thesis. University of Madison-Wisconsin, 1997Google Scholar) and in one Reifenstein syndrome patient with partial androgen insensitivity (28Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5524-5532Google Scholar). Previous reports showed that LNCaP ARt877s could be stimulated by E2, progesterone, and flutamide (38Gaddipati J.P. McLeod D.G. Heidenberg H.B. Sesterhenn I.A. Finger M.J. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2861-2864PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, ARt877a responded to E2 from 1 to 100 nm and to HF from 0.1 to 10 μm. Moreover, ARA54 can further promote this E2- or HF-mediated agonist activity on ARt877a (lanes 10–17). These results suggest that LNCaP AR might require ARA54 for proper or maximal DHT-, E2-, or HF-mediated transcriptional activity. Unexpectedly, although DHT can still enhance the transcriptional activity of another AR mutant, ARe708k, E2- and HF-mediated agonist activity on ARe708k, even in the presence of ARA54 (lanes 5–9), is extremely low. Because the codon 708 is located on the helix 3 of the ligand-binding domain and helix 3 has been suggested to play an essential role for the formation of ligand-binding cavity (28Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5524-5532Google Scholar), our findings may therefore demonstrate that the residue 708 in helix 3 might be the key component to distinguish the binding between DHT and E2/HF for AR. Together, these results suggest that the AR structure and coactivators, such as ARA54, are both important factors in determining the specificity of sex hormones and antiandrogens. ARA54 described here represents a new AR coactivator with a novel sequence, because neither the nucleotide nor amino acid sequence was found in the EMBL and GenBankTM data bases. Moreover, ARA54 contains a conserved RING finger motif and a B-box-like structure. Proteins in the RING finger family are ubiquitously expressed in species ranging from human to virus, participate in diverse cellular processes, and may be involved in some aspect of transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interaction (40Freeman P.S. Hanson I.M. Trowsdale J. Cell. 1991; 64: 483-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that mutant PML proteins without the RING finger motif could become the potential dominant negative inhibitors of the wild type PML (41Lee X.-F. Yang P. Chang K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, we have demonstrated that the C-terminal region of ARA54, without the RING finger motif, can serve as a dominant negative inhibitor to attenuate the AR-mediated transactivation. Although the significance of the RING finger domain in ARA54 remains unclear, it is possible that ARA54 might use this domain to interact with other key factors in the activated nuclear receptor-mediated signaling complex and function as a bridge factor between AR and general transcription machinery. Thus, it will be of great interest to further characterize the functions of the RING finger region of ARA54. The evidence that the C-terminal domain of ARA54 can function as a dominant negative mutant to inhibit the AR transcriptional activity strongly suggests that ARA54 might play some important roles in the androgen action. Moreover, the incomplete blocking of AR-mediated transcriptional activation by the dominant mutant of ARA54 (Fig. 6) implies that other cofactors like ARA70 and SRC-1 might still function as independent coactivators to induce AR-mediated transcription in the absence of endogenous ARA54. This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that ARA54, ARA70, and SRC-1 could additively induce the AR transactivation. Therefore, each of these cofactors may function via its own individual pathway to promote the AR transcriptional initiation complex for optimal transcription. It will be of particular interest to determine whether AR can simultaneously recruit both ARA54 and SRC-1 or other components of the general transcription factors in the preinitiation complex. So far, the most popular and effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer is androgen ablation therapy using a combination of surgical or chemical castration and antiandrogens such as HF. Unfortunately, most of the prostate tumors in patients treated with this therapy may relapse within 18 months (13Onate S.A. Tai S.Y. Tai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which prostate cancer cells become resistant to hormone therapy remains unknown. One of the explanations of how prostate cancer progresses from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent stage is that mutations in AR may change the specificity and sensitivity of AR to antiandrogens, such as HF (13Onate S.A. Tai S.Y. Tai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 16Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). It is particularly interesting to investigate whether cofactors may also play important roles in the progression of prostate cancer to an androgen-independent stage. Here we report that in the presence of 10 nm E2 or 1 μm HF, ARA54 can further enhance the transcriptional activity of LNCaP ARt877a but not wtAR or ARe708k. This suggests that in addition to particular amino acids within the structure of AR, other cofactors such as ARA54 might also contribute to the partial agonist activity of HF and E2 to the mtARs. The differential E2- or HF-mediated AR transcriptional activity between wtAR and mtAR in the presence of ARA54 may provide a nice model for the development of antiandrogens, which will be able to specifically block the mtARs that occur only in prostate tumors. In summary, our findings suggest that a novel AR-associated protein, ARA54, can function as a relatively specific coactivator for AR in human prostate cancer DU145 cells. Its ability to further enhance E2- or HF-mediated transactivation of ARt887a, but not wtAR, may not only help us to further understand the complexity of the molecular mechanism of androgen action in prostate but also to develop more specific antiandrogens in the battle against prostate cancer.

We show that PDT rapidly activates JNK1 while irreversibly inhibiting ERK2 in several cancer cell lines. In HeLa cells, sustained PDT-induced JNK1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activations overlap the activation of a DEVD-directed caspase activity, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and the onset of apoptosis. The caspase inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zDEVD-fmk) protect cells against apoptosis and inhibit DEVD-specific caspase activity and PARP cleavage without affecting JNK1 and p38 MAPK activations. Conversely, stable overexpression of CrmA, the serpin-like inhibitor of caspase-1 and caspase-8, has no effect on PDT-induced PARP cleavage, apoptosis, or JNK1/p38 activations. Cell transfection with the dominant negative inhibitors of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, SEK-AL and TAM-67, or pretreatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316 enhances PDT-induced apoptosis. A similar increase in PDT-induced apoptosis was observed by expression of the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-1. The simultaneous inhibition of both stress kinases by pretreating cells with PD169316 after transfection with either TAM-67 or SEK-AL produces a more pronounced sensitizing effect. Cell pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor PD169316 causes faster kinetics of DEVD-caspase activation and PARP cleavage and strongly oversensitizes the cells to apoptosis following PDT.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). These enzymes are critical components of a complex intracellular signaling network that ultimately regulates gene expression in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. The three well known mammalian MAPK families are: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases/stress-activated protein kinases (JNKs/SAPKs), and the p38 MAPK. Each of these enzymes is a target for discrete but closely related phosphorylation cascades in which the sequential activation of three kinases constitutes a common signaling module (2Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The best characterized MAPK pathway is the Ras/Raf/MEK cascade leading to the activation of ERK1/2 in response to growth factors (3Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JNK and p38 MAPK are key mediators of stress signals and inflammatory responses evoked by a variety of agents such as UV- and γ-irradiation, heat shock, osmotic stress, and inflammatory cytokines (4Hibi M.

Once activated, JNKs mediate the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors c-Jun, ATF2, and Elk1 (9Marias R. Wynne J. Treisman R.

Barret T. Dérijard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) as well as in the activation of MAPKAP2/3 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate small heat shock proteins (12Rouse J. Cohen P.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Inversely, other reports have suggested that the activation of JNK is not mechanistically implicated in the apoptotic process. Inhibition of the JNK pathway by the expression of the dominant negative forms of MEKK1, SEK1, or c-Jun mutant did not prevent Fas- or TNF-mediated cell death (21Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 22Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez Z. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Similarly, a recent study has shown that the activation of JNK/p38 MAPK does not correlate with apoptosis induced by the detachment of epithelial cells (23Khwaja A. Downward J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thymocytes from sek1−/− mice were found to be more susceptible to apoptosis induced by Fas and CD3 than their wild type counterparts (24Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), suggesting that the JNK pathway may also have a protective function. In conclusion, the exact role of JNK and/or p38 MAPK in programmed cell death remains highly ambiguous. Moreover, these reports stress the dependence of specific cellular responses (death or survival) on the cellular background as well as on the causative agent.Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new cancer treatment based on the topic or systemic application of a photosensitizing agent that accumulates in hyperproliferating benign and malignant tissues (reviewed in Ref. 25Dougherty T.J. Marcus S.L. Eur. J. Cancer. 1992; 28: 1734-1742Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Upon irradiation with tissue-penetrating light, the photosensitizer is activated and generates reactive oxygen species, which then cause cell death. PDT is a promising alternative to conventional cancer treatments involving cytotoxic drugs or ionizing radiation, as it combines a minimal systemic toxicity with a highly selective photodynamic destruction of tumor cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its antitumor activity is poorly understood. PDT with porphyrin and a porphyrin derivative has recently been reported to induce both c-Jun and c-Fos expression (26Kick G. Messer G. Plewig G. Kind P. Goetz A.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and activation of the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathways (27Tao J. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Wong G. Levy J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27107-27115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Klotz L.O. Fritsch C. Briviba K. Tsacmacidis N. Schliess F. Sies H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4297-4300PubMed Google Scholar), but a causative link between these observations and the PDT-induced cytotoxicity is still missing.In the present study, we have used the photodynamic agent hypericin as a stress stimulus and investigated its potential signaling to the different MAPK cascades. Hypericin is a photoactive natural pigment extracted from plants of the genus Hypericum with a phenanthroperylenequinone structure. Interest in this compound was renewed in recent years because of its potential as a photosensitizing anticancer drug. We (29Vandenbogaerde A.L. Cuveele J.F. Proot P. Himpens B.E.

Res. 1997; 19: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have shown recently that photo-activated hypericin has a powerful in vivoantitumor activity. Although hypericin has also been reported to cause apoptosis in various cancer cell lines (34Zhang W. Lawa R.E. Hinton D.R. Su Y. Couldwell W.T. Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Harris M.S. Sakamoto T. Kimura He S. Spee C. Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Yoo J.S. Hinton D. Ryan S.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the signal transduction pathways involved have never been investigated.Here we show that PDT with hypericin leads to a strong and sustained activation of both JNK1 and p38 MAPKs, while causing a drastic and irreversible inhibition of ERK2 in all cancer cell lines tested. Specifically in HeLa cells, we show that hypericin-induced apoptosis requires a DEVD-directed caspase activity, while the activation of the JNK/p38 MAPK pathways occurs via a caspase-independent mechanism and is not related to the process of apoptosis. Furthermore, by expression of dominant negative mutants of components of these stress-induced kinase signaling pathways, or by the use of the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316, we show that concomitant inhibition of the JNK and p38 MAPK significantly enhances cell death. These observations indicate that the JNK/p38 MAPK pathways contribute to a survival response that counteracts PDT-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells.DISCUSSIONThis study reports that PDT with hypericin induces a strong and persistent activation of the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways while inhibiting ERK2 activity. Most importantly this is the first study that outlines a protective role for the JNK/p38 MAPK pathways during PDT-induced apoptosis which is found to be critically dependent on a DEVD-directed caspase activity.The effect of photo-activated hypericin on the MAPK activities was observed in several cell lines of human and mouse origin, indicating that it is a general cellular response to this PDT treatment (Fig. 1). In HeLa cells, the activation of JNK1 and p38 MAPK was very rapid and sustained for at least 24 h post-irradiation (Fig. 3). We have shown that photo-activated hypericin, under the conditions used, induces apoptosis in HeLa cells, an observation that has also been reported by others using different cell lines (34Zhang W. Lawa R.E. Hinton D.R. Su Y. Couldwell W.T. Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Harris M.S. Sakamoto T. Kimura He S. Spee C. Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Yoo J.S. Hinton D. Ryan S.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our results further show that following PDT, the JNK1 and p38 MAPK activation patterns overlap with the kinetics of PARP cleavage, a DEVD-amc proteolytic activity and the onset of apoptosis (Fig. 3). Recently, PDT with a benzoporphyrin derivative has been shown to induce JNK1 and p38 MAPK by a mechanism involving reactive oxygen species production in murine keratinocytes, but the effects of such activations were not explored (27Tao J. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Wong G. Levy J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27107-27115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unlike this observation, cell pretreatment with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine or butylated hydroxyanisole did not affect hypericin-induced stress kinase activations. 2Z. Assefa, A. Vantieghem, and P. Agostinis, unpublished observations. Moreover, in the aforementioned study, PDT with BDP did not result in an inhibition of the ERKs which could be stimulated by EGF during photosensitization (27Tao J. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Wong G. Levy J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27107-27115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, here we show that PDT with hypericin caused an inhibition of the ERK pathway which could not be relieved or prevented by EGF or FCS (pre)treatment. Interestingly, we have reported previously that hypericin inhibits the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity in vitro in an irreversible and light-dependent manner (50Agostinis P. Vandenbogaerde A. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Lee K.-T. Goris J. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. de Witte P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).The relevance of the hypericin-mediated irreversible inhibition of the ERK signal to the process of PDT-induced cytotoxicity is not yet known. Intriguingly, several studies have suggested that the dynamic balance between the ERK and the JNK/p38 MAPK activities critically determines the cellular fate in response to differentiating, proliferating, or apoptogenic stimuli (16Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). However, while the role of the ERK signaling cascade in the processes of cell differentiation and proliferation has been clearly recognized, the requirement of JNK1 and p38 MAPK activations in apoptosis remains a matter of controversy. In some instances JNK and/or p38 MAPK activity is strictly required for apoptosis to occur (17Verheij M. Bose A. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M.

Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 22Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez Z. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M.

Strong and persistent activation of JNK and/or p38 MAPKs with a concurrent inhibition of ERK has been shown to be critical for apoptosis induced by UV- and γ-irradiation as well as by nerve growth factor withdrawal (16Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5027) Google Scholar, 18Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). In addition, a cross-talk between the JNK/p38 MAPK and caspase activation pathways has been reported in several systems (43Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 44Cahill M.A. Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Krammer P.H. Nordheim A.

Activation of caspases can be achieved through at least two mechanisms. The best characterized pathway involves the autoactivation of procaspase-8 following its recruitment by the death effector domain of the adapter protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain), which associates to clustered death domains of Fas/CD95 and TNFR1 (through TRADD, TNF receptor-associated death domain) upon ligand binding. This results in the caspase-8-mediated proteolytic activation of downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9, and commitment to cell death (reviewed in Ref. 51Wallach D. Bolin M. Varfolomeev E. Beyaert R. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Another pathway for caspase activation, triggered by many apoptogenic agents, involves the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol (52Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Cytosolic cytochrome c induces the ATP- or dATP-dependent formation of the “apoptosome,” a complex of proteins composed of cytochrome c itself, Apaf-1, and procaspase-9 (53Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jammerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar). The processing and activation of procaspase-9 in the complex ultimately leads to the activation of procaspase-3 and cell death (52Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14486-14491Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This latter mechanism may also contribute to the Fas-mediated apoptosis by amplifying the effect of caspase-8 on downstream caspases (54Kuwana T. Smith J.J. Muzio M. Dixit V. Newmeyer D.D. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16589-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).Therefore, we used two approaches to discern the relationship between the JNK/p38 MAPK and the caspase activation pathways. First, we used an inhibitor of the downstream effector caspases, zDEVD-fmk, and showed that while it clearly blocked PARP cleavage and the DEVD-amc proteolytic activity, and significantly counteracted the hypericin-induced apoptosis, it did not affect either JNK1 or p38 MAPK activations (Fig. 4). This indicates that stimulation of the JNK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades, in response to photo-activated hypericin, does not require a zDEVD-fmk-inhibitable caspase activity. This in turn implies that caspase activation is either downstream of the JNK1 and p38 MAPK activations or that it lies on an independent pathway. However, our results demonstrate that a DEVD-directed caspase, most likely caspase-3, is a key mediator of the hypericin-induced cell death.As a second approach, we examined the potential role of the early upstream caspase-1 and caspase-8 in PDT-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activations by stably expressing the serpin-like caspase inhibitor CrmA in HeLa cells. Overexpression of CrmA did not affect either the PDT-induced PARP cleavage, DEVD-amc proteolytic activity, or the JNK1/p38 MAPK activations (Fig. 4) and, moreover, did not prevent the PDT-induced apoptosis. On the contrary, TNF-mediated PARP cleavage (Fig. 4) and cell death were completely inhibited in HeLa cells that overexpress CrmA confirming the central role of procaspase-8 in the cytotoxic response to TNF (55Dbaido G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 3: 481-490Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that CrmA-inhibitable caspases are not required for PDT-induced apoptosis and clearly dissociate the hypericin-induced cytotoxicity from the prototype mechanisms that involve cell surface death domain-containing receptors. As mentioned above, hypericin could lead to the activation of a DEVD-directed caspases and ultimately to apoptosis through mitochondrial damage and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Indeed, we have shown that cytochrome c release is one of the earliest events induced by PDT in hypericin-treated HeLa cells (39Vantieghem A. Assefa Z. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. de Witte P. Agostinis P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).Finally, we present several lines of evidence that the activations of JNK1 and p38 MAPK may be regarded as cellular protective signals against hypericin-induced apoptosis. First, the expression of a dominant negative SEK1 mutant (SEK-AL), a direct upstream activator of JNK, and/or the transfection of the transactivation-deficient mutant of the c-Jun protein (TAM-67), the major downstream effector substrate of JNK, enhanced the rate of hypericin-induced cell death. Co-transfection of both mutant proteins significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. Second, the specific pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK, PD169316, also had an enhancing effect on the hypericin-induced cell death. Combined inhibition of JNK1 and p38 MAPK by PD169316 pretreatment of cells transfected with either SEK-AL or TAM-67 augmented the hypericin-induced apoptosis to nearly 90% (Fig. 5). Third, by expressing the dual specificity phosphatase MKP-1, which dephosphorylates and inactivates both JNK1 and p38 MAPK in vivo, we also observed a potentiation of the hypericin-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. These observations were further supported by the findings that in the presence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor, PDT with hypericin induced PARP cleavage, DEVD-directed caspase activation, and apoptosis with much faster kinetics. PD169316 pretreatment also highly oversensitized the cells to PDT with sublethal doses of hypericin (Fig.6). Altogether, the results suggest that JNK and p38 MAPK pathways are required for survival in response to PDT with hypericin. To some extent, our conclusions are in agreement with the results of a recent study on the protective role of the stress kinase pathways in the TNF/Fas-induced apoptosis in the murine cell line L929 (56Roulston A. Reinhard C. Amiri P. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10232-10239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In that study, expression of dominant negative mutants of MKK4/SEK1, MKK6 or TRAF2-DN (all of which are mediators of JNK or p38 activation) enhanced the TNF-induced apoptosis. Previous studies have also shown that TNF can induce NF-κB but not JNK in cells from TRAF2-deficient mice and these cells are more susceptible to apoptosis than those from wild type mice (57Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 58Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that JNK and p38 MAPK pathways may be essential for cell survival in the presence of TNF.Overall, our results indicate that although JNK1 and p38 MAPK may play a role in protecting HeLa cells from PDT-induced cytotoxicity, they cannot rescue cells from hypericin-induced cell death. Most likely they delay the apoptotic process by inducing the transcription of survival-promoting genes until a critical threshold of damage finally commits the cells to apoptosis. An intriguing explanation for the lack of full protection by the JNK/p38 MAPK pathways could reside in the concurrent irreversible inhibition of the ERK pathway. It is tempting to speculate that the JNK/p38 MAPK survival pathway ca"

Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). This report describes two new family members that were molecularly defined through examination of DNA data bases and subsequent full-length cloning. One of these new enzymes lacks the C2 domain, but some of the other above-listed features are found in both new enzymes, called here cPLA2β and cPLA2γ. While this paper was under review a report (27Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) appeared describing cPLA2γ.DISCUSSIONA considerable variety of phospholipids is present in cells and tissues, considering combinations of head groups, fatty acids, and linkages (ester, ether, and alkyl). It is unlikely that a full detailing of the catalytic repertoires and biological roles of these three enzymes will be accomplished quickly, given such a wide range of possible substrates. We expect that interesting functional differences will be discovered regarding these enzymes as their enzymatic and kinetic properties become fully characterized.cPLA2γIn light of extensive studies (19Nalefski E. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J.

Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5629-5633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) establishing the existence of a calcium-insensitive PLA2 activity in heart tissue, it is most interesting to find cPLA2γ mRNA selectively expressed in heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 C). The enzyme iPLA2 (see Ref. 40Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 41Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16069-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), which has no sequence similarity whatever to cPLA2γ, is the only calcium-insensitive cPLA2 previously known to be expressed in heart. It seems likely that some of the enzyme activity seen in heart tissue may be due to cPLA2γ. Since cPLA2γ appears to be largely membrane-bound through a lipid anchor motif at its C terminus (Fig. 4 A; see also Ref.27Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), there may well be separate cell compartments and biological roles for these two cytosolic PLA2s in cardiac tissue.The 27-bp imperfect palindrome shown in Fig. 4 A appears in the 5′-untranslated region of cPLA2γ cDNA, and in other clones analyzed this 27-bp segment appeared two or three times as concatenated repeats (not shown), presumably through alternative splicing. A search of GenBankTM, now just over 1 billion nucleotides, revealed that this exact sequence does not appear elsewhere in known genes. Interestingly, the closest match found was 23 of 27 bases, surrounding the initiator methionine codon of a human potassium channel protein, perfectly preserved in its mouse homolog (Fig. 4 B), making a stronger case for a possible functional relationship to translational regulation by these closely related sequence segments.cPLA2βThe C2 domain has been shown to mediate calcium sensitivity in cPLA2α (20Lin L.L. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6147-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 21Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This C2, or calcium and lipid binding, domain is widely distributed among diverse proteins (35Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Five of the six cPLA2α side chain oxygen atoms now known to be in contact with calcium (37Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) are indicated in Fig. 1 by asterisks and are aligned in cPLA2β, as explained in the figure legend. Consequently, the degree of alignment seen in Fig. 1 may well signify that cPLA2β has a functional C2 domain. Despite its low activity in our assay system, the data in Table II support this concept. This activity was also tested (not shown) in the full-length form of cPLA2β (i.e. with the extra N-terminal 99 aa), and it showed no higher activity in our assay than the 913-aa form.It is a mystery why the mRNA for cPLA2β is not fully processed in the 24 tissues we examined, and one should be cautious in interpreting this fact. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the spliced cPLA2β cDNA (depicted in Fig. 6) encoding the cPLA2β protein (shown in Fig. 1) was not derived from a prediction but was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from human brain tissue, demonstrating that it is spliced in cells at a low level. The major (unspliced) mRNA form for cPLA2β is not necessarily identical to the genomic sequence (i.e. it may represent a stable, partially spliced product); we have not examined chromosomal DNA encoding cPLA2β.The intron splice sites (Fig. 6 B) were seen to be all similar to the normal GT-AG consensus sequences (36Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 875-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), except for intron 2. Comparison (not shown) of the intron 2 sites to other minor consensus sequences (36Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 875-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed that they were not similar to the standard AT-AC consensus or the other known minor forms. Seven cDNA fragments from rat cPLA2β cDNA were also sequenced (not shown) and allowed comparison to introns 3–4, and notably the acceptor site of intron 2 (the latter shown in Fig. 6 B), which all had normal GT-AG consensus sequences. Since splicing generally has been observed to follow no requisite order, it does not seem likely that one unusual intron splice site could prevent the normal splicing of other introns. In addition, the introns in the seven rat cPLA2β cDNA clones were mostly unspliced, despite the normal consensus sequence at the acceptor site for intron 2. We must conclude that there is no obvious explanation for the inverted ratio of spliced to unspliced cPLA2β mRNA.It may be suspected that cPLA2β is a pseudogene; however, this does not seem likely, since most pseudogenes have accumulated premature terminator codons randomly within their coding regions, over much shorter spans than the >100 kDa of cPLA2β. In addition, conservation of cPLA2β is high between human and rat. Seven rat cPLA2β cDNA fragments covering 530 aa had 85% identity (not shown) to the human cPLA2β sequence, far higher than would be expected for a nonfunctional pseudogene (the introns and 3′-untranslated regions were not detectably conserved). It is possible that in some biological setting the mRNA becomes fully spliced, as a form of activation. For example this process may follow the form of splicing regulation seen dramatically for several genes in the inflammatory cytokine pathway, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2, and interleukin-1β (42Jarrous N. Osman F. Kaempfer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2814-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 43Gerez L. Arad G. Efrat S. Ketzinel M. Kaempfer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19569-19575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Jarrous N. Kaempfer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23141-23149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these cases splicing regulation is not nearly as stringently restricted as we see for cPLA2β. Viruses are known (45Cullen B.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) to exert very stringent temporal mRNA splicing control. However, to our knowledge such stringent splicing control has not been previously seen in cellular mRNAs.PhosphorylationcPLA2α has been shown to have several sites of phosphorylation, which alter the activity of the enzyme (20Lin L.L. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6147-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 21Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22de Carvalho M.G.S. McCormack A.L. Olson E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Yates III, J.R. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6987-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For cPLA2α, the pattern PXSP seen around Ser-505 has been most studied, but in addition phosphorylation has been detected on serine at positions 437, 454, and especially 727 (22de Carvalho M.G.S. McCormack A.L. Olson E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Yates III, J.R. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6987-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Comparison of the sequences for the three enzymes (Fig. 1) reveals that none of these serines is preserved in the alignment, with the lone exception that Ser-727 of cPLA2α is aligned with Ser-537 of cPLA2γ, albeit in a region of weak conservation, positioned immediately before the C-terminal CAAX box in cPLA2γ. We conclude that if there are phosphorylation sites in cPLA2β or cPLA2γ, they are probably specific to each enzyme and not a conserved feature within the family.Chromosomal LocationsThe three cPLA2s are all on different chromosomes, 1, 15, and 19; the calcium-independent iPLA2 can be mapped to human chromosome 22 (see “Experimental Procedures”); and the 14-kDa secreted cPLA2s are spread further still (10Tischfield J.A. Xia Y.R. Shih D.M. Klisak I. Chen J. Engle S.J. Siakotos A.N. Winstead M.V. Seilhamer J.J. Allamand V. Gyapay G. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1996; 32: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, as functionally related genes are sometimes clustered together in the genome, it is notable that within the same region of human chromosome 15 as cPLA2β (see “Experimental Procedures”), there are 14 mapped known genes, including the one encoding 1-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase β2. This phosphodiesterase β2 has the ability to produce and to degrade PIP2, the compound shown (46Leslie C. Channon J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 47Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J . Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) to activate cPLA2α by about 40-fold. This nearby chromosomal location to cPLA2β suggests a relationship, for example possibly PIP2 can activate cPLA2β. It will be interesting to explore this possibility.The vicinity of cPLA2γ on chromosome 19 (see “Experimental Procedures”) contains 20 known mapped genes, notable among them being apolipoprotein E and calmodulin. While certainly apolipoprotein E is prominent in many areas, particularly cardiovascular biology (48Srinivasan S.R. Ehnholm C. Wattigney W.A. Bao W. Berenson G.S. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 123: 33-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 49Kuller L.H. Shemanski L. Manolio T. Haan M. Fried L. Bryan N. Burke G.L. Tracy R. Bhadelia R. Stroke. 1998; 29: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the precise connection with cPLA2γ may not be immediately evident. However, the relationship postulated between calmodulin and another calcium-independent cytosolic PLA2 (50Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20989-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) makes this chromosomal location intriguing. Those authors postulated that iPLA2 may achieve calcium responsiveness and membrane access through association with calmodulin. Although cPLA2γ likely achieves its membrane access through a lipid anchor suggested by the prenyl group-binding site motif (27Underwood K.W. Song C. Kriz R.W. Chang X.J. Knopf J.L. Lin L.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21926-21932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), also called a “CAAX box,” at its C terminus, the close chromosomal location for cPLA2γ and calmodulin also suggests the possibility of a functional relationship between these two proteins.Catalysis and ConservationAs noted above, all four catalytically essential amino acids are strictly conserved in cPLA2β and cPLA2γ. The subtilase aspartate motif surrounding Asp-549 of cPLA2α is conserved quite well in cPLA2γ and in cPLA2β at least as well as in the yeast orthologs (compare Fig. 1 here and Fig. 1 of Ref.24Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Strifler B.A. DeFelippis M.R. Hyslop P.A. Tebbe A.L. Yee Y.K. Reynolds L.J. Dennis E.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Mutation studies support the idea that these four residues are essential for catalysis in all three of these paralogs (Ref. 24Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Strifler B.A. DeFelippis M.R. Hyslop P.A. Tebbe A.L. Yee Y.K. Reynolds L.J. Dennis E.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and Table III).Comparison of these cPLA2 family members makes it evident that there is an additional significant conserved region in all three cPLA2s, lying between amino acids 350 and 400 in cPLA2α (see Fig. 1), a region also noticeably conserved among cPLA2α orthologs of six species (Fig. 6 of Ref.24Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Strifler B.A. DeFelippis M.R. Hyslop P.A. Tebbe A.L. Yee Y.K. Reynolds L.J. Dennis E.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19225-19231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although several other regions of the sequence have been defined as to their function, this one has not. Mosior et al. (47Mosior M. Six D.A. Dennis E.A. J . Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2184-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) recently made a striking observation investigating the discovery of Leslie and Channon (46Leslie C. Channon J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that PIP2 can activate cPLA2α to a remarkable extent, providing a direct link between the phospholipase C and cPLA2 signaling pathways. It is tempting to suspect that this conserved region might mediate the PIP2 response, and it will be interesting to see whether the two new enzymes also have this property.ConclusionsAs analysis of the human genome accelerates, protein families are rapidly expanding, and searches for possible new members are becoming more fruitful. However, whereas estimates are that well over 70% of human genes are now represented in the EST DNA data bases, it is likely that genes with very low levels of expression or highly selective tissue distributions will elude discovery until even after genomic DNA sequencing is complete. There may be additional paralogs of cPLA2, since the present ones were only found because their traces of homology could be recognized in the EST data base as being significant. Exploration of gene families has yielded much information about structure-function relationships and understanding of molecular mechanisms and biological roles. Comparison of these three cPLA2 paralogs is likely to advance our understanding of lipid mediator and signaling pathways, which reach into many important biological and disease categories. Enzymatic breakdown of glycerophospholipids is carried out by numerous pathways, with the production of various bioactive lipids and fatty acids (1Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Often the released fatty acid is arachidonic acid, whose further metabolism gives rise to several types of bioactive lipids known as eicosanoids, many of which mediate inflammation. Thus PLA2 enzymes initiate the production of inflammatory mediators (12Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Novel"
https://openalex.org/W2048388437,"Lipoprotein lipase and the receptor-associated protein (RAP) bind to overlapping sites on the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP). We have investigated if lipoprotein lipase interacts with the RAP binding but structurally distinct receptor sortilin/neurotensin receptor-3. We show, by chemical cross-linking and surface plasmon resonance analysis, that soluble sortilin binds lipoprotein lipase with an affinity similar to that of LRP. The binding was inhibited by heparin and RAP and by the newly discovered sortilin ligand neurotensin. In 35S-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with the cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), lipoprotein lipase-containing complexes were isolated by anti-sortilin antibodies. To elucidate function in cells, sortilin-negative Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with full-length sortilin and shown to express about 8% of the receptors on the cell surface. These cells degraded125I-labeled lipoprotein lipase much faster than the wild-type cells. The degradation was inhibited by unlabeled lipoprotein lipase, indicating a saturable pathway, and by RAP and heparin. Moreover, inhibition by the weak base chloroquine suggested that degradation occurs in an acidic vesicle compartment. The results demonstrate that sortilin is a multifunctional receptor that binds lipoprotein lipase and, when expressed on the cell surface, mediates its endocytosis and degradation. Lipoprotein lipase and the receptor-associated protein (RAP) bind to overlapping sites on the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP). We have investigated if lipoprotein lipase interacts with the RAP binding but structurally distinct receptor sortilin/neurotensin receptor-3. We show, by chemical cross-linking and surface plasmon resonance analysis, that soluble sortilin binds lipoprotein lipase with an affinity similar to that of LRP. The binding was inhibited by heparin and RAP and by the newly discovered sortilin ligand neurotensin. In 35S-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with the cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), lipoprotein lipase-containing complexes were isolated by anti-sortilin antibodies. To elucidate function in cells, sortilin-negative Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with full-length sortilin and shown to express about 8% of the receptors on the cell surface. These cells degraded125I-labeled lipoprotein lipase much faster than the wild-type cells. The degradation was inhibited by unlabeled lipoprotein lipase, indicating a saturable pathway, and by RAP and heparin. Moreover, inhibition by the weak base chloroquine suggested that degradation occurs in an acidic vesicle compartment. The results demonstrate that sortilin is a multifunctional receptor that binds lipoprotein lipase and, when expressed on the cell surface, mediates its endocytosis and degradation. Lipoprotein lipase (LpL) 1The abbreviations used are:LpL, bovine lipoprotein lipase (dimeric); LDL, low density lipoprotein; LRP, LDL receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor; IGF-II, insulin-like growth factor-II; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RAP, receptor-associated protein; s-sortilin, soluble sortilin/neurotensin receptor-3; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RU, response units; D23, domains 2 and 3. is rate-limiting in hydrolysis of triglycerides in circulating lipoproteins, and reduced levels or activity of the active dimeric species therefore lead to increased triglyceride levels. Even small changes in LpL function in man may have important consequences. Thus, common mutations in the LpL gene with marginal effects on the activity are associated with dyslipidemias (1Gerdes C.

The mechanisms for synthesis, folding, and secretion of LpL to the lumenal side of the vascular epithelium are not known in detail. A large part of the synthesized LpL is normally degraded within the cell (4Semb H. Olivecrona T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Doolittle M.H.

Moreover, dimerization is important for regulation of catalytic activity (7Bergö M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). At the endothelium, LpL is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. LpL easily dissociates from these sites (8Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5267-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and reassociates to other sites, including receptors that mediate its uptake into cells. Clearance occurs via multifunctional endocytic receptors of the LDL receptor family, notably LDL receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) (9Chappell D.A. Fry G.L.

It consists of a lumenal domain homologous to yeast vacuolar protein-sorting 10 protein, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail with a C terminus strongly homologous to that of the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) receptor (16Petersen C.M.

In mature sortilin, an N-terminal 44-residue propeptide has been cleaved off, and recent results show that furin-mediated propeptide cleavage conditions sortilin for ligand binding (18Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Besides in neurones, sortilin is abundant in several cell types including skeletal muscle, heart, and adipocytes (16Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H.

Although sortilin, like the IGF-II receptor, is mainly located in the Golgi compartment and vesicles (16Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Røigaard H.

In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, sortilin colocalizes with the IGF-II receptor, and insulin causes a ∼2-fold increase in the expression of both receptors on the plasma membrane (19Morris N.J.

Thus, like the IGF-II receptor, sortilin has the potential of functioning both as a sorting receptor in the Golgi compartment and as a clearance receptor on the cell surface. Mature sortilin binds the receptor-associated protein, RAP (16Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Røigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), a specialized chaperone that interacts with LDL receptor family members, notably the multifunctional receptors LRP, megalin, and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (for reviews, see Refs. 20Bu G.

RAP consists of three homologous domains of which domain D3 binds to sortilin (23Tauris J. Ellgaard L. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Thøgersen H.C. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. Moestrup S.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that LpL and segments of RAP containing D3 cross-compete for binding to LRP, and these ligands are therefore thought to bind to the same or overlapping sites on the receptor (24Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23713-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As an approach to elucidate the function of sortilin as a putative endocytic and sorting receptor, we therefore investigated whether sortilin binds LpL. We show that the soluble lumenal domain of mature sortilin (s-sortilin) binds LpL with an affinity comparable with that of LRP and that the binding is inhibited by RAP and by neurotensin. Moreover, LpL is associated with sortilin in 3T3 adipocytes and is specifically degraded in stably transfected CHO cells that express mature full-length sortilin on the cell surface. We propose that sortilin, in addition to performing not yet elucidated sorting functions in the Golgi compartment, scavenges a diverse set of extracellular ligands such as LpL and neurotensin. The extracellular domain of mature sortilin (s-sortilin), comprising residues 45–725 of full-length sortilin, was expressed in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and purified from the culture medium by RAP affinity chromatography as described (23Tauris J.

The propeptide (residues 1–44) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein using the pGEX4T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on a glutathione-agarose column (18Petersen C.M.

Full-length sortilin was subcloned from the cloning pBK-CMV vector (16Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Røigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J.

LpL was purified from bovine milk as the enzymatically active dimeric enzyme (∼600 units/mg) as described previously (25Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). LpL and s-sortilin were 125I-iodinated to specific activities of about 0.5 mol of 125I/mol of protein using chloramine T as the oxidizing agent. The iodinated LpL preparation was applied to a Sepharose C16B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled material that eluted at 0.9 m NaCl was discarded, and the fraction that eluted at 1.5 m NaCl, representing the dimeric form of the lipase, was used for experiments. In some cases, LpL was made monomeric by incubation with 1 m guanidinium hydrochloride for 3 h at 20 °C and dialyzed immediately before use (26Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The construct LpL-(347–389/394–448 was produced in E. coli as described (27Nielsen M.S. Brejning J.

The construct consists of the hexahistidine-Factor X substrate sequence Met-Gly-Ser-(His)6-Ser-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg and amino acid residues 347–389 and 394–448 of human LpL. Deletion of the sequence Trp390-Ser-Asp-Trp393 from the construct LpL-(347–448) increases the solubility of the peptide. The construct contains the sites for binding to LRP and has about the same affinity as the uninterrupted stretch LpL-(347–448) and LpL-(313–448), which constitutes the C-terminal folding domain of LpL (27Nielsen M.S.

Human RAP and RAP constructs containing domain D1 (residues 18–112) or domains 2 and 3 (D23) (residues 113–323) were produced inE. coli as hexahistidine-tagged peptides (28Ellgaard L. Holtet T.L.

Rabbit anti-s-sortilin IgG used for immunoprecipitation of sortilin and for Western blotting and rabbit antiserum against a synthetic peptide containing residues Pro15-Arg28 of the sortilin propeptide have been described (18Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For detection of LpL in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we used IgG isolated from egg yolk of chickens immunized with bovine LpL (29Vilella E. Joven J. Fernandez M. Vilaro S. Brunzell J.D. Olivecrona T.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1555-1564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled s-sortilin (∼105cpm) was incubated with LpL in 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, for 16 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with the bifunctional reagent BS3 (Pierce) at a final concentration of 100 μm for 30 min at 20 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of SDS sample buffer with 20 mm Tris followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For solid phase assay, LpL was immobilized in Polysorp microtiter wells (NUNC, Denmark), the wells were blocked with 2% Tween 20 for 2 h at 20 °C (24Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23713-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and incubations with 125I-s-sortilin were in the above buffer. After 16 h at 4 °C, the wells were washed, and bound radioactivity was eluted with 10% SDS and counted. All measurements were performed on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden) equipped with CM5 sensor chips. The carboxylated dextran matrix of the sensor chip (flow cells 1 and 2) was activated by the injection of 240 μl of solution containing 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide in water, and s-sortilin was immobilized to an estimated density of 64 fmol/mm2. Samples for binding (40 μl) were injected at 5 μl/min (4 °C) in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (running buffer), and binding was expressed in terms of relative response units (RU), e.g. the response obtained from the flow cell with immobilized sortilin minus the response obtained using an activated but uncoupled flow cell. Regeneration of the chip was performed by injecting 20 μl of 10 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 4 m urea, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 8.0. Kinetic parameters were determined using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software. The number of LpL molecules bound/mol of immobilized sortilin was estimated by dividing the ratio RUligand/massligand with RUsortilin/masssortilin. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1 mix; Bio-Wittaker, Belgium), 10% donor calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. To induce their differentiation to adipocytes, donor calf serum was replaced with fetal calf serum, and the medium was supplemented with 10 μm dexamethasone for 48 h and subsequently with insulin (10 μg/ml) for 8 days. Wild-type CHO-K1 cells and cells stably transfected with sortilin (18Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) were grown to near confluency in HyQ-CCM5 medium (HyClone, Utah; about 3 × 105 cells/well). Degradation of 125I-LpL at was measured as 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the medium. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed, preincubated for 10 min in cysteine- and methionine-free modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) before overnight incubation in the same medium supplemented with 200 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (pro-mix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 5% full medium, and 10 μg/ml insulin. For identification of LpL-sortilin complexes, labeled 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with 1 mm cell-permeable and reducible cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce). After 30 min at 4 °C, the reaction was quenched in 20 mm Tris, and following washes, the cells were lysed in 400 μl of 1.0% Triton X-100 containing 20 mm Tris and proteinase inhibitors (Complete Mini, Boehringer Mannheim). After centrifugation, the lysate supernatant was diluted in 2 ml of a Tris-balanced salt solution and incubated with Sepharose-coupled anti-s-sortilin IgG for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and bound material was eluted in 300 μl of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.7, neutralized with Tris buffer and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE either before or after an additional step of precipitation using chicken anti-LpL IgG. Diphenyloxazole-fluorographed gels were exposed at −70 °C. The transfected CHO cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml membrane-impermeable reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce, IL) for 90 min at 4 °C. After washes in phosphate-buffered saline with 50 mm Tris to quench any unreacted reagent, the cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mmTris, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., CA). The fractions of streptavidin-bound (i.e.surface-biotinylated) and unbound sortilin were detected by Western blotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody (Dako, Denmark) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitation was performed by laser scanning densitometry using a 2202 Ultroscan instrument (LKB, Sweden). To test for binding, we first incubated LpL with 125I-labeled s-sortilin followed by the addition of the cross-linker BS3. As shown in Fig.1 A, a complex was formed when the labeled receptor was incubated with 125 nm LpL (lane 2) but not without LpL (lane 1). The labeled complex was increased by unlabeled soluble sortilin at low concentration (9 nm) (lane 3). However, the formation of complex was inhibited by 180–540 nm unlabeled soluble sortilin (lanes 4 and 5) and by heparin (lane 6). In addition, 500 nm LRP or megalin, which are both known to bind LpL (10Nykjær A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Weber W. Beisiegel U. Gliemann J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14176-14181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), abolished the formation of complex between sortilin and LpL (not shown). We next examined if RAP inhibits the binding. Because the cross-linked complex with RAP is not easily distinguished from that with LpL (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 versus 2), we used the smaller construct comprising RAP D23, which binds to sortilin (23Tauris J. Ellgaard L. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Thøgersen H.C. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. Moestrup S.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and shares binding sites with LpL on LRP (24Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23713-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At 5 μm, D23 markedly inhibited sortilin-LpL complex and caused the formation of a smaller complex (lane 4), whereas 125 nm D23 caused partial inhibition (lane 5). To further analyze the inhibition, 125I-sortilin was incubated with LpL immobilized in microtiter wells. Fig. 2shows that RAP and RAP D23, but not D1, inhibited the binding reaction. This agrees with the previous result that sortilin binds RAP D3 and D23 but not the individual domains D1 or D2 (23Tauris J. Ellgaard L. Jacobsen C. Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Thøgersen H.C. Gliemann J. Petersen C.M. Moestrup S.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The binding of LpL was further substantiated by plasmon resonance analysis using s-sortilin immobilized on the sensor chip. Fig.3 A shows that LpL binds readily and demonstrates a marked decrease in binding when LpL was made monomeric by treatment with guanidinium hydrochloride. The calculated capacity was about 0.4 mol of LpL/mol of s-sortilin, suggesting that the binding stoichiometry might be 1:1. The K d for binding of LpL to s-sortilin was calculated at about 26 nmfrom these and a series of similar curves obtained at LpL concentrations ranging from 9 nm to 454 nm. The affinity for binding of monomeric LpL was about 100-fold lower. For comparison, LpL binding was also analyzed using LRP immobilized to the chip. The K d value was calculated at about 11 nm for binding of LpL to LRP and was in the micromolar range when LpL had been made monomeric (not shown), which is in broad agreement with previous observations using LRP immobilized in microtiter wells (11Nykjær A. Nielsen M. Lookene A. Meyer N. Røigaard H. Etzerodt M. Beisiegel U. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31747-31755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further test the specificity of LpL binding, the chip with immobilized sortilin was perfused with the fragment LpL-(347–389/394–448), which contains the two LRP binding segments in the C-terminal folding domain of human LpL (27Nielsen M.S.

Fig. 3 Bshows that this peptide (20 μm) binds to sortilin, suggesting that the same segments in LpL are required for interaction with the two receptors. We also probed whether the 13-residue neuropeptide neurotensin, recently identified as a sortilin ligand (17Mazella J. Zsürger N. Navarro V. Chabry J. Kaghad M. Caput D. Ferrara P. Vita N. Gully D. Maffrand J.P. Vincent J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26273-26276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), interferes with LpL binding. As shown in Fig. 3 B, neurotensin at 20 μm essentially abolished the binding of LpL, suggesting that the two ligands bind to overlapping sites on sortilin. Finally, we tested the sortilin propeptide (as glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein), which binds to s-sortilin as well as to mature full-length sortilin and inhibits binding of RAP and neurotensin (18Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that s-sortilin, when first incubated with LpL at a near-saturating concentration (200 nm, cf. panel A), was unable to bind propeptide (not shown). Thus, LpL binds to soluble sortilin with an affinity comparable with that for binding to LRP, presumably via its C-terminal folding domain. Moreover, the binding is competed for by the sortilin ligands, RAP (via D3) and neurotensin and by the sortilin propeptide. To elucidate interaction in cells, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes because they express LpL as well as sortilin (31Olivecrona T. Chernick S.S. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Garrison M. Scow R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10748-10759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Morris N.J. Ross S.A. Lane W.S. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3582-3587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Initially we observed coexpression of LpL and sortilin upon differentiation, i.e. after 3–4 days in culture (not shown). Fully differentiated 35S-labeled 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with the permeable and thiol-cleavable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) and lysed, followed by incubation with Sepharose-coupled rabbit anti-sortilin IgG. Complexes were then released from the Sepharose beads and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4, lane 1, a dominating band corresponds to sortilin itself, and a marked band is compatible with LpL. Other labeled peptides may represent nonspecific binding reactions. To confirm the presence of LpL, we immunoprecipitated the complexes released from the anti-sortilin Sepharose beads using chicken anti-LpL IgG. Fig. 4, lane 2, shows that reducing SDS-PAGE identified labeled peptides compatible with LpL and sortilin. Thus, a fraction of LpL appears associated with sortilin in the 3T3-L1 cells. We used stably transfected CHO cells to elucidate functional consequences of LpL binding to sortilin. The transfectants expressed sortilin in contrast to the wild-type cells as seen from Western blotting of total lysates (Fig. 5 A, inset,lane 2 versus lane 1). The receptor was predominantly in the mature form because no reaction was observed when using anti-serum directed against the N-terminal propeptide (not shown). This is in agreement with the results of pulse-chase experiments, demonstrating that all newly synthesized sortilin is cleaved (18Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To assess the fraction of sortilin expressed on the cell surface, the transfectants were treated with the nonpermeable reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin at 4 °C and lysed, and biotinylated proteins were recovered on streptavidin-Sepharose beads. Sortilin was then detected by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting of the bound material as compared with the sortilin content in the fraction of the lysate not bound to streptavidin-Sepharose. Fig. 5,inset, shows that biotinylated (lane 3) as well as nonbiotinylated sortilin (lane 4) were readily detected. Scanning densitometry of the Western blots (cf. legend to Fig. 5) revealed that about 8% sortilin in the transfected cells had been accessible to biotinylation and, thus, represents the fraction expressed on the cell surface. We next aimed at determining LpL binding to the cell surface expressed sortilin. However, 125I-labeled LpL bound readily and equally well to wild-type and transfected CHO cells (not shown), presumably to cell surface proteoglycans as shown previously (12Berryman D.E. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24525-24531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Experiments were therefore performed to determine whether sortilin mediates uptake and subsequent degradation of the surface-associated LpL. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the transfected cells degraded125I-LpL much faster than wild-type cells. The cell-mediated degradation was inhibited by 100 units/ml heparin (not shown) and by 500 nm unlabeled LpL, indicating a saturable mechanism. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the degradation of LpL in sortilin transfectants was inhibited by RAP and by the weak base chloroquine that raises pH in intracellular compartments. We conclude that sortilin expressed on the cell surface can interact with LpL and mediate its degradation. The results show that sortilin is multifunctional because it binds LpL in addition to neurotensin, and they establish sortilin as an endocytic receptor on the cell surface because it can mediate LpL degradation. The affinity of LpL for binding to sortilin is similar to that for binding to LRP. As also shown for LRP (11Nykjær A. Nielsen M. Lookene A. Meyer N. Røigaard H. Etzerodt M. Beisiegel U. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31747-31755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the LpL monomer has markedly reduced affinity, possibly because the dimeric state provides the right conformation for receptor binding segments in the C-terminal folding domain. Alternatively, it cannot be excluded that the LpL dimer can interact with two sortilin molecules. We consistently observed that small amounts of unlabeled s-sortilin facilitated cross-linking of labeled sortilin to LpL (Fig. 1). Although this phenomenon remains unexplained, it is possible that sortilin, like heparin, can help stabilizing LpL in the dimeric form. Sortilin is mainly located intracellularly in several cell types. In transiently transfected COS-1 cells, full-length sortilin is mainly in the Golgi compartment, and chimeric receptors consisting of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of sortilin and the lumenal domain of the interleukin-2 receptor colocalize with the IGF-II receptor (16Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Røigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the predominant retrieval of sortilin to the Golgi compartment is most likely the acidic cluster at the C terminus, because an identical cluster in the IGF-II receptor, containing a phosphorylatable serine residue, is important for the retrieval via interaction with the newly identified protein PACS-1 (32Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In neurons, however, sortilin is up-regulated on the cell membrane following neurotensin-induced sequestration of the neurotensin receptor-1 (17Mazella J. Zsürger N. Navarro V. Chabry J. Kaghad M.

Vincent J.-P. Mazella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17138-17144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1-cultured adipocytes, the fraction of sortilin expressed on the surface is increased 1.7-fold by insulin (19Morris N.J. Ross S.A. Lane W.S. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Keller S.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3582-3587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the localization and the insulin responsiveness of sortilin in adipocytes resembles that of the IGF-II receptor, presumably because of the homology of important signal sequences in their cytoplasmic tails (16Petersen C.M. Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Jacobsen L. Tommerup N. Rasmussen H.H. Røigaard H. Gliemann J. Madsen P. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3599-3605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The two receptors are therefore likely to be similar in terms of cycling among the Golgi, endosomal, and plasma membrane compartments. The transfected CHO cells described in this report express about 8% of sortilin on the cell surface, in broad agreement with the fractional surface expressions of sortilin and IGF-II receptors in adipocytes and of IGF-II receptors in normal rat kidney cells (19Morris N.J.

Matteoni R. Back R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 441-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LpL is taken up by members of the LDL receptor family, particularly LRP (9Chappell D.A. Fry G.L.

Vilaró S. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5821-5827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the interaction with sortilin appears to be similar because a construct of LpL containing the segments important for binding to LRP also bound to sortilin. In addition, RAP domains D23 and LpL cross-compete for binding to sortilin, indicating that the two ligands have the same or overlapping sites for binding like on LRP (24Nielsen M.S. Nykjær A. Warshawsky I. Schwartz A.L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23713-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies using cultured cells have shown that LpL, independent of its catalytic activity, can enhance lipoprotein uptake by providing a bridge between lipoproteins and endocytic receptors of the LDL receptor family (Refs. 11Nykjær A. Nielsen M. Lookene A. Meyer N. Røigaard H. Etzerodt M. Beisiegel U. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31747-31755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Beisiegel U.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar), and LpL-facilitated lipoprotein uptake has recently been confirmed in vivo (37Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H. Cho I.S. Ramasamy R. Brunzell J.D. Goldberg I.J. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13841-13846Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Future studies should show whether sortilin, via interaction with LpL, participates in receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. The result that cell surface-expressed sortilin can mediate degradation of LpL may apply to other ligands, e.g. neurotensin (17Mazella J. Zsürger N. Navarro V. Chabry J. Kaghad M. Caput D.

Vincent J.-P. Mazella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17138-17144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However sortilin may also exhibit important functions in the Golgi compartment in analogy with the established dual functions of the IGF-II receptor as an endocytic and a sorting receptor. Because sortilin is abundantly expressed in cell types that secrete LpL, future studies should elucidate whether it is involved in sorting of newly synthesized LpL to specialized compartments. In conclusion, we find that sortilin binds LpL with an affinity comparable with that of LRP and that the receptor can mediate uptake and degradation of the ligand when expressed on the cell surface.

Phosphorylation of monomeric human CDK2 by CAK1 is more efficient than phosphorylation of the binary CDK2-cyclin A complex. Phosphorylated CDK2 exhibits histone H1 kinase activity corresponding to approximately 0.3% of that observed with the fully activated phosphorylated CDK2-cyclin A complex.

The crystal structures of the ATP-bound forms of phosphorylated CDK2 and unphosphorylated CDK2 have been solved at 2.1-Å resolution. The structures are similar, with the major difference occurring in the activation segment, which is disordered in phosphorylated CDK2. The greater mobility of the activation segment in phosphorylated CDK2 and the absence of spontaneous crystallization suggest that phosphorylated CDK2 may adopt several different mobile states. The majority of these states are likely to correspond to inactive conformations, but a small fraction of phosphorylated CDK2 may be in an active conformation and hence explain the basal activity observed.

Progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle is critically dependent upon the activity of a family of serine/threonine kinases, the cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs). 1The abbreviations used are:CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CAK, CDK-activating kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; KAP, kinase-associated phosphatase; Mant, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl). CDKs are regulated by both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that promote the correct timing and order of events for cell growth and cell division (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Monomeric, nonphosphorylated CDKs have no detectable kinase activity. Activation requires two components: (i) the association of a positive regulatory cyclin subunit (2Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CAK activity is associated with a monomeric protein called CAK1 or CIV1 (CAKi n v ivo) (19Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J.

Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). CAK1 shows greatest sequence similarity to the CDK family but does not have a cyclin partner. Dephosphorylation of the threonine in the activation segment is catalyzed by the kinase-associated phosphatase (KAP) (22Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 23Hannon G.J. Casso D. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For CDK2, KAP will only accept monomeric phosphorylated CDK2 as a substrate and not the binary complex of phosphorylated CDK2-cyclin A, suggesting that in vivo KAP dephosphorylates Thr160 only after the cyclin subunit is dissociated or degraded. Cyclin proteolysis is mediated by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway (24Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25Murray A.

CDK-cyclin heterodimers may also be regulated by reversible phosphorylation at other sites leading to inhibition (reviewed in Ref.1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar) and by association with protein inhibitor molecules (CKIs) such as p27kip1 (reviewed in Ref. 28Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar). Several groups have addressed the question of whether the monomeric CDK or the CDK-cyclin complex is the better substrate for phosphorylation by CAK. The results suggest both a CDK and species dependence. Studies using CAK purified from starfish oocytes (9Fesquet D. Labbe J.-C. Derancourt J. Capony J.-P. Galas S. Girard F. Lorca T. Shuttleworth J. Doree M. Cavadore J.-C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3111-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) concluded that this enzyme can only phosphorylate CDC2 (CDK1) when it is bound to a cyclin. However, CAK purified from Xenopus laevis egg extract can phosphorylate bacterially expressed human CDK2 (10Solomon M.J. Harper J.W. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) or GST-CDK2 (11Poon R.Y.C. Yamashita K. Adamczewski J.P. Hunt T. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3123-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) in the absence of cyclin. Fisher and Morgan working with CAK purified from both human and murine cells have shown that CAK activates complexes of CDK2 and CDC2 with various cyclins and also phosphorylates CDK2, but not CDC2, in the absence of cyclin (12Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Studies with S. cerevisiae CAK1 have indicated that CDK2 and CDC28 phosphorylation can occur with or without cyclin (19Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J.

The requirement for CDKs to be both phosphorylated and associated with a cyclin subunit for full activation indicates that more significant changes need to occur than those promoted by phosphorylation alone.

Kinase activity associated with monomeric phosphorylated CDKs has been reported for CDK7, where dual phosphorylation on the two sites in the activation segment (Ser170 and Thr176 inX. laevis CDK7) is sufficient to generate CAK activity to one-third of its maximal value in vitro (34Martinez A.-M.

Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 37Russo A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). CDK2 adopts a characteristic protein kinase fold composed of a mostly β-sheet N-terminal domain that contains one helix, the C-helix, and a predominantly α-helical C-terminal domain. The ATP-binding site is situated at the domain-domain interface. In the structure of inactive, monomeric CDK2, residues at the ATP-binding site are wrongly disposed and are unable to promote the correct alignment of the triphosphate moiety for catalysis, although the inactive monomer can bind ATP (35De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The inactive conformation arises mainly from the organization of two key elements of structure. These are the C-helix, which contains the PSTAIRE motif (single letter amino acid code, residues 45–51), and the activation segment, which includes residues that lie between the conserved DFG and APE motifs (residues 145–147 and 170–172, respectively). The position of the C-helix in the inactive CDK2 monomer results in the loss of the stabilizing interaction between Glu51 (the E of the PSTAIRE sequence) and Lys33 that is important for correct localization of the ATP triphosphate. The activation segment conformation buries Thr160 away from solvent facing in toward the conserved glycine-rich loop. Upon formation of the CDK2-cyclin A complex, there are no changes in the structure of cyclin A (38Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E.P. Rasmussen B. Hunt T. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but there are substantial changes in CDK2 that create the ATP triphosphate recognition site (36Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). CDK2-cyclin A exhibits about 0.2% of the activity of the fully activated phosphorylated binary complex. In the structure of phosphorylated CDK2-cyclin A, further structural rearrangements occur centered within the activation segment (37Russo A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Thr160, now phosphorylated, turns in to contact three arginine residues: one (Arg50) from the C-helix PSTAIRE motif within the N-terminal domain, a second (Arg126) that is adjacent to the catalytic aspartate (Asp127), and a third (Arg150) from the start of the activation segment. The phosphothreonine group acts as an organizing center, and a major outcome of the realigned phosphorylated CDK2-cyclin A structure appears to be the formation of the protein-substrate recognition site that is likely to depend most sensitively on the activation segment orientation. In order to elucidate the structure and biological properties of phosphorylated CDK2 in the absence of cyclin, we have prepared phosphorylated CDK2 by the action of CAK1 on CDK2. We have analyzed the role of cyclin in the recognition of CDK2 by CAK1; the relative affinities of CDK2 and phosphorylated CDK2 for cyclin A, ATP, and substrate; and the structural consequences of CDK2 phosphorylation. The crystallographic results demonstrate disorder in the activation segment of phosphorylated CDK2 compared with this region of nonphosphorylated CDK2. We propose that this disorder can explain the differences observed in ATP and substrate binding between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CDK2 and the low level of phosphorylated CDK2 histone H1 kinase activity. Human CDK2 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a recombinant baculovirus encoding CDK2 (Autographica californicaCDK2) following slight modifications to the published method (39Rosenblatt J. De Bondt H. Jancarik J. Morgan D.O. Kim S.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells, adapted to Sf900-II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), were maintained in shake flasks at 28 °C. Cells (2 × 10 9) were infected with A. californicaCDK2 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. At 48 h postinfection, the virus-infected cells were harvested and lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mmbenzamidine, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). After homogenization, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C) and loaded onto DEAE-Sepharose (1.6 × 13 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), preequilibrated in hypotonic lysis buffer. The NaCl concentration of the flow-through pool was raised to 50 mm prior to loading onto an SP-Sepharose column (1.6 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CDK2 eluted in the flow-through as two distinct peaks that were pooled separately and then further purified using an ATP-agarose column (11-atom spacer, ribose hydroxyl-linked, 1 × 5 cm; Sigma) preequilibrated in 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. CDK2 was eluted with an increasing NaCl gradient. The two CDK2 populations eluting from the SP-Sepharose column behaved equivalently on the ATP-agarose column, and both pools were successfully phosphorylated by CAK1. Human CDK2 was also prepared as a GST fusion protein using a pGEX-KG plasmid transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM101. 1-Liter cultures were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for 16 h at 25 °C. Harvested cells were lysed by sonication of a freeze/thawed sample to which lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) had been added. Following clarification, the lysate was applied to a 5-ml glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated in Hepes-buffered saline (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 134 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA), and after washing, the GST fusion protein eluted with freshly prepared Hepes-buffered saline containing 20 mm glutathione. Yields of soluble fusion were greater than 100 mg/liter. Following thrombin cleavage (Sigma; 16 h at 1:1000 (w/w) at 25 °C), CDK2 was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A C-terminal fragment (residues 171–432) of bovine cyclin A, cyclin A3, possessing a hexahistidine tag, was expressed and purified as described (38Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E.P. Rasmussen B. Hunt T. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A pGEX clone containing the CAK1 cDNA insert was transformed intoE. coli strain B834. Typically 1–2 liters of bacterial culture were grown to an A 600 of 0.7 at 37 °C and then shifted to 16 °C for 2 h before induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation for a further 28 h at 16 °C. Harvested cells were lysed, and GST-CAK1 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose as described above. Yields of soluble fusion protein were 2 mg/liter. The partially purified preparation showed three bands around the expected position of the fusion protein on gels. Thrombin digests demonstrated that the middle band was GST-CAK1. Since the preparation was an effective source of CAK activity, further purification was not carried out. Partially purified fusion was found to be stable for at least 2 weeks when stored on ice. His-tagged CAK1 was overexpressed in S. cerevisiae strain MD4/4C (α leu2 his3 ura2 trp1) as described (20Thuret J.-Y. Valay J.-G. Faye G. Mann M. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. The His-tagged CAK1 showed similar enzymatic properties to those of the fusion protein. CDK2 phosphorylated on Thr160 was prepared by adding CAK1 activity (either as GST fusion or a histidine-tagged version) at a final CAK1:CDK2 ratio of between 1:20 and 1:2 (w/w) in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm ATP for 0.5 h at 25 °C. As reported by others (19Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Thuret J.-Y. Valay J.-G. Faye G. Mann M. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we also found that CAK1 gave a burst of phosphorylation followed by a fall in activity within minutes (data not shown). In order to obtain complete phosphorylation of CDK2, 3–4 aliquots of CAK1 and ATP were added. With GST-CAK1, ratios of 1:2 were required to achieve complete phosphorylation as judged by band shift on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated CDK2 was purified for analysis and crystallization trials by gel filtration (Superdex 75; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), a step that removed high molecular weight contaminants and glutathione. A glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then used to remove GST-CAK1. With histidine-tagged CAK1, lower amounts of CAK1 to CDK2 were used (1:20), and ion exchange (MonoQ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was employed to resolve phosphorylated CDK2 from unmodified CDK2 and His-tagged CAK1. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmmonothiolglycerol before loading onto the ion exchanger equilibrated in the same buffer. Pure phosphorylated CDK2, as judged by SDS-PAGE, eluted at approximately 75 mm salt upon gradient elution. Binary complexes of CDK2-cyclin A3 and phosphorylated CDK2-cyclin A3 were formed by adding cyclin A3 in slight molar excess to the CDK2 subunit and purified by Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography. Human p27kip1 carrying a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli cells (0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 3–4 h at 37 °C) and purified in one step using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Purified recombinant KAP was a kind gift of Dr. Neil Hanlon. Phosphorylation of CDK2 was monitored by gel shift on SDS-PAGE using 15% acrylamide and also by incorporation of32P-labeled phosphate. Initially GST-CAK1 was titrated, at concentrations from 0.75 to 7.5 μm (50–500 ng in 10 μl), against 30 μm (1 μg in 10 μl) monomeric CDK2 as substrate. Kinase reactions were performed in 10 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmmagnesium chloride, 1.0 mm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Radioactive analytical kinase reactions were performed using 1.5 μm GST-CAK1 (100 ng in 10 μl) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 0.1 mm ATP containing 1 μCi of γ-32P-labeled ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and either 15 μmCDK2-cyclin A3 complex (1 μg in 10 μl) or 15 μmmonomeric CDK2 (0.5 μg in 10 μl) as substrate. The reactions proceeded for 30 min at 30 °C before termination with SDS sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide), the stained and dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. Histone H1 kinase activity was examined using the same reaction conditions to which 300 μm histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim) was added. Inhibition of kinase activity by p27kip1 was measured by including 35 μm p27kip1 (1.0 μg in 10 μl) in the radioactive kinase assays carried out under the same reaction conditions as described above. PhosphorImager analyses (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) were carried out on the fixed, stained, and dried gels. 15 μm purified phosphorylated CDK2 (0.5 μg in 10 μl) was incubated with 25 μm KAP (0.6 μg in 10 μl) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence or absence of 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The reaction was stopped after 1 h at 25 °C by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide). 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) (Mant)-derivated nucleotide analogues were synthesized as described by Hiratsuka (40Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and purified according to John et al. (41John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cyclin A was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity as described by Lorca et al. (42Lorca T. Labbe J.-C. Devault A. Fesquet D. Strausfeld U. Nilsson J. Nygren P.-A. Uhlen M. Cavadore J.-C. Doree M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 55-62PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C using a Spex II fluorolog spectrofluorometer, with spectral band passes of 2 and 8 nm, for excitation and emission, respectively. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of CDK2 (0.2 μm of protein) was measured in a fluorescence buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm EDTA. Proteins were incubated for 30 min in fluorescence buffer before starting the experiments, and all measurements were corrected as already described (43Divita G. Goody R.S. Gautheron D.C. Di Pietro A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13178-13186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of ATP and ADP was monitored by the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of CDK2 at 340 nm upon excitation at 295 nm. A fixed concentration of CDK2 (0.2 μm) was titrated by increasing the concentration of ATP or ADP, respectively. The binding of Mant-nucleotides to CDK2 was monitored by the enhancement of the Mant-group fluorescence at 450 nm upon excitation at 340 nm (41John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Titration curve fitting was accomplished using Grafit software (Erithacus Software Ltd.) using a quadratic equation (44Heitz A. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Doree M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All the results correspond to the average of four separate experiments with an S.D. value lower than 10% for intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence titrations. The affinity between CDK2 or phosphorylated CDK2 and cyclin A was measured by the direct fluorescence titration of the CDK2-Mant-ATP complex with different cyclin A concentrations. Mant-ATP-CDK2 complexes were incubated for 15 min in the presence of different cyclin concentrations before starting the experiment. CDK2/cyclin interactions were also monitored using the enhancement of Mant-ATP fluorescence at 430 nm. The Mant-ATP-CDK2 complexes were kept at a constant concentration of 0.2 μm, and the fluorescence emission was monitored at 430 nm (excitation at 350 nm) as a function of the cyclin concentration. TheK d was calculated by fitting the data to a standard quadratic equation (44Heitz A. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Doree M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For displacement experiments, CDK2-Mant-ATP complexes at a concentration of 0.2 μm were incubated in the presence of a 200-fold excess of ATP and with or without added cyclin A (200 nm). Dissociation of the fluorescently labeled nucleotides was monitored according to the quenching of Mant fluorescence at 430 nm upon excitation at 350 nm. Data were fitted as already described (44Heitz A. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Doree M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GST-CDK2 was used for BIAcore analysis because neither free cyclin A3 nor CDK2 could be immobilized in an active form. GST-CDK2 was phosphorylated by His-tagged CAK1, as described above, and the fusion protein was purified on Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phosphorylated GST-CDK2 showed minimal mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of the CDK2 fusion protein was confirmed using γ-32P-labeled ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples of GST-CDK2 and GST-phosphorylated CDK2 were captured on the sensor chip (CM5) using immobilized anti-GST immunoglobulin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cyclin A3, at concentrations of 5–100 μg/ml, was passed over the chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Data analysis was performed with the BIAevaluation software (version 2.1, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified phosphorylated CDK2 was buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm monothioglycerol and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon). Since initial crystallization trials with phosphorylated CDK2 were not successful, sitting drops (2 μl) were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein and well solution (12–16% PEG 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm ammonium acetate) and allowed to equilibrate for 3 days before streak/microseeding with microcrystalline preparations of unmodified CDK2 using a 50-μm diameter steel wire for the seed transfer. Typically, crystals appeared within 2 days and continued to grow for 1 week. Maximum crystal dimensions were 200 × 100 × 75 μm. CDK2 was crystallized using the hanging drop method by mixing equal volumes (1 μl) of protein solution (at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 15 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and well solution (10–15% PEG 3350, 50 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.4). Crystals appeared overnight and continued to grow for 5 days. Crystal complexes of phosphorylated CDK2 and ATP and of CDK2 and ATP were prepared by soaking crystals in the presence of 2.5 mm ATP and 5 mmMgCl2. Data for the Phosphorylated CDK2-ATP complex were collected on beamline BW7B at DESY (Hamburg) operating at a wavelength of 1.044 Å usin"
https://openalex.org/W2020174316,"The binding of CC chemokines to CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) triggers cellular responses that, generally, are only transient in nature. To explore the potential role of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) in the regulation of CCR5, we performed phosphorylation experiments in a rat basophilic leukemia cell line stably expressing CCR5. The ability of various CCR5 ligands to stimulate calcium mobilization in these cells correlated with their ability to induce receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, internalization, and GRK association with the receptor. Aminooxypentane-RANTES, a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus infection, has been proposed to act through enhanced CCR5 internalization and inhibition of receptor recycling. Aminooxypentane-RANTES profoundly induced CCR5 phosphorylation, but had no effect on CCR1. In permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia CCR5 cells, monoclonal antibodies with specificity for GRK2/3 inhibited RANTES-induced receptor phosphorylation. Consistent with a role for these kinases in CCR5 regulation, 1–2 × 105copies of GRK2 or GRK3 were found to be expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that RANTES-induced CCR5 phosphorylation selectively occurs on serine residues. Our findings with receptor mutants indicate that serine residues at positions 336, 337, 342, and 349 represent GRK phosphorylation sites on CCR5. This study demonstrates that chemokines differ in their ability to induce CCR5 phosphorylation and desensitization and provides a molecular mechanism for the agonist-induced attenuation of CCR5 signaling.

Chemokines are a large family of chemotactic cytokines that mediate leukocyte activation and recruitment to sites of inflammation (1Wells T.N. Power C.A. Proudfoot A.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 376-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). They are small polypeptides of 8–10 kDa, which can be subdivided into two major gene families depending on the relative position of four conserved cysteines, the first two of which are adjacent in CC chemokines or separated by one intervening residue in CXC chemokines. Both CC and CXC chemokines bind to heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors which transduce signals through members of the Gior Gq family of G proteins (2Arai H. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21814-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding repertoires of different chemokine receptors significantly overlap, as do the sets of receptors expressed by different leukocytes and other target cells. Further adding to the versatility of the chemokine system, multiple and distinct signaling pathways exist for individual receptors, which are differentially regulated depending on the ligand and cell type involved (2Arai H. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21814-21819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4al-Aoukaty A. Schall T.J. Maghazachi A.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 4255-4260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like many other G protein-coupled receptors, chemokine receptors demonstrate diminishing responsiveness upon repeated or prolonged exposure to agonist, a phenomenon generally referred to as receptor desensitization. Other regulatory processes are receptor sequestration and degradation, which summarily contribute to dampening the cellular response. Receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) 1The abbreviations used are:GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; AOP-RANTES, aminooxypentane RANTES; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; CCR, CC chemokine receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody; Met-RANTES, methioninylated RANTES; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein. has been shown to be crucial in the rapid agonist-induced desensitization of many G protein-coupled receptor systems (5Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation promotes the binding of regulatory arrestin proteins, which results in further uncoupling of receptor-G protein interactions. Agonist-induced desensitization is clearly important in the control of the cytotoxic potential of leukocytes in the response to chemoattractant agonists. Furthermore, this regulatory mechanism may be critical for chemokine receptors whose primary function is to continuously sense small changes in the gradients of chemoattractants and thereby direct cellular migration. In the present study, we investigated early signaling events, which are initiated after ligand binding to CC chemokine receptor CCR5 and contribute to receptor desensitization. Under physiological conditions, CCR5 interacts with RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, or MCP-2 (6Samson M. Labbe O. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M.

We show that these various CCR5 ligands differ in their abilities to stimulate the receptor-G protein-PLC system in RBL-2H3 cells and that the intrinsic activities of these compounds directly correlate with their abilities to induce CCR5 phosphorylation and desensitization through a GRK-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, we identify amino acid residues within the CCR5 carboxyl terminus that are phosphorylated upon cellular stimulation with CC chemokines.

Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by the FLAG epitope. The 5′ mutagenic primer was: 5′-CGCGGGTCTAGAACC(ATGAAGACCATCATCGCCCTGAGCTACATCTTCTGCCTGGTGTTCGCC)[GACTACAAGGACGATGATGACGCC]GATTATCAAGTGTCAAGTCCA-3′. The signal sequence is surrounded by parentheses, the FLAG tag sequence is surrounded by brackets, and the start codon and 21 bases corresponding to amino acids 2–8 of CCR5 are underlined. The 3′ oligonucleotide primer was: 5′-CGCGGGTCTAGATCACAAGCCCACAGATATTTC-3′, with nucleotides 1039–1059 of the native sequence underlined. The resulting PCR product was digested with XbaI and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (12Mizushima S. Nagata S.

The cDNA construct for bovine GRK3 (13Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

David Gladstone Institutes of San Francisco, CA. Polymerase chain reaction was employed to generate CCR5 mutants with serine to alanine mutations at positions Ser-336, Ser-337, Ser-342, and Ser-349 by using the following degenerate 3′ primer: CGCGGGTCTAGATCACAAGCCCACAGMTATTTCCTGCTCCCCAGAGGMTCGGGTGTAAACTGMGGMTGCTCGCTCGGGAGCCTCTTG. Mutagenic base exchanges that resulted in the random substitution of serine residues by alanine are highlighted in boldface type; nucleotides 985–1059 of the native sequence are underlined. The mutated DNA fragments obtained were digested with XbaI and ligated into the expression vector pEF-BOS. Recombinant clones were isolated and sequenced. A total of 14 distinct sequences were identified, which encoded for CCR5 variants with various combinations of serine to alanine substitutions. RBL-2H3 cells were maintained in 80:20–10 medium (80 parts RPMI 1640, 20 parts medium 199, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). RBL cells (1 × 107 cells in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) were transfected by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) at 260 V and a capacitance of 960 microfarads in the presence of phβAPr-1-neo plasmid (15Gunning P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) containing cDNA for FLAG-CCR5. Fresh medium containing 600 μg/ml Geniticin was added 24 h after transfection. Surviving foci were isolated, expanded, and evaluated for expression of FLAG-CCR5 at the cell surface by flow cytometry using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (16Oppermann M. Freedman N.J.

CHO-CCR1 cells, which stably express a hemagglutinin-tagged version of CCR1 (17Solari R. Offord R.E. Remy S. Aubry J.P. Wells T.N. Whitehorn E. Oung T. Proudfoot A.E. J. Biol.

Barrett (Affymax Research Institute) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with different DNAs by the DEAE-dextran method, and phosphorylation experiments were performed 64 h after transfection. The polymorphonuclear leukocyte and mononuclear cell fractions were freshly isolated from EDTA blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Nycomed Pharma). Granulocytes (>80% CD16+ cells) were isolated from the cell pellets following the removal of erythrocytes by incubation with Gey's lysis buffer. Monocytes (>80% CD14+ cells) were purified after adherence (1 h/37 °C) of mononuclear cells to plastic tissue culture plates in the presence of 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum. Non-adherent lymphocytes consisted of 60–80% CD3+, 5–10% CD19+, and 10–20% CD56+ cells. Cell lysates were obtained by scraping cells into detergent buffer. The agonist-induced phosphorylation of CCR5 in intact cells was determined as described previously (16Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL-CCR5 cells or COS-7 cells transiently transfected with CCR5-pEF-BOS were metabolically labeled with32Pi. After treatment with different stimuli as indicated, cells were washed and solubilized in detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, with phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described; Ref. 16Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13266-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Receptors were immunoprecipitated by incubating precleared cellular lysates with 12 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal IgG1 and protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were dissociated and resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10% gels. Radioactively labeled receptors were visualized by autoradiography and analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager™. Receptor phosphorylation data were corrected for different receptor expression levels in transfected cells by multiplying the relative receptor expression as assessed by flow cytometry using receptor-specific antibodies (percentage of positive cells multiplied by the mean channel of fluorescence of positive cells) with the protein content of each immunoprecipitation tube. The experimental protocol for determining receptor phosphorylation in permeabilized cells has been described (18Oppermann M. Diverse P.M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In brief, RBL-CCR5 cells were permeabilized by incubation for 5 min with 0.5 unit of streptolysin O in KG buffer (139 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm glucose, 20 mm potassium salt of Pipes, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). This procedure resulted in the permeabilization of >95% of the cells as assessed by trypan blue staining. Cells were incubated with antibodies (500 μg/ml) for 10 min in KG buffer containing 10 μm ATP and 50 μm GTP in the presence or absence of staurosporine (500 nm). [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi/ml) was added, and cells were stimulated for 5 min with the indicated stimuli. Cells were lysed with detergent buffer, and receptors were immunoprecipitated using the same protocol as described for whole cell phosphorylation experiments. 32P-Labeled receptors were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon PVDF), excised and hydrolyzed in 6n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were lyophilized and resolubilized in pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid/acetic acid/H2O, 50/156/1794, (v/v/v)) containing phosphoamino acid standards. The samples were spotted on thin-layer cellulose plates and phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis (900 V/1.5 h) at pH 1.9, followed by a second electrophoresis (900 V/45 min) at pH 3.5 (pyridine/acetic acid/H2O, 10/100/1890, (v/v/v)) in the orthogonal direction. After ninhydrin staining, thin layer plates were exposed to PhosphorImager screens. RBL-CCR5 or CHO-CCR1 cells were washed with buffer A (148 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm glucose) and incubated (30 min/37 °C) at 107 cells/ml in the same buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 8 μm Fluo3-AM. After washing the cells with buffer A, cells were resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml of buffer A. Chemokine-induced intracellular calcium mobilization was determined by spectrofluorometry using a Perkin Elmer MPF-44B fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 506 nm and an emission wavelength of 526 nm. Intracellular calcium levels were calculated using the equation [Ca2+]i = K d × (F −F min)/(F max −F) (19Merritt J.E. McCarthy S.A. Davies M.P. Moores K.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), where K d is the dissociation constant of Fluo3-AM, F min is the autofluorescence of cells that were incubated in the absence of calcium chelator and F max is the maximal fluorescence determined with detergent-lysed cells. The agonist-induced internalization of CCR5 in RBL-CCR5 cells was determined, in principal, as described previously (10Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlöndorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 105 RBL-CCR5 cells were incubated (30 min/37 °C) in 100 μl of medium containing various concentrations of chemokines. Thereafter, cells were cooled to 4 °C and surface-expressed CCR5 were detected by flow cytometry using anti-CCR5 mAb MC-4 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled rabbit anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragment (Dako). The relative CCR5 surface expression was calculated as 100 × (mean channel of fluorescence [stimulated] − mean channel of fluorescence [negative control])/(mean channel of fluorescence [medium] − mean channel of fluorescence [negative control]) [%]. Synthetic peptides that correspond to amino acids Val-658 to Leu-689 of bovine GRK2 and Leu-658 to Leu-688 of bovine GRK3, respectively, were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer using FastMoc chemistry, and the products were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Peptides were coupled through an additional cysteine residue at the peptide amino terminus to bovine serum albumin using the heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate as described (20Oppermann M. Raedt U. Hebell T. Schmidt B. Zimmermann B. Götze O. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3785-3794PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were generated according to standard techniques following the immunization of BALB/c mice with peptide-bovine serum albumin conjugates. Hybridoma supernatants were screened by solid phase ELISA techniques or immunoblotting employing purified recombinant GRKs or cellular lysates from cells that overexpressed individual GRKs as the antigens. While several mAbs were obtained that specifically react with either GRK2 alone or both GRK2 and GRK3, no antibody was identified that solely recognizes GRK3. ELISA procedures were established that allowed the sensitive quantitation of GRK2 or GRK3 in cellular lysates. For the quantitation of GRK2, the mAb C5/1 (18Oppermann M. Diverse P.M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which recognizes a conserved sequence (Ala-480 to Phe-488) present in both GRK2 and GRK3, was adsorbed into wells of microtiter plates (5 μg/ml) in 50 mm carbonate, pH 10.6. Purified recombinant GRK2 as the protein standard or cellular lysates were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline-0.05% Tween and were allowed to bind for 2 h. GRK2 that had bound to the first mAb was detected by adding, in sequence, the biotinylated GRK2-specific mAb E23/8 (1 μg/ml; 1 h), a 4000-fold dilution of streptavidin-peroxidase (1 h) and 2.2-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) as substrate. The quantitation of GRK3 by ELISA followed the same protocol except for the following modifications. Recombinant GRK3 as the protein standard or GRK3 present in cellular lysates was detected by adding the biotinylated GRK2/3-specific mAb G7/5 (1 μg/ml) in the presence of a 100-fold excess of mAb E23/8 (which blocks G7/5 binding to GRK2) to wells containing mAb C5/1 as the first antibody. Detection limits of these assays are 15 ng/ml GRK2 or GRK3. Purified recombinant GRK2 and GRK3 were kindly provided by Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC). Agonist-induced association of GRKs with CCR5 was analyzed essentially as described previously (21Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL-CCR5 cells were treated with the indicated stimuli for 3 min in serum-free medium and were then incubated for 30 min with Hank's balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2.5 mm of the cell-permeant homobifunctional cross-linking agent dithiobis(succinimidylproprionate). After cellular lysis in detergent buffer, receptor-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 antibody and were dissociated under reducing conditions. Equivalent amounts of receptor protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Following the incubation with biotinylated GRK2/3-specific mAb C5/1 (2 μg/ml) and a 4000-fold dilution of streptavidin peroxidase, chemiluminescence of GRK2/3 was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Experimental procedures were performed three times, unless otherwise indicated. Results were analyzed for statistical significance by an unpaired Student's t test, and one-sided p values were calculated using ExcelTM software (Microsoft). To investigate the signaling properties of CCR5 in response to different chemokines, RBL-2H3 cells were stably transfected with a cDNA construct encoding human CCR5. Fig.1 shows that RANTES, AOP-RANTES, Met-RANTES, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β induced calcium mobilization in RBL-CCR5 cells, albeit with different efficiencies. Dose-response curves indicated that the maximal MIP-1α or MIP-1β induced calcium mobilization amounted to only 30% of the signal seen in cells that were stimulated with AOP-RANTES or RANTES. Met-RANTES was the least effective of all CCR5 ligands tested. Half-maximal effects were observed at concentrations between 1.5 and 6 nm for the different chemokines, with AOP-RANTES being the most potent agonist. To assess the effect of pertussis toxin on agonist-induced calcium mobilization, RBL-CCR5 cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 20 h. This treatment completely abrogated CCR5 signaling in response to chemokines (data not shown). Other groups, using different cells and assay systems, reported rank orders of signaling efficacies of CC chemokines in the CCR5 system that partially deviate from our findings (6Samson M. Labbe O. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 7Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol.

Caron M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This may point to cell type-specific effects or to the differential activation of the various intracellular effectors by these chemokines. Alternatively, varying biological activities of the different preparations of recombinant chemokines may account for these discrepancies. We therefore compared chemokine effects on CCR5 with those on the closely related chemokine receptor CCR1. Here, RANTES and MIP-1α were essentially equally effective (Fig. 1). Interestingly, AOP-RANTES failed to activate intracellular calcium mobilization in CCR1-expressing cells. RANTES-induced calcium mobilization was effectively desensitized in RBL-CCR5 cells by prior treatment with RANTES or with AOP-RANTES (Fig.2). In contrast, pretreatment with MIP-1α, MIP-1β, or Met-RANTES reduced the subsequent RANTES-induced cellular stimulation by only 15–20%. Thus, the abilities of the different receptor ligands to activate calcium mobilization via CCR5 paralleled their abilities to induce receptor desensitization. This generally good fit between the efficacies of chemokines in receptor activation and desensitization was also observed in the CCR1 system (Fig. 2). Activation of PKC by treatment with PMA inhibited the subsequent RANTES-induced calcium mobilization via both CCR1 and CCR5. Because of the importance of agonist-induced receptor internalization for receptor desensitization and resensitization in many G protein-coupled receptor systems, we also analyzed the effects of chemokines on CCR5 endocytosis in RBL-CCR5 cells. As shown in Fig.3, AOP-RANTES was more effective than RANTES and Met-RANTES at receptor endocytosis. While 10 nmAOP-RANTES induced internalization of >80% of CCR5, treatment of RBL-CCR5 cells with equivalent concentrations of RANTES or Met-RANTES resulted in the down-regulation of surface-expressed CCR5 of only 60% or <20%, respectively. This result confirms previous findings with chemokine-induced CCR5 endocytosis in CHO-CCR5 cells (10Mack M. Luckow B. Nelson P.J. Cihak J. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Signoret N. Marsh M. Stangassinger M. Borlat F. Wells T.N. Schlöndorff D. Proudfoot A.E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1215-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To determine whether receptor phosphorylation correlated with the observed chemokine-induced receptor desensitization and internalization we immunoprecipitated CCR5 from RBL cells which were metabolically labeled with 32Pi and subsequently stimulated with various agonists. In a dose-dependent fashion, RANTES promoted within 5 min the phosphorylation of a 40-kDa band, which was absent in untransfected 32P-labeled control cells. At receptor-saturating concentrations, RANTES increased the phosphorylation of CCR5 in RBL cells 4.5-fold above basal levels (Fig.4). After stimulation of these cells with MIP-1α or MIP-1β, maximal 32P incorporation into this receptor amounted to only 18 ± 4% or 12 ± 2% of the signal observed after RANTES stimulation. Yet, these signals were significantly (p < 0.01) different from basal values in the absence of stimulus. While Met-RANTES was the least effective of all CCR5 ligands tested, the maximal AOP-RANTES induced receptor phosphorylation was 2.8 ± 0.3-fold higher than in cells that had been stimulated with RANTES. Pretreatment of RBL-CCR5 cells with pertussis toxin reduced the maximal AOP-RANTES-induced receptor phosphorylation by 55% (data not shown). Again, MIP-1α and RANTES induced CCR1 phosphorylation equally well, while stimulation with AOP-RANTES and Met-RANTES did not result in significant CCR1 phosphorylation. Since our calcium mobilization experiments had indicated that in RBL cells CCR5 is coupled to phospholipase C, we sought to determine the extent to which PKC might participate in the agonist-induced CCR5 phosphorylation. The phorbol ester PMA significantly increased CCR5 phosphorylation above basal values (Fig.5). However, pretreatment of RBL-CCR5 cells with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide at concentrations that abolished PMA-induced phosphorylation inhibited RANTES- or AOP-RANTES-induced CCR5 phosphorylation by only 16 ± 1% or 22 ± 10%, respectively. While this modest effect of the P"
https://openalex.org/W2032597695,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) have been principally characterized by their ability to phosphorylate and desensitize G protein-coupled receptors. However, recent studies suggest that GRKs may have more diverse protein/protein interactions in cells. Based on the identification of a consensus caveolin binding motif within the pleckstrin homology domain of GRK2, we tested the direct binding of purified full-length GRK2 to various glutathioneS-transferase-caveolin-1 fusion proteins, and we discovered a specific interaction of GRK2 with the caveolin scaffolding domain. Interestingly, analysis of GRK1 and GRK5, which lack a pleckstrin homology domain, revealed in vitro binding properties similar to those of GRK2. Maltose-binding protein caveolin and glutathione S-transferase-GRK fusion proteins were used to map overlapping regions in the N termini of both GRK2 and GRK5 that appear to mediate conserved GRK/caveolin interactions. In vivo association of GRK2 and caveolin was suggested by co-fractionation of GRK2 with caveolin in A431 and NIH-3T3 cells and was further supported by co-immunoprecipitation of GRK2 and caveolin in COS-1 cells. Functional significance for the GRK/caveolin interaction was demonstrated by the potent inhibition of GRK-mediated phosphorylation of both receptor and peptide substrates by caveolin-1 and -3 scaffolding domain peptides. These data reveal a novel mode for the regulation of GRKs that is likely to play an important role in their cellular function.

Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This process functions to both uncouple the receptor from the G protein and to promote receptor internalization via clathrin-coated pits. The activity and cellular localization of GRKs appear to be regulated by a variety of molecules including activated receptors, Gβγ subunits, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PKC, and calmodulin (1Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Many of these interactions are thought to be important largely for their ability to regulate interaction of GRKs with the plasma membrane where receptor substrates reside. Recent studies have provided novel information regarding the function and cellular localization of GRKs. For example, it was shown that GRK2 can traffic along with β2-adrenergic receptors to the endosome following receptor activation (2Ruiz-Gomez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mayor and co-workers (3Murga C. Ruiz-Gomez A. Garcia-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J.

In addition, we and others (4Carman C.V. Som T. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20308-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A.

Collectively, these studies suggest that the function and regulation of GRKs may involve diverse protein/protein interactions. Caveolae represent distinct cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched plasma membrane and vesicular structures in cells that function in a variety of cellular processes including endothelial transcytosis and potocytosis (7Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Caveolin, a 22–24-kDa integral membrane protein composed of cytoplasmic N and C termini and a central intramembrane domain, is thought to be a major structural component of caveolae (7Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). A 20-amino acid juxtamembrane region (the scaffolding domain) within the N-terminal domain has been shown to mediate the association of caveolin with other proteins (8Couet J. Shengwen L. Okamoto T. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, a wide variety of cellular signaling molecules have been shown to associate with caveolae leading to the hypothesis that caveolae may serve as cell-surface microdomains that concentrate and organize cellular signaling pathways (7Okamoto T.

These studies reveal that many proteins involved in mitogenic signaling cascades, including the epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin and Neu (c-ErbB2) receptors, c-Src, Fyn, Erk-2, and Ras, associate with caveolin (12Couet J.

Similarly, various G protein-coupled signaling components including receptors (β2-adrenergic, m2-muscarinic, B2-bradykinin, cholecystokinin, ETA-endothelin, calcium-sensing and angiotensin II receptors), G proteins (Gsα, Giα, Goα, and Gqα) and various downstream effector molecules (adenylyl cyclase, PKCα, -Y, -ε, and -ζ, and endothelial and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase) have been shown to interact with caveolin suggesting a potential role of caveolae in regulating such pathways (20Dupree P.

Since GRKs also play an important role in regulating G protein-coupled signaling pathways, we examined the primary sequence of the GRKs for consensus caveolin binding motifs (32Couet J. Li S.

Indeed, GRK2 and -3 were found to contain a C-terminal, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-localized consensus caveolin binding motif. Here, we investigate the interaction of GRKs with caveolin both in vitro and in intact cells, and we demonstrate a previously unappreciated mode of regulation for these kinases. Hemagglutinin (HA)-specific polyclonal antibody was from Babco.

An MBP-caveolin-1 fusion construct containing caveolin residues 1–101 (MBP-caveolin-11–101) was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of base pairs 1–303 of the caveolin-1 cDNA. The product was then subcloned into the pMal vector in-frame with the upstream MBP via EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites in the polylinker region. Purified MBP and MBP-caveolin-1 fusion proteins were generated as described previously (37Vojtek B.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed using standard methods (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was performed using caveolin-1-, GRK1-, GRK2-, GRK5-, AP-2-, clathrin-, transferrin receptor-, Gβ-, and GST-specific primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution), and visualization by ECL following the manufacturer's guidelines. Five μg of purified GST or GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal residues 1–61 (GST-caveolin1–61) or membrane proximal residues 61–101 (GST-caveolin61–101) immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 2 μg of purified GRK1, GRK2, GRK2 PH domain (GRK2 residues 553–670), GRK5 or Gβ1γ2 in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl and either 0.02% or 1% Triton X-100) at 30 °C for 60 min. The samples were chilled on ice for 5 min, and the beads were then pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 10 s, washed three times with 400 μl of binding buffer, and boiled with SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using GRK- or Gβ-specific antibodies. One μg of purified MBP or MBP-caveolin-11–101 immobilized on amylose resin was incubated with 200 ng of purified GRKs or soluble GST, GST-GRK2 (residues 1–184, 1–147, 1–122, 1–88, 1–63, 70–184, 80–184, 87–184, 94–184, 185–467, or 468–689), or GST-GRK5 (residues 1–200, 1–98, 1–39, 20–49, or 489–590) fusion proteins in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100) at 30 °C for 60 min. Washing, elution, and analysis were identical to GST-caveolin binding experiments with the exception that GST fusion proteins were immunoblotted with a GST-specific antibody. COS-1, A431 and NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (or 10% bovine calf serum for NIH-3T3 cells), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. COS-1 cells grown to 75–95% confluence in a 100-mm dish were transfected with 20 μg total of pcDNA3, pcDNA3-GRK2, and pCB7-caveolin-1 DNA using FugeneTM following the manufacturer's instructions. Five 150-mm dishes of A431 or NIH-3T3 cells were grown to confluence, and caveolin-rich fractions were generated by a detergent-free sodium carbonate method, essentially as described previously (18Song K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Briefly, dishes were placed on ice for 5 min, rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then scraped into ∼1.5 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0 buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were then subjected to 15 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer, three 20-s bursts with a Brinkman Polytron (2500 rpm), and three 30-s bursts with a tip sonicator, all on ice. The extracts were diluted 1:2 with 90% sucrose in MES-buffered saline, overlaid with 6 ml of 35% sucrose/MES-buffered saline and 3 ml of 5% sucrose/MES-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 4 °C for ∼16 h at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. After centrifugation, nine 1.3-ml fractions were collected, and aliquots of each were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using either caveolin-1-, GRK2-, AP-2-, clathrin-, or transferrin receptor-specific antibodies. COS-1 cells, co-transfected with pcDNA3-GRK2 and pCB7-caveolin-1, were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection and harvested by addition of 1 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A and aprotinin) and rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were scraped, vortexed 5 times, and homogenized with two 15-s bursts with a Brinkman Polytron (2500 rpm). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was removed. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μl of supernatant was incubated with either a GRK2-, caveolin-1, or HA-specific polyclonal antibody or a transferrin receptor-specific monoclonal antibody for 30 min at 4 °C followed by addition of 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in extraction buffer and an additional 60 min incubation at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 10 s, pellets were washed three times for 30 min at 4 °C with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using GRK2-, caveolin-1-, and transferrin receptor-specific antibodies. Rhodopsin phosphorylation reactions contained, in a total volume of 20 μl, 30 nm GRK1, GRK2, or GRK5, 400 nm rhodopsin, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5 cpm/fmol), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and either Me2SO (vehicle) or 0.1–12.5 μmcaveolin peptides (17Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 30Michel J.B. Feron O. Sase K. Prabhakar P. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) in Me2SO. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, stopped with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. After autoradiography the32P-labeled rhodopsin bands were excised and counted. Peptide phosphorylation reactions were identical except they contained 0.1–10 mm peptide substrate (RRREEEEESAAA) instead of rhodopsin and 50 nm GRK2 in a total volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for either 20 or 60 min, blotted to P81 paper, washed 5 times with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and counted. Since many of the proteins involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling associate with caveolae and/or caveolin, we analyzed the primary sequence of GRK2 and found that a consensus caveolin binding motif (φXφXXXXφ, φXXXXφXXφ, or φXφXXXXφXXφ; where φ is an aromatic residue (32Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar)) exists within the C-terminal PH domain (576WQRRYFYQF584). To test whether GRK2 can bind to caveolin, purified GRK2 was incubated with GST, GST-caveolin1–61, and GST-caveolin61–101 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose. This analysis demonstrated specific binding of GRK2 (∼15% of the total) to GST-caveolin61–101 (Fig.1), a protein that contains the caveolin scaffolding domain (residues 81–101) previously implicated in caveolin interaction with other signaling molecules such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, c-Src, PKC, and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (12Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar,17Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25907-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Importantly, there was minimal binding to GST alone (data not shown) or GST-caveolin1–61 (Fig. 1). Moreover, GRK2 binding to GST-caveolin61–101 was modestly enhanced at higher ionic strength (data not shown), consistent with the binding being primarily mediated by hydrophobic interactions. Given the localization of the identified consensus caveolin binding sequence to the PH domain, we also analyzed the direct binding of purified GRK2 PH domain and observed significant and specific binding to GST-caveolin61–101 (data not shown). Interestingly, GRK1 and GRK5, which lack a PH domain, also displayed specific binding to GST-caveolin61–101 (although a low level of binding to GST-caveolin1–61 was also observed for GRK5) (Fig. 1). To test further the binding specificity, similar experiments were performed in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 in order to minimize the role of nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. Whereas the overall extent of binding was slightly reduced for all of the GRKs tested, GRK1, GRK2, GRK5, and the GRK2-PH domain, retained specific binding to GST-caveolin61–101 (data not shown). To demonstrate further the specificity of GRK/caveolin interactions, we tested the binding of purified Gβ1γ2 to the GST-caveolin-1 constructs. Despite modification with an extremely hydrophobic geranylgeranyl moiety, Gβ1γ2did not significantly interact with either GST-caveolin1–61 or GST-caveolin61–101 (Fig.1). These results demonstrate that the observed GRK/caveolin binding is not simply due to nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. Overall, these data suggest that caveolin binding may be a common feature of GRKs and that a conserved caveolin binding motif may be present. Analysis of the aromatic residues present in GRKs failed to reveal conserved sequences that strictly fit the previously identified consensus caveolin binding motifs (32Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). However, three potential caveolin binding motifs were identified in all GRKs as follows:63LXXXXφXXφ71,162φXXφXXXXXφXXφXXφ177, and 375φXLXXXXφ382. In order to map caveolin-binding determinants in GRKs, amylose resins containing either purified MBP or an MBP-caveolin1–101fusion protein were generated and incubated with either full-length GRKs or various soluble GST-GRK2 or GST-GRK5 fusion proteins. Whereas full-length GRK1, GRK2, and GRK5 failed to interact with MBP, they each bound to MBP-caveolin1–101 similar to their demonstrated binding to GST-caveolin61–101 (data not shown). Analysis of GST-GRK2 fusion proteins containing the N terminus (residues 1–184), catalytic domain (residues 185–467), and C terminus (residues 468–689) were then tested. This revealed specific binding of GST-GRK2468–689 (Fig. 2) in agreement with the observed binding of purified GRK2 PH domain to GST-caveolin61–101 mentioned above. Interestingly, GST-GRK21–184 also bound significantly to MBP-caveolin1–101, whereas GST-GRK2184–467 exhibited weak binding to both MBP-caveolin1–101 and MBP, suggesting that this interaction is not specific (Fig. 2). Importantly, neither GST alone nor any of the other GST-GRK fusion proteins tested bound to the MBP-amylose resin under these conditions (data not shown). To map further the caveolin-binding determinants within the N terminus of GRK2, GST-GRK21–184 was progressively truncated, and the resulting fusions were analyzed for caveolin binding. GST-GRK21–147, GST-GRK21–122, and GST-GRK21–88 all retained binding to MBP-caveolin1–101, whereas GST-GRK21–63failed to bind (Fig. 2). Additional GST-GRK2 fusions (GST-GRK270–184, GST-GRK280–184, GST-GRK287–184, and GST-GRK294–184) were also tested, and all failed to bind MBP-caveolin1–101. This suggests that the critical binding determinants lie between residues 63 and 70 in GRK2. Indeed, residues 63–71 were initially identified as a conserved domain with similarity to the consensus sequences for caveolin binding (Fig. 2 C). In order to determine if this N-terminal domain was responsible for the conserved GRK/caveolin interactions, the binding of several GST-GRK5 fusion proteins to MBP-caveolin1–101 was also tested. Initial analysis of an N-terminal construct (GST-GRK51–200) demonstrated significant and specific binding to MBP-caveolin1–101, whereas a C-terminal construct (GST-GRK5489–590) failed to bind (Fig. 2). To map further the N-terminal caveolin-binding site, GST-GRK51–98, GST-GRK51–39, and GST-GRK520–49 were analyzed. Although GST-GRK51–98 retained binding to MBP-caveolin1–101, GST-GRK51–39 and GST-GRK520–49 failed to bind (Fig. 2) suggesting that the critical caveolin binding region in GRK5 lies between residues 49 and 98, a region that overlaps the N-terminal caveolin binding region identified in GRK2. These data suggest that the N-terminal region, including GRK2 residues 63–71 (LXXXXφXXφ) (Fig. 2 C), is important for the conserved GRK/caveolin binding characteristics. The initial study that proposed caveolin binding motifs (φXφXXXXφ, φXXXXφXXφ, or φXφXXXXφXXφ) used the caveolin scaffolding domain to select random peptide ligands from phage display libraries (32Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in that study nearly 10% of the selected 15-mer peptides contained only two aromatic residues. Additionally, whereas a generally conserved caveolin consensus motif, including four aromatic residues (φXφXXXXφXXφ) has been identified in Gα subunits, the Gαq subunit has substitutions of valine and leucine for two of these aromatic residues (32Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Despite this substitution, Gαq has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin (22de Weerd W.F.C. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems possible that caveolin binding requirements may be broader than initially described. Finally, although the functional significance for the existence of two caveolin binding regions in GRK2 (residues 63–71 and the PH domain) remains to be elucidated, it is of interest that the PH domain-localized motif overlaps with a region that includes phospholipid-binding determinants (39Harlan J.E. Hadjuk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Two approaches were used to ascertain whether GRK2 and caveolin associate in intact cells. The first employed a widely used extraction and fractionation method that enables the separation of caveolae from other cellular organelles (18Song K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). For these studies, A431 cells were lysed in a detergent-free sodium carbona"
https://openalex.org/W2071835467,"Smad proteins are essential components of the intracellular signaling pathways utilized by members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of growth factors. Certain Smad proteins (e.g. Smad1, -2, and -3) can act as regulated transcriptional activators, a process that involves phosphorylation of these proteins by activated TGF-β superfamily receptors. We demonstrate that the intracellular kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase-1 (MEKK-1), an upstream activator of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, can participate in Smad2-dependent transcriptional events in cultured endothelial cells. A constitutively active form of MEKK-1 but not mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK-1) or TGF-β-activated kinase-1, two distinct intracellular kinases, can specifically activate a Gal4-Smad2 fusion protein, and this effect correlates with an increase in the phosphorylation state of the Smad2 protein. These effects do not require the presence of the C-terminal SSXS motif of Smad2 that is the site of TGF-β type 1 receptor-mediated phosphorylation. Activation of Smad2 by active MEKK-1 results in enhanced Smad2-Smad4 interactions, nuclear localization of Smad2 and Smad4, and the stimulation of Smad protein-transcriptional coactivator interactions in endothelial cells. Overexpression of Smad7 can inhibit the MEKK-1-mediated stimulation of Smad2 transcriptional activity. A physiological level of fluid shear stress, a known activator of endogenous MEKK-1 activity in endothelial cells, can stimulate Smad2-mediated transcriptional activity. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism for activation of Smad protein-mediated signaling in endothelial cells and suggest that Smad2 may act as an integrator of diverse stimuli in these cells. Smad proteins are essential components of the intracellular signaling pathways utilized by members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of growth factors. Certain Smad proteins (e.g. Smad1, -2, and -3) can act as regulated transcriptional activators, a process that involves phosphorylation of these proteins by activated TGF-β superfamily receptors. We demonstrate that the intracellular kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase-1 (MEKK-1), an upstream activator of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, can participate in Smad2-dependent transcriptional events in cultured endothelial cells. A constitutively active form of MEKK-1 but not mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK-1) or TGF-β-activated kinase-1, two distinct intracellular kinases, can specifically activate a Gal4-Smad2 fusion protein, and this effect correlates with an increase in the phosphorylation state of the Smad2 protein. These effects do not require the presence of the C-terminal SSXS motif of Smad2 that is the site of TGF-β type 1 receptor-mediated phosphorylation. Activation of Smad2 by active MEKK-1 results in enhanced Smad2-Smad4 interactions, nuclear localization of Smad2 and Smad4, and the stimulation of Smad protein-transcriptional coactivator interactions in endothelial cells. Overexpression of Smad7 can inhibit the MEKK-1-mediated stimulation of Smad2 transcriptional activity. A physiological level of fluid shear stress, a known activator of endogenous MEKK-1 activity in endothelial cells, can stimulate Smad2-mediated transcriptional activity. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism for activation of Smad protein-mediated signaling in endothelial cells and suggest that Smad2 may act as an integrator of diverse stimuli in these cells.

The discovery of Smad proteins and the demonstration that they can mediate many of the transcriptional effects of these growth factors has been an important advance (1Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 3Wrana J.L.

The central roles of these proteins in mediating TGF-β responses in cells is highlighted by the demonstration that mutations in Smads 2, 3, and 4 have been causally linked to specific malignancies, and disruption of the Smad2 and Smad4 genes in mice results in early embryonic lethality (4Waldrip W.R.

As the detailed molecular mechanisms of Smad protein signaling have emerged a number of functional interactions between these proteins and other signaling pathways have been reported. For instance, recent work has demonstrated that the classic mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK/ERK) can negatively regulate bone morphogenic protein/Smad1-dependent transcriptional responses. This appears to occur as a result of the phosphorylation of Smad1 by a member of the Erk kinases and subsequent translocation of Smad1 out of the nucleus (6Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In contrast to this inhibitory effect, the stress-activated protein kinase pathway (i.e. the SAPK/JNK pathway) has been implicated as a positive regulator of certain Smad-dependent effects. Previous data from several groups have documented the importance of AP-1 and related transcriptional effectors in some TGF-β-mediated transcriptional responses, and a recent report demonstrated a direct functional interaction between Smad3 and c-Fos/c-Jun in mediating TGF-β-dependent transcription (7Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Recently, signals derived from growth factor receptors containing tyrosine kinase activities were shown to be capable of modulating Smad-dependent effects. This was suggested to occur as a result of activation of a kinase downstream of MEK-1, an upstream activator of the classic MAPK/ERK kinase pathway, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 (9de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, a variety of other kinases have been implicated in TGF-β signaling, such as TAK-1 and TAB, although their precise roles have not been elucidated (10Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K.

Taken together, these data indicate that multiple signal transduction cascades may modulate Smad signaling in cells and begin to provide possible mechanisms by which signals derived from non-TGF-β family members may impact TGF-β superfamily responses. Furthermore, these data suggest that Smad proteins may be involved in the transduction of diverse signals in cells. In this report we demonstrate that MEKK-1, a MAPK kinase kinase that is an upstream activator of the SAPK/JNK pathway, is capable of selectively activating Smad2-dependent transcriptional activity independently of TGF-β in cultured endothelial cells. These data demonstrate a functional interaction between the SAPK/JNK and Smad signaling pathways and suggest that Smad protein signaling may be modulated by MEKK-1 or related kinases in endothelial cells. Primary bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated as described and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 250 units/ml penicillin G, and 250 μg/ml streptomycin (13Topper J.N. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K.R. Xu Y.Y. Deeds J.D. Feeley R. Gimeno C.J. Woolf E.A. Tayber O. Mays G.G. Sampson B.A. Schoen F.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Falb D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These were utilized at passages 3–12. COS-7 cells were maintained in the same medium. The p3TP promoter, Smad protein expression constructs, Smad-GAL4/VP16 fusion constructs, and CBP fusion constructs have been described previously (14Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter (P800) was provided by David Loskutoff, dominant negative MEKK-1 by Roger Davis, and activated TAK-1 expression plasmid by Eisuke Nishida. The active MEKK-1, MEK-1, and protein kinase A expression plasmids were obtained from Stratagene. The activated MEKK-1 construct consists of amino acids 380–672 of MEKK-1. The activated MEK-1 construct consists of the 2218/E222 derivative that has had amino acids 32–51 deleted. The c-Jun and Elk1 fusion proteins consist of amino acids 1–223 of c-Jun and 307–427 of Elk1 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, respectively. The CRE, AP-1, and NF-κB-dependent promoters consist of four tandem CRE sites (AGCCTGACGTCAGAG), seven tandem AP-1 sites (TGACTAA), or four tandem NFKB sites (TGGGGACTTTCCGC) cloned upstream of a minimal TATA box and luciferase reporter gene. The Smad2 mutants pMSmad2*P and pMSmad2C*P have been described previously (14Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For the labeling experiments, a Flag epitope replaced the Gal4 binding domain, and these were subcloned into the expression vector pCI (Promega). For transient transfections, cells were seeded at 50–70% confluence and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 h. The cells were allowed to recover overnight in media containing 0.2% serum. Following approximately 18 h of incubation, luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured (Tropix). All results are reported as luciferase activity (relative light unit) normalized to cotransfected β-galactosidase activity (expressed from cotransfected, constitutive expression constructs, e.g. cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase, phosphoglycerol kinase β-galactosidase) and are representative of at least three independent experiments. A typical transfection utilized 0.25–0.5 μg of reporter gene plasmid and 5 ng of active kinase (e.g. MEKK-1 and MEK-1) expression plasmid. Total DNA and total amount of expression plasmid were equalized by the addition of appropriate control plasmids. Antibodies directed against the epitopes used in the immunoprecipitations and Western blots were obtained from commercial suppliers (Boehringer Mannheim, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Eastman Kodak Co.). The anti-CBP/P300, MEKK-1, and MEK-1 antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell lysates were made approximately 24 h after transfection in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors, and immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved on 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide denaturing gels, transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting, and probed with appropriate antisera at 1/1000–1/2000 as indicated in the figures. Individual proteins were detected with a secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase and visualized with chemiluminescence (ECL). COS-7 cells were transfected as above, allowed to recover overnight, and subsequently incubated in low phosphate media containing [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C. For the TGF-β stimulation, active TGF-β at 5 ng/ml (R & D Systems) was added for the final 30 min. The cells were washed, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-epitope antisera as above. Proteins were resolved on a 10% denaturing acrylamide gel and electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and autoradiography was performed. Western blots with anti-epitope antisera were performed to control for protein levels. BAEC were transfected as above. The confluent monolayers were then washed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 min. After pre-blocking with nonspecific goat serum, the primary (anti-epitope) antibodies were applied at 1/500 for 1 h. The monolayers were then washed and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate. The monolayers were visualized with a Nikon Microphot-FXA fluorescence microscope and imaged with a Power Macintosh-based image analysis system (Oncor). BAEC were exposed to a steady laminar shear stress stimulus utilizing a modified cone-plate flow system that has been described in detail previously and is a well validated method for exposing cultured cells to defined fluid mechanical stimuli (15Topper J.N. Cai J. Falb D. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10417-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 16Topper J.N. Cai J. Stavrakis G. Anderson K.R. Woolf E.A. Sampson B.A. Schoen F.J. Falb D. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2396-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For these experiments the BAEC were transfected as described above and subsequently plated to 12 individual “coverslips” (per experiment) that were simultaneously subjected to the LSS (flow) stimulus for 18 h. LSS at approximately 10 dynes/cm2 was achieved by utilizing a 0.5° cone rotating at a rate of 100 rpm. Identical coverslips maintained under standard (static) culture conditions served as controls. All flow experiments utilized the same culture medium as the static experiments. To investigate the role of non-receptor kinases in the regulation of Smad signaling in endothelial cells, we examined the ability of constitutively activated forms of MEK-1, MEKK-1, and TAK-1 to regulate two TGF-β responsive promoters, the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter (P800) and p3TP. MEK-1 is an activator of the classic MAPK/ERK pathway, and MEKK-1 is an activator of the stress or SAPK/JNK pathway (17Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 18Errede B. Cade R.M. Yashar B.M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). TAK-1 is a kinase that has been implicated in TGF-β signaling and is capable of activating components of the SAPK/JNK pathway, but its precise role is unknown (12Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). In preliminary titration experiments in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), a ratio of active kinase to reporter gene plasmid of 1 to 100 was found to be sufficient to reproducibly activate transcription, and under these conditions only MEKK-1 was reproducibly capable of activating the TGF-β-responsive promoters P800 and p3TP. Comparable levels of active MEK-1 or active or wild type TAK were unable to reproducibly activate these promoters, although active TAK-1 could stimulate the P800 promoter when expressed at very high levels (data not shown). Fig. 1 demonstrates the response of the p3TP and P800 promoters to coexpression of active MEKK-1, active MEK-1, or a constitutively active TGF-β type-1 receptor (actTβR1). Both promoters are induced significantly by the active TGF-β1 receptor and active MEKK-1 but not by active MEK-1. When these kinases are expressed in combination with the activated TGF-β receptor, MEKK-1 appears to stimulate the activity of both promoters in a manner additive to the TGF-β receptor, whereas MEK-1 has little effect. To explore the mechanisms of these effects in more detail, the p3TP promoter was stimulated with either active TβR1 or active MEKK-1, and the effects of coexpression of a dominant negative form of MEKK-1 or Smad7, an inhibitory Smad protein, was examined. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the induction of p3TP by the active TGF-β receptor was partially inhibited by the dominant negative MEKK-1 and was potently inhibited by coexpression of Smad7. Similarly, the induction of p3TP by active MEKK-1 was inhibited by coexpression of both dominant negative MEKK-1 and Smad7. Fig. 1 E is a series of Western blots demonstrating the expression levels of the activated kinases utilized in these experiments. At the level of expression plasmids used (5 ng) we reproducibly observed a level of activated MEKK-1 or MEK-1 protein approximately 3–5 times that of the corresponding endogenous protein, and the relative levels of the two overexpressed active kinases (MEKK-1 and MEK-1) appeared comparable. Taken together, these results suggest that maximal transcriptional induction of the P800 and p3TP promoters by the active TGF-β1 receptor requires the action of MEKK-1 as well as Smad proteins. In addition, the observation that Smad7 can block active MEKK-1-mediated stimulation of these promoters suggests that Smad proteins are playing a role in the MEKK-1-mediated transcriptional stimulation. To investigate this hypothesis directly, we utilized a Gal4-based transcriptional system. We have previously shown that this system faithfully recapitulates ligand (TGF-β)-induced, Smad-dependent activation of transcription in cultured endothelial cells (14Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were cotransfected with constructs encoding fusion proteins between the Gal4 DNA binding domain and either full-length or C-terminal MH2domains of Smad2, -4, -6, and -7 together with a Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter gene and constitutively activated forms of MEKK-1 or MEK-1. As shown in Fig.2, MEKK-1 markedly stimulates Smad2-dependent transcription in this system. The low basal level of luciferase activity observed in the absence of MEKK-1 probably reflects a small amount of endogenous TGF-β activation in the endothelial culture system. Smad4 demonstrates a reproducibly lower level of basal transcriptional activity in this system, and this is not enhanced in the presence of MEKK-1. Gal4 constructs containing only the C-terminal MH2 domain (along with the linker region) of these proteins (pM2C and pM4C) demonstrated significantly increased basal levels of transcriptional activity and were also markedly stimulated by MEKK-1. This observation is consistent with previous data demonstrating that the transcriptional activation domain is contained within the C-terminal half of the Smad protein (MH2 domain) and indicates that MEKK-1 can stimulate Smad2- and Smad4-dependent transcription in the absence of the inhibitory MH1 domain. In contrast to Smad2 and Smad4, neither Smad6 nor Smad7 demonstrated any significant basal or MEKK-1-induced transcriptional activity in endothelial cells. Moreover, overexpression of a constitutively activated form of MEK-1 does not stimulate the transcriptional activity of any Smad construct tested in this system (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 B demonstrates that the MEKK-1-mediated stimulation of GAL4-Smad2 (pM2)-mediated transcription is inhibited by coexpression of either the dominant negative MEKK-1 or Smad7. Taken together, these results indicate that MEKK-1 appears capable of selectively stimulating Smad2-dependent transcriptional activity in BAEC and that Smad7 can interfere with this process. MEKK-1 has been reported to modulate the activity of a number of signal transduction pathways in addition to the SAPK/JNK pathway such as NF-κB/IκB and p53-mediated events (19Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 20Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 10541-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To examine the selectivity of our endothelial cell system, we performed a number of controls to assess the specificity of the observed MEKK-1-mediated stimulation. Conditioned media from endothelial cells expressing active MEKK-1 consistently failed to stimulate p3TP or GAL4-Smad2-mediated transcription, and inclusion of a neutralizing antibody to soluble TGF-β in the media of the transfection studies (in quantities sufficient to inhibit the activity of exogenously added active TGF-β1 at 1.0 ng/ml) did not inhibit MEKK-1-mediated stimulation of Smad-dependent transcription (data not shown). These results indicate that MEKK-1 is not inducing the expression of TGF-β which can then act in a paracrine manner. To ensure that MEKK-1 activation of Smad2 and Smad4 was not the result of promiscuous signaling or indiscriminate stimulation of the general transcriptional apparatus in this overexpression system, we examined the response of a series of well characterized control promoters and transcriptional effectors. As shown in Fig.3, both constitutively activated kinases (MEKK-1 and MEK-1) demonstrated a selective pattern of promoter activation when expressed at these levels in BAEC (see Fig.1 E). Active MEKK-1 potently stimulated a coexpressed AP-1-dependent promoter, whereas an NF-κB-dependent promoter was also stimulated but to much lesser degree. Active MEKK-1 was unable to significantly stimulate a CRE-dependent promoter, as compared with a constitutively activated form of protein kinase A, a known activator of CRE-dependent transcription (Fig. 3). Thus, expression of active MEKK-1 appears to be eliciting the expected pattern of promoter specificity in this endothelial cell context. To examine further the selectivity of transcription factor activation in our system, we examined the ability of active MEKK-1 and MEK-1 to stimulate the activity of fusion constructs between the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the activation domains of the transcription factors c-Jun, Elk-1, and VP-16 (pMJun, pMElk-1, and pMVP16, respectively). Active MEKK-1 markedly stimulated the transcriptional activity of pMJun but, at best, was only a modest activator of pMElk-1 in our system (Fig. 3). Conversely, active MEK-1 overexpression potently activated pMElk-1 but not pMJun, consistent with the role of MEK-1 as an activator of the classic MAPK (ERK) signal transduction pathway. Neither of these kinases had a significant effect on the high basal transcriptional activity of the GAL4-VP16 fusion protein. Taken together, these data demonstrate that when carefully expressed at relatively low levels in cultured endothelial cells, constitutively activated forms of both MEKK-1 and MEK-1 consistently demonstrate a pattern of promoter and transcription factor activation that is selective, and under these conditions, only MEKK-1 appears capable of significantly stimulating Smad2-dependent transcription. Considerable experimental evidence supports a model of Smad signaling that involves phosphorylation of certain Smad proteins (e.g. Smad2) on a series of C-terminal serines (termed the SSXS motif) by the kinase present in TGF-β family type 1 receptors (22Abdollah S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of this C-terminal SSXS motif of Smad2 in the transcriptional response to active MEKK-1 described above, we generated two mutant Gal4-Smad2 fusion constructs (pM2*P and pM2C*P) that lack these serine residues. We have previously shown that the full-length Smad2 mutant (pM2*P) is unresponsive to TGF-β in BAEC, whereas the truncated Smad2 mutant (pM2C*P) retains considerable transcriptional activation ability (14Topper J.N. DiChiara M.R. Brown J.D. Williams A.J. Falb D. Collins T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9506-9511Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When these constructs were cotransfected into BAEC together with a constitutively activated form of MEKK-1, the full-length mutant Smad2 was not stimulated (Fig. 4). In contrast, pM2C*P possessed a significant basal level of transcriptional activity that was markedly enhanced by MEKK-1 (Fig. 4). MEK-1 overexpression resulted in no significant stimulation of either Smad2 mutant (Fig.4). To determine if MEKK-1 stimulation of Smad2 transcriptional activity also correlated with a change in its phosphorylation state, we performed a series of in vivo labeling experiments. Cells were transfected with epitope-tagged Smad2 expression constructs along with constitutively activated forms of the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI), MEKK-1, or MEK-1 and metabolically labeled in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. As shown in Fig. 4, Smad2 demonstrated a basal level of phosphorylation when overexpressed. In the presence of either soluble TGF-β or active TβRI, the phosphorylation state of Smad2 increases although the soluble TGF-β ligand stimulus consistently results in a lower level of Smad2 phosphorylation in this system. This is in agreement with previous data describing the role of the TGF-β type I receptor kinase in the phosphorylation of Smad2 (22Abdollah S. Macias-Silva M. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi H. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27678-27685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In the presence of MEKK-1, the phosphorylation state of Smad2 significantly increases as compared with either TβRI or the untreated control, whereas active MEK-1 only modestly increased Smad2 phosphorylation. To determine if the MEKK-1-mediated increase in the phosphorylation state of Smad2 occurs on the SSXS motif known to be the substrate for the TGF-β type I receptor, we examined the phosphorylation of the Smad2 mutant in which the SSXS motif has been deleted (Smad2*P). As with wild type Smad2, when Smad2*P was overexpressed there is a low but detectable level of basal phosphorylation. In contrast to wild type Smad2, however, the phosphorylation state of Smad2*P was not significantly altered by either soluble TGF-β or coexpression of the active TβRI but is enhanced by coexpression of active MEKK-1. These results suggest that MEKK-1 activity can result in the phosphorylation of Smad2 (either by MEKK-1 itself or a yet to be defined kinase) and that this phosphorylation event can occur at a site or sites distinct from the C-terminal SSXS motif that is the site of type 1 receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Given the ability of active MEKK-1 to stimulate the transcriptional activity of Gal4 Smad2C and Smad2C*P (Figs. 2 A and 4 A), the sites of MEKK-1-induced phosphorylation likely reside in the linker region or the C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad2. Although the SSXS motif appears to be dispensable for the MEKK-1-mediated stimulation of Smad2 demonstrated here, these data do not exclude some role for this site in the wild type Smad2 protein stimulated with active MEKK-1. Homo- and heterotypic interactions between Smad2 and Smad4 are thought to be critical for nuclear localization and subsequent stimulation of transcriptional events in response to TGF-β (1Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Massague J.

To determine if MEKK-1 can regulate Smad-Smad interactions, we employed mammalian two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation approaches. In the mammalian two-hybrid system, protein-protein interactions are detected by fusing one test protein to the Gal4 DNA binding domain, fusing a second test protein to the strong transcriptional activation domain of the VP16 protein, and coexpressing these with the GAL4-dependent reporter.

These actions of CD47 are all specifically abrogated by pertussis toxin treatment of cells. Here we report that CD47, its β3 integrin partner, and Gi proteins form a stable, detergent-soluble complex that can be recovered by immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography. Giα is released from this complex by treatment with GTP or AlF4. GTP and AlF4 also reduce the binding of CD47 to its agonist peptide (4N1K) derived from thrombospondin, indicating a direct association of CD47 with Gi. 4N1K peptide causes a rapid decrease in intraplatelet cyclic AMP levels, a Gi-dependent event necessary for aggregation. Finally, 4N1K stimulates the binding of GTPγ35S to membranes from cells expressing IAP and αvβ3. This functional coupling of CD47 to heterotrimeric G proteins provides a mechanistic explanation for the biological effects of CD47 in a wide variety of systems.

Giα is released from this complex by treatment with GTP or AlF4. GTP and AlF4 also reduce the binding of CD47 to its agonist peptide (4N1K) derived from thrombospondin, indicating a direct association of CD47 with Gi. 4N1K peptide causes a rapid decrease in intraplatelet cyclic AMP levels, a Gi-dependent event necessary for aggregation. Finally, 4N1K stimulates the binding of GTPγ35S to membranes from cells expressing IAP and αvβ3. This functional coupling of CD47 to heterotrimeric G proteins provides a mechanistic explanation for the biological effects of CD47 in a wide variety of systems. The thrombospondins (TSPs) 1The abbreviations used are:TSP, thrombospondin; IAP, integrin-associated protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; 7TMS, seven-transmembrane segment; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.1The abbreviations used are:TSP, thrombospondin; IAP, integrin-associated protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; 7TMS, seven-transmembrane segment; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. are a family of multidomain, secreted glycoproteins whose production is differentially regulated during development, wound repair, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and other states in which rapid changes occur in cell proliferation and migration (1Bornstein P.

Many of the apparently diverse effects of TSP proteins can be ascribed to the presence of different complements of receptors for the several domains of TSP on different cell types. Integrin-associated protein (IAP or CD47) is a receptor for the carboxyl-terminal cell binding domain of TSP1, which contains the active CD47 agonist peptide RFYVVMWK (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P.

The Thrombospondin Gene Family. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar), suggesting that all TSP family members use CD47 as a receptor. CD47 is an unusual member of the IgG superfamily of receptors. It consists of a single IgGv extracellular domain and five transmembrane segments terminating in a short, alternatively spliced cytoplasmic tail (5Lindberg F.P. Gresham H.D. Schwarz E. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD47 block signaling events such as the increase in intracellular Ca2+ that occurs when endothelial cells spread on matrix proteins containing RGD sequences (6Schwartz M.A. Brown E.J. Fazeli B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19931-19934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, anti-CD47 mAbs can block the transendothelial (7Cooper D. Lindberg F.P. Gamble G.R. Brown E.J.

CD47 appears to be involved in processes related to integrin-mediated cell spreading (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in a number of cell types.In several biological settings, the binding to CD47 of TSP1, its cell binding domain, or the agonist peptide 4N1K (KRFYVVMWKK) can stimulate the “activation” of integrins to a higher affinity/avidity state. For example, the 4N1K peptide stimulates platelet spreading on fibrinogen-coated surfaces and induces aggregation of platelets via activation of the integrin αIIbβ3 as judged by the enhanced binding of the ligand mimetic mAb PAC-1 (10Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). When C32 human melanoma cells attach to a sparsely coated vitronectin substratum, TSP1 and 4N1K dramatically stimulate the rate of αvβ3-dependent cell spreading (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Further, 4N1K peptide is a chemoattractant of endothelial cells migrating on a gelatin/RGD-containing matrix to which they attach via αvβ3 (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The chemotaxis of vascular smooth muscle cells toward soluble collagen is also stimulated by 4N1K. In this case, α2β1, a collagen receptor, is modulated by CD47 (11Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In each of these systems, the augmentation of integrin function is selectively blocked by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, which disables signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi family.The current study was undertaken to determine if the integrin-CD47 complex might functionally associate with a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. The data presented here indicate that not only does such an association exist, it has functional consequences for the regulation of GTP binding and cyclic AMP levels. Furthermore, a negative heterotropic effect of GTPγS and AlF4 on ligand binding to CD47 suggests that the association of the integrin-CD47 complex with Gi is direct.DISCUSSIONThe coupling of CD47 to Gi protein activation is consistent with our knowledge of the biological actions of TSP and CD47. CD47 functions as a chemotaxis receptor (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) for TSP and 4N1K, and many receptors for chemotactic ligands are 7TMS receptors that are coupled to G (usually Gi) proteins (18Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD47 on platelets is a costimulatory receptor for αIIbβ3activation (10Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Other platelet receptors that costimulate αIIbβ3 (e.g. thrombin, ADP, epinephrine, and thromboxane receptors) are 7TMS receptors coupled to heterotrimeric Gi proteins (19Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Activation of all of these costimulatory receptors in platelets leads to a precipitous drop in intraplatelet cAMP levels, an event essential for further activation and aggregation (19Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, activation of CD47 on platelets results in an immediate and profound decrease in platelet cAMP.Other signaling events thought to emanate from CD47 include Ca2+ fluxes (6Schwartz M.A. Brown E.J. Fazeli B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19931-19934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All of these events are regulated by 7TMS receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins (21Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of these activities have also been implicated in integrin regulation in a variety of systems (22Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Our recent data show that CD47 can associate with and/or modulate integrins of the β1 (11Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and β2 families (23Van Strijp J.A.G. Russell D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J.

In all of these biological systems, the effects of the CD47 agonists 4N1K and TSP-1 on cell spreading, chemotaxis, and adhesion are blocked by pertussis toxin treatment of the cells in question (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,10Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol.

Linder, unpublished data., 3X. Q. Wang and W. A. Frazier, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it appears that different integrin αβ heterodimers associating with CD47 can all couple to Gi protein-dependent pathways. This combinatorial diversity of the integrins that can associate with and be regulated by CD47 may underlie some of the long noted, yet poorly explained, variety of functions attributed to TSP proteins (1Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Lawler J. The Thrombospondin Gene Family. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). The agonist peptide sequence RFYVVMWK is extremely well conserved in all five TSP isoforms; thus, CD47 is probably a receptor for all TSP family members.Aside from the physical association of integrins, CD47, and Gi proteins, other factors support the concept of a functional association in which CD47 communicates directly with Gi. First, treatment of platelets (Fig. 5) with 4N1K initiates a precipitous drop in intraplatelet cyclic AMP levels. This signaling event is common to all of the agonists that activate platelets through G protein-coupled receptors (19Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We have also observed a similar fall in intracellular cyclic AMP in other cell types that respond to TSP-1 stimulation with integrin activation.2 Second, the agonist peptide 4N1K rapidly stimulates GTPγ35S binding to membranes (Fig. 6). These membranes contain few means of generating a signal intermediate between CD47 ligation and Gi activation, since trisphosphate kinase substrates and energy-requiring reactions are eliminated. Last, a direct link between CD47 and Gi is indicated by the negative heterotropic effect of G protein activators (GTPγS and AlF4) on the binding of 4N1K to CD47.Based on the data presented here, we propose a model for CD47 action in which the integrin-CD47 heterotrimer functions as an ad hocserpentine or 7TMS receptor, each of the integrin subunits contributing one transmembrane segment and CD47 contributing its five. Thisheterotrimeric receptor would then activate heterotrimeric G proteins in much the same way as classical 7TMS receptors. This hypothesis garners support from a number of additional observations as follows. (i) The stability of the integrin-CD47 complex is consistent with the formation of a seven-helix bundle within the core of the membrane. The integrin-CD47 complex survives solubilization with several different detergents (including radioimmune precipitation buffer under some conditions) and the extensive washing associated with affinity chromatography. SDS gels of material eluted from the 4N1K columns reveal the integrin chains and CD47 as the major protein-stained bands. 4J. Chung and W. A. Frazier, unpublished data. (ii) Methods that allow detection of CD47-G protein complexes from C32 and platelet membranes detect little or no CD47-G protein complex when applied to red blood cell membranes. 5W. A. Frazier, A.-G. Gao, J. Dimitry, J. Chung, E. J. Brown, F. P. Lindberg, and M. E. Linder, unpublished results. Red cells contain both CD47 and Gi proteins but no integrins (25Rosales C. Gresham H.D. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2759-2764PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the integrin may be necessary to stabilize the CD47-G protein complex. However, there may be integrin-independent actions of CD47 in other cells such as T cells (26Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). (iii) The bundle of seven transmembrane segments need not be covalently connected for even classical G protein-coupled receptors to bind ligand and activate G proteins. Proteolysis of the β-adrenergic receptor results in disconnected transmembrane segments fully capable of signaling (27Rubenstein R.C. Wong S.K. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16655-16659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a functional β2-adrenergic receptor was assembled by expression of two separate proteins, one containing transmembrane segments 1–5 and the other containing segments 6 and 7 (28Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). (iv) Structural features conserved across the large 7TMS receptor superfamily have some homologs in integrin-CD47 heterotrimers. These include the DRY sequence, which occurs at the membrane-cytoplasmic boundary of the third transmembrane segment of many 7TMS receptors, the WXXXL sequence in transmembrane segment IV, and positively charged residue clusters in cytoplasmic domains involved in G protein coupling (29$$Google Scholar). Further experiments employing mutagenesis strategies are under way to map the sites of G protein coupling in CD47 and thus test this hypothesis. (v) The CD47 agonist peptide 4N1K is similar in sequence to peptide ligands for other G protein-coupled receptors. For example, the neurokinin I receptor, which can couple to Gi, binds short peptide ligands (30Krause J.E. Blount P. Sachais B.S. Buck S.H. The Tachykinin Receptors. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 165-218Crossref Google Scholar). Among them is physalaemin with the sequence -KFYGLM, which is similar to the sequence -RFYVVM of 4N1K/TSPs. Taken together, these considerations suggest that a functional heterotrimeric 7TMS unit could be assembled from the α- and β-chains of an integrin associated with the five TM segments of CD47. This model is currently being tested.In summary, we report that the CD47-integrin complex includes one or more heterotrimeric Gi proteins. We provide functional evidence that there is a direct interaction between CD47 and the G protein as evidenced by the following: (i) a negative heterotropic effect of GTP and AlF4 on the binding of 4N1K by CD47; (ii) the fact that 4N1K treatment of cells causes a rapid, pertussis toxin-sensitive drop in intracellular cyclic AMP; and finally (iii) 4N1K specifically stimulates the binding of a radiolabeled GTP analog to membranes in a CD47-dependent fashion. Given the ubiquitous distribution of integrins, CD47, and TSP family members, these results provide a far reaching paradigm for many of the biological actions of TSP proteins and suggest a novel route for G protein activation leading to the modulation of integrin function in many systems.

The chemotaxis of vascular smooth muscle cells toward soluble collagen is also stimulated by 4N1K. In this case, α2β1, a collagen receptor, is modulated by CD47 (11Wang X.Q. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and β2 families (23Van Strijp J.A.G. Russell D.G. Tuomanen E. Brown E.J. Wright S.D. J.

Dimitry, J. Chung, E. J. Brown, F. P. Lindberg, and M. E. Linder, unpublished data. as well as β3 (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In all of these biological systems, the effects of the CD47 agonists 4N1K and TSP-1 on cell spreading, chemotaxis, and adhesion are blocked by pertussis toxin treatment of the cells in question (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,10Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol.

Linder, unpublished data., 3X. Q. Wang and W. A. Frazier, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it appears that different integrin αβ heterodimers associating with CD47 can all couple to Gi protein-dependent pathways. This combinatorial diversity of the integrins that can associate with and be regulated by CD47 may underlie some of the long noted, yet poorly explained, variety of functions attributed to TSP proteins (1Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 2Adams J.C. Tucker R.P. Lawler J. The Thrombospondin Gene Family. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). The agonist peptide sequence RFYVVMWK is extremely well conserved in all five TSP isoforms; thus, CD47 is probably a receptor for all TSP family members.Aside from the physical association of integrins, CD47, and Gi proteins, other factors support the concept of a functional association in which CD47 communicates directly with Gi. First, treatment of platelets (Fig. 5) with 4N1K initiates a precipitous drop in intraplatelet cyclic AMP levels. This signaling event is common to all of the agonists that activate platelets through G protein-coupled receptors (19Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We have also observed a similar fall in intracellular cyclic AMP in other cell types that respond to TSP-1 stimulation with integrin activation.2 Second, the agonist peptide 4N1K rapidly stimulates GTPγ35S binding to membranes (Fig. 6). These membranes contain few means of generating a signal intermediate between CD47 ligation and Gi activation, since trisphosphate kinase substrates and energy-requiring reactions are eliminated. Last, a direct link between CD47 and Gi is indicated by the negative heterotropic effect of G protein activators (GTPγS and AlF4) on the binding of 4N1K to CD47.Based on the data presented here, we propose a model for CD47 action in which the integrin-CD47 heterotrimer functions as an ad hocserpentine or 7TMS receptor, each of the integrin subunits contributing one transmembrane segment and CD47 contributing its five. Thisheterotrimeric receptor would then activate heterotrimeric G proteins in much the same way as classical 7TMS receptors. This hypothesis garners support from a number of additional observations as follows. (i) The stability of the integrin-CD47 complex is consistent with the formation of a seven-helix bundle within the core of the membrane. The integrin-CD47 complex survives solubilization with several different detergents (including radioimmune precipitation buffer under some conditions) and the extensive washing associated with affinity chromatography. SDS gels of material eluted from the 4N1K columns reveal the integrin chains and CD47 as the major protein-stained bands. 4J. Chung and W. A. Frazier, unpublished data. (ii) Methods that allow detection of CD47-G protein complexes from C32 and platelet membranes detect little or no CD47-G protein complex when applied to red blood cell membranes. 5W. A. Frazier, A.-G. Gao, J. Dimitry, J. Chung, E. J. Brown, F. P. Lindberg, and M. E. Linder, unpublished results. Red cells contain both CD47 and Gi proteins but no integrins (25Rosales C. Gresham H.D. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2759-2764PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the integrin may be necessary to stabilize the CD47-G protein complex. However, there may be integrin-independent actions of CD47 in other cells such as T cells (26Reinhold M.I. Lindberg F.P. Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Brown E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). (iii) The bundle of seven transmembrane segments need not be covalently connected for even classical G protein-coupled receptors to bind ligand and activate G proteins. Proteolysis of the β-adrenergic receptor results in disconnected transmembrane segments fully capable of signaling (27Rubenstein R.C. Wong S.K. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16655-16659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a functional β2-adrenergic receptor was assembled by expression of two separate proteins, one containing transmembrane segments 1–5 and the other containing segments 6 and 7 (28Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). (iv) Structural features conserved across the large 7TMS receptor superfamily have some homologs in integrin-CD47 heterotrimers. These include the DRY sequence, which occurs at the membrane-cytoplasmic boundary of the third transmembrane segment of many 7TMS receptors, the WXXXL sequence in transmembrane segment IV, and positively charged residue clusters in cytoplasmic domains involved in G protein coupling (29$$Google Scholar). Further experiments employing mutagenesis strategies are under way to map the sites of G protein coupling in CD47 and thus test this hypothesis. (v) The CD47 agonist peptide 4N1K is similar in sequence to peptide ligands for other G protein-coupled receptors. For example, the neurokinin I receptor, which can couple to Gi, binds short peptide ligands (30Krause J.E. Blount P. Sachais B.S. Buck S.H. The Tachykinin Receptors. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 165-218Crossref Google Scholar). Among them is physalaemin with the sequence -KFYGLM, which is similar to the sequence -RFYVVM of 4N1K/TSPs. Taken together, these considerations suggest that a functional heterotrimeric 7TMS unit could be assembled from the α- and β-chains of an integrin associated with the five TM segments of CD47. This model is currently being tested.In summary, we report that the CD47-integrin complex includes one or more heterotrimeric Gi proteins. We provide functional evidence that there is a direct interaction between CD47 and the G protein as evidenced by the following: (i) a negative heterotropic effect of GTP and AlF4 on the binding of 4N1K by CD47; (ii) the fact that 4N1K treatment of cells causes a rapid, pertussis toxin-sensitive drop in intracellular cyclic AMP; and finally (iii) 4N1K specifically stimulates the binding of a radiolabeled GTP analog to membranes in a CD47-dependent fashion. Given the ubiquitous distribution of integrins, CD47, and TSP family members, these results provide a far reaching paradigm for many of the biological actions of TSP proteins and suggest a novel route for G protein activation leading to the modulation of integrin function in many systems. The coupling of CD47 to Gi protein activation is consistent with our knowledge of the biological actions of TSP and CD47. CD47 functions as a chemotaxis receptor (3Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) for TSP and 4N1K, and many receptors for chemotactic ligands are 7TMS receptors that are coupled to G (usually Gi) proteins (18Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD47 on platelets is a costimulatory receptor for αIIbβ3activation (10Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Other platelet receptors that costimulate αIIbβ3 (e.g. thrombin, ADP, epinephrine, and thromboxane receptors) are 7TMS receptors coupled to heterotrimeric Gi proteins (19Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Activation of all of these costimulatory receptors in platelets leads to a precipitous drop in intraplatelet cAMP levels, an event essential for further activation and aggregation (19Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 695-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, activation of CD47 on platelets results in an immediate and profound decrease in platelet cAMP. Other signaling events thought to emanate from CD47 include Ca2+ fluxes (6Schwartz M.A. Brown E.J. Fazeli B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19931-19934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (4Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All of these events are regulated by 7TMS receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins (21Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of these activities have also been implicated in integrin regulation in a variety of systems (22Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

https://openalex.org/W2138860259,"In photoreceptor cells of the retina, photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal triggers phototransduction. Regeneration of 11-cis-retinal proceeds via a complex set of reactions in photoreceptors and in adjacent retinal pigment epithelial cells where all-trans-retinol is isomerized to 11-cis-retinol. Our results show that isomerizationin vitro only occurs in the presence of apo-cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein. This retinoid-binding protein may drive the reaction by mass action, overcoming the thermodynamically unfavorable isomerization. Furthermore, this 11-cis-retinol/11-cis-retinal-specific binding protein potently stimulates hydrolysis of endogenous 11-cis-retinyl esters but has no effect on hydrolysis of all-trans-retinyl esters. Apo-cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein probably exerts its effect by trapping the 11-cis-retinol product. When retinoid-depleted retinal pigment epithelial microsomes were preincubated with different amounts of all-trans-retinol to form all-trans-retinyl esters and then [3H]all-trans-retinol was added, as predicted, the specific radioactivity of [3H]all-trans-retinyl esters increased during subsequent reaction. However, the specific radioactivity of newly formed 11-cis-retinol stayed constant during the course of the reaction, and it was largely unaffected by expansion of the all-trans-retinyl ester pool during the preincubation. The absence of dilution establishes that most of the ester pool does not participate in isomerization, which in turn suggests that a retinoid intermediate other than all-trans-retinyl ester is on the isomerization reaction pathway.

Photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal is the key reaction that initiates vision (1Wald G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1935; 19: 351-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 11-cis-retinal is coupled via a Schiff base to a Lys residue located in the transmembrane portion of the rod and cone photoreceptor opsins. Photoisomerization triggers conformational changes in these receptors that lead to activation of G-proteins and subsequent initiation of the signaling cascade of reactions, which comprise phototransduction (2Polans A. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 547-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). How all-trans-retinal is isomerized back to 11-cis-retinal is one of the fundamental questions in vision. A pulse of intense light, which occasionally bleaches nearly 100% of our visual pigment, quickly generates 3 mmall-trans-retinal in the photoreceptor cell outer segment. Yet in a matter of minutes (the time constant in humans is 400 s for rhodopsin; Ref. 3Alpern M. Maaseidvaag F. Ohba N. Vision Res. 1971; 11: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the entire cycle of isomerization and pigment regeneration occurs. No free retinals accumulate; all-trans-retinal is either complexed with opsin or reduced and esterified with fatty acids, whereas 11-cis-retinal combines with opsins. Analysis of the visual cycle in mice showed that the concentrations of free retinols and retinals are low compared with the ester pool and with all-trans-retinal and 11-cis-retinal bound to opsins (4Saari J.C. Garwin G.G. Van Hooser J.P. Palczewski K. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutations in any of the genes involved in retinoid metabolism could result in retinal dystrophies and degeneration of photoreceptors. Thus, it is important to understand this metabolic pathway at the molecular level. Understanding of the visual cycle presents several intellectual problems. How does the stereospecific, energy-requiring isomerization occur in a two-cell system, with a substrate that is virtually insoluble in the aqueous phase? By what mechanism does the isomerization product, 11-cis-retinal, leave the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) 1The abbreviations used are:RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; LRAT, lecithin:retinol acyltransferase; apo-rCRALBP, apo-recombinant cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein; MOPS, 3-N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; BSA, bovine serum albumin; BTP, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane.cells and go to the photoreceptor cells where regeneration of visual pigments occurs? What methods are available to characterize the low abundance, membrane-bound enzymes responsible for retinoid regeneration? It is well established that all-trans-retinal, the product of photoisomerization, is reduced to all-trans-retinol in photoreceptor cells before it diffuses to RPE cells (5Dowling J.E. Nature. 1960; 188: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 6Zimmerman W.F. Vision Res. 1974; 14: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It is possible that esterification of all-trans-retinol with fatty acids, catalyzed by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT; Fig. 1, reaction 2) in RPE cells, drives this transcellular diffusion by mass action. Rando and colleagues (7Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) proposed that all-trans-retinyl carboxylic esters are substrates for a membrane-bound isomerohydrolase that catalyzes the reaction in which all-trans- to 11-cis-isomerization is coupled to ester hydrolysis (Fig. 1,reaction 5). 11-cis-retinol formed by this reaction is oxidized to 11-cis-retinal by an NAD/NADP-dependent 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase(s) present in RPE cells (8Zimmerman W.F. Lion F. Deamen F.J.M. Bonting S.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 21: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, reaction 9 and reverse reaction 10) and transported back to the photoreceptor cells where it associates with opsins to form rhodopsins (5Dowling J.E. Nature. 1960; 188: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 9Brown P.K. Wald G. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 865-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 11-cis-retinol can also be esterified by LRAT to 11-cis-retinyl esters (Fig. 1,reaction 8). In addition to this pathway, cones may regenerate their pigments via enzymatic processes that also involve the neural retina (10Goldstein E.B. Vision Res. 1967; 7: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Goldstein E.B. Vision Res. 1970; 10: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Saari J.C. Sporn M.B.

What evidence supports the proposed isomerohydrolase reaction in RPE microsomes? 1) Isomerization occurs at the alcohol oxidation state (13Bernstein P.S. Rando R.R.

Hydrolysis of all-trans-retinyl carboxylic ester was proposed (7Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) to provide the energy needed for isomerization (4 kcal/mol; Ref. 16Rando R.R. Chang A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 2879-2882Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 3) The inhibition of all-trans-retinol esterification by an LRAT inhibitor prevents biosynthesis of 11-cis-retinol, which led to the conclusion that retinyl esters are essential intermediates in 11-cis-retinol formation (17Trehan A. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 4) During isomerization,18O-labeled all-trans-retinol loses its oxygen. In order for this to happen, the bond between C15 and oxygen must be cleaved. The proposed mechanism of isomerization resembles a base catalyzed SN1 alkyl cleavage. In this mechanism, double bond migration and expulsion of the carboxylate occur during addition of a base to C11 of the retinyl ester. Rotation about the C11-C12 single bond is followed by attack of water at C15 and concomitant reshuffling of the double bonds, which locks the retinol in the 11-cis configuration (7Deigner P.S. Law W.C. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Science. 1989; 244: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Despite these studies supporting the isomerohydrolase reaction, there are several puzzling features. 1) Even under the best conditions, isomerization activity is too slow (1.3 pmol/min/mg protein; Ref. 15Fulton B.S. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7938-7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by a factor >100 to account for the amount of 11-cis-retinol produced by this tissue. 2) Enzymatic production of 11-cis-retinol from all-trans-retinyl ester has not been demonstrated in a chemically defined system (13Bernstein P.S. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6473-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Bernstein P.S. Law W.C. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). 3) Enzymatic endothermic isomerization could be driven by mass action if the 11-cis-retinol product is selectively removed from RPE cells. 4) RPE microsomes contain a high concentration of all-trans-retinyl esters (>50%), which are not converted to 11-cis-retinol despite a favorable ΔG. 5) Evidence for participation of retinyl esters in isomerization is indirect. The LRAT inhibitor employed to block retinyl ester formation (17Trehan A. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) could also block formation of an unidentified intermediate different from all-trans-retinyl ester. 6) The stoichiometry of the isomerohydrolase reaction has not been established. 7) A putative isomerohydrolase has defied purification and molecular characterization. It was recently shown that apo-recombinant cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (apo-rCRALBP), which binds 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinal, but not all-trans-retinol and all-trans-retinal (12Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodmann D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar) or albumin, enhances production of 11-cis-retinol in RPE microsomes (18Winston A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This suggests that 11-cis-retinol may act as a potent inhibitor of the isomerase. As shown in the current study, we have also found that apo-rCRALBP greatly promotes retinoid isomerization, which allowed us to carefully study isomerization of all-trans-retinol in RPE microsomes. Our data reveal the complexity of the enzymatic activities in RPE microsomes that utilize retinoids. They also reveal several inconsistencies or oversimplifications in the model in which all-trans-retinyl ester is a substrate for a putative isomerohydrolase. Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse (Schenk Packing Co., Inc., Stanwood, WA). Liver microsomes were isolated from fresh bovine liver employing sucrose density gradients as described for isolation of bovine rod outer segments (19Papermaster D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The coding sequence for 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (20Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) was amplified from bovine retina cDNA by polymerase chain reaction with primer FH51 (5′-CATATGTGGCTGCCTCTGCTGCTG-3′), which placed a NdeI restriction site at the ATG initiation site, and primer FH52 (5′-TTAGTAGACTGTCTGGGCAGG-3′) by 32 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2.5 min. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the pCRTM 2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) (designated pFR425) and sequenced by dyedeoxy terminator sequencing (ABI-Prism, Perkin-Elmer). The expression cassette was then transferred into the baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) by transposition. Sf9 insect cells were transfected with the recombinant bacmid using cationic liposome-mediated transfection (CellFECTIN reagent, Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the expression of recombinant proteins, cells cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 27 °C were harvested by centrifugation at 1200 × g, 72–96 h after infection (21Haeseleer F. Huang J. Lebioda L. Saari J.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21790-21799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A microsomal membrane fraction was obtained from fresh bovine RPE cells as described previously (22Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 190: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction was resuspended in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, containing 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol to a total protein concentration of 3.2 mg/ml determined according to the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (219357) Google Scholar), and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed a typical composition of proteins as observed by others (20Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Barry R.J. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9231-9238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein pattern did not vary significantly between preparations. Significant variations in enzymatic activities of RPE microsome preparations were observed as a function of length of storage at −80 °C. For example, ester hydrolase and isomerase activities declined by ∼50% during 3 months. Thus, <1-month-old preparations were used for all studies. To destroy endogenous retinoids, RPE microsomes (200-μl aliquots) were irradiated in a quartz cuvette for 5 min at 0 °C using a ChromatoUVE-transilluminator (model TM-15 from UVP Inc.). UV treatment produced RPE microsomes without detectable amounts of all retinoids. Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein was prepared from bovine retinas as described previously (25Saari J.C. Bredberg D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Apo-rCRALBP was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity by Ni2+affinity chromatography as described by Crabb et al. (26Crabb J.W. Chen Y. Goldflam S. West K. Kapron J. Redfern C.P.F. Methods in Molecular Biology : Retinoid Protocols. 89. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 91-104Google Scholar). Apo-recombinant cellular retinol-binding protein type I was a generous gift from Dr. David Ong (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). To prevent isomerization and oxidation, all procedures involving retinoids were performed under dim red illumination, and the retinoids were stored under argon at −80 °C. [11,12-3H(N)]All-trans-retinol (NEN Life Science Products) was diluted with all-trans-retinol to give the desired specific radioactivity (550,000 dpm/nmol), and purified on a normal phase HPLC column (Altex, Ultrasphere-Si 5u; 4.6 × 250 mm; flow rate, 1.4 ml/min; 10% ethyl acetate in hexane; Ref. 27Landers G.M. Olson J.A. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 438: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Purified material was dried under argon and stored in vials (0.5–10-nmol aliquots at −80 °C) for up to 3 months. [15-3H(N)]11-cis-retinol (260,000 dpm/nmol) was prepared by reduction of 11-cis-retinal with [3H]NaBH4 and purified by HPLC (28Bridges C.D.B. Fong S.-L. Alvarez R.A. Vision Res. 1980; 20: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Retinoid concentrations in ethanol were determined spectrophotometrically: 11-cis-retinal, 380 nm, ε = 24,935m−1 cm−1; all-trans-retinal, 383 nm, ε = 42,880m−1 cm−1; 11-cis-retinol, 319 nm, ε = 34,890m−1 cm−1; all-trans-retinol, 325 nm, ε = 52,770m−1 cm−1. Rhodopsin concentration was measured as described by McDowell (29McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Substrate, [3H]all-trans-retinol, or [3H]11-cis-retinol (0.5–1 nmol, 260,000–550,000 dpm/nmol), was dried from hexane/ethyl acetate under argon in a 1.5-ml polypropylene tube. 20 μl of BSA (5% solution in 10 mm BTP, pH 7.0) was added followed by 20–30 μl of apo-rCRALBP in 10 mm BTP, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm NaCl to give a final concentration of 25 μm. Next, 10 mm BTP, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2 was added to bring the total volume to 175 μl. For some experiments, additional compounds in the same buffer were added. Finally, 25 μl of RPE microsomes (80 μg of protein) were added to this mixture, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. The reaction mixture (180 μl of 200 μl) was transferred to a new vial containing 300 μl of ice-cold methanol, and 300 μl of hexane was added. The sample was vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged for 4 min at 14,000 ×g to separate organic and aqueous phases. 10 μl of hexane extract was injected into the HPLC column. Retinoids were separated using an HP1050 HPLC (with a single wavelength detector at 325 nm) or an HP1100 HPLC (with a diode array detector 280–400 nm) and a normal phase, narrow bore column (Alltech, Silica 5μ Solvent Miser, 2.1 × 250 mm). An isocratic solvent composed of 10% ethyl acetate in hexane at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min was used. All-trans-retinol and 11-cis-retinol were extracted with hexane in 75–95% yield as determined using [3H]retinol tracers. To estimate the yield of retinyl ester extraction, [3H]all-trans-retinol was incubated for 1 h with RPE microsomes as a source of LRAT. Most of the [3H]all-trans-retinol was converted to hydrophobic [3H]all-trans-retinyl esters, which were extracted in ∼60% yield. All-trans-retinyl esters and 11-cis-retinyl esters were eluted 0.5 min after the solvent front (Fig. 2 A, peak 1), followed by 11-cis-retinol (peak 3) and all-trans-retinol (peak 4), all with a chromatographic yield of >95%. 9-cis-retinol eluted ∼1 min earlier than all-trans-retinol, while 13-cis-retinol eluted on the descending side of the 11-cis-retinol peak (data not shown). Without preincubation, native RPE microsomes contained 0–0.9 nmol of all-trans-retinol/mg of protein, 0–0.3 nmol 11-cis-retinol, 8.6 ± 0.9 nmol all-trans-retinyl esters, and 9.6 ± 1.4 nmol 11-cis-retinyl esters. The amounts of all-trans-retinyl esters and 11-cis-retinyl esters were measured after separation of a mixture of esters from polar retinoids, saponification, and another round of HPLC separation to quantify all-trans-retinol and 11-cis-retinol. The different preparations of RPE microsomes had similar amounts of retinols and retinals; however, they differed in amounts of endogenous esters (with similar ratio between 11-cis-retinyl and all-trans-retinyl esters). In some cases, the ester pool was as high as ∼60 nmol/mg of protein. Isomers of retinal were converted to more polar and less chemically reactive oximes before analysis (32Bridges C.D.B. Alvarez R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 463-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were stopped with the addition of an equal volume of methanol containing sufficient NH2OH to give a final concentration of 10 mm. After 30 min at room temperature, 0.3 ml of hexane was added, and retinoids were extracted as described before. Retinals in RPE microsomes were converted to oximes with >85% yield. The syn-conformer of retinal oximes eluted between the retinyl ester and 11-cis-retinol peaks (Fig. 2 A, peak 2), whereas smaller peaks of the anti-conformer eluted on the descending side of the all-trans-retinol peak (descending site of peak 4in Fig. 2 A). Retinals were present in RPE microsomes at a low level (<0.1 nmol/mg of RPE protein) and were not generated in most of our experimental conditions. Hexane from the extracts containing retinyl esters or from the HPLC purified retinyl ester fractions (typically 200 μl) were evaporated under argon. The residual esters were dissolved in 230 μl of absolute ethanol, and 20 μl of 6 m KOH was added. The sample was incubated for 30 min at 55 °C, diluted with 100 μl of water, chilled on ice for 2 min, and extracted with 300 μl of hexane. The retinoids in hexane were analyzed directly by HPLC. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (208094) Google Scholar) using 12% SDS acrylamide gels in a Hoefer minigel apparatus and low molecular weight markers from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 50% methanol and 7% acetic acid. To test the influence of apo-rCRALBP on formation of 11-cis-retinol from endogenous retinoids, the binding protein was added to a suspension of bovine RPE microsomes and incubated at 37 °C. Retinoids were extracted with hexane and separated on a normal phase silica column under isocratic conditions (Fig. 2 A). Addition of apo-rCRALBP to bovine RPE microsomes resulted in formation of 11-cis-retinol (Fig.3 A, peak 3). To prove that the fraction, which eluted at ∼10 min, contained 11-cis-retinol and not 13-cis-retinol, which co-elutes, 1) UV spectra were recorded continuously during the chromatography (data not shown) and after the fraction was collected. The spectrum showed the smooth ascending and descending limbs (Fig.2 B) characteristic of 11-cis-retinol (31Knowles A. Dartnall H.J.A. Davson H. The Eye. 2B. Academic Press, New York1977: 118Google Scholar) and 2) material in the 10-min fraction was oxidized to the aldehyde by recombinant 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase and incubated with opsin, giving the characteristic spectrum of rhodopsin (498 nm absorption maximum) with a yield of 85% (Fig. 2 C). Note that 13-cis-retinal does not regenerate opsin. We conclude that the 10-min fraction contained >85% 11-cis-retinol. The retinol was bound to soluble apo-rCRALBP as determined after pelleting the RPE microsomes and analyzing the retinol content of the membrane and supernatant phases. When apo-rCRALBP was boiled or omitted, only 11-cis-retinol endogenous to RPE microsomes was found (Fig. 3, B and C). Boiling the RPE microsomes led to even smaller amounts of 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinyl esters (Fig. 3 D) than in unboiled samples without apo-rCRALBP, presumably due to partial destruction of 11-cis-retinoids. Ester analysis showed an apparent ∼20% increase in the amount of 11-cis-retinyl ester in the sample with apo-rCRALBP as compared with the sample that lacked this retinoid-binding protein. This was attributed to higher extraction yields of polar retinoids, as compared with the more hydrophobic esters. As will be described below, most of the 11-cis-retinol formed in the presence of apo-rCRALBP is due to hydrolysis of 11-cis-retinyl esters. To follow the fate of exogenous all-trans-retinol, RPE microsomes were incubated with 2.5 μm[3H]all-trans-retinol. In the first 5 min of the reaction, more than 90% of [3H]all-trans-retinol was converted to [3H]all-trans-retinyl esters by endogenous LRAT (Fig. 4 A). The amount of [3H]all-trans-retinyl esters decreased during reaction as more [3H]11-cis-retinol was formed in the samples containing apo-rCRALBP (Fig. 4 A). During the course of the reaction, the amount of free [3H]all-trans-retinol decreased rapidly to ∼0.12 μm (or ∼0.3 nmol/mg of protein). The decrease in the ester pool coincides with an increase in 11-cis-retinol, suggesting a precursor-product relationship (13Bernstein P.S. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6473-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Bernstein P.S. Law W.C. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1849-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, evidence to be presented under “UV-treated RPE Microsomes” indicates that only a small fraction of the ester pool, if any, participates in the isomerization reaction. Thus, it is more likely that the decrease in the ester pool reflects conversion to all-trans-retinol, subsequent isomerization to 11-cis-retinol, and binding to apo-rCRALBP. Based on hydrolysis of the ester pool and rechromatography of retinols, no detectable amounts of [3H]11-cis-retinyl esters were formed during the reaction (data not shown). Isomerization was measured as the formation of [3H]11-cis-retinol. Based on the initial rate, the isomerization proceeded with formation of 0.09 nmol of 11-cis-retinol/min/mg of protein (Fig.4 A). 2Because RPE microsomes contain endogenous retinoids, the specific radioactivity of the labeled pool is lower than that of the [3H]all-trans-retinol added. The mol amounts given for each retinoid species are calculated from the cpm data using the specific radioactivity of the added [3H]all-trans-retinol and are lower limit values. The amount of [3H]all-trans-retinol converted to [3H]13-cis-retinol was estimated as ∼5 pmol/mg of protein by quantifying the amount of [3H]13-cis-retinol formed at time 0 in samples with boiled apo-rCRALBP. 13-cis-retinol was identified by its specific retention time (0.2 min after 11-cis-retinol) and characteristic UV spectrum (data not shown) (31Knowles A. Dartnall H.J.A. Davson H. The Eye. 2B. Academic Press, New York1977: 118Google Scholar). No additional [3H]13-cis-retinol was formed during incubation with RPE microsomes (data not shown). Thus, 13-cis-retinol was only a small fraction (∼1/200) of 11-cis-retinol and did not significantly affect interpretation of our data. In addition to isomerization, 11-cis-retinol was also produced as a result of hydrolysis of endogenous 11-cis-retinyl esters (described below in Fig. 5). The isomerization plus hydrolysis reactions proceeded with an initial rate of 1.4 nmol/min/mg of protein, which is faster than the rate of isomerization (0.09 nmol of 11-cis-retinol/min/mg of protein), and reached a plateau in ∼60 min to form ∼16 nmol of 11-cis-retinol/mg of RPE protein (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, the concentration of apo-rCRALBP used in the above experiments (25 μm) was sufficient to give maximal effects on 11-cis-retinol and [3H]11-cis-retinol formation. Note that the concentration of CRALBP used in this study is within the in vivo concentration predicted to be ∼25–50 μm(12Saari J.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodmann D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 351-385Google Scholar). The initial formation of [3H]all-trans-retinyl esters was unaffected by the presence of active apo-rCRALBP or boiled apo-rCRALBP. To measure retinyl ester hydrolase activity directly without isomerization, exogenously added [3H]11-cis-retinol was converted to 11-cis-retinyl esters, by LRAT present in RPE microsomes, before apo-rCRALBP was added. Most of the exogenously added 11-cis-retinol (∼90%) was converted to the esters. Addition of apo-rCRALBP led to the release of 11-cis-retinol and [3H]11-cis-retinol (Fig.5, inset A) with an initial rate of 0.7 nmol/min/mg of protein. If isomerization would contribute significantly to the total amounts of 11-cis-retinol formed, it is expected that with time, more 11-cis-retinol would be converted, diluting [3H]11-cis-retinol formed from the [3H]11-cis-retinyl ester pool. The ratio of [3H]11-cis-retinol to total 11-cis-retinol, however, remained constant during the reaction (Fig. 5, inset B), suggesting only a small contribution of the isomerization of endogenous all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol formation. No radioactivity was detected in the all-trans-retinol peak in the presence or absence of apo-rCRALBP. All together, the results show that isomerization of all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol is essentially an irreversible reaction in RPE microsomes under the conditions studied. In control experiments, liver microsomes were used to assay isomerase activity in the presence of apo-rCRALBP and exogenously added [3H]"

In this article we show that PKCζ but not PKCα and PKCδ can co-immunoprecipitate PKB from CHO cell lysates. Association of PKB with PKCζ was also found in COS-1 cells transiently expressing PKB and PKCζ, and moreover we found that this association is mediated by the AH domain of PKB. Stimulation of COS-1 cells with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) resulted in a decrease in the PKB-PKCζ interaction. The use of kinase-inactive mutants of both kinases revealed that dissociation of the complex depends upon PKB activity. Analysis of the activities of the interacting kinases showed that PDGF-induced activation of PKCζ was not affected by co-expression of PKB. However, both PDGF- and p110-CAAX-induced activation of PKB were significantly abolished in cells co-expressing PKCζ. In contrast, co-expression of a kinase-dead PKCζ mutant showed an increased induction of PKB activity upon PDGF treatment. Downstream signaling of PKB, such as the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3, was also reduced by co-expression of PKCζ. A clear inhibitory effect of PKCζ was found on the constitutively active double PKB mutant (T308D/S473D).

Overexpression of PKB family members has been correlated with different cancers such as breast cancer and some pancreatic and ovarian cancers (2Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F.

Recently, PKB has been found to yield an anti-apoptotic signal, which is crucial for cell survival in both fibroblasts and neuronal cells (8Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriquez-Vicania P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C.

Other reports have indicated a role for PKB in the regulation of glycogen synthesis by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (10Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar, 11van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M.T. J. Biol.

In addition, glucose uptake and metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes have been shown to be regulated by PKB by mediating the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (12Kohn A.D.

Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a role for PKB has been described in the regulation of protein synthesis through indirect activation of the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) (14Burgering B.M.T. Cofer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). PKB comprises a NH2-terminal Akt homology (AH) domain of 148 amino acids, a catalytic domain of 264 amino acids showing high homology with cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) and a short COOH-terminal tail of 68 amino acids. A pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of 106 amino acids is present within the AH domain. Treatment of cells with different growth factors, insulin, or phosphatase inhibitors results in rapid activation of PKB (10Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar, 14Burgering B.M.T. Cofer P.J.

A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Also heat shock, hyperosmolarity stress, and intracellular cAMP elevation were shown to activate PKB in vivo (16Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 91: 7639-7643Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Growth factor and insulin-induced activation is almost completely prevented by overexpression of a dominant negative form of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (Δp85) or by pretreatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 (14Burgering B.M.T. Cofer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a PDGF receptor mutant that is not able to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity also fails to activate PKB (14Burgering B.M.T. Cofer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar, 18Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that insulin and growth factor-induced signals leading to PKB activation are transduced via the PI 3-kinase pathway. In contrast, stress, okadaic acid, and cAMP induced activation of PKB is PI 3-kinase independent since wortmannin is unable to block this pathway of PKB activation (15Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 16Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, in vivo, PKB can be activated via at least two pathways: a PI 3-kinase dependent and a PI 3-kinase independent pathway. The mechanism of PKB activation through the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway is not completely understood. In vitro, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), one of the lipid products generated by PI 3-kinase, stimulates PKB activity by binding to the PH domain (19Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 20Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKB activation was shown to be dependent on its phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 (21Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr308 is mediated by an upstream kinase, called phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1), while the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Ser473, already designated as PDK-2, remains to be identified (22Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 23Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R.J. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism for PKB activation is that PI(3,4)P2 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) generated by PI 3-kinase recruit PKB to the plasma membrane where Thr308 is phosphorylated by PDK-1 and Ser473 by PDK-2 (24Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The activation of PKB by both PI(3,4)P2 and PDK-1 and -2 makes the activation of PKB a multistep process. Initial studies by Konishi and co-workers (25Konishi H. Shinomura T. Kuroda S. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem . Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Konishi H. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showed that the α, δ, and ζ isoforms of PKC are able to interact with PKB in vitro. In this paper we show that PKB can only be co-immunoprecipiatated with PKCζ and in addition we found that this interaction is under control of PKB activity. To understand the possible function of the PKB-PKCζ association, we investigated whether the interacting kinases regulate the activity of the respective kinases. Although no effect was found of PKB on PKCζ activity, both PDGF- and p110-CAAX-induced activation of PKB is abolished by co-expression of PKCζ. The activity of GSK-3, a downstream target of PKB is also affected by PKCζ co-expression. Finally, we found that the constitutive active PKB mutant (T308D/S473D) is inhibited by PKCζ in a PDGF-independent fashion. The results obtained establish PKCζ as a negative regulator of PKB activity. The pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) constructs containing HA-tagged wild-type bovine PKBα, PKBα “kinase dead” (K179A), PKBDD and PKBAA were a gift from Dr. Paul Coffer (Department of Pulmonary Diseases, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands). The DNA fragments encoding the AH domain of PKB (PKBAH) and PKB lacking the AH domain (PKBΔAH) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned as a BamHI/KpnI fragment into the eukaryotic expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing a HA epitope tag (pBK-HA). p110-CAAX, p110-R916P-CAAX (PLAP-CAAX), and the pMT2SM constructs containing Myc-tagged wild-type mouse PKCζ and Myc-tagged kinase-dead PKCζ have been described earlier (27Van Dijk M.C.M. Muriana F.J.G. Van der Hoeven P.C.J. De Wit J. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Didichenko S.A. Tilton B.

COS-1 and CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 7% CO2. Transient transfections in COS-1 cells were performed at 40% confluency by a DEAE-dextran method. In short, DNA was diluted in 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline and added to the cells. Following a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, medium containing 80 μm chloroquine (Sigma) was added and the cells were incubated for 2.5–3 h at 37 °C and subsequently shocked with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) for 2.5 min. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were serum starved for 16 h. Stimulated and unstimulated cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Lysates were centrifuged and supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h at 4 °C. HA-PKB was immunoprecipitated from aliquots (200 μg of protein) of the precleared extracts using 6 μg of the monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma), whereas Myc-PKCζ was immunoprecipitated from precleared lysates by 1 μg of the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Endogenous PKCζ was immunoprecipitated from CHO cells using a polyclonal PKCζ antibody (27Van Dijk M.C.M. Muriana F.J.G. Van der Hoeven P.C.J. De Wit J. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads, whereas PKCα and PKCδ were immunoprecipitated by monoclonal PKCα and PKCδ antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), respectively. Normal rabbit serum was used as control antiserum for the co-immunoprecipitation studies. Immunoprecipitations were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with low salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) prior to Western blot analysis or twice with high salt buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5m LiCl) and twice with low salt buffer prior to activity measurements. Cell extracts and immunoprecipitations were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). Membranes were blocked in 5% Protifar (Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. For detection of the Myc-tagged or HA-tagged proteins the membranes were incubated with the monoclonal 9E10 or 12CA5 antibody in 1% protifar in TBST buffer subsequently followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Detection of endogenous PKB was performed using the monoclonal PKB/Akt antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or the polyclonal Akt-C20 (Santa Cruz Biochemical Corp., Santa Cruz, CA) subsequently followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or donkey anti-goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibody, respectively. Endogenous PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCζ were detected using the monoclonal PKCα, PKCδ (Transduction Laboratories), or polyclonal PKCζ antibody followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For PKB detection with the phospho-specific Akt (Ser473) antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with the polyclonal antibody followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products Inc., Boston, MA). For quantification of protein amounts a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software were used. PKCζ activity was measured with the ε-peptide (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV) as substrate as described previously (27Van Dijk M.C.M. Muriana F.J.G. Van der Hoeven P.C.J. De Wit J. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4799-4805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were incubated with 45 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 50 μm ε-peptide, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham International, United Kingdom). PKB activity was assayed with the Crosstide peptide (GRPRTSSFAEG) as a substrate (10Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were incubated with 45 μl of kinase assay mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 μm Crosstide peptide, 1 μm of the specific peptide inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKI) (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland), 50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). GSK-3 activity was measured using the GS peptide (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQSEDEEE) (29Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with 60 μm GS peptide, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C under continuous shaking, reactions were stopped by addition of 200 mm EDTA. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 25% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants containing the phosphorylated peptide were spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose filters (Whatman), washed three times with 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid, and analyzed by Cerenkov counting. Control experiments revealed that phosphorylation of the GS peptide is highly specific for GSK-3β and that neither PKB nor PKCζ is able to phosphorylate the peptide. 2R. P. Doornbos, unpublished observations.Under the conditions used the kinase assays are linear for at least 60 min. In vitrobinding studies have recently shown that PKB associates with the α, δ, and ζ isoforms of PKC (5Konishi H. Kuroda S. Tanaka M. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the possible interaction of these PKC isoforms with PKB in vivo, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using CHO cells. Endogenous PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCζ were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and Western blot analysis shows that similar amounts of the three PKC isoforms were precipitated (Fig.1 B). The presence of PKB was analyzed using Western blot detection and, as shown in Fig. 1A, PKB is present in the PKCζ but not in the PKCα and PKCδ immunoprecipitates. As a control, normal rabbit serum was incubated with lysates of CHO cells and only a faint band is visible possibly reflecting aspecific binding to the non-immune control (Fig. 1A). The binding of PKB with PKCζ was subsequently investigated in more detail by transient expression of HA-tagged PKB and Myc-tagged PKCζ (Myc-PKCζ) in COS-1 cells. HA-PKB was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody against the HA-tag (12CA5) and co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-PKCζ was observed on Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against the Myc-tag (9E10) (Fig. 1 C). To identify the domain of PKB that is necessary for the association with PKCζ in vivo, we generated HA-tagged PKB constructs lacking the AH domain (HA-PKBΔAH) or comprising the AH domain (HA-PKBAH). Co-expression of these constructs with PKCζ revealed that the interaction of PKB with PKCζ depends entirely on the presence of the AH domain. This observation is in agreement with the in vitro data obtained by Konishi and co-workers (26Konishi H. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PKCζ could not be observed on a Western blot when PKBΔAH was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing PKBΔAH and PKCζ (Fig. 1 C). As a control, the expression levels of the transiently expressed proteins were analyzed in total cell lysates and similar expression levels were found for all constructs (Fig. 1 C). In conclusion, our observations clearly demonstrate that PKCζ associates with PKBin vivo. Furthermore, the in vivo association of PKB and PKCζ is mediated via the AH domain of PKB. To investigate the effect of PDGF on the PKB-PKCζ complex, COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with both HA-PKB and Myc-PKCζ. The cells were serum-starved overnight and either left untreated or stimulated with 25 ng/ml PDGF for 10 min. PKB was immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitation of PKCζ was determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A). Upon PDGF treatment the interaction decreased with approximately 75% indicating that PDGF induces the dissociation of the complex. As previously reported, PDGF induces the activation of PKB and, albeit to a lesser extent, also of PKCζ (27Van Dijk M.C.M. Muriana F.J.G. Van der Hoeven P.C.J. De Wit J. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In order to establish whether the activity of these kinases is involved in PKB·PKCζ complex formation, we analyzed the effect of kinase-dead mutants of both PKB and PKCζ. In repeated experiments expression of kinase-dead PKCζ resulted in a reduction of complex formation which, however, can be explained by the reduction in PKCζkd expression (Fig.2 B). In contrast, expression of kinase-dead PKB resulted in a dramatic increase in the PKB-PKCζ interaction (Fig. 2 A). This demonstrates that PKB activity induces the dissociation of the complex, whereas PKCζ activity seems not to be required for the regulation of the complex. As a control experiment, we incubated the same blot with anti-HA antibodies showing that similar amounts of HA-PKB were precipitated (Fig. 2 B). In order to establish the physiological role for the PKB-PKCζ interaction we investigated the effect on the activity of both kinases. To test a possible role for PKB on PKCζ activity, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with PKCζ alone or co-transfected with PKB. After stimulation of the cells with PDGF, PKCζ was immunoprecipitated and its activity was measured by an in vitro kinase assay using the ε-peptide as a substrate (28Ways D.K. Cook P.P. Webster C. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4799-4805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PDGF stimulation resulted in an increase of PKCζ activity (Fig. 3) which is in agreement with previous studies (27Van Dijk M.C.M. Muriana F.J.G. Van der Hoeven P.C.J. De Wit J. Schaap D. Moolenaar W.H. Van Blitterswijk W.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Co-expression of PKB did not affect activation of PKCζ upon PDGF treatment, demonstrating that PKB has no effect on the PDGF-induced activity of PKCζ (Fig. 3). To demonstrate that PKCζ and not PKB activity accounts for the observed change in ε-peptide phosphorylation we co-transfected PKCζ with kinase-dead PKB. Similar results were obtained as with wild-type PKB showing that PKB activity does not influence the observed change in ε-peptide phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Using the same approach, we investigated whether PKCζ has an effect on PKB activity. For these experiments, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type PKB or co-transfected with wild-type PKB and either wild-type PKCζ or kinase-dead PKCζ. After PDGF treatment, PKB was immunoprecipitated and its activity was measured by an in vitro kinase assay using Crosstide as substrate (10Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Activity measurements showed that PKB activity was increased more than 3-fold upon stimulation of the cells with PDGF (Fig.4A). However, PDGF-induced PKB activation was almost completely abolished when PKB was co-expressed with wild-type PKCζ (Fig. 4 A). This indicates that PKCζ is able to inhibit PDGF induced activity of PKB. In contrast, PKB activity was increased more than 7-fold by PDGF when the cells were co-transfected with the kinase-dead mutant of PKCζ (Fig.4 A). These data clearly show that PKB activity is negatively regulated by PKCζ. An important step in the full activation of PKB is the phosphorylation of residues Thr308 and Ser473 by PDK1 and -2 (21Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). To establish whether the inhibition of PKB activation by PKCζ is due to a reduced increase in the phosphorylation of PKB we used a polyclonal antibody against PKB when phosphorylated on Ser473. As shown in Fig. 5,A and C, PDGF treatment induced an significant increase (p < 0.05) in Ser473phosphorylation when PKB was the only transfected protein in COS-1 cells. In contrast, no significant increase in Ser473phosphorylation was observed upon PDGF treatment when PKCζ was co-expressed with PKB (Fig. 5, A and C). As a control, expression levels of total PKB protein were determined and as shown in Fig. 5 B the amount of PKB in all lanes was equal indicating that the observed differences in phosphorylated PKB on Ser473 was not due to differences in PKB expression levels. Taken together, from these experiments it can be concluded that PKCζ is a negative regulator of PDGF-induced PKB activity. As already mentioned, both PKB and PKCζ are activated by PDGF most probably through the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. In order to find out whether the negative regulation of PKB by PKCζ is mediated by the PI 3-kinase/PKB signal transduction pathway we expressed a catalytically active membrane-targeted PI 3-kinase (p110-CAAX) together with PKB in COS-1 cells. p110-CAAX caused a significant, ligand-independent increase in PKB activity (Fig.6 A). In contrast, a catalytically inactive membrane-targeted PI 3-kinase (PLAP-CAAX) was unable to do so (Fig. 6 A), which is in agreement with the work of Didichenko and co-workers (30Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Balmer H.K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Co-expression of PKCζ with p110-CAAX and PKB reduced the p110-CAAX-induced PKB activity with almost 80% (Fig. 6 A). Interestingly co-expression of PKCζ with PLAP-CAAX and PKB also resulted in a decrease in basal PKB activity (Fig. 6 A). These observations demonstrate that basal activity of PKCζ is already sufficient to inhibit PKB. It has previously been shown that GSK-3 is phosphorylated and inactivated by PKB in vitro and in vivo (10Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M.

In order to test whether this downstream effector of PKB is also affected by co-expression of PKCζ, we measured GSK-3 activities in cells expressing PKB alone, PKB and PKCζ, and PKB and kinase-dead PKCζ using a peptide phosphorylation assay (29Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As expected, upon treatment of cells with PDGF the GSK-3 activity is decreased (Fig.4 B). However, when PKB is co-expressed with PKCζ the PDGF-induced reduction in GSK-3 activity is completely overcome (Fig.4 B).

https://openalex.org/W2071467059,"The myeloid cell-derived calcium-binding murine protein, S100A8, is secreted to act as a chemotactic factor at picomolar concentrations, stimulating recruitment of myeloid cells to inflammatory sites. S100A8 may be exposed to oxygen metabolites, particularly hypochlorite, the major oxidant generated by activated neutrophils at inflammatory sites. Here we show that hypochlorite oxidizes the single Cys residue (Cys41) of S100A8. Electrospray mass spectrometry and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that low concentrations of hypochlorite (40 μm) converted 70–80% of S100A8 to the disulfide-linked homodimer. The mass was 20,707 Da, 92 Da more than expected, indicating additional oxidation of susceptible amino acids (possibly methionine). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation of differentiated HL-60 granulocytic cells generated an oxidative burst that was sufficient to efficiently oxidize exogenous S100A8 within 10 min, and results implicate involvement of the myeloperoxidase system. Moreover, disulfide-linked dimer was identified in lung lavage fluid of mice with endotoxin-induced pulmonary injury. S100A8 dimer was inactive in chemotaxis and failed to recruit leukocytes in vivo. Positive chemotactic activity of recombinant Ala41S100A8 indicated that Cys41 was not essential for function and suggested that covalent dimerization may structurally modify accessibility of the chemotactic hinge domain. Disulfide-dependent dimerization may be a physiologically significant regulatory mechanism controlling S100A8-provoked leukocyte recruitment.

Murine S100A8, also known as CP-10 (chemotactic protein, 10 kDa), myeloid-related protein 8, and calgranulin A (1Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem.

Hilt D.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 437-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Most S100 proteins appear to function as intracellular calcium-modulated proteins that may regulate diverse functions including cell growth, differentiation, energy metabolism, cytoskeletal-membrane interactions, and kinase activities (1Schafer B.W.

Extracellular activities have been ascribed to at least five family members, and since our description of the chemotactic activity of S100A8, similar functions for S100A2 (S100L, chemotactic for guinea pig eosinophils) and S100A7 (psoriasin, chemotactic for human CD4+ T lymphocytes and neutrophils) have been reported (4Komada T.

In contrast to the classical chemoattractants such as fMet-Leu-Phe, C5a, and the chemokines, S100A8 and TGF-β affect cytoskeletal actin polymerization and cell migration without causing degranulation and activation (17Cornish C.J.

Nenortas E. Beckett D. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1577-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, the extracellular neurotrophic and mitogenic activities of S100B are dependent on redox status and inter- or intrachain disulfide bond formation (6Barger S.W. Wolchok S.R. Van Eldik L.

Roth J. Burwinkel F. Vollmer E. Bocker W. Sorg C. Transplantation. 1994; 58: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our recent experiments confirm the propensity of murine S100A8 to form non-covalent dimers in solution, and this property is independent of calcium and covalent disulfide bond formation (24Raftery M.J. Geczy C.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Murine S100A8 comprises 88 amino acids with a single cysteine residue at position 41 (14Lackmann M. Cornish C.J. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7499-7504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that the monomeric (non-covalent dimeric) form of S100A8 was functional, whereas the oxidized homodimer was chemotactically inactive. S100A8 was readily oxidized by hypochlorite, a myeloperoxidase product generated by activated neutrophils and macrophages and implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation and atherogenesis (25Dean R. Fu S. Stocker R. Davies M. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar, 26Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The efficiency by which stimulated neutrophils oxidized exogenous S100A8 suggests that the redox status of Cys41 of S100A8 may represent a physiologically relevant regulatory mechanism controlling S100A8-provoked leukocyte recruitmentin vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRPMI 1640 and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), HBSS (without CaCl2 and MgCl2), bovine serum albumin, sodium hypochlorite, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. T4 DNA ligase, restriction enzymes, and Complete protease inhibitors were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany), and thioglycollate was from Difco.S100A8 AnaloguesPreparation and isolation of recombinant (r)S100A8 is described in detail (27Iismaa S.E.

Alewood, manuscript in preparation. All S100A8 preparations were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS analysis. Recombinant proteins differed from their synthetic and native counterparts by an additional dipeptide, Gly-Ser, at the N terminus (27Iismaa S.E. Hu S. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and these residues were designated as positions −2 and −1.For Ala41S100A8 the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the double take double-stranded mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Briefly, plasmid pS100A8-9 containing a 286-base pair BamHI fragment encoding the S100A8 cDNA (27Iismaa S.E. Hu S. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was linearized at the unique ScaI restriction enzyme site in the ampicillin resistance gene, biotinylated at the 3′ ends with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, purified from free biotinylated nucleotide using avidin-coated beads, and separated into single strands by alkali denaturation. A ScaI extension primer complementary to the terminal 18 bases of the 3′ end of the template strand (5′-ACTCACCAGTCACAGAAA-3′) and the Ala mutagenic primer complementary to the same strand and containing base changes that alter codon specificity from Cys41 to Ala41(5′ACAAACTGAGGAGCCTCAGT AGTGAC-3′) were annealed to the captured template strand and extended with T7 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. The strands were denatured using NaOH, and the mutant strand was collected in the supernatant. A ScaI bridging primer containing 18 bases complementary to the ScaI extension primer and 6 bases complementary to the first 6 bases on the other side of the ScaI site (5′-TTTCTGTGACTGGTGAGTACTCAA-3′) was annealed to the mutant strand thereby recircularizing the strand and extended with T7 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. The double-stranded closed circular molecules incorporating the mutation in both strands were transformed into XL-1 Blue Escherichia coli(Stratagene). The sequence of the mutated cDNA insert of one such recombinant, designated pS100A8-9.1, was verified by the chain termination method of DNA sequencing prior to subcloning into theBamHI site of the Glutagene pGEX2T bacterial expression vector (AMRAD Pharmacia Biotech, Melbourne, Australia) to produce the recombinant expression plasmid pAla41S100A8.High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)All liquid chromatographic separations were performed using a non-metallic LC 625 HPLC system and UV absorbance monitored at 214 and 280 nm with a Waters 490 UV/visible detector. Samples were analyzed by C4 RP-HPLC using a Vydac 300 Å, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, C4 reverse phase column and gradient of 25–70% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at 1 ml/min over 30 min. Fractions with majorA 214 nm were collected manually.Mass SpectrometryElectrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectra were acquired using a single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (Platform, VG-Fisons Instruments, Manchester, UK). Samples (∼50 pmol, 10 μl) were injected into a moving solvent (10 μl/min; 50:50 water:acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) using a Phoenix 40 HPLC pump (VG-Fisons Instruments) coupled directly to the ionization source via a fused silica capillary (50 μm × 40 cm). The source temperature was 50 °C, and nitrogen was used as the nebulizer and drying gas. Sample droplets were ionized at a positive potential of approximately 3 kV and transferred to the mass analyzer with a cone voltage (sample cone to skimmer lens voltage) of 50 V. The peak width at half-height was 1 Da. Spectra were acquired in multi-channel acquisition mode over the mass range 700 to 1800 Da in 5 s and then calibrated with horse heart myoglobin (Sigma). Some spectra were recorded using a HP LC/MSD 1100 mass spectrometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) using similar conditions.Oxidation of S100A8Hypochlorite OxidationRecombinant S100A8, Ala41S100A8, S100A9, hS100A8 (purified from human PMN) 4M. J. Raftery and C. L. Geczy, submitted for publication. and bovine S100B (Sigma) were used. Generally, 100 μg of S100 protein was reconstituted with 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.5 (final concentration 10−5m). Hypochlorite, from a stock solution of 45 mm (determined as described previously (40Hazell L.J. van den Berg J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar)) was diluted in PBS, pH 7.5, to working solutions of 200 μmto 20 mm. S100 proteins were treated with increasing concentrations of hypochlorite (10–100 μm) for 15 min on ice before an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample mixture (±100 mm DTT) was added, and samples were heated (100 °C, 3 min) and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and silver staining or Western blotting using anti-S100A8. Alternatively, after 15 min, samples were fractionated by RP-HPLC and the eluted peaks analyzed by mass spectrometry.Copper OxidationRecombinant S100A8 (100 μl of 1 mg/ml) purified from C4 RP-HPLC (29Raftery M.J. Harrison C.A. Alewood P. Jones A. Geczy C.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 312: 285-293Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was reduced in volume by two-thirds (Speedvac; Savant, Farmingdale, NY). An equal volume of ammonium bicarbonate (0.1 m) was added prior to the addition of copper sulfate (50 mm) to a final concentration of 2 mm. After 30 min at room temperature S100A8 homodimer was separated from residual monomer by C4 RP-HPLC.PMA-induced Oxidation of S100A8 by Myeloid CellsThe human promyelocytic cell line, HL-60, was differentiated to the granulocytic lineage with Me2SO (1.25%) for 5 days as described (30Yu H. Suchard S.J. Nairn R. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15719-15724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). dHL-60 cells were washed twice in HBSS or Ca2+-free HBSS and resuspended (107 cells/ml) in the same solutions. Alternatively, murine PMN (107 cells/ml) elicited 6 h after intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate as described (31Ryan J. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2110-2117PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Recombinant S100A8 (final concentration 10−5 or 5 × 10−7m) was added to cell suspensions (106 cells) that were subsequently activated with PMA (1 μg/ml) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The rate of PMA-induced oxidation of S100A8 was measured by incubating dHL-60 cells with PMA (1 μg/ml) for 1–30 min. After incubation, an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample mixture was added, and samples were analyzed by 10% non-reducing SDS-PAGE and silver staining or Western blot analysis using anti-S100A8. In some experiments sodium azide (10 nmto 100 μm) was included. All results shown are representative of at least three experiments.Induction of LPS-induced Pulmonary InjuryMale Quakenbush Swiss mice, aged 8 weeks, were from the Animal Breeding and Holding Unit, University of New South Wales and experimental procedures complied with the requirements of the University's Animal Care and Ethics Committee (reference number 96/124).Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Difco, E. coli 055:B5), 10 μg/60 μl, was placed on the nares and introduced into the lung by inhalation according to the method of Szarka et al. (52Szarka R.J. Wang N. Gordon L. Nation P. Smith R.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Control mice received 60 μl of PBS, pH 7.2. Each group comprised four mice. Animals were killed by exsanguination after an overdose of pentobarbital at 48 h after intranasal instillation. The lungs were perfused with 0.9% saline under a pressure of 40 cm of H2O for 60 s to remove blood from the capillary bed. The trachea was then cannulated with a blunted 19-gauge needle and lungs lavaged. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained by washing the lungs three times repeatedly with 1 ml of PBS containing 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). NEM was included to prevent artifactual formation of disulfide-linked S100A8 during isolation. Cells were pelleted (4 °C, 1200 rpm, 10 min), and in agreement with earlier studies (52Szarka R.J. Wang N. Gordon L. Nation P. Smith R.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), this procedure yielded 150–250-fold increases in neutrophil numbers after 48 h. Supernatants were processed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.Chemotaxis AssayS100A8 analogues (10 μg) lyophilized (Speedvac) with glycerol (5 μl) were stored at −80 °C. Reconstitution was with 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 990 μl RPMI 1640 to give a 10−6m stock solution that was serially diluted in RPMI 1640, 0.1% bovine serum albumin immediately before use. The murine monocytoid cell line WEHI 265 was used as responding cell (27Iismaa S.E. Hu S. Kocher M. Lackmann M. Harrison C.A. Thliveris S. Geczy C.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and chemotaxis was performed in a 48-well microchemotaxis Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe Inc., Bethesda, MD) as described (15Lackmann M. Rajasekariah P. Iismaa S.E. Jones G. Cornish C.J. Hu S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2981-2991PubMed Google Scholar). Endotoxin-activated mouse serum (EAMS, 5%) was used as a positive control. Coomassie Blue/crystal violet was used to stain the membranes and migrating cells quantitated (10× objective) using planimetry measurements obtained from image analysis (Wild-Leitz, Lane Cove, Australia). Data were analyzed using the Student's t test (* p < 0.01 versus controls).Leukocyte Recruitment in VivoS100A8 analogues (30 μg) were reconstituted in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, neutralized to pH 6.5 with 0.1m sodium phosphate, and made to 1 ml with phenol red-free HBSS (PRF-HBSS) containing 0.1% ovalbumin (5× crystalline, Calbiochem). S100A8 solutions were held overnight at 4 °C and subsequently diluted with 2 ml of PRF-HBSS, 0.1% ovalbumin (S100A8 final concentration 10−6m). Specific pathogen-free female Balb/c mice (6–8 weeks) were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of S100A8 (final concentration 10 μg per mouse), or analogues, or vehicle control solution, sacrificed after 16 h (maximal leukocyte recruitment occurred between 16 and 24 h (32Lau W.

However, the demonstration that disulfide formation (whether inter- or intrachain) is required for the extracellular neurotrophic and mitogenic activities of S100B (6Barger S.W. Wolchok S.R. Van Eldik L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1160: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Scotto C. Mely Y. Oshima H. Garin J. Cochet C. Chambaz E. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3901-3908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggests that S100 proteins contain specific amino acids that are prone to oxidation, and that this reaction may selectively regulate bioactivity (35Yao Y. Jas G. Kuczera K. Williams T. Schoneich C. Squier T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2767-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In view of the sensitivity of cysteine residues to oxidation, and of their potentially important functional role in defining target protein-binding sites in S100 proteins (36Baudier J. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5876-5883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Johnsson N. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14464-14468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our strategy was to determine whether oxidation of the single Cys residue at position 41 modified murine S100A8 function.PMNs secrete granular enzymes and oxygen metabolites following exposure to activating agents such as PMA and to classical chemoattractants (38Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3822) Google Scholar). The two-electron (non-radical) oxidant hypochlorite is a major product of stimulated neutrophils that produce superoxide radicals which dismute to H2O2 and are then converted into hypohalous acids by myeloperoxidase in the presence of halides (25Dean R. Fu S. Stocker R. Davies M. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Hypochlorite-modified proteins are implicated in inflammatory processes. For example, human α1-proteinase inhibitor contains a critical methionine (position 358) in its reactive center, which is susceptible to OCl− oxidation (39Ossana P.J. Test S.T. Matheson N.R. Regiani S. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), rendering it an ineffective inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (39Ossana P.J. Test S.T. Matheson N.R. Regiani S. Weiss S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Hypochlorite-oxidized proteins have also been identified in human atherosclerotic lesions (26Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and OCl− can transform lipoprotein into a high uptake form without significant lipid oxidation. ApoB-100, the single major protein associated with low density lipoprotein, is the main target for this oxidant (40Hazell L.J. van den Berg J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) which becomes aggregated and cross-linked.S100A8 and S100A9 are constitutive cytoplasmic proteins in neutrophils and are released in high concentrations at inflammatory sites (11Kocher M. Kenny P.A. Farram E. Abdul M.K. Finlay J.J. Geczy C.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1342-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kumar R.K. Harrison C.A. Cornish C.J. Kocher M. Geczy C.L.

Rheumatol. 1994; 21: 733-738PubMed Google Scholar) making them potential candidates for OCl−-mediated oxidation. Indeed, S100A8 oxidation to the disulfide-linked dimer increased from 20% in the presence of 10 μm hypochlorite to 70–80% with 40 μm hypochlorite (Fig. 1 A). The physiological significance of this mechanism is highlighted by the observation that activated neutrophils (106) can generate as much as 124 μm hypochlorite within 2 h of stimulation (42Wu S. Boyer C. Pizzo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20627-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Covalent disulfide bond formation in response to OCl− was confirmed by mass spectral analysis (Table I), by reduction of dimer to monomer with 100 mm DTT (Fig.1 A), and by the failure of Ala41S100A8 to dimerize, even at high concentrations of oxidant (Fig. 1 B). In keeping with its high structural similarity to the murine protein (14Lackmann M. Cornish C.J. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Geczy C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7499-7504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the response of human S100A8 to OCl− was similar (1B). Cys42 of human S100A8 and Cys41 of murine S100A8 are in the α-helix immediately preceding the hinge region (a 13-amino acid domain separating the two calcium-binding EF hand domains), and similar responses were not unexpected. Nitric oxide, another important product of activated myeloid cells, reacts readily with free radicals such as superoxide anion (O·̄2) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−), and NO and its oxidation products can modify thiols to yield biologically active reaction products (33Mahoney C.W.

By measuring the chemiluminescence of the aequorin fusion partner, the translocation of oligomerized connexins from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane was shown to occur at different rates that depended on the connexin isoform. Treatment of COS-7 cells expressing Cx32-Aeq and Cx43-Aeq with brefeldin A inhibited the movement of these chimera to the plasma membrane by 84 ± 4 and 88 ± 4%, respectively. Nocodazole treatment of the cells expressing Cx32-Aeq and Cx43-Aeq produced 29 ± 16 and 4 ± 7% inhibition, respectively. In contrast, the transport of Cx26 to the plasma membrane, studied using a construct (Cx26/43T-Aeq) in which the short cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx26 was replaced with the extended carboxyl terminus of Cx43, was inhibited 89 ± 5% by nocodazole and was minimally affected by exposure of cells to brefeldin A (17 ±11%). The transfer of Lucifer yellow across gap junctions between cells expressing wild-type Cx32, Cx43, and the corresponding Cx32-Aeq and Cx43-Aeq chimeras was reduced by nocodazole treatment and abolished by brefeldin A treatment. However, the extent of dye coupling between cells expressing wild-type Cx26 or the Cx26/43T-Aeq chimeras was not significantly affected by brefeldin A treatment, but after nocodazole treatment, transfer of dye to neighboring cells was greatly reduced. These contrasting effects of brefeldin A and nocodazole on the trafficking properties and intercellular dye transfer are interpreted to suggest that two pathways contribute to the routing of connexins to the gap junction.

Gap junctions provide a direct intercellular route allowing adjacent cells in tissues and organs to communicate signaling and regulatory molecules (1Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B.

Endocrinol. 1994; 98: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Gap junctions discriminate between molecules mainly on the basis of size (<1 kDa) and charge, and the channels are gated by transmembrane voltage (3Trexler E.B. Bennett M.V.L. Bargiello T.A.

Mutations detected in the cDNA encoding connexin (Cx) 1The abbreviations used are:Cx, connexin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment; Cx-Aeq, connexin-aequorin; KRH, Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer. protein subunits of gap junctions have shown that Cx32 and Cx26 are implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth X-linked peripheral neuropathy and sensorineural deafness, respectively (9Bergoffen J. Scherer S.S. Wang S. Oronzi Scott M. Bone L.J. Paul D.L. Chen K. Lensch M.W. Chance P.F. Fischbeck K.H. Science. 1993; 262: 2039-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 10Kelsell D.P.

A key event in the formation of gap junction channels is the oligomerization of connexins into hexameric hemichannels (connexons). These align and interact with connexons in the plasma membrane of adjacent cells to form an electrically sealed intercellular channel (11Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of connexins was reported to occur after exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (12Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and oligomeric assembly is promoted in the Golgi apparatus (13Diez J.A. Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1998: 130-134Google Scholar). These properties suggest that connexins are unusual membrane proteins since protein folding and oligomerization in the membrane are usually requirements for exit from the ER (14Pelham H.R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 15Nilsson T. von Heijne G. Membrane Protein Assembly. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 189-197Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that connexins accumulate in intracellular stores that correspond to the ERGIC/Golgi in cultured cells (16Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 17Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1260-1265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and growth factors appear to regulate connexin transport between these stores and the gap junction (20Nadarajah B. Marenkova H. Becker D.L. Evans W.H. Parnavelas J.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7881-7890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transport of membrane proteins in general from such intracellular stores to the plasma membrane is likely to involve tubulovesicular networks (21Nakata T. Terada S. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 659-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 22Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cole N. Presley J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 16-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Gap junctions are dynamic structures, with their constituent connexin proteins having high turnover rates (16Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 23Fallon R.F. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Since the extent of intercellular communication is a function of the number of gap junction channels participating in coupling (24Blennerhassett M.G. Garfield R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1001-C1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because gap junctions are rapidly removed from the plasma membrane (16Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J.

Cell Res. 1997; 236: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the translocation of connexins from intracellular sites to the plasma membrane compensates for this high turnover to maintain and modulate coupling between cells. We have used connexin-26, -32, and -43 fused to the calcium reporter aequorin to study the trafficking pathways that lead to the generation of functional gap junction channels (18George C.H.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gradations in the cytoplasmic calcium levels surrounding various stations as they trafficked along the secretory pathway and at the gap junction were determined (18George C.H. Kendall J.M. Campbell A.K. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29822-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To overcome the nonfunctionality of the Cx26-Aeq chimera, the 16-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx26 was replaced with the 156-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx43, producing a construct (Cx26/43T-Aeq) whose behavior could not be distinguished from that of Cx26 (18George C.H. Kendall J.M. Campbell A.K. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29822-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this work, the inherent chemiluminescent activity of a series of Cx-Aeq chimeras was used to quantify levels of connexins and their oligomeric status in intracellular stores and at the plasma membrane, and a method was devised to measure the kinetics of translocation between these stores and the plasma membrane. Applications of drugs that disrupt protein trafficking and the cytoskeleton (brefeldin A, nocodazole, and monensin) pointed to differences in the properties of trafficking of the Cx26, Cx32, and Cx43 chimeras to plasma membranes and gap junctions. All cell culture reagents and plasticware were from Life Technologies, Inc.; other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless specified. COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid cDNA encoding Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, Cx26/43T-Aeq, and Cx32/43T-Aeq (18George C.H. Kendall J.M. Campbell A.K. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29822-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); trypsinized; seeded onto glass coverslips (8 × 104/100 μl); and processed for photon counting as described (27Martin P.E.M. George C.H. Castro C. Kendall J.M. Capel J. Campbell A.K. Revilla A. Barrio L.C. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Four h prior to commencement of experiments, cells were incubated in tissue culture medium containing 3 mm EGTA to give nominal free calcium and a 5 μm final concentration of coelenterazine (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Coverslips were fixed onto a perfusion chamber and brought into contact with a fiber-optic bundle attached to a photon-counting camera (Photek 216) (29Campbell A.K. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were perfused with Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit solution containing nominal free Ca2+ (KRH−Ca2+; 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) for 10 min to remove excess coelenterazine. Plasma membrane-associated recombinant protein was selectively consumed by perfusing the cells with KRH+Ca2+(120 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 4.8 mmKCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 1.3 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4). Recombinant protein that has been previously exposed to Ca2+ (causing the loss of bound coelenterazine) cannot contribute to further chemiluminescence measurements. This procedure is shown in Fig. 1. Cell culture, transfection, and processing for photon counting were carried out as described above. Coelenterazine (5 μm final concentration) in Ca2+-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added 4 h prior to photon counting. The following inhibitors were added 1 h prior to start of experiments: brefeldin A (5 μg/ml), nocodazole (20 μg/ml; Calbiochem), and monensin (20 μm). Cells exposed to nocodazole were processed prior to experiments as described (31Cole N.B. Sciaky N. Marotta A. Song J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 631-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). During the experiments, all perfusion media (KRH−Ca2+ and KRH+Ca2+) contained the appropriate drug at the above concentrations. The effect of inhibitors on the recovery of chemiluminescent activity at the plasma membrane was measured at time intervals between 5 and 25 min using the above protocol. COS-7 cells (1 × 107) transfected with cDNA encoding each recombinant connexin and propagated for 48 h were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; pelleted by centrifugation (1500 × g, 10 min); and resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were dispersed by passage through a fine gauge needle (25 gauge, 10 times) and sonicated (10 × 20 s; Decon Laboratories, Ltd.). The resultant suspension was centrifuged (500 × g, 15 min) to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. The post-nuclear supernatant was separated on 15-ml linear Nycodenz gradients as described by Hammond and Helenius (32Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 231-238Crossref Scopus (398) Google Scholar) into 16 (1 ml) fractions, and their densities were calculated from refractive index measurements. The subcellular compartments corresponding to the ER (17–22% (w/v) Nycodenz, fractions 1–5), ERGIC (13–16% (w/v) Nycodenz, fractions 6–11), and the Golgi (9–12% (w/v) Nycodenz, fractions 12–16) were verified by assay across the gradients of mannosyltransferase, Golgi 58-kDa protein, and galactosyltransferase, respectively (18George C.H. Kendall J.M. Campbell A.K. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29822-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to each subcellular compartment were pooled. To determine the distribution of Cx-Aeq chimeras across the gradient, 500 μl from each pool was incubated with an equal volume of buffer (1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 5 μm coelenterazine for 2 h in the dark at 4 °C. Chemiluminescent activity was then measured by luminometry (Berthold) after injection of 50 mm CaCl2 into the sample. The remainder of the pooled ER, ERGIC, and Golgi samples from the Nycodenz gradients (see above) were dialyzed against distilled H2O (removal of Nycodenz was monitored by refractometry), concentrated under vacuum to ∼50 μl, and mixed with an equal volume of 2× solubilization buffer (20 mm triethanolamine, 20 mm EDTA, and 20 mm dithiothreitol, pH 9.2). Dodecyl maltoside (0.2%, w/v) was added to solubilize membranes, but to keep oligomeric forms of connexins intact (13Diez J.A. Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1998: 130-134Google Scholar), and each pooled sample was mixed by orbital rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. Pooled fractions corresponding to the ER, ERGIC, and Golgi were added to separate preformed sucrose gradients (5 ml, 10–40% (w/v) sucrose) containing dodecyl maltoside (0.2%, w/v) and centrifuged for 22 h at 150,000 × g to determine the oligomeric status of connexins within the ER, ERGIC, and Golgi according to sedimentation rates (12Musil L.S. Goodenough D.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Fractions (10 × 0.5 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube, and following the removal of 20 μl from each for refractive index measurements, the chemiluminescent activity of each fraction was measured. Under the above conditions (10–40% sucrose, 22 h, 150,000 × g), the resultant sucrose gradient was categorized as follows: <15% (w/v) sucrose, monomer (connexin); 15–33% (w/v) sucrose, oligomeric intermediates; and >33% (w/v) sucrose, hexamer (connexon) (according to the migration of known molecular mass proteins) (13Diez J.A. Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1998: 130-134Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transiently expressing various Cx-Aeq chimeras were incubated in Ca2+-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing an inhibitor of protein trafficking (5 μg/ml brefeldin A, 20 μg/ml nocodazole, or 20 μmmonensin) for 1–6 h prior to start of measurement of chemiluminescence. The amount of plasma membrane-associated recombinant connexin at each time interval was quantified for each protein as described above. To investigate the effects of inhibitors on total recombinant protein in cells (at the plasma membrane and in intracellular stores), COS-7 cells (1 × 107) expressing Cx-Aeq chimeras were exposed to brefeldin A, nocodazole, or monensin for 2 or 6 h. Cells were subsequently harvested in hyposmotic buffer (1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and freeze-thawed (five cycles). Nuclei were removed from the suspension by centrifugation (500 ×g, 15 min), and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined (Pierce). Reconstitution of the extracted recombinant protein with coelenterazine and measurement of chemiluminescent activity were carried out as described above. HeLa cells were microinjected with plasmid cDNA encoding wild-type or chimeric connexins (28George C.H. Martin P.E.M. Evans W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transient expression of recombinant protein in >95% cells was observed 24 h later, and cells were then incubated in brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) or nocodazole (20 μg/ml) for 2 or 6 h. Lucifer yellow (5% (w/v) in 0.3 m LiCl) was injected into the cytoplasm, and 10 min later, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline). Dye transfer was quantified by viewing cells on a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) fitted with appropriate filters. The addition of Ca2+ to cells previously maintained in Ca2+-free media has been shown to selectively trigger plasma membrane-associated aequorin (18George C.H. Kendall J.M. Campbell A.K. Evans W.H.

The remaining chemiluminescence in a population of cells expressing chimeric connexins (i.e. intracellular stores that are unaffected by the addition of KRH+Ca2+ to the cells formerly maintained in KRH−Ca2+) was calculated at the end of each experiment by exposing cells to 5 mmCa2+ in H2O; this allowed the relative amounts of Cx-Aeq at the plasma membrane and sequestered in intracellular stores to be determined. Following consumption of all plasma membrane-associated recombinant protein, cells were perfused for variable times in KRH−Ca2+. By measuring the recovery of chemiluminescent activity at the plasma membrane at different time points (Fig. 1), it became evident that connexins were delivered to the plasma membrane at different rates (Fig. 2). After consumption of all Cx-Aeq chimeras initially present at the plasma membrane, the rate of appearance of chimeras at the plasma membrane was Cx26/43T-Aeq (5 min) > Cx43-Aeq (10 min) > Cx32-Aeq ≈ Cx32/43T-Aeq (15 min) (Fig.2, C (panel i), B (panel ii), A (panel iii), and D(panel iii), respectively). The amount of Cx32-Aeq (Fig.3 A), Cx43-Aeq (Fig.3 B), Cx26/43T-Aeq (Fig. 3 C), and Cx32/43T-Aeq (Fig. 3 D) detected at the plasma membrane increased with time. The translocation of various connexins to the plasma membrane was influenced by various inhibitors of protein trafficking and depended on the connexin isoform to which the aequorin reporter was attached. Delivery of Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, and Cx32/43T-Aeq from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane was inhibited by 83 ± 4, 87 ± 4, and 81 ± 4%, respectively, in cells treated with brefeldin A (Fig. 3, A, B, and D, respectively) compared with untreated cells. Treatment of cells expressing these chimeric proteins with nocodazole had a much lower relative effect on their movement to the plasma membrane; nocodazole reduced the amount of Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, and Cx32/43T-Aeq at the plasma membrane by 29 ± 16, 4 ± 7, and 7 ± 7%, respectively (Fig. 3,A, B, and D respectively). In contrast, delivery of Cx26/43T-Aeq to the plasma membrane was almost completely inhibited by nocodazole treatment (89 ± 5% inhibition of translocation to the plasma membrane). However, translocation of Cx26/43T-Aeq was affected to a lesser extent by exposure to brefeldin A (16 ± 11% inhibition of movement to the plasma membrane) (Fig.3 C). The movement of all connexins to the plasma membrane was inhibited by monensin treatment (Fig. 3, A–D). A combination of brefeldin A and nocodazole completely inhibited trafficking of all Cx-Aeq chimeras (data not shown). The intracellular location of the Cx-Aeq chimeras was analyzed using a subcellular fractionation approach. Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, and Cx32/43T-Aeq accumulated in the Golgi region of COS-7 cells (Table I) as determined by their comigration with galactosyltransferase (18George C.H. Kendall J.M. Campbell A.K. Evans W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29822-29829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cx26/43T-Aeq was found predominantly in the ERGIC (revealed by its comigration with Golgi 58-kDa protein), with only 21 ± 5% of the total chimera being transferred to the Golgi apparatus (Table I). Analysis of connexin assembly demonstrated that the oligomerization process commenced in the ER, and the formation of connexons, i.e. protein migrating at the 9 S position on sucrose gradients (13Diez J.A. Ahmad S. Evans W.H. Werner R. Gap Junctions. IOS Press, Amsterdam1998: 130-134Google Scholar, 36Falk M.M. Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2704-2716Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), was promoted as the connexin trafficked along the secretory pathway (Fig.4); the extent of oligomerization (determined on the basis of the amount of connexon formed) of each connexin was Cx43-Aeq ≈ Cx26/43T-Aeq > Cx32/43T-Aeq > Cx32-Aeq (Fig. 4, B, C, D, andA, respectively). However, the fusion of aequorin to the carboxyl-terminal tail of each connexin appeared to hinder the oligomerization of Cx-Aeq chimeras relative to that observed with wild-type connexins (28George C.H. Martin P.E.M. Evans W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The results show that Cx26/43T-Aeq was assembled into connexons at an earlier stage than observed with the Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, or Cx32/43T-Aeq chimera, and its maximal oligomerization into connexons occurred, importantly, in the ERGIC environs of the cell (Fig. 4 C). However, it was noted that the Cx-Aeq chimeras were not fully oligomerized in these intracellular stores, and they existed as a mixture of hexameric connexons and non-hexameric oligomers (Fig. 4).Table ISubcellular distribution of Cx-Aeq chimeras in COS-7 cellsCx-Aeq chimerasSubcellular distribution of Cx-Aeq chimerasERERGICGolgi%Cx32-Aeq14.7 ± 3.216.3 ± 4.169 ± 8.4Cx43-Aeq13.2 ± 4.16.2 ± 1.280.6 ± 9.6Cx26/43T-Aeq15.8 ± 3.763.2 ± 9.721.0 ± 4.5Cx32/43T-Aeq24.6 ± 5.217.6 ± 4.257.8 ± 6.3The amount of Cx-Aeq chimeras in the ER, ERGIC, and Golgi compartments was determined by chemiluminescence measurement following Nycodenz fractionation of COS-7 cells.

Open table in a new tab The amount of Cx-Aeq chimeras in the ER, ERGIC, and Golgi compartments was determined by chemiluminescence measurement following Nycodenz fractionation of COS-7 cells. Results are given as the percentage of total cellular Cx-Aeq in each compartment and are expressed as the means ± S.E. (n = 3). Cx-Aeq chimeras specifically associated with the plasma membrane accounted for 2–5% of the total recombinant protein expressed by COS-7 cells, with the majority of Cx-Aeq chimeras being located in intracellular stores (Fig. 4). However, Cx32-Aeq (3 ± 0.2%), Cx43-Aeq (4 ± 0.5%), Cx26/43T-Aeq (5 ± 0.3%), and Cx32/43T-Aeq (4 ± 0.4%) (Fig. 5,A–D at t = 0, respectively) were detected at the plasma membrane in different amounts. Trafficking of Cx32-Aeq (Fig. 5 A), Cx43-Aeq (Fig. 5 B), or Cx32/43T-Aeq (Fig. 5 D) to the plasma membrane was inhibited by incubating COS-7 cells expressing each of these chimeric connexins in brefeldin A. Under these conditions, the time required for the removal of 50% of Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, and Cx32/43T-Aeq from the plasma membrane (t1/2) was 198 ± 24, 168 ± 19, and 165 ± 27 min, respectively. The majority of Cx32-Aeq (85 ± 5%), Cx43-Aeq (76 ± 4%), and Cx32/43T-Aeq (74 ± 6%) was removed from the plasma membrane following exposure to brefeldin A for 6 h. Treatment of COS-7 cells expressing Cx32-Aeq, Cx43-Aeq, or Cx32/43T-Aeq with nocodazole did not greatly affect the amount of recombinant protein associated with the plasma membrane even after 6 h of incubation (13 ± 7, 13 ± 6, and 21 ± 8% decreases, respectively) compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5,A, B, and D, respectively). In contrast, removal of Cx26/43T-Aeq from the plasma membrane took place more rapidly (t1/2 = 54 ± 10 min) when its trafficking to the plasma membrane was inhibited by nocodazole (Fig.5 C). Brefeldin A treatment of cells expressing Cx26/43T-Aeq resulted in a longer residence time of this chimera at the plasma membrane (13 ± 5% decrease) compared with other Cx-Aeq chimeras (Fig. 5 C). Incubation of cells with monensin prevented trafficking of all Cx-Aeq chimeras to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3) and inhibited their subsequent removal from the cell periphery (Fig. 5,A–D). In complementary experiments using HeLa cells expressing various Cx-Aeq chimeras, both the amount of Cx-Aeq chimeras present at the plasma membrane and their loss from the cell surface induced by various inhibitors of protein trafficking were no different from what was observed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Incubation of cells with nocodazole or monensin for up to 6 h had little effect on the total levels of Cx-Aeq chimeras expressed (TableII). Prolonged exposure to brefeldin A (6 h) decreased the amount of all Cx-Aeq chimeras in cells (82 ± 9%). This probably represents removal from intracellular stores owing to degradation (16Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and therefore did not affect the quantification of brefeldin A-induced loss of connexin from the plasma membrane.Table IIEffect of protein trafficking inhibitors on the amount of Cx-Aeq chimeras in COS-7 cellsInhibitorChemiluminescent activity2 h6 hcounts/μg cellular protein (x10−3)Untreated6.55 ± 0.516.61 ± 0.52Brefeldin A6.09 ± 0.615.42 ± 0.55Nocodazole6.71 ± 0.516.34 ± 0.51Monensin6.68 ± 0.496.45 ± 0.54The Cx43-Aeq content of cells was determined following treatment of cells with inhibitors of protein trafficking for 2 or 6 h.

After a 2-h incubation in brefeldin A (when 2–3% the total recombinant connexin was present at the plasma membrane), dye transfer between cells expressing Cx32 and Cx43 (as Cx-Aeq chimeras or wild-type connexins) was not affected (Table III).

The Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activity of these myofibrillar preparations was measured in order to examine the functional consequences of these troponin mutations. An I79N troponin T mutation was found to cause a definite increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofibrillar ATPase activity without inducing any significant change in the maximum level of ATPase activity. A detailed analysis indicated the inhibitory action of troponin I to be impaired by the I79N troponin T mutation. Two more troponin T mutations (R92Q and R278C) were also found to have a Ca2+–sensitizing effect without inducing any change in maximum ATPase activity. Two other troponin T mutations (F110I and E244D) had no Ca2+–sensitizing effects on the ATPase activity, but remarkably potentiated the maximum level of ATPase activity. These findings indicate that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked troponin T mutations have at least two different effects on the Ca2+–sensitive ATPase activity, Ca2+–sensitization and potentiation of the maximum level of the ATPase activity.

The contraction of striated muscle is regulated by Ca2+ through two specific regulatory proteins, troponin (Tn) 1The abbreviations used are:Tn, troponin; HCM, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; CDTA, trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; pCa, -log [Ca2+]. and tropomyosin, which are located on the thin filament. Tn is a complex of three subunits, troponin C (TnC), troponin I (TnI), and troponin T (TnT). TnI inhibits myosin-actin interaction and TnC suppresses the inhibitory effect of TnI by binding of Ca2+.

Previous genetic analyses have shown that eight different point mutations in TnT to be associated with HCM. However, it is still not clear as to how these single point mutations are functionally related to and cause this disease. This study was carried out to investigate the functions of five HCM-linked TnT mutants in cardiac myofibrils under physiological conditions. We prepared recombinant human cardiac Tn subunits (wild-type TnC, TnI, and TnT) and five HCM-linked TnT mutants, and these recombinant proteins were then incorporated into rabbit cardiac myofibrils using our previously reported TnT treatment procedure (15Shiraishi F. Kambara M. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1022-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Hatakenaka M. Ohtsuki I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activity of these reconstituted myofibrils was examined. We thus found the HCM-linked TnT mutants to have at least two different effects on ATPase activity, which are Ca2+-sensitization (I79N, R92Q, and R278C) and the potentiation of the maximum level (F110I and E244D). The Ca2+-sensitizing effect of I79N and R92Q TnT mutants is consistent with our previous study using skinned fibers (18Morimoto S. Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohtsuki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C201-C207Crossref Google Scholar). These findings suggest that an enhanced contractility of the cardiac muscle, which occurs as a result of mutations in both groups, may be a common mechanism for the pathogenesis of HCM associated with these TnT mutations. Human cardiac Tn (TnC, TnI, and TnT) cDNAs were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of human heart mRNA purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pUC 119 vector for screening by a restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. The obtained wild-type Tn cDNAs were then constructed into a pET-3d vector for expression. To obtain mutant TnTs, mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction according to the method described by Horton (19Horton R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 15: 251-261PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides employed for mutagenesis were: 5′-CCTCCCAAGAACCCCGATGG-3′ for the I79N mutation, 5′-GACATCCACCAGAAGCGCATG-3′ for the R92Q mutation, 5′-GAGGCTCACATTGAGAACAGG-3′ for the F110I mutation, 5′-TATAACTTGGATGCAGAGAAG-3′ for the E244D mutation, and 5′-CTCCAAGACCTGCGGGAAGG-3′ for the R278C mutation. The changed bases were underlined. The results of the mutations in TnT cDNA were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild-type Tn and mutant TnTs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (18Morimoto S. Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohtsuki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C201-C207Crossref Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The induction of protein expression by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was continued for 5.0 h, and then the cells were harvested and lysed. The lysate was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C. For the purification of TnT and TnC, 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 6m urea, 5 mm CDTA, and 15 mm 2-ME were added to the supernatant and the samples were applied to RESORCE Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. For the purification of TnI, the pellet was resuspended with the same solution described above and the sample was applied to a Poros HS/M column (PerSeptive Biosystem). To prepare myofibrils, fresh rabbit cardiac left ventricular muscle was cut in 5-mm slice and soaked in a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), and 0.5% 2-ME for 6 h at 4 °C. The solution was then changed to another solution containing 50% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), and 0.5% 2-ME and the slices were kept in it overnight at 4 °C. The following morning, these slices were transferred to the new solution and stored at −20 °C. Myofibrils were prepared from the kept samples according to the method of Solaro et al. (20Solaro R.J. Pang D.C. Briggs F.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 245: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Tn exchange was carried out according to our previously reported method (15Shiraishi F.

Myofibrils (300 μg/ml) were incubated in a solution containing 20 mm MOPS/KOH (pH 6.2), 265 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm 2-ME and 37.5 μg/ml recombinant human cardiac TnT at 25 °C for 1 h while shaking. These myofibrils were washed with a solution containing 0.5% Briji-58, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 265 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm 2-ME, and the myofibrils were resuspended in a solution (300 μg/ml) containing 60 mm KCl and 1 mmsodium bicarbonate after washing with the same solution. The myofibrils were then reconstituted with recombinant TnI (15.2 μg/ml) and TnC (11.6 μg/ml) on ice for 1 h. The reaction mixture (200 μl) for the ATPase assay consisted of 90 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm Ca2+-EGTA, 4 mm ATP, 40 μg of myofibrils. The reaction was started by adding ATP at 25 °C and was terminated by adding 1.6 ml of a mixture of 50% acetone, 2.5 mm(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and 1.25 n H2SO4. The contents were mixed carefully and 160 μl of 1 m citric acid were added to tubes and the yellow color was measured at OD355 (21Heinonen J.K. Lahti R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Ca2+ concentrations in the reaction mixtures were calculated as described previously (22Morimoto S. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the procedure of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), with an acrylamide concentration of 12%. Alkaline gel electrophoresis was carried out according to the procedure described previously (24Yamamoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 93: 1061-1069Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Alkaline urea gel electrophoresis was done by the procedure of Pan and Solaro (25Pan B.-S. Solaro R.J. J . Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7839-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with an acrylamide concentration of 13.5% at pH 8.5. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and an optical densitometric scan was performed using Phoretix gel analysis software (Phoretix International Ltd.). Three subunits of human cardiac Tn (TnT, TnI, and TnC) were cloned by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction technique and expressed using a pET-3d vector. As shown in Fig. 1 A, recombinant human cardiac TnT and TnC had exactly the same electrophoretic mobility as rabbit cardiac TnT and TnC on 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Recombinant human cardiac TnI, however, had a little faster mobility than rabbit cardiac TnI. An alkaline gel electrophoresis analysis showed the recombinant human cardiac Tn subunit combined with the native rabbit cardiac Tn subunit to form binary or ternary complexes under nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 1 B). As a result, the recombinant human cardiac Tn subunits had the ability to form a Tn complex in the same way as the native rabbit cardiac Tn subunits. We previously reported the endogenous Tn complexes in myofibrils were replaced with exogenous TnT after treatment with an excessive amount of purified TnT in acidic solution and the ATPase activity of the treated myofibrils becomes insensitive to Ca2+ (15Shiraishi F.

Fig.2 shows the ATPase activity of rabbit cardiac myofibrils treated with different amounts of recombinant TnT in the presence (pCa 5.18) and absence (pCa 7.05) of Ca2+. The ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+ did not change after the treatment with TnT at any concentrations, whereas the ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+ increased in a concentration-dependent manner and reached almost a maximum level after treatment with 20 μg/ml TnT (Fig. 2). The maximum ATPase activities of wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils were 22 ± 1.6 nmol·Pi/mg/min in the absence of Ca2+ and 32 ± 0.5 nmol·Pi/mg/min in the presence of Ca2+(mean ± S.E., n = 4). The maximum ATPase activities of I79N TnT-treated myofibrils were 22 ± 1.5 nmol·Pi/mg/min in the absence of Ca2+ and 33 ± 3.0 nmol·Pi/mg/min in the presence of Ca2+ (mean ± S.E., n = 4). As a result, the maximum ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+increased up to approximately 65% of the maximum activity in the presence of Ca2+ by the treatments with either wild-type or I79N TnT at 37.5 μg/ml. In the following experiments, myofibrils were treated with this concentration of TnT. To determine the extent of the exchange of Tn complex in the myofibrils, both SDS-PAGE and alkaline urea gel electrophoresis were carried out. The densitometry of TnI bands in the SDS-PAGE pattern of the myofibrils showed that 65.3 ± 3.2% (mean ± S.E., n = 5) and 63.8 ± 4.0% (mean ± S.E., n = 5) of the native TnI was removed by wild-type TnT treatment and I79N TnT treatment, respectively (Fig.3 A). Although native rabbit cardiac TnT and recombinant human cardiac TnT had exactly the same electrophoretic mobility on 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2), the recombinant human cardiac TnT had a slightly faster mobility than rabbit cardiac TnT on alkaline urea gel (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2). A densitometry scan on alkaline urea gel was performed to estimate the amount of TnT exchanged into myofibrils. On the typical scanning patterns of TnT-treated and untreated myofibrils (Fig. 3 C), the density of both native rabbit TnT and TnC bands decreased by treatment with wild-type TnT or I79N TnT of which mobility were the same as actin. Although a quantitative analysis of TnTs could not be carried out because of the high background density, the increase in the density of the actin peak after TnT treatment indicated the incorporation of human recombinant TnTs into the myofibrils. The densitometry of the TnC bands showed the percentage of native rabbit TnC removed from myofibrils to be 65.0 ± 4.0% (mean ± S.E., n = 5) by wild-type TnT treatment and 63.9 ± 2.1% (mean ± S.E., n= 5) by I79N TnT treatment. These gel scan analyses, taken together with the ATPase assays, provided strong evidence that the extent of the recombinant human cardiac TnT incorporated into the myofibrils were approximately 65% and that the wild-type and I79N mutant TnTs were also equally effective in replacing the endogenous Tn complex in myofibrils. As shown in Fig.4, the addition of the recombinant human cardiac TnI resulted in a decrease in the Ca2+-insensitive ATPase activity of the myofibrils treated with wild-type or I79N TnT in a dose-dependent manner and were completely inhibited at 15.2 μg/ml (Fig. 4 A). The amounts of TnI required for a 50% inhibition (IC50) were 0.80 ± 0.05 μg/ml and 1.74 ± 0.21 μg/ml (mean ± S.E., n = 3) for wild-type TnT-treated and I79N TnT-treated myofibrils, respectively. This indicated that the inhibitory effect of TnI on actin-tropomyosin was significantly smaller in the I79N mutant TnT-treated myofibrils than the wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils. In the presence of Ca2+, recombinant human cardiac TnC activated the suppressed ATPase activity of the TnI-reconstituted myofibrils in a dose-dependent manner and fully neutralized the ATPase activity at the concentration of 11.6 μg/ml (Fig.4 B). No significant difference in the neutralizing effect of TnC was detected between the myofibrils containing wild-type TnT and I79N TnT. Although no significant difference was seen in thepCa-ATPase activity relationships at pH 7.5, the Ca2+ sensitivity (pCa50,pCa at half-maximum activation) of the myofibrils reconstituted with I79N mutant TnT was significantly higher than the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrils reconstituted with wild-type TnT at pH 7.0 and 6.5 (Fig. 5). The difference in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the reconstituted myofibrils was thus larger at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.0 (TableI). However, no significant difference was observed in the maximum ATPase activity and the Hill coefficient (n H, an index of cooperativity) between the myofibrils reconstituted with wild-type TnT and reconstituted with I79N mutant TnT at any pH.Table IThe Ca2+ sensitivity of ATPase activity of myofibrils after being reconstituted with recombinant human cardiac Tns at different pH levelspHpCa50Wild-type TnTI79N TnT6.55.15 ± 0.080 (n = 3)5.55 ± 0.083 (n = 4)ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils.7.06.01 ± 0.035 (n = 3)6.16 ± 0.080 (n = 4)ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils.7.56.28 ± 0.036 (n = 3)6.24 ± 0.009 (n = 3)pCa values at half-maximum ATPase activity (pCa50) at each pH were calculated by fitting the data shown in Fig. 4 to the Hill equation.

Four other missense mutations, R92Q, F110I, E244D, and R278C mutant TnTs, were generated by the overlap extension methods. An SDS-PAGE analysis showed all of these mutants to have the same electrophoretic mobility on 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig.6 A). The densitometric scan of the SDS-PAGE gel was performed to determine the amount of native TnI removed from the myofibrils after treatment with mutant TnTs (Fig.6 B, Table II). No significant difference was found in the amounts of native TnI removed from myofibrils by treatment with mutant TnTs. This result indicated that the extent of the removal of native TnT and hence the incorporation of these mutant TnTs into the myofibrils were almost the same as the wild-type and I79N TnTs.Table IIComparison of the effects of mutant TnTs on myofibrilsTnT type% of removed native TnI from myofibrils by treatment with TnTsMyofibrillar ATPase activitypCa50Maximum ATPase activity (Pi·nmol/mg/min)n HAfter TnT treatmentAfter TnT treatment + TnC·I reconstitutionWild-type65.0 ± 4.0 (n = 5)6.01 ± 0.035 (n = 4)29.8 ± 2.9 (n = 4)32.3 ± 3.6 (n = 4)2.2 ± 0.6 (n = 4)I79N63.9 ± 2.1 (n = 5)6.16 ± 0.028 (n = 4)ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils (t test).29.3 ± 3.0 (n = 4)31.0 ± 0.8 (n = 4)2.4 ± 0.2 (n = 4)R92Q61.2 ± 2.9 (n = 4)6.17 ± 0.003 (n = 3)ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils (t test).30.3 ± 1.2 (n = 3)29.7 ± 0.2 (n = 3)2.1 ± 0.2 (n = 3)F110I60.8 ± 4.8 (n = 4)5.98 ± 0.063 (n = 3)27.4 ± 1.6 (n = 3)45.4 ± 1.8 (n = 3)ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils (t test).1.6 ± 0.2 (n = 3)E244D70.5 ± 4.2 (n = 4)6.00 ± 0.036 (n = 3)27.8 ± 3.0 (n = 3)48.8 ± 4.2 (n = 3)ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils (t test).1.6 ± 0.1 (n = 3)R278C72.1 ± 4.2 (n = 4)6.24 ± 0.064 (n = 4)ap < 0.05 compared with wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils (t test).31.6 ± 2.1 (n = 4)31.9 ± 2.6 (n = 4)1.2 ± 0.2 (n = 4)Myofibrils were treated with wild-type or mutant TnT, and an SDS-PAGE analysis or ATPase activity measurement in the presence of Ca2+(pCa5.18) was carried out before and after reconstitution.

The pCa-ATPase activity relationships were examined at pH 7.0 using myofibrils which were treated with these TnT mutants and then reconstituted with recombinant human cardiac TnI and TnC. As shown in Fig. 7, an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the ATPase activity was observed with R92Q and R278C TnT mutants, with no significant effect on the maximum ATPase activity. On the other hand, an increase in the maximum ATPase activity was observed with F110I and E244D TnT mutants, without any change in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the ATPase activity (Fig. 8). No significant change in the cooperativity was observed between the wild-type TnT-treated myofibrils and mutant TnT-treated myofibrils (Table II). The summary in Table IIclearly indicates these HCM-related TnT mutants to have the same ability as wild-type TnT to exchange native TnT in the myofibrils and are thus classified into at least two groups according to their effects on the Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activity.Figure 8The potentiation of the maximum ATPase activity caused by F110I and E244D TnT mutants. Myofibrils were treated with wild-type (○), F110I (▪), or E244D (♦) TnT (37.5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C and reconstituted with recombinant human cardiac TnI (15.2 μg/ml) and TnC (11.2 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C.

The results of the present study indicated the recombinant human cardiac Tn subunits and native rabbit cardiac Tn subunits to be almost identical. These findings led us to analyze the effects of HCM-linked TnT mutants on the Ca2+-sensitive ATPase activity of rabbit cardiac myofibrils. We already reported that I79N and R92Q TnT mutants in HCM have a Ca2+ sensitizing effect on the tension development of skinned fibers prepared from the rabbit ventricular muscle (18Morimoto S. Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohtsuki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C201-C207Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study, the Ca2+sensitizing effects of I79N and R92Q mutant TnTs on the myofibrillar ATPase activity were thus confirmed. Regarding the molecular mechanism of action of these TnT mutants, the inhibitory effect of TnI on the Ca2+-insensitive ATPase activity of myofibrils with I79N mutant TnT was found to be smaller than that with wild-type TnT, while the neutralizing effect of wild-type TnC was not affected by this mutation (Fig. 3, Aand B). These findings suggest that the I79N mutant TnT reduced the affinity of TnI to actin-tropomyosin. The same mechanisms on the action of R92Q TnT mutant was also suggested in our previous study using skinned fibers (18Morimoto S. Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohtsuki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C201-C207Crossref Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that a mutation at Arg278 in TnT, in addition to the mutations at Ile79 and Arg92 in the TnT mentioned above, thus caused an increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the ATPase activity without any change in the maximum level. It was also recently reported that the HCM-linked α-tropomyosin mutant, D175N, is associated with an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity (26Bottinelli R. Coviello D.A. Redwood C.S. Pellegrino M.A. Maron B.J. Spirito P. Watkins H. Reggiani C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is therefore highly conceivable that an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity is one of the characteristic features of the HCM caused by the regulatory proteins associated with the thin filament. The results of both the present and previous studies showing the Ca2+ sensitizing effects of R92Q mutant on the ATPase activity of myofibrils and the tension development of skinned fibers apparently conflict with the results of a recent study by Marianet al. (27Marian A.J. Zhao G. Seta Y. Roberts R. Yu Q.-T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). They reported that the expression of R92Q mutant human cardiac TnT in cultured adult feline cardiac myocytes impaired the contractile performance as indicated by both fractional cell shortening and the peak velocity of shortening of the myocytes (27Marian A.J. Zhao G. Seta Y. Roberts R. Yu Q.-T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the reason for this discrepancy in the results is not known, it might be due to the difference of the design of the experiments. No significant difference has been reported between the effects of I91N mutation in rat embryonic cardiac TnT, thus corresponding to I79N mutation in human, and wild-type TnT on Ca2+ sensitivity of the thin filaments examined by S-1 Mg-ATPase activity at pH 7.5 (28Lin D. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2842-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). While we found this mutant to behave in a manner similar to a wild-type at pH 7.5, the mutant had a Ca2+ sensitizing effect on the actomyosin ATPase activity at pH 7.0 and 6.5, which was more significant at an acidic pH 6.5, which is also consistent with the previous observations on skinned fibers (18Morimoto S. Yanaga F. Minakami R. Ohtsuki I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C201-C207Crossref Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the I79N mutant may have a strong effect on the contractile performance during myocardial ischemia, although the effects of acidic pH on other TnT mutants have not yet been examined. The most significant finding of the present study was that the maximum ATPase activity of the myofibrils was potentiated by the mutations at Phe110 and Glu244 in TnT (Fig. 8 and Table II). The potentiation effects of F110I and E244D TnT mutants were not observed after the TnT treatment but were observed only after subsequent reconstitution with TnC and TnI (Table II). This strongly suggests that the potentiation of the maximum ATPase activity is caused through a change in the interaction of TnT and TnC·I. In the present study, we found that the effects of HCM-linked TnT mutations can be classified into at least two different types. The I79N, R92Q, and R278C TnT mutants enhanced Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity without affecting the maximum level of ATPase activity, whereas the F110I and E244D TnT mutants enhanced a maximum level of ATPase activity without affecting the Ca2+sensitivity. These two groups of missense mutations in TnT might cause HCM in different manners. However, it is noteworthy that the mutations which cause an increase in the maximum ATPase activity alone also have an apparent Ca2+ sensitizing effect at a submaximal concentration of Ca2+ due to a scale-up of the overall ATPase activity. Since the intact cardiac muscle has been reported to never be activated beyond the half-maximal level (29Rüegg J.C. Calcium in Muscle Activation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 183-193Google Scholar), an enhanced myofilament response to the submaximal Ca2+ may be a common phenomenon for the pathogenesis of HCM associated with these missense mutations in TnT. In several reports HCM-linked β-myosin heavy chain mutations and TnT mutations have been shown to impair cardiac performance and cause compensatory cardiac hypertrophy (30Palmiter K.A. Solaro R.J. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1997; 92 Suppl. 1: 63-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sweeney H.L. Straceski A.J. Leinwand L.A. Tikunov B.A. Faust L. J. Biol.

Invest. 1996; 98: 2456-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, our findings suggest that certain mutations might determine a hypercontractile state and thus appear to induce hypertrophy directly, instead of causing it indirectly via the mechanism of compensatory hypertrophy.

We have reported recently that four of the gene products (huntingtin, atrophin-1 (DRPLA), ataxin-3, and androgen receptor) associated with these open reading frame triplet repeat expansions are substrates for the cysteine protease cell death executioners, the caspases. This led us to hypothesize that caspase cleavage of these proteins may represent a common step in the pathogenesis of each of these four neurodegenerative diseases. Here we present evidence that caspase cleavage of atrophin-1 modulates cytotoxicity and aggregate formation. Cleavage of atrophin-1 at Asp109 by caspases is critical for cytotoxicity because a mutant atrophin-1 that is resistant to caspase cleavage is associated with significantly decreased toxicity. Further, the altered cellular localization within the nucleus and aggregate formation associated with the expanded form of atrophin-1 are completely suppressed by mutation of the caspase cleavage site at Asp109. These results provide support for the toxic fragment hypothesis whereby cleavage of atrophin-1 by caspases may be an important step in the pathogenesis of DRPLA. Therefore, inhibiting caspase cleavage of the polyglutamine-containing proteins may be a feasible therapeutic strategy to prevent cell death.

Expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in these disease proteins results in selective death of neurons in different regions of the brain. Because all of these disease-associated proteins share a similar mutation, i.e. CAG expansion in the coding region causing expansion of a polyglutamine stretch, they may have a common pathological mechanism leading to neuronal cytotoxicity. Except for the polyglutamine tract, it is generally believed that the eight disease proteins are unrelated because their amino acid sequences bear no discernible sequence homology. However, recent evidence from our laboratories (13Goldberg Y.P. Nicholson D.W. Rasper D.M. Kalchman M.A. Koide H.B. Graham R.K. Bromm M. Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P.

This would imply that a second common feature of at least seven of the polyglutamine expansion disease proteins may be their involvement in the apoptotic cell death pathway as cellular substrates for the caspases.

To date, we have characterized the caspase cleavage of four of the polyglutamine repeat disease proteins: huntingtin, the androgen receptor, atrophin-1 (DRPLA), and ataxin-3 (Machado-Joseph disease) (13Goldberg Y.P.

These initial studies suggested that a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway may be a critical factor in the generation of truncated proteins in some of these polyglutamine repeat disease proteins and raised a number of questions that warrant further investigation: Is the proteolytic pathway involving caspases required to explain a common mechanism of cytotoxicity of these proteins with expanded polyglutamine stretches? How are these caspase substrates involved in the apoptotic process and neurodegeneration? Are any of the functional domains within these proteins activated or inactivated by caspase cleavage? Does the proteolytic processing by caspases form the basis for selective neuronal loss characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases? Does the distinct cellular localization of each of these structurally and functionally unrelated proteins determine which caspase family member cleaves them? Do other proteolytic pathways contribute to the cytotoxicity of these proteins? Given our recent findings, we wished to address the following specific questions: Is caspase cleavage required for the cytotoxicity exhibited by these proteins? In other words, is the formation of a truncated protein containing the polyglutamine stretch via a caspase-dependent pathway required for cytotoxicity? Additionally, we wished to address whether the caspase cleavage site is required for the formation of the protein aggregates and/or altered cellular localization characteristic of these diseases. Of the four proteins we reported recently as caspase substrates, atrophin-1 is a particularly attractive candidate for our initial investigation because in all likelihood it contains only one caspase cleavage site within the entire protein. This is in contrast to ataxin-3, huntingtin, and androgen receptor, which are cleaved at multiple sites within the protein. Here we provide in vitro evidence that caspase cleavage of atrophin-1 modulates cytotoxicity, formation of protein aggregates, and its subcellular localization. Cells from the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfection was carried out with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-DRPLA26, pRc/CMV-LacZ, pcDNA3-DRPLA65, pcDNA3-DRPLA26D109N, and pcDNA3-DRPLA65 D109N (24Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M.

Using pRc/CMV-LacZ, transfection efficiency was determined by staining for the expression of β-galactosidase. Cell death was measured by trypan blue exclusion, acridine orange/ethidium bromide, and LacZ reporter gene cotransfection. Death was established as apoptotic based on acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and assessment of caspase-3 activation. Cell death was measured 36–50 h after transfection. Cellular death in confluent cells was induced with tamoxifen citrate at a concentration of 35 μm 36–48 h after transfection (26Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were collected for three to five experiments and then compared by Student's t test for statistical significance. Apoptosis was also monitored with the ApoAlert caspase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with the Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate (CLONTECH). Plasmids pcDNA3, pcDNA3-DRPLA26, pRc/CMV-LacZ, pcDNA3-DRPLA65, pcDNA3-DRPLA26D109N, and pcDNA3-DRPLA65 D109N were transcribed using T7 polymerase and then translated using the TNT system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Translations (2.5 μl) were incubated with 10–50 ng caspase-3 for 2 h in the following buffer (10 μl): 20 mm PIPES, 100 mmNaCl, 1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2 at 37 °C. His-tagged caspase-3 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (27Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M.

Western blots were carried out as described previously using anti-caspase-3 mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) (26Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6165-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected at 40% confluence using a modified calcium phosphate protocol by mixing Qiagen-prepared DNA (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) with 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 2 × BBS (50 mm BES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.0) and adding the mixture to cells immediately. After a 3-h incubation, the media were removed and replaced with fresh growth media. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were either treated with 35 μm tamoxifen (Sigma) for 4 h or left untreated. Cells were harvested by gentle scraping into the growth media and centrifugation at 4,000 × gfor 4 min. Samples were washed once with PBS, centrifuged as before, and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of total cellular protein were mixed with 5 × Laemmli sample buffer, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein was transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunoblotted with anti-atrophin-1 antibody, and detected using enhanced chemoluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human DRPLA26D109N and DRPLA65D109N were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system from Stratagene. pcDNA3-DRPLA constructs were used as templates with the following two synthetic primers according to manufacturer instructions: 5′-CCGATCTGGATAGCTTGAACGGGCGGAGCCTTAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTAAGGCTCCGCCCGTTCAAGCTATCCAGATCGG -3′. Radiosequencing was performed as described previously (27Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 30Salvesen G. Enghild J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmid pcDNA3-DRPLA26 was transcribed and translated with T7 polymerase using the TNT system (Promega) with either [35S]methionine or [3H]leucine. The translation was treated with caspase-3, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After autoradiography, the position of the [35S]methionine-labeled atrophin-1 fragments was used to cut out the [3H]leucine atrophin-1 bands from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The samples were subjected to automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 476A sequencer, and the anilinothiazolinone derivatives in each cycle were counted in a scintillation counter. Comparison of the known positions of leucines relative to the caspase cleavage site aspartate allowed identification of the atrophin-1 cleavage site. 293T cells were grown on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with the indicated DRPLA construct as described above. At 36 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 35 μm tamoxifen for 45 min. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS solution for 20 min, the cells were washed and then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 PBS for 5 min. The DRPLA antibody utilized in these studies has been described by Woodet al. (31Wood J.D. Yuan J. Margolis R.L. Colomer V. Duan K. Kushi J. Kaminsky Z. Kleiderlein J.J. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and was raised in rabbits against synthetic peptide DRPLA425 (residues 425–439 of atrophin-1). The cells were washed twice, incubated at room temperature with anti-DRPLA antibody (1:200) for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated in Texas red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1,000) for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then mounted onto slides with DAPI (4′,6′-diamindino-2-phenylindole, Sigma, 0.05 μg/ml) in 90% glycerol and PBS as a nuclear counterstain. Immunofluorescence was observed using a Zeiss confocal microscope. Control experiments were performed, including incubation with secondary antibody only, and immunofluorescence of cells transfected with control plasmids. DRPLA is one of eight autosomal dominant neurodegenerative diseases with expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats encoding polyglutamine stretches (32Ross C.A. Margolis R.L. Rosenblatt A. Ranen R.G. Becher M.W. Aylward E. Medicine. 1997; 76: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by progressive dementia, myoclonic epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and choreoathetotic movements. Like many of these disease-associated proteins, atrophin-1 is expressed ubiquitously in the central nervous system (33Yazawa I. Nukina N. Goto J. Kurisaki H. Hebisawa A. Kanazawa I. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 225: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and thus its expression pattern offers little clue to the relative susceptibility or resistance of certain neuronal populations of cells to undergo neurodegeneration. We and others have demonstrated recently that atrophin-1 is cleaved by caspases (14Wellington C.L. Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Margolis R.L. Trifiro M.A. Singaraja R. McCutcheon K. Salvesen G.S.

Atrophin-1 is one of at least 40 cellular caspase substrates identified, and its function, as well as its contribution to the apoptotic process, is unknown. Atrophin-1 contains a consensus caspase-3 cleavage site (14Wellington C.L. Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Margolis R.L. Trifiro M.A. Singaraja R. McCutcheon K. Salvesen G.S. Propp S.S. Bromm M.

The cleavage products generated during caspase-3 cleavage of in vitro translated atrophin-1 migrated at 145 and 150 kDa for constructs with 26 and 65 glutamines, respectively (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2 and 6). These COOH-terminal fragments contain the polyglutamine tract and would be expected to lack the predicted nuclear targeting sequence located at the NH2terminus of the protein at amino acids 16–32 (see Fig. 1 B). NH2-terminal sequencing of the DRPLA cleavage product confirmed that atrophin-1 was cleaved at Asp109. To analyze the functional significance of caspase cleavage we prepared constructs of DRPLA without a caspase cleavage site. Mutation of the caspase P1 residue in atrophin-1 from Asp109 to Asn abolished the processing of the in vitro translated atrophin-1 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 8) by caspases. Because we have shown previously that atrophin-1 can be cleaved by caspase-1, caspase-7, and caspase-8 in addition to caspase-3, we evaluated whether the Asp109 mutation abolished cleavage by multiple caspases present in transfected cells by Western blotting (Fig. 1 C). Caspase cleavage products were observed in 293T cells transiently transfected with DRPLA26 or DRPLA65 after tamoxifen treatment, showing that tamoxifen challenge induced caspase activation in cells transfected with these constructs. In contrast, no cleavage products were generated in cells transfected with DRPLA26D109N or DRPLA65D109N after tamoxifen treatment. These results show that we have prepared atrophin-1 proteins resistant to caspase cleavage in vitro and in transfected cells. Therefore, we utilized these constructs to test whether this site influences the cytotoxicity of atrophin-1 in cell culture. We have recently developed an in vitro tissue culture model to investigate the cellular toxicity of polyglutamine repeat expansion disease proteins (15Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Propp S.S. Ellerby H.M. Rabizadeh S. Neil R. Cashman N.R. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Wellington C.L. Salvesen G.S. Hayden M.R. Bredesen D.E. J.

Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In this system, a sublethal stress is induced by tamoxifen in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells. A sublethal stress in these studies is defined as a stress delivered by a concentration of a pro-apoptotic agent that does not result in the processing of caspase-3 in plasmid control transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, treatment of 293T cells with tamoxifen at a concentration of 35 μm does not lead to processing of caspase-3 over a 24-h period of time. Higher concentrations of tamoxifen (>40 μm) result in apoptotic cell death based on acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining of the cells (data not shown) and the processing of caspase-3 (Fig. 2 B). To investigate the cytotoxicity of atrophin-1, we transiently transfected 293T cells with expression constructs encoding the human atrophin-1 gene with a normal CAG repeat length (DRPLA26) and an expanded CAG repeat length (DRPLA65). These cells were then treated with sublethal concentrations of tamoxifen (35 μm) 36 h after transfection. Untransfected 293T cells do not express atrophin-1, and lack of expression in transfected cells was verified by immunofluorescence and Western analysis. 293T cells expressing DRPLA26 induced significantly higher proportions of apoptotic cell death than vector controls (Fig. 3 A) when cells were exposed to tamoxifen. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant increase in cell death and corresponding caspase activity (Fig. 3 B) when the polyglutamine repeat length was expanded (DRPLA26 versus DRPLA65), indicating a gain of function for the disease-associated form of atrophin-1 protein. Western analysis verified equal expression of each of the atrophin-1 proteins. Interestingly, the expression of DRPLA26 is pro-apoptotic when exposed to an apoptotic stress. Because the function of atrophin-1 protein is unknown, it is difficult to speculate how overexpression of normal atrophin-1 enhances cellular death. However, there is a growing body of literature suggesting that many of the caspase substrates can act to enhance or block apoptotic cell death upon cleavage by caspases. For example, cleavage of presenilin-2 results in the generation of an anti-apoptotic cleavage product (36Vito P. Ghayur T. Dadamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28315-28320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of the caspase substrate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase results in the generation of a pro-apoptotic fragment that enhances caspase activation through a positive feedback loop (27Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have reported recently that the truncated fragment of Huntington disease containing the normal polyglutamine repeat is pro-apoptotic (17Martindale D. Hackam A. Wieczorek A. Ellerby L.M. Wellington C. McCutcheon K. Devon R. Sinaraja R. Bredesen D. Tufaro F. Hayden M.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that DRPLA65 is more pro-apoptotic than DRPLA26, which indicates that the gain of function related to CAG length may influence downstream events in apoptosis. Next, we assessed the effect of blocking caspase cleavage of DRPLA26 and DRPLA65 on the pro-apoptotic effects of these proteins in culture. As shown in Fig. 3, transient transfection of DRPLA26D109N and DRPLA65D109N resulted in almost complete suppression of apoptotic cell death when compared with DRPLA26 and DRPLA65. Therefore, proteins with the same CAG length which are no longer cleaved by caspases have decreased toxicity. Because our cytotoxicity studies indicated that the caspase cleavage site is crucial to the pro-apoptotic effect of atrophin-1, we investigated whether apoptosis induction with tamoxifen modulated the formation of aggregates. Intracellular neuronal inclusions may be a common property for glutamine repeat expansion diseases (37Nishiyama K. Nakamura K. Murayama S. Yamada M. Kanazawa I. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Aggregates have been reported recently in the brains of patients with DRPLA and are similar to those observed in Huntington disease (16Di Figlia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P.

Sharp A.H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 387-395Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of transiently transfected 293T cells or COS-7 cells indicated that atrophin-1 is localized at the outer border of the nucleus, consistent with its putative nuclear localization signal (Fig. 4 A). This result differs from earlier work that has suggested that atrophin-1 is localized to the cytoplasm (20Igarashi S. Koide R. Shimohata T. Yamada M. Hayashi Y. Takano H. Date H. Oyake M. Sato T. Sato A. Egawa S. Ikeuchi T. Tanaka H. Nakano R. Tanaka K. Hozumi I. Inuzuka T. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 39Ross C.A. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Some of these earlier studies used epitope-tagged proteins in which the epitope may have interfered with the nuclear targeting signal. Expression of DRPLA65, but not DRPLA26, led to formation of densely stained nuclei (granular in appearance) with altered nuclear distribution upon apoptosis induction compared with the controls (atrophin-1-transfected cells not treated with tamoxifen), as determined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4, Aand C). Normal atrophin-1 protein is localized to the outer edge of the nuclei before and after apoptotic stimulation, whereas the disease-associated form of atrophin-1 leads to dense, particulate staining throughout the nuclei during apoptotic stimulation. Further analysis (Fig. 5) of the disease-associated form of atrophin-1 demonstrates that atrophin-1 colocalizes with DAPI-stained nuclei during apoptotic stimulation with tamoxifen (Fig. 5, A–C), and confocal images under high magnification show that the aggregates are nuclear (Fig. 5,D–F). Thus, the disease-associated form of atrophin-1 shows an altered pattern of nuclear distribution compared with the normal form of atrophin-1. Modulation of aggregate formation did not occur in the absence of apoptosis induction for DRPLA65-transfected cells (data not shown) during the first 48 h after transfection. Interestingly, longer periods of time after transfection (>72 h) resulted in increased formation of cytoplasmic aggregates. These aggregates were larger in the DRPLA65-transfected cells and occurred with higher frequency (Fig. 6).Figure 5Subcellular localization of atrophin-1 with expanded repeats in transfected 293T cells treated with tamoxifen.

Images were collected with a confocal microscope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because aggregate formation was modulated by the stimulation of apoptosis, we next assessed whether mutation of the caspase cleavage site in DRPLA65 blocks formation of aggregates. Cells transfected with pcDNA3-DRPLA26 expressed atrophin-1 protein that was localized to the outer edge of the nucleus with a homogeneous pattern during apoptotic cell death with tamoxifen (Fig. 4 A). Cells transfected with pcDNA3-DRPLA65 showed granular dense straining throughout the nucleus (Fig. 4 C) during apoptotic cell death. In sharp contrast, cells transfected with pcDNA3-DRPLA65D109N did not show altered nuclear distribution and granular dense staining, suggesting that, at least in this system, caspase cleavage of DRPLA is required for aggregation (Fig. 4,B and D). It is of relevance to compare our results with those found for SCA1, given that it is also a nuclear protein yet does not appear to be cleaved by caspases. Interestingly, recent studies on SCA1 show that the subcellular localization of wild-type ataxin-1 differs from the mutant ataxin-1 both in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type ataxin-1 localizes to the nucleus in COS-1 cells (40Skinner P.J. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Klement I.A. Helin K. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nature. 1997; 389: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), whereas mutant ataxin-1 shows a specific redistribution or disruption of the nuclear structure. In these studies there was no evidence that apoptosis modulated the formation of aggregates, which is consistent with our finding that ataxin-1 is not a caspase substrate.2 Ataxin-1 redistribution may be important for the pathogenic mechanism in this disease, and additional studies will determine whether this is similarly the case for atrophin-1. In this study, we show that cells transfected with expression constructs encoding atrophin-1 undergo enhanced apoptotic cell death that is mediated by a pro-apoptotic caspase cleavage product. In vitro mutagenesis of caspase cleavage site Asp109blocks production of this pro-apoptotic fragment and reduces cellular toxicity dramatically. This is consistent with our recent findings that expression of truncated huntingtin fragments resulted in significantly more cell death than the full-length huntingtin (17Martindale D. Hackam A.

Our results suggest that caspase cleavage is required for modulation of aggregate formation but does not determine whether aggregation is required for cellular toxicity. Recent work on ataxin-1 indicates that nuclear localization is critical for pathogenesis but not aggregation (41Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

In this model, initial cleavage by caspases or other proteases would produce a toxic fragment with a gain of toxic function, e.g. aggregation or altered protein-protein interactions. This generation of a toxic fragment would lead to increased activation of caspases through a feedback loop. In other words, the toxic fragments may function as caspase amplifiers. This amplification loop would be highly dependent upon the cellular context such as caspase/inhibitor distribution within the cell as well as protein-protein and/or protein-ligand interaction with each type of polyglutamine repeat protein (14Wellington C.L. Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Margolis R.L. Trifiro M.A. Singaraja R. McCutcheon K. Salvesen G.S. Propp S.S. Bromm M. Rowland K.J. Zhang T. Rasper D. Roy S. Thornberry N. Pinsky L. Kakizuka A. Ross C.A.

Further, amplification would also be dependent upon the ability of a particular cell type to evoke proteolytic pathways that remove this toxic caspase-amplifying fragment. These experiments have not addressed what is the initial trigger for caspase activation in the disease process but suggest that proteolysis is important for cytotoxicity. However, physiological stresses that are otherwise sublethal may in the presence of a caspase amplification mechanism lead to cell death. In addition, the results in this study do not exclude additional mechanisms for proteolytic cleavage of atrophin-1 or the other CAG-containing gene products generating a smaller toxic fragment. Furthermore, the results do not offer an explanation for the specific pattern of neuronal loss in CAG repeat diseases. It is possible that alterations in caspase expression, caspase inhibitors, partner proteins, or downstream targets may determine the selective vulnerability for each of the CAG repeat diseases. Further studies directed at identifying the specific caspase family members that process the CAG repeat disease proteins, as well as a study of the regional specificity of the caspases in the brain, should shed light on this question. Finally, because blocking the cleavage of atrophin-1 inhibits its pro-apoptotic effect, such a strategy may prove useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with polyglutamine repeat expansions. Extension of these results to animal models of polyglutamine expansion diseases should prove useful."

The first transporter sequences have been identified within the last 2 years. However, information about the secondary and tertiary structure for these molecules has been limited to theoretical considerations. In the present study, an epitope-insertion approach was used to investigate the membrane topology of the CMP-sialic acid transporter. Immunofluorescence studies were carried out to analyze the orientation of the introduced epitopes in semipermeabilized cells. Both an amino-terminally introduced FLAG sequence and a carboxyl-terminal hemagglutinin tag were found to be oriented toward the cytosol. Results obtained with CMP-sialic acid transporter variants that contained the hemagglutinin epitope in potential intermembrane loop structures were in good correlation with the presence of 10 transmembrane regions. This building concept seems to be preserved also in other mammalian and nonmammalian nucleotide sugar transporters. Moreover, the functional analysis of the generated mutants demonstrated that insertions in or very close to membrane-spanning regions inactivate the transport process, whereas those in hydrophilic loop structures have no detectable effect on the activity.

Surprisingly high sequence homology has been found between the mammalian transporters for CMP-sialic acid, UDP-Gal, and UDP-GlcNAc (8Ishida N. Miura N. Yoshioka S. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Guillen E. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7888-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas the conservation between transporters of identical specificity in different biological kingdoms can be low (9Guillen E. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7888-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, cloning of transporters was achieved by complementation, and the cDNAs isolated were demonstrated to correct the mutant phenotype. Transport activity, however, has only been proven for the murine CMP-Sia-Tr, which could be functionally expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14Berninsone P. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12616-12619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because yeast cells lack sialic acids, this result clearly demonstrates that the cloned cDNA in fact encodes the CMP-Sia-Tr and not an accessory protein required in the transport process. Moreover, the canine UDP-GlcNAc-Tr, although only 22% identical to the yeast orthologue, has been isolated by expression cloning in the UDP-GlcNAc-Tr negative mutant of Kluyveromyces lactis. This result allows us to speculate that structural elements involved in specific substrate recognition are formed via the tertiary and/or quaternary organization of the transport proteins. Limited information is available on the regulation of CMP-sialic acid translocation, or on how variations in the translocation rates influence sialylation reactions in the Golgi lumen. It is well established that lumenal CMP stimulates CMP-sialic acid uptake by Golgi vesicles, indicating antiport of CMP and CMP-sialic acid (15Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, CMP-sialic acid is also translocated in the absence of CMP (14Berninsone P. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12616-12619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Milla M.E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and CMP and derivatives of CMP-sialic acid have been shown to compete with CMP-sialic acid translocation if added onto the cytosolic side of the Golgi membrane (16Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These reagents could therefore be used to block the sialylation of cell surfaces. Artificial reduction of cell surface sialylation via application of CMP-sialic acid derivatives has been demonstrated to reduce growth and metastasis of tumor cells (17Harvey B.E. Thomas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, because sialic acids provide recognition and receptor structures for viral and bacterial pathogens (for review, see Ref. 18Kelm S. Schauer R. Jeon K.W. Jarvik J.W. International Review of Cytology: A Survey of Cell Biology. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1997: 137-240Google Scholar), reversible inhibition of cell surface sialylation has been discussed as a perspective to protect healthy cells against these invasive organisms. Understanding structure-function relationships of nucleotide sugar transporters requires knowledge of the three dimensional organization in the plane of the lipid bilayer. The first important step toward this aim is the determination of the membrane topology. Hydrophobicity analyses of the nucleotide sugar transporters cloned to date suggest between 6 and 10 transmembrane domains and the use of secondary structure prediction algorithms proposed models with eight transmembrane domains for both CMP-Sia-Tr and UDP-galactose transporter (6Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Miura N. Ishida N. Hoshino M. Yamauchi M. Hara T. Ayusawa D. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to develop a detailed topological model of the CMP-Sia-Tr. An epitope-insertion approach was used to map membrane orientation. This approach, in contrast to other methods (e.g. methods using truncated proteins fused to reporter proteins), takes into account that even small changes in sequences surrounding transmembrane domains can alter the membrane topology (19Zhang J.T. Lee C.H. Duthie M. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1742-1746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and that it is therefore important to confirm unaltered membrane orientation of the analyzed protein by the remaining activity. The results of this study strongly suggest a 10-transmembrane domain topology in which amino and carboxyl termini are oriented toward the cytosol. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 12CA5, directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope YPYDVPDYASL, was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and mAb M5, directed against the FLAG sequence MDYKDDDDK, was from Eastman Kodak, New Haven. Polysialic acid (PSA)-specific mAb 735 has been described (20Frosch M. Görgen I. Boulnois G.J. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Secondary antibodies anti-mouse Ig-alkaline phosphatase-conjugate, anti-mouse Ig (DTAF)-conjugate and anti-rabbit Ig-tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate conjugate were from Dianova. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant 8G8 had been isolated from ethylmethane sulfonate-treated CHO-K1 cells (22Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and was found to belong to the Lec2 complementation group, comprising cells with defects in the CMP-Sia-Tr gene (5Eckhardt M.

CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Seromed) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Seromed) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Mouse CMP-Sia-Tr, with carboxyl-terminal HA tag and amino-terminal FLAG sequence, respectively, were generated as described previously (5Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using the FLAG-tagged construct as template, overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction (24Higiuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar) was used to generate two series of insertion mutants, the N constructs (N1–N15) and the HA constructs. For the production of N construct, primers were designed that introduced the sequence GGATCCAACGCTAGC at selected sites of the CMP-Sia-Tr (see Table I). This sequence, which encodes the pentapeptide GSNAS, introduces BamHI and NheI restriction sites and harbors a potential N-glycosylation site. The newly introduced restriction sites were then used to produce HA constructs by ligating a linker encoding the HA epitope (HA1-HA15). The linker was prepared by annealing the 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides HA sense (5′-GATCCTACCCTTATGACGTCCCCGATTACGCCAGCCTGG-3′) and HA antisense (5′-CTAGCCAGGCTGGCGTAATCGGGGACGTCATAAGGGTAG-3′). In the final constructs, the peptide sequence GSYPYDVPDYASLAS was inserted after the amino acid residue indicated in Table I (the epitope of mAb 12CA5 is underlined). Construct HA16 was generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction, directly introducing the HA encoding sequence (see above) between nucleotides 270 and 271 of the CMP-Sia-Tr coding sequence. A carboxyl-terminal truncated version of construct HA12 was prepared by digestion with NheI, fill-in with Klenow enzyme, and religation, resulting in HA12STOP with a stop codon immediately downstream of the HA epitope. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Table ISummary of the results obtained with HA epitope-tagged CMP-Sia-Tr analyzed in this studyConstructInsertion after amino acidHA epitope orientationComplementation of CHO 8G8 cellsSubcellular localizationN1YesHA1Ala-38LumenalYesGolgiN10YesHA10Gly-68CytosolicYesGolgiHA16Ala-75CytosolicYesGolgiN2YesHA2Gly-83CytosolicYesGolgiN9NoGolgi + ERHA9Asn-102NDaND, not detectable.NoGolgi + ERN14NoHA14Leu-109LumenalNoGolgiN3NoHA3Ala-114NDNoGolgiN15NoHA15Gln-118NDNoGolgiN11NoHA11Lys-124NDNoGolgiN13YesHA13Asn-137CytosolicYesGolgiN4YesHA4Ala-165LumenalYesGolgiN5YesHA5Ser-202CytosolicYesGolgiN6YesHA6Ile-233LumenalYesbcomplementation of 8G8 cells by transient transfection of construct HA6 was less efficient and varied between different experiments, strongly depending on transfection efficiency.GolgiN7NoHA7Tyr-266CytosolicNoGolgiN8NoHA8Ser-287NDNoGolgiN12NoHA12Gln-294NDNoGolgiHA12STOPGln-294NDNoGolgia ND, not detectable.b complementation of 8G8 cells by transient transfection of construct HA6 was less efficient and varied between different experiments, strongly depending on transfection efficiency. Open table in a new tab Cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells per 35-mm cell culture dish or at 1.5 × 106 per 10-cm dish. For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips. Epitope-tagged CMP-Sia-Tr cDNAs were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 μg cDNA was mixed with 6 μl (24 μl) LipofectAMINE in 1 ml Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) added to the cells that had been washed twice with Opti-MEM and incubated for 6–8 h. Transfections were stopped by adding 2 volumes of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and cells were analyzed 48 h later. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, again washed in PBS, and incubated for 20 min in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS to neutralize residual paraformaldehyde. Thereafter, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, 0.1% BSA in PBS for 15 min and incubated with the respective primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies used were anti-FLAG mAb M5 (5.4 μg/ml), anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (2.6 μg/ml), and rabbit anti-α-mannosidase II antiserum (1:2000) in 0.2% saponin, 0.1% BSA in PBS. After washing four times in 0.1% BSA/PBS, cells were incubated with anti-mouse Ig-DTAF (1:100) and anti-rabbit Ig-TRITC (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. The incubation was stopped by washing three times in 0.1% BSA/PBS. After a final wash in PBS, slides were briefly rinsed in water and mounted in moviol. Samples were visualized under a Zeiss Axiophot Epifluorescence microscope. To selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane of transfected CHO cells, we used low concentrations of digitonin (25Diaz R. Stahl P.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 25-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde as described above and washed three times with PBS, and the plasma membrane was permeabilized by incubating the cells for 15 min at 4 °C in 5 μg/ml digitonin, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 6.9. Thereafter, cells were washed three times with PBS, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. Control cells were treated in the same way, but 0.1% saponin was added to the blocking solution to achieve complete permeabilization. For staining, cells were processed as described above, but saponin was omitted from solutions containing primary antibodies. Microsomal fractions were isolated from postnuclear supernatants of transiently transfected cells by centrifugation for 1 h at 150,000 × g. Cells or microsomal fractions were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and mixed with an equal volume of 120 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. Lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting onto nitrocellulose as described (26Mühlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6943-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In case chemiluminescence detection was applied, samples were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Boehringer Mannheim). Membranes were incubated with mAb 12CA5 (2.6 μg/ml), M5 (5.4 μg/ml), or 735 (10 μg/ml), in 2% nonfat dry milk in PBS. Primary antibodies were detected with anti-mouse Ig-alkaline phosphate conjugate (Dianova) using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) as substrates. Alternatively, alkaline phosphatase was detected by chemiluminescence using disodium-3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo-[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenylphosphate (Boehringer Mannheim). Two days after transfection, cells were fixed in 50% methanol/50% acetone. Polysialic acid was detected by sequential incubation with mAb 735 (10 μg/ml) and anti-mouse Ig-alkaline phosphate conjugate in 2% nonfat dry milk in PBS, as described for Western blotting. Bound secondary antibodies were revealed using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in alkaline phosphatase buffer. Putative transmembrane-spanning regions and helix ends of CMP-Sia-Tr, human and yeast UDP-Gal-Tr and a related putative nucleotide sugar transporter of Caenorhabditis elegans were estimated by using the programs PredictProtein (27Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and interfacial hydrophobicity analysis (28White S.H. Jacobs R.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The murine CMP-Sia-Tr sequence was aligned to the human UDP-Gal-Tr, theSchizosaccharomyces pombe UDP-Gal-Tr and the relatedC. elegans protein ZK370.7 using CLUSTAL (29Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene. 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). Helix ends were estimated by assuming that helix ends in corresponding transmembrane domains of different transporters are identical, if the sequences surrounding the helix ends are highly conserved. When different results were obtained for different transporter sequences or with different algorithms, the most plausible distribution of charged and polar residues was fitted to the experimental results. The murine wild-type CMP-Sia-Tr, with either amino-terminal FLAG or carboxyl-terminal HA tag, was transiently expressed in the Lec2 clone 8G8 (5Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the orientation of the epitope tags was determined by immunofluorescence using digitonin-permeabilized cells. Low concentrations of digitonin selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane because of its higher concentration of cholesterol compared with intracellular membranes (30Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were simultaneously stained with M5 and polyclonal α-mannosidase II antibodies or with mAb 12CA5 and polyclonal α-mannosidase II antibodies. Because the α-mannosidase II antiserum recognizes the catalytic domain of the enzyme exclusively (31Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), this staining could be used to control the integrity of Golgi membranes after permeabilization. As shown in Figs.1 A and2 A, both mAb 12CA5 and mAb M5 recognize their epitopes in digitonin-treated cells, whereas no α-mannosidase II staining was detectable (Figs. 1 B and2 B). After saponin permeabilization, all antibodies reached their epitopes, but the intensity of the staining with mAbs 12CA5 and M5 was not increased (Figs. 1, A and C, and 2,A and C), demonstrating that HA and FLAG epitopes were fully accessible in semipermeabilized cells. These results clearly demonstrate that CMP-Sia-Tr is composed of an even number of transmembrane domains, with amino and carboxyl termini oriented toward the cytosol.Figure 2Orientation of the amino terminus of CMP-Sia-Tr. CHO cells were grown on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with the amino-terminally FLAG-tagged mouse CMP-Sia-Tr using LipofectAMINE. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and incubated in 5 μg/ml digitonin to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane (A andB) or in saponin (C and D). Thereafter cells were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using the anti-FLAG mAb M5 (A and C). Simultaneously, all cells were stained with α-mannosidase II antiserum (B D). Bound primary antibodes were visualized using anti-mouse Ig-DTAF and anti-rabbit Ig-TRITC conjugates. Again, inaccessibility of the α-mannosidase II antiserum to its antigen revealed that the Golgi membrane was not permeabilized by digitonin treatment. Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The orientation of amino and carboxyl termini as evaluated in the first experiment was in agreement with the predicted model of the CMP-Sia-Tr (6Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this model to select putative intermembrane loops for the generation of insertion mutants (Fig. 3). In the first set of mutants, a short nucleotide sequence that encodes the pentapeptide GSNAS was introduced at various positions of the amino-terminally FLAG-tagged murine CMP-Sia-Tr. The resulting mutants received the name N constructs, because the inserted pentapeptide contained the consensus motif for N-glycosylation. The foreign nucleotide sequence, in addition, introduced unique endonuclease restriction sites, which in a second step could be used to ligate a linker that encodes the HA epitope consisting of the amino acid sequence GSYPYDVPDYASLAS. The latter constructs received the name HA constructs. All insertion mutants are summarized in Table I. To evaluate the membrane topology of the CMP-Sia-Tr, the HA constructs were transiently expressed in CHO 8G8 cells (5Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the orientation of the HA epitope was determined by immunofluorescence with the mAb 12CA5 in permeable (saponin-treated) and semipermeable (digitonin-treated) cells. Simultaneous staining with the α-mannosidase II antiserum served as a control for the integrity of Golgi membranes in digitonin-treated cells. The HA epitopes inserted at amino acid positions 38 (HA1), 109 (HA14), 165 (HA4), and 233 (HA6) could be detected after saponin but not after digitonin treatment of the cells (Fig. 4, 12CA5), indicating that the tags in these constructs are part of lumenal loops. In contrast, the HA epitopes introduced in mutants HA2, HA13, HA5, and HA7 (insertions were at amino acid positions 83, 137, 202, and 266, respectively) were detectable in both semipermeabilized and saponin-treated cells, demonstrating cytosolic orientation. Together, these results identified the hydrophobic regions I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, V, and VI (see Fig. 3 C) as membrane-spanning domains. Moreover, the cytosolic orientation of the HA epitope in construct HA2 and the lumenal orientation of the tag in construct HA14 clearly show that amino acids between these regions, despite of the relatively weak hydrophobic character, span the Golgi membrane. The co-localization of the transporter mutants with α-mannosidase II (Fig. 4, comparethird and fourth columns) indicates that Golgi targeting was not affected. The transporter variants HA9, HA3, HA15, HA11, HA8, and HA12 (see Figs.3 C and 8 A) were undetectable in immunofluorescence studies with mAb 12CA5; however, expression and localization could be displayed with the anti-FLAG mAb M5 (examples are displayed in Fig. 5). In the case of HA9, only few transfected cells were detectable by immunofluorescence (see Fig. 5), and the protein was not visible in Western blot (see Fig. 7). All other variants were stained with mAb 12CA5 and migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa (see Fig. 7). The inaccessibility of the HA tags HA9, HA3, HA15, HA11, HA8, and HA12 in immunofluorescence suggests that these epitopes are inserted into transmembrane domains, or, as in the case of construct HA3, they are in close proximity to the membrane. Co-localization with α-mannosidase II was found for all constructs, but HA9 was partially retained in the ER. Correct targeting of the transporter mutants is consistent with their correct folding.Figure 5Localization of HA-tagged CMP-Sia-Tr.HA-tagged CMP-Sia-Trs that were undetectable with mAb 12CA5 were transiently transfected into CHO cells. Two days after transfection, cells were saponin permeabilized and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis using anti-HA mAb 12CA5 or anti-FLAG mAb M5. All cells stained with mAb M5 were simultaneously stained with α-mannosidase II antiserum. Results similar to those for HA11 and HA3 were obtained for constructs HA15, HA8, and HA12 (data not shown).

We compared CADTK regulation with that of the highly homologous focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (FAK). First, we generated site-specific CADTK mutants. Mutation of Tyr402 eliminated autophosphorylation and significantly decreased kinase activity. Mutation of Tyr881, a putative Src kinase phosphorylation site predicted to bind Grb2, had little effect on CADTK regulation. Src family tyrosine kinases resulted in CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation even when co-expressed with the Tyr402/Tyr881 double mutant, suggesting that Src/Fyn etc. phosphorylate additional tyrosine residues. Interestingly, CADTK tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK when both were transiently expressed, but FAK did not phosphorylate CADTK. Biochemical experiments confirmed direct CADTK phosphorylation of FAK. This phosphorylation utilized tyrosine residues other than Tyr397, Tyr925, or Tyr576/Tyr577, suggesting that new SH2-binding sites might be created by CADTK-dependent FAK phosphorylation. Last, expression of the CADTK carboxyl terminus (CRNK) abolished CADTK but not FAK autophosphorylation. In contrast, FAK carboxyl terminus overexpression inhibited both FAK and CADTK autophosphorylation, suggesting that a FAK-dependent cytoskeletal function may be necessary for CADTK activation. Thus, CADTK and FAK, which both bind to some, but not necessarily the same, cytoskeletal elements, may be involved in coordinate regulation of cytoskeletal structure and signaling.

CADTK and FAK are highly homologous, sharing an overall 45% amino acid sequence identity with 60% identity in the catalytic domain. Several tyrosine residues appear to be conserved between CADTK and FAK, including a Src family tyrosine kinase SH2-binding site. Furthermore, CADTK, like FAK, contains proline-rich motifs capable of SH3 domain interaction and a putative focal adhesion targeting domain. Immunostaining of CADTK and expression of GFP-tagged CADTK revealed that CADTK localizes to the focal adhesion region. In cells expressing both FAK and CADTK, both proteins appear to co-localize near the focal adhesion membrane attachment sites, however, CADTK extends further into the cell, e.g. CADTK extends onto actin stress fibers in smooth muscle cells (16Brinson A.E.

Harding, X. Li, L. Grave, and S. Earp, manuscript in preparation. Given the high degree of structural and amino acid sequence similarity, CADTK and FAK may well have some similar or even interchangeable biological functions. In fact, well studied mouse fibroblast cell lines appear to express only FAK and not CADTK. In contrast, we and others have recently shown that normal circulating monocytes, as well as T and B cells, express only CADTK (23Li X. Hunter D. Morris J. Haskill J.S. Earp H.S. J. Biol.

When expressed together the major difference between the two enzymes was easily detected, FAK is constitutively active in resting, adherent cells while CADTK is dephosphorylated and inactive until stimulated by agonists, i.e. CADTK regulation is more dynamic in the sense that it rapidly responds to extracellular signals. In this report, we examined the tyrosine autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity of CADTK and variants constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and compare them to previous structure/function data obtained with FAK. CADTK and FAK were tyrosine phosphorylated by Src family tyrosine kinases; the sites of CADTK are not necessarily those previously thought to be Src targets on FAK. Intriguingly, we showed that CADTK tyrosine phosphorylated FAK bothin vivo and in vitro while FAK did not phosphorylate CADTK. Again, sites other than major autophosphorylation or putative Src target site appeared to be involved. Last, by transiently co-expressing the carboxyl terminus of CADTK (CRNK) and the carboxyl terminus of FAK (FRNK) with wild type CADTK or FAK, we demonstrated that FRNK inhibited both FAK and CADTK tyrosine autophosphorylation, while CRNK inhibited only CADTK autophosphorylation. Our results demonstrate that although CADTK and FAK are regulated differentially in cells expressing both proteins, they may, additionally, influence signal transduction from the other family member.

Human 293(T) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (39Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14341-14348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rat wtCADTK cDNA was used as a template to generate a series of CADTK mutants based on polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Stratagene). Mutated CADTK cDNAs were amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with complementary DNA mutagenic oligonucleotides for designed mutations (K457A, D567N, Y402F, Y881F, K457A/Y402F, Y579F/Y580F CADTK). The human FAK cDNA was used to make the mutants Y397F, Y576F/Y577F, and Y925F FAK by the same method. All the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (University of North Carolina, Sequence Facility). Cell lysates were prepared essentially as described previously (5Earp H.S. Huckle W.R. Dawson T.L. Li X. Graves L.M. Dy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28440-28447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated with agonists were scraped into ice-cold cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 10%(v/v) glycerol with freshly added 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 μg/ml phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 kallikrein inhibitor units of aprotinin/ml). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and their protein content determined by Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), pcDNA3-CADTK, pcDNA3-wtCADTK, pcDNA3-FAK, pCMV-FRNK, pcDNA3-Yes, PXM139-Fyn, Lck, Syk, and ZAP70 were transfected or co-transfected into human 293(T) cells with Fugene6 according to the manufacturer's procedure (Boehringer Mannheim). After 48 h, transfected cells were harvested and lysed, and the lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P), anti-CADTK, anti-FAK, or by a tyrosine kinase activity assay. In a typical experiment, ∼500 μg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated by incubation with the antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads were then added for 1 more hour. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon (Millipore), and incubated with the selected antibody. Immunoblots were developed with ECL according to the manufacturer's procedure (Amersham). Immunoblots were stripped in buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 50 °C for 30 min and reprobed with another antibody. Immune complex tyrosine kinase and autokinase assays were performed as previously reported (3Huckle W.R. Dy R.C. Earp H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8837-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, immune complex suspensions were preincubated for 5 min at 4 °C with 160 μg of the synthetic tyrosine kinase substrate poly(Glu4:Tyr) (Sigma) or the control substrate poly(Glu). Additional experiments were performed using a GST NH2terminus of human FAK fusion protein encompassing amino acids 1 to 426 (5 μg per assay) as a substrate. Reactions (80 μl of total reaction volume) were initiated by adding of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5 μm) After 15 min at 25 °C, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted on P81 Whatman paper. The papers were washed once with 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate in 10% trichloroacetic acid and twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, air-dried, and assayed by liquid scintillation counting. For GST NH2-terminal FAK phosphorylation, the assays were stopped with SDS stop solution, run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subjected to autoradiography. Assessment of the ability of CADTK and FAK to directly cross-phosphorylate was performed using an in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation assay. Briefly, CADTK-GFP, kdCADTK, kdFAK, and control vector were transiently expressed in 293(T) cells, independently. Equal amounts of cell lysates were mixed before adding specific antibodies. Cell lysate mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h followed by addition of protein A/G-agarose beads. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase assay buffer before providing [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. After removing the supernatant, SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer was added to the immunocomplexes and they were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. These experiments were repeated using wild type CADTK and separating phosphorylated CADTK (p115) and FAK (p125) on 8% low bis-acrylamide gels and by immunoprecipitating both CADTK-GFP and kdFAK, using buffers with 0.1% SDS in the washes. Tyr397is a major FAK tyrosine autophosphorylation site (44Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site dramatically inhibited FAK tyrosine autophosphorylation and decreased tyrosine kinase activity by 50% (45Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Autophosphorylated Tyr397 serves as an SH2 domain docking site for the recruitment of Src family tyrosine kinases (44Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol.

Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 15: 2819-2827Google Scholar), which in turn may tyrosine phosphorylate FAK on Tyr925 (49Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5623-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) or other tyrosine residues (45Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Guided by amino acid sequence similarity to FAK, we mutated homologous CADTK tyrosine residues to investigate their effects on CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity. In addition, to create “kinase deficient” CADTK, we separately mutated two CADTK residues important in Mg2+-ATP binding, Lys457 and Asp567, changing them to Ala and Asn, respectively. For comparison, we also made similar mutations in the human FAK cDNA. Both wild type and mutant cDNAs were transiently expressed in 293(T) cells and their tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activity was assessed. As shown in Fig.1 A, mutation of the CADTK Mg2+-ATP-binding site residues (K457A or D567N) abolished tyrosine kinase activity as assessed by poly(Glu4:Tyr) phosphorylation as well as CADTK tyrosine autophosphorylation (Fig.1 B), suggesting that these two residues are each required for CADTK kinase activity. Mutation of Tyr402(corresponding to the Src family binding site, Tyr397) also abolished CADTK tyrosine autophosphorylation, severely depressing but not completely inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity (∼70% decrease). These data suggest that Tyr402, like Tyr397 in FAK, is the major tyrosine autophosphorylation site. Its phosphorylation is important but not absolutely required for tyrosine kinase activity. Mutation of adjacent tyrosine residues Tyr579/Tyr580 in the catalytic domain of CADTK (corresponding to FAK Tyr576/Tyr577) significantly decreased CADTK tyrosine autophosphorylation and reduced kinase activity by ∼60%. These data, taken together with the Y402F mutant data, suggest that Tyr579/Tyr580 are not major tyrosine autophosphorylation sites but that transient tyrosine phosphorylation of these sites may be required for full or continued CADTK activation. Mutation of Tyr881 (corresponding to FAK Tyr925, the site of Grb2 SH2 domain association) had little or no effect on CADTK tyrosine autophosphorylation or tyrosine kinase activity. Thus, autophosphorylation appears to involve Tyr402 but not Tyr881. Finally, double mutants, K457A/Y402F and Y402F/Y881F, produced the same effect as the single mutants, K457A and Y402F, respectively, suggesting that the single mutation of K457A and Y402F produced the dominant effect. CADTK tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine autophosphorylation data were generally concordant, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with kinase activity. Comparison of the effects of corresponding CADTK and FAK mutations (45Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that the structure-function regulatory mechanisms of these two tyrosine kinases are similar. To further examine the regulation of these two kinases, the kinase-deficient CADTK (kdCADTK), K457A CADTK, and kinase-deficient FAK (kdFAK) K454A FAK were transiently co-expressed with the Src family tyrosine kinase members, Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lck. As shown in Fig.2, Src, Fyn, and Yes dramatically increased CADTK (Fig. 2 A) and FAK (Fig. 2 B) tyrosine phosphorylation, while Lck had little effect (particularly on CADTK). These data suggest that CADTK and FAK signaling may be similarly affected by Src family tyrosine kinases, presumably by phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues. However, Src and Fyn were also capable of substantially phosphorylating the Y402F/Y881F CADTK double mutant (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that other tyrosine residue(s) must be significant targets for Src family tyrosine kinases. Moreover, at least when co-expressed, neither activated Src, wild type Fyn, nor Yes required a Tyr402 docking site on CADTK to tyrosine phosphorylate CADTK. Last, transient co-expression of two important hematopoietic cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, Syk or ZAP70, with kdCADTK did not inc"
https://openalex.org/W2089352446,"G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) are activated by a direct interaction with Gβγ subunits and also by raised internal [Na+]. Both processes require the presence of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2). Here we show that the proximal C-terminal region of GIRK2 mediates the Na+-dependent activation of both the GIRK2 homomeric channels and the GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channels. Within this region, GIRK2 has an aspartate at position 226, whereas GIRK1 has an asparagine at the equivalent position (217). A single point mutation, D226N, in GIRK2, abolished the Na+-dependent activation of both the homomeric and heteromeric channels. Neutralizing a nearby negative charge, E234S had no effect. The reverse mutation in GIRK1, N217D, was sufficient to restore Na+-dependent activation to the GIRK1N217D/GIRK2D226N heteromeric channels. The D226N mutation did not alter either the single channel properties or the ability of these channels to be activated via the m2-muscarinic receptor. PIP2 dramatically increased the open probability of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels in the absence of Na+ or Gβγ but did not preclude further activation by Na+, suggesting that Na+ is not acting simply to promote PIP2binding to GIRKs. We conclude that aspartate 226 in GIRK2 plays a crucial role in Na+-dependent gating of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels.

This mechanism mediates the coupling of m2-muscarinic receptors with GIRK channels in the atria, and the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents by neurotransmitters acting on GABAB, 5HT1A and A1 receptors, in hippocampal neurons (4Luscher C.

More recently, other regulators of GIRK channels have been identified, which can activate these channels in the absence of G proteins. Recombinant GIRK1/GIRK4 channels and the native atrial channels were shown by Suiet al. (5Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to be activated by a rise in cytosolic [Na+], with a threshold for activation of 3–10 mm and an EC50 of ∼40 mm. In isolated membrane patches, activation by Na+ required the hydrolysis of ATP. Subsequently, Sui et al. (6Sui J.L. Petit Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) mimics the ATP effects and that depletion or block of PIP2 inhibits the activation of GIRK channels by both Gβγ and Na+. Huang et al. (7Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) reported similar findings and showed also that activation of GIRK channels, by applying PIP2 in the presence of Na+, precluded further activation by Gβγ. Activation by internal Na+ is not unique to atrial GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channels have also been shown to be activated by 20 mm Na+ in the presence of ATP (8Lesage F.

G proteins have been shown to interact with both the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions of GIRK subunits. Huang et al. (12Huang C.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) made a series of GIRK1 C-terminal fusion proteins and reported that the region between amino acids 318 and 462 was involved in binding purified Gβγ. A recent study by Krapivinsky et al. (13Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) identified a single region within the C-terminal tail of GIRK4 that lies in close proximity to the second transmembrane segment (TM2) (amino acids 209–245) as being critical for Gβγ binding and channel activation. A point mutation within the proximal C terminus of GIRK4, substituting threonine for cysteine 216, drastically reduced the potency of Gβγ in activating not only GIRK4 homomeric channels but also GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromeric channels (13Krapivinsky G.

The aim of our study was to identify the region of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels that mediates their activation by internal Na+. Using a chimeric approach, combined with site directed mutagenesis of the GIRK subunits, we have identified the proximal C-terminal region of GIRK2 as playing a crucial role in the Na+-dependent activation of both GIRK2 homomeric and GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channels. Within this region, GIRK2 has an aspartate at position 226, which is conserved in GIRK4, but is an asparagine in GIRK1. Substituting asparagine for aspartate 226 in GIRK2, abolished Na+-dependent activation of both the homomeric and GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channels without affecting their ability to be activated via the m2-muscarinic receptors. The reverse mutation in the GIRK1 subunit (N217D) was sufficient to recover Na+-dependent activation of the heteromeric channel. Standard PCR procedures were used to construct a strong Kozak consensus sequence GCCGCCACC immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon in cDNA clones for GIRK1 and GIRK2. We used the longer of the GIRK2 splice variants, which contains 423 amino acids (14Bond C.T. Ammala C. Ashfield R. Blair T.A. Gribble F. Khan R.N. Lee K. Proks P. Rowe I.C. Sakura H. Ashford M.J. Adelman J.P. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These constructs were then subcloned into theEcoRI site of the pBG7.2 vector, which provides the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopus β-globin gene. GIRK4 was also subcloned into the pBG7.2 vector, and the human muscarinic m2 receptor was inserted into pBluescript KS(II)+. The construction of chimeras 1211 and 1222 was as described in Stevens et al.(15Stevens E.B. Woodward R. Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 547-562Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, silent restriction sites were introduced forAflII and BssHII into the GIRK2 cDNA at positions corresponding to amino acids 87 and 199, respectively. These sites lie at the beginning of the first proposed membrane-spanning segment (TM1) and just downstream of the second membrane-spanning segment (TM2). GIRK1 has a BssHII site at the equivalent position (amino acid 190), downstream of TM2, and in addition, anAflII site was introduced at the DNA sequence corresponding to amino acid position 78. Standard subcloning, in which the N- and C-terminal hydrophilic regions of GIRK1 and GIRK2 were substituted individually and together, generated 1211 and 1222 chimeric constructs. For construction of 1221 and 1212 chimeras, an NheI restriction site was introduced into chimera 1211 chimera at the position corresponding to amino acid 361 using standard PCR methods. GIRK2 cDNA has an NheI site at the equivalent position (amino acid 370). 1221 and 1212 chimeric constructs were generated by exchanging the transmembrane and proximal C-terminal regions of 1211 and 1222 using AflII and NheI sites. Point mutants, GIRK2D226N and GIRK2E234S, were generated by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis using standard PCR methods. 1211N217D mutant was generated using GeneEditor™ in vitrosite-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). GIRK1N217D mutant was made by exchanging the transmembrane regions of GIRK1 and 1211N217D usingAflII and BssHII sites. The sequence of all PCR-amplified products and point mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Oocytes were surgically removed from female Xenopus laevis anesthetized with 0.3% (w/v) 3-amino benzoic acid (Sigma) and dissociated from connective tissue using 0.3% (w/v) collagenase (Sigma) in Ca2+-free buffer (mm): 82.5 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.6 with NaOH). Isolated oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl cRNAs dissolved in water. The in vitro transcription of cRNAs was as described previously in Stevens et al. (15Stevens E.B. Woodward R. Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 547-562Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A similar total amount of channel subunit cRNA was injected into each oocyte. In some experiments, the human m2-muscarinic receptor cRNA was coinjected. Oocytes were incubated in ND96 at 18 °C. Two electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed 3–6 days after microinjection using an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments), interfaced to a Macintosh Quadra 700 computer using an ITC16 AID board (Instrutech) with Pulse acquisition software (version 7.89; HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany). Microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl had resistances ranging between 0.5 and 2 megaohms. Oocytes were continually perfused with standard recording solution (mm): 90 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 1 HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH). Currents were recorded in the presence of 3 μm carbacol (CCh) before and after application of 1 mmBa2+. Current records were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 °C). Patch clamp experiments were performed using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier, and currents were recorded at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Patch pipettes had resistance of between 1 and 2 megaohms when filled with pipette solution and were coated with wax. Excised inside-out patch pipettes were transferred to a small chamber with a volume of ∼100 μl. Solutions were exchanged by perfusing through this small chamber a volume of 500 μl. Continuous records of channel activity were obtained at a holding potential of −80 mV. Ten-second ramp tests from −140 mV to +80 mV were performed throughout the recording to check that there were no noninwardly rectifying channels present in the patch. Data were acquired using Pulse acquisition software (version 8.11; HEKA Electronics). The pipettes solution contained (mm): 96 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2 and 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 with KOH; while the bath solution contained (mm): 96 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2 with KOH. Gadolinium at 100 μm was routinely added to the pipette solution to suppress native stretch-activated channel activity in the oocyte membrane. In some experiments, CCh at 3 μm was added to the pipette solution. NaCl (1–200 mm) or NMDG (10–100 mm) was added to 96 mm KCl bath solution without compensation for changes in osmolarity and ionic strength. Solutions containing MgATP were prepared fresh each day and the pH was readjusted to 7.2 after addition of MgATP. The concentration of free Mg2+ was maintained at ∼1.9 mm and calculated using EQCAL software (BioTools). PIP2 (a gift from R. Irvine) was purified from pig brain tissue. The stock of purified PIP2 was in chloroform (8.7 mm) and was kept at −20 °C in an air-tight glass container under nitrogen gas. Test solutions were prepared freshly before each experiment by evaporating the chloroform and redissolving in 100 μl of Mg2+-free 96 mm KCl bath solution under sonication for 1–2 min. The final concentration of PIP2 was adjusted by adding the appropriate volume of Mg2+-free 96 mm KCl bath solution. To measure channel activity, the mean current of each continuous recording segment was calculated by first subtracting the baseline current and then summing the amplitudes of all of the sample points and dividing by the number of sample points within the continuous recording segment (Igor Pro, version 3; Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). We did not correct for the small reduction in the unitary current amplitude at high [Na+]. For each Na+-activated dose-response experiment, the mean currents at different Na+ concentration were normalized to the response obtained in the presence of 100 mmNa+. For each Na+-inhibited dose-response experiment, the mean currents were normalized to the response obtained at 0 mm Na+. Dose-response curves were fitted to the Hill equation: normalized mean current = A + (B − A)/(1 + ([Na+]/C)h), whereA is the maximum, B is the offset, Cis either the EC50 or IC50, and h is the Hill coefficient. Single channel data were analyzed using TAC software to determine unitary current amplitudes and open time distributions (version 2.51; SKALAR Instruments, Seattle, WA). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. We measured the effects of raising internal [Na+] on GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Fig.1 A shows a multichannel recording firstly in the cell-attached mode and then following patch excision in a solution lacking ATP, GTP, and Na+. Channel activity ran down over a period of 1–2 min and was partly restored by application of 5 mm MgATP and further increased by application of 20 mm Na+ in the continued presence of ATP. In contrast, application of 20 mmNa+ in the absence of MgATP had little effect on channel activity (Fig. 1 B), and 5 mm AMP-PNP was unable to substitute for ATP in activating the channel. Even in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS plus 5 mm MgATP, application of 20 mm Na+ further increased channel activity (Fig. 1 C), and the effects of Na+ were not blocked by 100 μm GDPβS (Fig.1 D). Thus, Na+-dependent activation of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels appears to require ATP hydrolysis, but is independent of G proteins. Sui et al. (6Sui J.L. Petit Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) suggested that the production of PIP2 by hydrolysis of MgATP is responsible for the ATP dependence of GIRK1/GIRK4 channel activity. They applied 1 μm PIP2 in the absence of Na+ or Gβγ and showed little change in GIRK1/GIRK4 channel opening frequency, but a large increase in channel activity upon subsequent application of 20 mm Na+. We applied 50 μm PIP2 for 5 min in the absence of Na+ or Gβγ and saw a dramatic increase in the opening frequency of the channel (Fig. 1 E), with no apparent change in the single channel conductance. Subsequent application of 20 mm Na+ further increased the open probability (P open) by ∼2-fold (1.93 ± 0.16,n = 3). Thus PIP2 appears to be an activator of GIRK channels in the absence of either Na+ or Gβγ, but the actions of PIP2 do not preclude further activation by Na+. Fig. 2 shows the dose-response relationship for Na+-activation of GIRK1/GIRK2, GIRK2, and GIRK1/GIRK4 channels in the presence of 5 mm MgATP. The data were fitted with the Hill equation with EC50 values ranging between 27 and 44 mm. The Hill coefficients were close to 2 for GIRK1/GIRK2 and GIRK1/GIRK4 and close to 4 for the GIRK2 homomeric channels (Table I). This suggests that all four subunits within the homomeric GIRK2 channel complex bind Na+, whereas in the heteromeric channels, only two of the four subunits are Na+-sensitive. GIRK1 subunits do not form functional homomeric channels and so to test the possibility that GIRK1 subunits are Na+-insensitive, we looked at the effects of Na+ on a chimeric channel (1211) containing the N- and C-terminal tails of GIRK1 and the TM and H5 regions of GIRK2 (Fig. 2 C). We have shown previously that this chimeric subunit (previously called 121), expressed with the m2 receptor in Xenopus oocytes, gives rise to large ACh-induced currents (15Stevens E.B. Woodward R. Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 547-562Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to the GIRK1/GIRK2 or GIRK2 currents the 1211 currents were inhibited by increasing internal Na+, with an IC50 of ∼23 mm and a Hill coefficient of ∼1.0 (Fig. 2 D). This inhibition appears to be partly caused by a reduction in the single channel conductance at Na+ levels greater than 10 mm (Fig.2 E) and partly by a decrease in the channelP open. Interestinly the 1211 channels were more sensitive to MgATP than were the wild type channels. Application of 2 mm MgATP, in the absence of Na+ or GTP, caused a 4.9 ± 0.5 (n = 3)-fold increase in the Popen of 1211 channels (Fig. 2 F) and only a 2.1 ± 0.5 (n = 3)-fold increase in the Popen of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels. Thus, the loss of Na+-dependent activation does not appear to be caused by a decrease in the ATP sensitivity of the channel.Table IA summary of the Na+ sensitivity of wild type and mutant GIRK channelsChannelEC50IC50Hill coefficientnmmGroup IaGroup I is Na+-activated heteromeric channels.GIRK1/GIRK2271.77GIRK1/GIRK4442.05GIRK1/1222432.34GIRK1/1221281.64GIRK1/GIRK2E234S301.66GIRK1N217D/GIRK2D226N321.75Group IIbGroup II is Na+-activated homomeric channels.GIRK2374.251221373.84GIRK2E234S424.051211N217D373.64Group IIIcGroup III is Na+-inhibited channels.1211230.951212171.13GIRK2D226N180.96GIRK1/1212161.06GIRK1/GIRK2D226N291.34a Group I is Na+-activated heteromeric channels.b Group II is Na+-activated homomeric channels.c Group III is Na+-inhibited channels. Open table in a new tab NMDG had a similar effect to Na+ on the 1211 currents, and it also inhibited the GIRK1/GIKR2 currents. Fig. 2 G shows GIRK1/GIRK2 currents in the presence of increasing concentrations of NMDG and then following wash out. The inhibition by NMDG was fully reversible and the dose response relation was fitted with a Hill equation with an IC50 of ∼20 mm and a Hill coefficient of 1.2 (Fig. 2 H). These results suggest that Na+ may have a dual action on the GIRK1/GIRK2 channels, an inhibitory action that is masked by the ability of Na+ to activate the channel by another mechanism. Na+-dependent activation of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels appears to require the cytoplasmic tail regions of the GIRK2 subunit. To locate the Na+-sensing region of GIRK2 we looked at the effects of Na+ on the 1222 chimeric subunit. This differs from chimera 1211 in that it has the GIRK2 C-terminal tail and only the N-terminal tail of GIRK1. 1222 subunit (previously called 122) does not appear to form functional homomeric channels but does form functional heteromeric channels when coexpressed with GIRK1 in Xenopus oocytes (15Stevens E.B. Woodward R. Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 547-562Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Increasing internal Na+ activated this channel with an EC50 of ∼43 mm and a Hill coefficient of 2.3 (Fig. 3, A andB), suggesting that the C-terminal tail of GIRK2 is sufficient to restore the Na+-dependent activation of GIRK channels. To further narrow down the region crucial for Na+ gating we generated two additional chimeric subunits, 1221 and 1212, which divided up the GIRK2 C terminus into two segments: amino acids 199 to 369, which are highly conserved within the GIRK family, and the poorly conserved region downstream of residue 369 (Fig. 3 C). Two electrode voltage clamp measurements showed that both of these chimeric subunits produced much larger whole cell currents when coexpressed with GIRK1 than when expressed alone, indicating that they formed heteromeric complexes with GIRK1. We compared the effects of Na+, in the presence of MgATP, on the homomeric chimeric channels and the heteromeric channels. The 1221 and GIRK1/1221 channels were both reversibly activated by Na+, whereas the 1212 and GIRK1/1212 channels were inhibited (Fig. 3). The Na+ dose-response curve for 1221 had a Hill coefficient of 3.8, whereas the curve for GIRK1/1221 had a Hill coefficient of 1.6 (Table I). Thus, the region of the GIRK2 C-terminal tail that lies proximal to TM2 appears to be responsible for the Na+-dependent activation of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels. We compared the sequences of GIRK1, GIRK2, and GIRK4 within the proximal C-terminal region and looked for positions where there is a negative charge in GIRK2 and GIRK4 that is not present at the equivalent position in GIRK1 (Fig.4 A). There are 7 acidic residues conserved between GIRK2 and GIRK4 but not GIRK1. Two of these residues are located within the first 45 amino acid segment downstream of the TM2 region (Fig. 4 A). There is an aspartate at position 226 in GIRK2, which is also present in GIRK4, but is an asparagine in GIRK1. There is a glutamate at position 234, where GIRK1 has a serine. We generated two GIRK2 mutants, GIRK2D226N and GIRK2E234S, and expressed these individually and together with GIRK1, plus the m2-muscarinic receptor. The mutants displayed similar characteristics to wild type GIRK2 in that they produced small whole cell currents when expressed individually but much larger currents when coexpressed with GIRK1 indicating the formation of functional heteromeric channels (Fig. 4 B). The time course of the GIRK1/GIRK2E234S and GIRK1/GIRK2D226N heteromeric currents and their degree of inward rectification were indistinguishable from wild type GIRK1/GIRK2 currents (Fig. 4 C and Ref. 15Stevens E.B. Woodward R. Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 547-562Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mutant GIRK2 homomeric currents also rectified strongly, suggesting that neither glutamate 234 nor aspartate 226 plays a key role in determining the rectification properties of these channels. Finally, all of the mutant channels were activated by application of CCh, indicating that coupling to the m2-muscarinic receptor was not disrupted by the mutations. GIRK2E234S and GIRK1/GIRK2E234S channels were activated by increasing internal Na+, similar to the wild type channels; the dose-response relationships were fitted with Hill functions with EC50 values of ∼42 and ∼30 mm,respectively, and Hill coefficients of 4.0 and 1.6, respectively (Fig.5, A and B). In contrast both GIRK2D226N channels and GIRK1/GIRK2D226N channels were inhibited by increasing internal Na+ (Fig. 5, Cand D), similar to the 1211 channels. Thus the aspartate at position 226 in GIRK2 appears to play a crucial role in Na+-dependent activation of both GIRK2 homomeric and GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channels. Two other mutations at this position, D226K and D226E, failed to produce functional channels, either when expressed alone or coexpressed with GIRK1. As a result, we were not able to further investigate the relationship between the structure of the side group of this residue and activation by Na+. The reverse mutation in the 1211 chimera, N217D, was able to confer Na+-dependent activation to this channel. The dose-response relationship was best fitted with a Hill coefficient with an EC50 of ∼37 mm and a Hill coefficient of 3.6 (Fig. 5, E and F, and Table I). This is very similar to the dose-response relationship for Na+-dependent activation of the GIRK2 homomeric channel. The reverse mutation in the GIRK1 subunit, N217D, was also sufficient to recover Na+-dependent activation to GIRK1N217D/GIRK2D226N heteromeric channels (Fig.5, G and H, and Table I). Single channel records of the wild type and mutant channels in the cell-attached configuration are shown in Fig.6. The E234S mutation, while not affecting the Na+-dependent activation of the channel, did alter the intrinsic gating of the GIRK2 homomeric channels; all of the traces show a rapid flickering between the open and closed states of the channel. However, the D226N mutation did not appear to change either the kinetic behavior or the unitary conductance of the homomeric and heteromeric channels. GIRK2 and GIRK2D226N openings were very brief; the open time distributions were fitted with single exponential with time constants of 0.51 and 0.50 ms, respectively. The heteromeric channels displayed longer openings; there was an additional slower component to the open time distribution with a time constant of 2.8 ms (36%) for GIRK1/GIRK2D226N and 3.8 ms (23%) for GIRK1/GIRK2. Thus the loss of Na+-dependent activation of the mutant channels does not appear to be caused by a change in their intrinsic gating behavior. Interestingly the reverse mutation in the 1211 chimera, N217D, did alter the intrinsic gating of the channel. In the cell-attached recording mode, this mutant displayed very brief opening events (τ = 0.21 ms), and correspondingly very small whole cell currents (Fig. 4 B), unlike the 1211 chimera, which produces large whole cell currents (15Stevens E.B. Woodward R. Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 503: 547-562Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and displayed much longer openings; τ1 = 0.85 (61%), τ 2= 2.5 ms (39%). We have shown that the aspartate residue at position 226 within the proximal C-terminal region of GIRK2 plays a crucial role in the Na+-dependent activation of GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channels and GIRK2 homomeric channels. When D226 in GIRK2 was substituted for an asparagine, activation of GIRK2D226N homomeric channels and GIRK1/GIRK2D226N heteromeric channels by Na+was lost, and instead P open decreased with increasing internal [Na+]. The wild type GIRK1 subunit was not able to support Na+-dependent activation of the heteromeric channel. The reverse mutation, N217D, in the GIRK1 subunit was sufficient to recover Na+-dependent activation of the GIRK1N217D/GIRK2D226N channel, and similarly this mutation in the 1211 chimera introduced Na+-dependent activation to 1211N217D channels. The D226N mutation in GIRK2 did not inhibit the activation of the channel via the m2 receptor, suggesting that G protein gating of GIRKs occurs via a different mechanism to Na+-dependent activation. Substituting asparagine for aspartate 226 in GIRK2 could be disrupting Na+-dependent activation of the homomeric and heteromeric channels in at least three different ways: 1) it could reduce the binding affinity of Na+ to the channel; 2) it could interfere with the mechanism by which Na+ binding, to either GIRK2 or an accessory protein, is coupled to channel opening; 3) it could disrupt the intrinsic gating of the channel in such a way as to prevent the channel from opening in response to any stimulus. We can rule out the third possibility, because the mutant and chimeric channels that were not activated by Na+ were still activated by both internal MgATP and external CCh. Also, the single channel properties of GIRK2D226N channels and GIRK1/GIRK2D226N channels in the cell-attached recording configuration did not differ substantially from the wild type homomeric and heteromeric channels. Thus, the intrinsic gating of these channels does not appear to have been dramatically altered. We have no direct evidence that Na+ acts by binding to aspartate 226 or anywhere on the GIRK2 subunit. However, Na+-dependent activation is observed in isolated membrane patches, indicating that other cytosolic proteins are not required for mediating its actions. Also, other negatively charged residues within the proximal C-terminal region of Kir subunits are involved in the binding of Mg2+ and polyamines (16Taglialatela M. Ficker E. Wible B.A. Brown A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5532-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), indicating that this region of Kir subunits is accessible to internal cations. Aspartate residues have also been shown to mediate the allosteric actions of internal Na+ on other transmembrane proteins, for example the D2-dopamine receptor (18Neve K.A. Cox B.A. Henningsen R.A. Spanoyannis A. Neve R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 29: 733-739Google Scholar). Aspartate 226 in GIRK2 and aspartate 223 in GIRK4 are only 7 residues downstream of the cysteine that appears to be crucial for Gβγ-mediated activation of GIRK4 and GIRK1/GIRK4 channels (13Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A peptide from this region of GIRK4 has also been shown to compete with binding of the Gβγ to the native channel (13Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The binding site for PIP2 also appears to be located within this proximal C-terminal region. PIP2 regulates the activity of several of the inward rectifiers, including ROMK1 (Kir1.1) and the ATP-sensitive K+ channel (SUR/Kir6.2), as well as GIRK channels. Neutralization of the arginines at positions 176 and 177 in Kir6.2, and position 188 in Kir1.1, reduce PIP2 sensitivity (19Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 7Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 20Shyng S.-L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Thus, the proximal C-terminal region immediately following the second transmembrane segment appears to be an important domain for mediating the effects of internal ligands. Huang et al. (7Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) suggested that Gβγ activates GIRK channels by stabilizing interactions between PIP2 and the channel. They showed that in the presence of Gβγ, the rate of channel activation by PIP2 was increased, and the rate of dissociation of PIP2 was decreased. They also showed that activation of GIRK channels by PIP2, in the presence of 20 mm Na+, precluded further activation by Gβγ. One possible mechanism for Na+-dependent activation of GIRK channels is that Na+ interacts with aspartate 226 (or aspartate 223 in GIRK4) to promote the binding of the anionic PIP2 to a nearby region of the C terminus. However, the results of Sui et al. (6Sui J.L. Petit Jacques J. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) suggest that PIP2 and Na+ activate GIRK channels via different mechanisms. They reported that 1 μm PIP2 increased the mean open time of GIRK1/GIRK4 channels, whereas subsequent application of Na+specifically increased the opening frequency. In our experiments, a 5-min application of 50 μm PIP2 produced a dramatic increase in the apparent open frequency of GIRK1/GIRK2 channels, but it did not preclude further activation of the channels by Na+. Thus, we propose that Na+ increases theP open of PIP2-bound channels. It remains to be tested whether or not it also increases the affinity of PIP2 binding to GIRK channels. For those mutant GIRK channels lacking aspartate 226, the decrease in the open probability as a result of increasing internal [Na+] might be caused by a reduction in PIP2binding. Shyng and Nichols (20Shyng S.-L. Nichols C.G. Science. 1998; 282: 1138-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) compared the ability of different phospholipids to activate ATP-sensitive K+ channels (SUR1/Kir6.2) and concluded that a negatively charged head and a lipid tail are necessary to stimulate these channels. Screening of negative charges by application of polycations, such as Ca2+ or polylysine, inhibited PIP2-stimulated KATPchannel activity. In our experiments, increasing internal [NMDG] appeared to be as effective as increasing [Na+] in reducing the open probability of these mutant GIRK channels, and it also inhibited GIRK1/GIRK2 currents. The Na+ and NMDG were added to the bath solution without compensation for changes in ionic strength. The resultant increase in the ionic strength of the internal solution might have reduced long range electrostatic interactions between PIP2 in the membrane and the GIRK channels. Neither the D226N nor E234S mutation in GIRK2 appeared to change the rectification of the whole cell currents. The E234S mutation did alter the channels gating characteristics, causing it to flicker rapidly between an open and shut state. Mutating the equivalent glutamate in IRK1 channels has been shown to produce a similar flickering behavior, but it also decreases the sensitivity of IRK1 to the internal blockers Mg2+ and polyamines (16Taglialatela M. Ficker E. Wible B.A. Brown A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5532-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), thus reducing rectification. Our results, together with the fact that GIRK2 does not possess a negatively charged residue within its TM2 region, suggest that the residues involved in determining the rectification of GIRK2 differ from those shown to be important in the rectification of other inward rectifier channels. GIRK channels are located in postsynaptic neurons in several areas of the central nervous system (21Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M.N. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J.P.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 321-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), where the influx of Na+ occurs through both ligand-gated receptors and voltage-gated Na+ channels (22Callaway J.C. Ross W.N. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). During periods of rapid firing, large increases in subplasmalemmal [Na+] are likely to occur in the vicinity of these channels. Yu et al.(23Yu X.-M. Salter M.W. Nature. 1998; 396: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) recently reported that NMDA receptors are activated by [Na+]i over a similar range of concentrations as required for the activation of GIRK channels. They showed in hippocampal neurons that Na+ entry through either NMDA receptors or voltage-gated Na+ channels could activate neighboring channels that were isolated within a cell-attached membrane patch. Thus, it seems likely that GIRK channels will be activated by Na+ influx into dendrites under physiological conditions, and this may provide a negative feedback mechanism for suppressing neuronal firing following periods of high activity.

The formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels is an important factor in a broad spectrum of diseases (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7213) Google Scholar). New blood vessel growth by the process of angiogenesis is balanced by several protein activators and inhibitors. One such inhibitor is angiostatin, which accumulated in the murine circulation in the presence of a growing Lewis lung tumor and disappeared when the tumor was removed (2O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L.

The angiostatin produced by the primary tumor was found to inhibit the neovascularization and growth of its remote metastases.

Serine proteinase activity was required for the generation of angiostatin from plasminogen or plasmin by cultured human prostate carcinoma cells (10Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L. Cundiff D.L. Schnaper H.W. Madison L. Volpert O. Bouck N. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Soff G.A.

Production of angiostatin by CHO or HT1080 cells involves reduction of one or more disulfide bonds in plasmin followed by proteolysis of the reduced enzyme by a serine proteinase (11Stathakis P.

The plasmin disulfide bond(s) are reduced by a secreted reductase, which we have called plasmin reductase. Plasmin reductase requires a small cofactor for activity, and physiologically relevant concentrations of reduced glutathione or cysteine fulfill this role. Angiostatin can also be generated from plasmin with the reductants, thioredoxin (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), protein disulfide isomerase (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J.

In this study, we present evidence that the Cys461–Cys540 and Cys511–Cys535 disulfide bonds in kringle 5 of plasmin were reduced by plasmin reductase. Plasmin reductase activity was secreted by the transformed cell lines, HT1080, CHO, MCF-7, MDA231, and BT20, but not by the monocyte/macrophage cell line, THP-1. Cultured bovine and rat vascular smooth muscle cells secreted small but reproducible levels of plasmin reductase, but neither primary foreskin fibroblasts, blood monocyte/macrophages, nor macrovascular or microvascular endothelial cells secreted detectable plasmin reductase. Reduction of the kringle 5 disulfide bonds triggered cleavage at either Arg529-Lys530 or two other positions C-terminal of Cys461 in kringle 5 by a serine proteinase. Three serine proteinases were purified from HT1080-conditioned medium (HT1080cm), one or more of which could account for proteolysis of reduced plasmin. 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), while soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) and SBTI-agarose were from Sigma-Aldrich (Sydney, Australia). Plasminogen was purified from fresh frozen human plasma and separated into its two carbohydrate variants according to published procedures (13Castellino F.J. Powell J.R.

Urokinase plasminogen activator was a gift from Serono Australia. Plasmin was generated by incubating plasminogen (20 μm) with urokinase plasminogen activator (20 nm) for 30 min in 20 mm Hepes, 0.14m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer at 37 °C. Val-Phe-Lys-chloromethyl ketone was from Calbiochem. Plasmin (20 μm) was inactivated by incubation with Val-Phe-Lys-chloromethyl ketone (40 μm) for 60 min at room temperature. The treated plasmin contained <0.01% active plasmin measured using hydrolysis of H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S2251; Kabi, Mölndal, Sweden). Plasminogen fragments were generated by limited proteolysis with porcine elastase and purified by a combination of lysine-Sepharose affinity and Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (14Sottrup-Jensen L.

Miniplasmin was generated by incubating miniplasminogen (2 μm) with urokinase plasminogen activator (20 nm) for 2 h in 20 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer at 37 °C. Thioredoxin-derived angiostatin fragments were prepared as described previously (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1986; 251: C707-C712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were harvested and cultured as indicated. Bovine vascular smooth muscle cells were purchased from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA). HT1080, CHO-K1, MCF-7, BT20, MDA231, and THP-1 cells were purchased from American Type Cell Culture (Rockville, MD). All media components were from Life Technologies, Inc. Conditioned medium was collected by incubating cells at ∼80% confluence with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 for 6 h. The ratio of number of cells to volume of conditioned medium was 1-3 × 106 cells/ml. All conditioned medium was passed through a 0.22-μm filter prior to storage at −80 °C. Conditioned medium (1 ml) was incubated with plasmin (10 μg) for 2 h at 37 °C. Angiostatin fragments were labeled with MPB (100 μm) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by quenching of the unreacted MPB with GSH (200 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. Unreacted GSH and other free sulfhydryls in the system were blocked with iodoacetamide (400 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. The plasmin kringle products were collected on 50 μl of packed lysine-Sepharose beads by incubation on a rotating wheel for 1 h at room temperature; washed three times with 20 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer; and eluted with 50 mm ε-aminocaproic acid in the Hepes buffer. Angiostatin was generated from 1 mg of plasmin in 100 ml of HT1080cm as described above. The conditioned medium was applied to a 1 × 20-cm column of lysine-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,), and the matrix was washed with 20 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of ε-ACA to 12 mm in the Hepes buffer. The angiostatin fragments were separated from a small amount of aggregated protein by gel filtration on a 2 × 50-cm Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,) column in the Hepes buffer. Samples were separated on 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under nonreducing or reducing conditions (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), transferred to PVDF membrane, and developed and visualized using chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (DuPont). Both rabbit anti-human plasminogen polyclonal antibodies and swine anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) were used at 1:2000 dilution. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Australia, Sydney, Australia) was used at a 1:2000 dilution. NeutraLite avidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (100 μl of 5 μg/ml in 15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mmNaHCO3, 0.02% azide, pH 9.6) were adsorbed to Nunc PolySorp 96-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) overnight at 4 °C in a humid environment. Wells were washed once with 20 mmHepes, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Hepes/Tween). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by adding 200 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin in 15 mmNa2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 0.02% azide, pH 9.6 buffer and incubating for 90 min at 37 °C, and then wells were washed two times with Hepes/Tween. MPB-labeled angiostatin fragments were diluted in Hepes/Tween, and 100-μl aliquots were added to avidin-coated wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times with Hepes/Tween and 100 μl of 5 μg/ml murine anti-K1–3 monoclonal antibody (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times with Hepes/Tween, and rabbit anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was added at a 1:500 dilution in 100 μl of Hepes/Tween and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Wells were washed three times with Hepes/Tween, and the color was developed with 100 μl of 0.003% H2O2, 1 mg/ml 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) in 50 mm citrate, pH 4.5 buffer for 20 min at room temperature with orbital shaking. Absorbances were read at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices Thermomax Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Results were corrected for control wells not incubated with MPB-labeled angiostatin. Gelatin zymography was a modification of the technique originally described by Heussen and Dowdle (22Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). Bovine type B gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was incorporated into a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Following electrophoresis, gels were washed twice with 20 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer containing 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min to remove the SDS. Gels were then incubated in 20 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer overnight at 37 °C and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. On some occasions, gels were incubated with 20 mm Hepes, 0.14m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer containing 10 mm EDTA to inactivate metalloproteinases in the HT1080cm. Plasmin (10 μg) was incubated with HT1080cm (1 ml) at 37 °C. At discrete time intervals, aliquots (20 μl) of the reactions were diluted 10-fold into 20 mmHepes, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml PEG 6000, pH 7.4 buffer containing 200 μmH-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide. The initial rates of release of p-nitroaniline from the chromogenic substrate were measured as described previously (23Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium (200 ml) from HT1080 cells was concentrated 20-fold over a 10-kDa cut-off membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and loaded onto a 10-ml SBTI-agarose column (Sigma-Aldrich) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer. The SBTI-agarose was washed with two column volumes of Hepes buffer containing 1 m NaCl and re-equilibrated with Hepes buffer containing 0.14 m NaCl. The serine proteinases were eluted from the column with 10 mm MES, 10 mm Hepes, pH 5.2 buffer containing 0.8 mbenzamidine. The eluate was extensively dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer and stored at −80 °C until use. HT1080 cells at ∼80% confluence were washed twice with PBS and incubated with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 for 6 h (0.7 × 106 cells/ml of medium). Conditioned medium was passed through a 0.22-μm filter prior to storage at −80 °C. The low M r thiol compounds in the conditioned medium were derivatized with the fluorescent compound 7-benzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonic acid and resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (24Dudman N.P.B. Guo X.W. Crooks R. Xie L. Silberberg J.S. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 2028-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GSH and GSSG levels were determined as described by Vandeputte et al. (25Vandeputte C. Guizon I. Genestie-Denis I. Vannier B. Lorenzon G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1994; 10: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Stathakis et al. (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) observed that three angiostatin fragments were made in CHO or HT1080cm with apparent M r of 45, 41, and 38. These fragments were generated in HT1080cm, labeled with MPB, and purified by lysine-Sepharose affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Accordingly, three fragments were purified with apparent M r of 45, 41, and 38 on nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). The apparent M r of the three fragments on reducing SDS-PAGE were 66, 60, and 57 (not shown). All three fragments were labeled with MPB, indicating that all fragments contained free thiols. Three angiostatin fragments with similar M r were also generated by incubation of plasmin with reduced thioredoxin as previously reported (Fig. 1 B) (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To estimate secretion of plasmin reductase by cultured cells, an ELISA assay for MPB-labeled angiostatin was developed. This assay measured angiostatin generated by plasmin reductase and, therefore, was a relative measure of plasmin reductase activity. Briefly, plasmin was incubated with conditioned medium, and the angiostatin fragments were labeled with the biotin-linked maleimide, MPB. The MPB-labeled angiostatin fragments were adsorbed to avidin-coated microtiter plate wells, and the bound angiostatin was detected using a murine kringle 1–3 monoclonal antibody and a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody. To test the specificity of the ELISA, plasminogen, plasmin, or the plasminogen fragment kringles 1–3 (K1–3), K1–4, K4, or K5-serine proteinase (10 μg/ml) were incubated in either Hepes-buffered saline or HT1080cm for 2 h at 37 °C, and the angiostatin fragments were labeled with MPB and quantitated by ELISA. The plasminogen fragments were prepared by limited proteolytic digestion of plasminogen with porcine elastase and purified by a combination of lysine-Sepharose affinity and gel filtration chromatography (14Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Peterson T.E. Magnusson S. Davidson J.F. Rowan R.M. Samama M.M. Desnoyers P.C. Progress in Chemical Fibrinolysis and Thrombolysis. 3. Raven Press, New York1978: 191-209Google Scholar). MPB-labeled angiostatin fragments were only produced in HT1080cm from plasmin or plasmin derived endogenously from plasminogen (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). As anticipated, no MPB-labeled angiostatin fragments derived from the plasminogen fragments in HT1080cm. Also, no MPB-labeled angiostatin fragments were produced from incubation of plasminogen, plasmin, or any of the plasminogen fragments in Hepes-buffered saline for 2 h at 37 °C. This result served as a negative control for plasmin reductase. The response of the ELISA was linear up to a plasmin kringle fragment concentration of ∼200 ng/ml (Fig. 2 B). It is important to note that the ELISA assay was not an absolute measure of angiostatin formation. It is possible that one or more of the free thiols on angiostatin were refractive or inefficiently labeled by MPB due to steric factors or that two thiols on a proportion of the angiostatin molecules oxidized to form an intra- or interchain disulfide bond, which was not labeled with MPB. These considerations would have resulted in underestimation of the angiostatin generated. Nevertheless, the ELISA was a relative measure of angiostatin formation or plasmin reductase activity in serum-free conditioned medium. For example, generation of MPB-labeled angiostatin was a linear function of the concentration of HT1080cm in the reaction or of plasmin reductase concentration (r = 0.99) (Fig. 2 C). Conditioned medium from selected primary and transformed cells was collected by incubating cells at ∼80% confluence with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, buffer for 6 h. The ratio of number of cells to volume of conditioned medium was between 1 and 3 × 106 cells/ml. Plasmin (10 μg/ml) was incubated with the conditioned medium, and MPB-labeled angiostatin fragments were quantitated by ELISA (see Fig. 2). ELISA results were corrected for background angiostatin formation in unconditioned medium, which was negligible. Neither human foreskin fibroblasts, bovine aortic endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, nor human dermal microvascular endothelial cells secreted plasmin reductase activity (Fig.3). However, cultured rat or bovine vascular smooth muscle cells secreted plasmin reductase and converted plasmin to angiostatin, although the activity was 6% of the reductase activity secreted by HT1080 cells. CHO and MCF-7 cells secreted approximately 60%, BT20 cells 27%, and MDA231 cells 20% of the plasmin reductase activity secreted by HT1080 cells. THP-1 cells did not secrete detectable levels of plasmin reductase. The angiostatin-generating activity secreted by HT1080 cells was the highest of the cells examined and was used to further investigate the cofactor requirements of plasmin reductase. We previously reported that plasmin reductase secreted by HT1080 cells requires two components for activity, a protein component that can be heat-inactivated and a lowM r cofactor that can be GSH (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The lowM r thiol compounds in HT1080cm were derivatized with the fluorescent compound 7-benzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonic acid and resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (24Dudman N.P.B. Guo X.W. Crooks R. Xie L. Silberberg J.S. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 2028-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The only low M r thiol detectable in HT1080cm was GSH (not shown). The concentrations of GSH and GSSG were determined as described by Vandeputte et al. (25Vandeputte C. Guizon I. Genestie-Denis I. Vannier B. Lorenzon G. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1994; 10: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The concentration of GSH in the HT1080cm was 1.1 ± 0.12 μm. This corresponded to secretion of 0.27 ± 0.03 nmol of GSH/106 cells/h. No GSSG was detected in HT1080cm. To examine the GSH requirements of plasmin reductase, we measured the plasmin reductase activity of either Hepes-buffered saline or dialyzed HT1080cm supplemented with 0, 1, 5, or 10 μm GSH (Fig.4). Dialysis of HT1080cm using a 12–14-kDa cut-off membrane reduced the angiostatin-generating activity to 12% of control. Supplementation of the dialyzed HT1080cm with 1 μm GSH doubled the angiostatin-generating activity, while 10 μm GSH restored the angiostatin-generating activity to that of undialyzed HT1080cm. This is in accordance with our previous findings (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GSH at a concentration of 1 μm, the concentration in HT1080cm, had no angiostatin-generating activity on its own, while 10 μm GSH had 6% of the angiostatin-generating activity of undialyzed HT1080cm (Fig. 4). The plasminogen fragment K1–3, K1–4, K4, or K5-serine proteinase was incubated with HT1080cm for 2 h and then labeled with MPB. The fragment was resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with streptavidin-peroxidase to detect the MPB label. Of the plasminogen fragments, only K5-serine proteinase incorporated MPB (Fig.5). This observation suggested that the target disulfide bonds in plasmin for plasmin reductase resided in K5. Incubation of plasmin in pH 11 buffer causes reduction and isomerization of K5 disulfide bonds and results in formation of microplasmin (26Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8292-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Wohl R.C. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8793-8795Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Microplasmin has a Lys530 N terminus that is within K5. We compared the plasmin fragments generated by plasmin reductase with those generated by alkaline pH. Plasmin was incubated in either 0.1m glycine, pH 11 buffer or HT1080cm for 12 h at 37 °C. Samples were resolved and detected on gelatin zymography. Three major catalytically active plasmin fragments with apparentM r of 40, 30, and 29 were generated in either pH 11 buffer or HT1080cm (Fig.6 A). TheM r 29 fragment corresponded to theM r 29 microplasmin fragment described by Wuet al. (26Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8292-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Wohl R.C. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8793-8795Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Microplasmin hydrolyzes the tripeptidyl p-nitroanilide substrate, H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide with 1.4-fold higher efficiency than plasmin. This is a consequence of a 1.4-fold increase in the catalytic constant (26Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8292-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Plasmin was incubated in HT1080cm, and the initial rate of hydrolysis of H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide was measured at discrete time intervals (Fig. 6 B). Plasmin activity is reported as the fraction of control plasmin activity. The efficiency of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate increased with time of incubation and peaked at ∼2-fold enhanced efficiency at ∼8 h. The initial rate of hydrolysis returned to control levels after 24 h of incubation. Angiostatin is generated from reduced plasmin by a serine proteinase in CHO or HT1080cm (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Serine proteinase activity is also required for generation of angiostatin from plasminogen or plasmin by cultured human prostate carcinoma cells (10Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L. Cundiff D.L. Schnaper H.W. Madison L. Volpert O. Bouck N. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Soff G.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4887-4890PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin autoproteolysis can account for angiostatin formation in the presence of protein reductants (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or small thiols (12Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To examine whether autoproteolysis is the operative mechanism in HT1080cm, we compared formation of angiostatin from either active plasmin or plasmin inactivated with Val-Phe-Lys-chloromethyl ketone (VFK-plasmin). Plasmin or VFK-plasmin was incubated with HT1080cm for 2 h, and the angiostatin fragments were labeled with MPB. The MPB-labeled fragments were either resolved on SDS-PAGE and blotted with streptavidin-peroxidase (Fig.7 A) or quantitated by ELISA (Fig. 7 B). Similar levels of angiostatin were generated from either active plasmin or VFK-plasmin, which indicated that autoproteolysis was not necessary for angiostatin formation. Interestingly, MPB labeled both intact VFK-plasmin and angiostatin fragments derived from the inactivated plasmin (Fig. 7 A). This observation implied that reduction of plasmin preceded proteolysis. Formation of angiostatin from either active plasmin or VFK-plasmin was inhibited by the serine proteinase inhibitor, SBTI (Fig. 7 B). To examine the contribution of autoproteolysis of reduced plasmin to angiostatin formation, the HT1080cm was passed over either a Sepharose 4B or SBTI-Sepharose 4B column, and the angiostatin-generating activity of the eluate was measured (Fig. 7 C). Sepharose 4B was used to control for nonspecific protein adsorption to the agarose matrix. Depletion of serine proteinases in HT1080cm reduced the angiostatin-generating activity to 34% of control. SBTI-inhibitable serine proteinases in HT1080cm were purified on a SBTI-agarose column, and the bound enzymes were eluted with benzamidine. Serine proteinases from the equivalent of 3 ml of HT1080cm were resolved and detected using gelatin zymography (Fig.8). Proteinases with apparentM r of 70, 50, and 39 were evident. These enzymes did not correspond to plasmin or catalytically active plasmin fragments. The formation of angiostatin from plasmin in the conditioned medium of transformed cells is a two-step process (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). First, one or more disulfide bonds in plasmin are reduced by a protein disulfide bond reductase, which we have called plasmin reductase, and a reductase cofactor, which can be a small thiol such as GSH. Second, reduced plasmin is cleaved by a serine proteinase producing angiostatin. Three angiostatin fragments are produced with apparentM r of 45, 41, and 38 on nonreducing SDS-PAGE, which have the same Lys78 N terminus but different C termini. Plasmin reductase activity was secreted by the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080; the human mammary carcinoma cell lines, MCF-7, MDA231, and BT20; and CHO cells. In contrast, the monocyte/macrophage cell line THP-1 did not secrete significant levels of plasmin reductase before or after stimulation with phorbol ester (not shown). Neither primary foreskin fibroblasts, blood monocyte/macrophages, nor macrovascular or microvascular endothelial cells secreted detectable plasmin reductase. In contrast, cultured bovine and rat vascular smooth muscle cells secreted small but reproducible levels of plasmin reductase. In general terms, cellular transformation appeared to be associated with secretion of plasmin reductase and angiostatin formation. This result suggested that angiostatin formation is driven by tumor cells in vivo. Production of angiostatin by vascular smooth muscle cells is an interesting observation and suggested that angiostatin may function in the atherosclerotic vessel wall. The metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA did not have any effect on angiostatin production by the cell lines used in this study. Gately et al. (12Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) have shown that a sufficient concentration of small thiols alone can generate angiostatin from plasmin. The concentration of GSH in the HT1080cm was 1.1 ± 0.12 μm, and it was the only small thiol detected in the medium. This corresponded to secretion of 0.27 ± 0.03 nmol of GSH/106 cells/h, which is comparable with the level of secretion of GSH by other cultured cells (28Bannai S. Tsukeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3444-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dethmers J.K. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7492-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of the GSH to the plasmin reductase activity of HT1080cm, the medium was dialyzed, and the angiostatin-generating activity was determined. Dialysis of HT1080cm reduced the angiostatin-generating activity to 12% of control. Supplementation of the dialyzed HT1080cm with 1 μm GSH doubled the angiostatin-generating activity, while 10 μm GSH restored the angiostatin-generating activity to that of undialyzed HT1080cm. In contrast, 1 μm GSH, the concentration in HT1080cm, had no angiostatin-generating activity, while 10 μm GSH had 6% of the angiostatin generating activity of HT1080cm. These results support our previous findings (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and the proposal that plasmin reductase requires a small thiol cofactor such as GSH to provide the hydrogens and electrons to reduce the plasmin disulfide bonds. We suggest that high concentrations (100 μm) of small thiols have enough reducing power to reduce plasmin (12Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar); however, these concentrations are not achievable in cell culture. Considered together, these observations implied that plasmin reduction in HT1080cm was catalyzed by plasmin reductase using GSH as a cofactor and not by GSH directly. One or more disulfide bonds in the K5-serine proteinase fragment of plasminogen was reduced in HT1080cm. In contrast, neither K4, K1–3, nor K1–4 were substrates for plasmin reductase. This finding suggested that the target disulfide bond(s) for plasmin reductase were in K5. Plasmin undergoes autoproteolysis in alkaline pH, producing a catalytically active microplasmin fragment with a Lys530 N terminus (26Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8292-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Wohl R.C. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8793-8795Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Microplasmin consists of the last 10 amino acids of K5, the remaining 21 amino acids of the A chain, and the serine proteinase domain. Wu et al. (26Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8292-8295Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Wu H.-L. Shi G.-Y. Wohl R.C. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8793-8795Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) noticed that both the Cys461–Cys540 and Cys511–Cys535 disulfide bonds in K5 must have been reduced to release microplasmin from K1–4. They proposed that the increased −OH ion concentration at pH 11 was responsible for reducing the two disulfide bonds. We observed that the proteinase fragments produced from plasmin in pH 11 buffer were of identicalM r to the proteinase fragments generated from plasmin in HT1080cm. Fragments with apparent M rof 40, 30, and 29 were generated. The M r 29 fragment is the same size as microplasmin. We suggest that the mechanism of plasmin proteolysis at pH 11 is the same as the mechanism of proteolysis in HT1080cm. In other words, plasmin reductase achieves at neutral pH what is achieved by −OH ion at pH 11. Three major angiostatin fragments (Fig. 1 A) and three major serine proteinase fragments (Fig. 6 A) were produced in HT1080cm. Based on the close similarity in plasmin fragments produced at alkaline pH and in HT1080cm, we suggest that at least the Cys461–Cys540 and Cys511–Cys535 disulfide bonds in K5 were reduced by plasmin reductase. For instance, reduction of only the K5 Cys482–Cys523 and Cys511–Cys535 disulfide bonds would not have resulted in release of angiostatin from plasmin. Similarly, angiostatin would have remained covalently linked to the remaining kringles if the Cys461–Cys540 and Cys482–Cys523 disulfide bonds were reduced, but not the disulfide bond at Cys511–Cys535. Reduction of the Cys461–Cys540 and Cys511–Cys535 disulfide bonds is consistent with all of the experimental data, although we cannot exclude reduction of the Cys482–Cys523 disulfide bond in K5 or other disulfide bonds in K1–4. The largest angiostatin fragment (M r 45) and the smallest catalytically active fragment (M r 29; microplasmin) probably resulted from cleavage at the Arg529-Lys530 peptide bond. We hypothesize that cleavage can also occur at either the Arg473-Ala474 or Arg503-Ala504 peptide bond. Cleavage at these sites is favored by serine proteinases with plasmin-like specificity and would produce fragments of the size observed experimentally. Also, all three angiostatin fragments contained one or more cysteine residues (Fig. 1 A). For the smallest angiostatin fragment (M r 38) to contain a free thiol, proteolysis must have occurred C-terminal of Cys461. A model of K5 and the proposed target disulfide bonds is shown in Fig.9. Gately et al. (10Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L. Cundiff D.L. Schnaper H.W. Madison L. Volpert O. Bouck N. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Soff G.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4887-4890PubMed Google Scholar) observed that serine proteinase activity was required for generation of angiostatin from plasminogen or plasmin by cultured human prostate carcinoma cells, and we reported that serine proteinase activity was necessary for angiostatin generation by cultured CHO and HT1080 cells (11Stathakis P.

Incubation of purified plasmin with the reductant thioredoxin (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) results in formation of angiostatin. This indicates that plasmin autoproteolysis can account for angiostatin formation. However, angiostatin was generated almost equally well from either active or inactive plasmin in HT1080cm, which implied that a proteinase(s) secreted by HT1080 cells was mostly responsible for plasmin proteolysis. The enzyme(s) was a serine proteinase, since it was inactivated by SBTI. Depletion of serine proteinases in HT1080cm by SBTI-agarose reduced the angiostatin-generating activity to 34% of control. This result implied that the rate of angiostatin formation is slowed when autoproteolysis of reduced plasmin is the operative mechanism. There were three major serine proteinases in HT1080cm with apparent M rof 70, 50, and 39 that cleaved gelatin. One or more of these enzymes may contribute to generation of angiostatin from reduced plasmin. Therefore, although plasmin autoproteolysis can account for angiostatin formation, HT1080 cells did not rely entirely on this mechanism and secreted other serine proteinase(s) that cleaved reduced plasmin. We have proposed that reduction of plasmin precedes proteolysis (11Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M. Matthias L.J. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20641-20645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by the experiment that examined generation of angiostatin from inactivated plasmin. MPB labeled both intact VFK-plasmin and angiostatin fragments derived from the inactivated plasmin. This finding demonstrated reduction of disulfide bond(s) in intact plasmin, which supports our contention that plasmin reduction precedes proteolysis. In summary, angiostatin formation involves disulfide bond reduction and proteolysis in K5 of plasmin. The motif in angiostatin responsible for its antiangiogenic properties is not known. Interestingly, the K5 domain of plasminogen has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation (30Cao Y. Chen A. An S.S.A. Ji R.-W. Davidson D. Cao Y. Llinás M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22924-22928Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Also, plasminogen interacts with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells through K5 (31Wu H.-L. Wu I.-S. Fang R.-Y. Hau J.-S. Wu D.-H. Chang B.-I. Lin T.-M. Shi G.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is possible that the active motif in angiostatin resides in K5 and that the reduction and proteolytic events in this kringle expose the motif. We thank Dr. P. Little for the gift of rat vascular smooth muscle cells and Dr. N. Dudman and Dr. C. Grant for assistance with the GSH determinations."
https://openalex.org/W2100016308,"We have identified a series of potent, orally bioavailable, non-peptidyl, triarylimidazole and triarylpyrrole glucagon receptor antagonists. 2-(4-Pyridyl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(5-bromo-2-propyloxyphenyl)pyrrole (L-168,049), a prototypical member of this series, inhibits binding of labeled glucagon to the human glucagon receptor with an IC50 = 3.7 ± 3.4 nm(n = 7) but does not inhibit binding of labeled glucagon-like peptide to the highly homologous human glucagon-like peptide receptor at concentrations up to 10 μm. The binding affinity of L-168,049 for the human glucagon receptor is decreased 24-fold by the inclusion of divalent cations (5 mm). L-168,049 increases the apparent EC50 for glucagon stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human glucagon receptor and decreases the maximal glucagon stimulation observed, with aK b (concentration of antagonist that shifts the agonist dose-response 2-fold) of 25 nm. These data suggest that L-168,049 is a noncompetitive antagonist of glucagon action. Inclusion of L-168,049 increases the rate of dissociation of labeled glucagon from the receptor 4-fold, confirming that the compound is a noncompetitive glucagon antagonist. In addition, we have identified two putative transmembrane domain residues, phenylalanine 184 in transmembrane domain 2 and tyrosine 239 in transmembrane domain 3, for which substitution by alanine reduces the affinity of L-168,049 46- and 4.5-fold, respectively.

Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide that is an important counter-regulatory hormone in the control of glucose homeostasis (1Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Charron M.J. Diabetes Metab. 1996; 22: 373-396PubMed Google Scholar). Glucagon secretion from the endocrine pancreas induces an increase in hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and it attenuates the ability of insulin to inhibit these processes. As such, the overall rates of hepatic glucose synthesis and glycogen metabolism are controlled by the systemic ratio of insulin and glucagon (2Roden M. Perseghin G. Petersen K.F. Hwang J.-H.

Therefore, glucagon antagonists have the potential to improve hepatic insulin sensitivity and to be effective hypoglycemic agents. Peptidyl glucagon antagonists and their hypoglycemic activity were first described over 15 years ago, and an extensive exploration of the structure/activity relationships of these glucagon analogs has been reported (4Johnson D.G.

This receptor superfamily has a binding pocket for small-molecule ligands within the transmembrane domain that has made it possible to identify non-peptidyl antagonists for many receptor families in which the endogenous ligands are small peptides or proteins (9Cascieri M.A. Fong T.M. Strader C.D. Drugs Future. 1996; 21: 521-527Google Scholar). Thus, we initiated an effort to identify non-peptidyl, orally active antagonists for the human glucagon receptor. Collins et al. (10Collins J.L. Dambeck P.J. Goldstein S.W. Faraci W.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1992; 2: 915-918Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have described a dichloroquinoxaline glucagon antagonist with weak affinity (IC50 = 4 μm) for the rat glucagon receptor. However, there have been no subsequent reports in the patent or scientific literature describing the development of potent antagonists from this series. Our initial screening efforts identified a series of triarylimidazole and triarylpyrrole compounds with significant binding affinity for the human glucagon receptor, and efforts to evaluate the structure-activity relationships of this series have lead to the identification of potent glucagon antagonists (11de Laszlo S.E.

In the present article, we describe the identification and characterization of a potent glucagon antagonist from this series. Stable CHO 1The abbreviations used are:CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1; TM, transmembrane (domain); L-168, 049, 2-(4-pyridyl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(5-bromo-2- propyloxyphenyl)pyrrole.cell lines or COS cells transiently expressing the human glucagon receptor were prepared as described previously (8MacNeil D.J.

Antagonist binding affinity was assessed by measuring inhibition of radiolabeled glucagon binding to CHO cell membranes. Briefly,125I-glucagon (58 pm) binding to the membrane preparation was measured in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 40 μg/ml bacitracin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 3 μm o-phenanthroline ± 1 μm glucagon for 1 h at room temperature. Bound cpm were recovered by filtration using a Tomtec harvester and quantified in a γ-scintillation counter. The ability of compound to inhibit glucagon-stimulated adenylyl cyclase was assessed as described previously (12Chicchi G.G. Graziano M.P. Koch G. Hey P. Sullivan K. Vicario P.P. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7765-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested from monolayers with enzyme-free cell dissociation solution (Specialty Media, Inc.) and were pelleted at 500 × g. The cells were resuspended at 100,000 cells/100 μl in 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Ro-20-1724 (Biomol, Inc.), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), benzamidine (10 μg/ml), bacitracin (40 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (5 μg/ml), and 0.02% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C with increasing peptide concentrations in the presence or absence of antagonist followed by lysis by boiling. Lysates were analyzed for cAMP content versus a nonacetylated cAMP standard curve using the Amersham cAMP radioimmunoassay scintillation proximity assay kit. Data were analyzed using Packard TopCount with RIASmart and GraphPad Prism software. The wild-type glucagon receptor was cloned into pCI-neo (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) at the NheI and XbaI sites. Mutations at amino acid residues 184 (TM2, F184A) and 239 (TM3, Y239A) of the wild-type glucagon receptor were prepared using recombinant polymerase chain reaction. The sense primers for the F184A and the Y239A mutants were 5′-TTTGCGTCCGCCGTGCTGAA-3′ and 5-GTGGCCAACGCCTGCTGGCTGCT-3′, respectively. The resulting mutant fragments were excised with either ApaI/SacII (F184A) or SacII/BclI (Y239A) and ligated into the pCI-neo wild-type glucagon receptor. Mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing. All other mutants were prepared in a similar manner using oligonucleotides specific to the production of an alanine at the indicated position with the wild-type receptor, and mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The restriction sites for the other mutations were as follows: TM1 (Tyr-145, Tyr-149, and Ser-152, digested with ApaI/SacII), TM2 (Phe-184 and Ser-190, digested with ApaI/SacII), TM3 (Gln-232, Tyr-233, Asn-238, and Tyr-239, digested with SacII/BclI), TM4 (Phe-278, digested with SstII/BclI), TM5 (Phe-312, Phe-319, and Phe-320, digested withKspI/PflM 1), and TM7 (Lys-381, Phe-383, Phe-384, Phe-387, Ser-390, and Phe-391, digested with PflM 1/XbaI). The transfection of COS cells and the preparation of membranes for binding assays were performed as described previously (12Chicchi G.G. Graziano M.P. Koch G. Hey P. Sullivan K. Vicario P.P. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7765-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Compound titrations using wild-type receptor transiently expressed in COS cells were performed as controls in all experiments utilizing mutant receptors. Several triarylimidazole compounds were identified from compound collection screening that inhibit labeled glucagon binding to the human glucagon receptor with potencies ranging from 300 nm to 1 μm (11de Laszlo S.E. Hacker C. Li B. Kim D. MacCoss M. Mantlo N. Pivnichny J.V. Colwell L. Koch G.E. Cascieri M.A. Hagmann W.K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Optimization of this activity by structural modification of these lead compounds led to the identification of the triarylpyrrole glucagon antagonist, L-168,049 (Fig.1). This compound inhibits binding of labeled glucagon with an IC50 of 3.7 ± 3.4 nm (n = 7). Surprisingly, the affinity of L-168,049 is decreased 48-fold by the inclusion of 5 mmMgCl2 in the assay (Fig. 2). In the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, the compound inhibits binding of labeled glucagon with an IC50 of 179 ± 86 nm (n = 3). An equivalent decrease in affinity is also observed with MnCl2 and CaCl2, but not with NaCl, indicating that the loss in affinity is divalent cation-dependent (data not shown). L-168,049 does not inhibit binding of labeledglucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) to the highly homologous GLP-1 receptor at concentrations as high as 10 μm.Figure 2Inhibition of the binding of125I-glucagon to the human glucagon receptor by L-168,049 in the absence (closed circles) or presence (open circles) of 5 mmMgCl2. Assays were performed using CHO cell membranes as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are the average of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inclusion of increasing doses of L-168,049 increases the apparent EC50 for glucagon stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and decreases the maximal stimulation observed (Fig.3). A competitive antagonist should not alter maximal agonist-induced activation of the receptor, suggesting that L-168,049 is a noncompetitive antagonist of glucagon. Schild transformation of these data is linear with a slope of 0.6, which is consistent with a noncompetitive mechanism. The affinity of L-168,049, as measured by the concentration of antagonist that shifts the agonist dose-response 2-fold (K b), is 25 nm. In the absence of exogenously added glucagon, L-168,049 does not alter intracellular cAMP levels, indicating that it has no agonist activity. 125I-Glucagon dissociates from the human glucagon receptor in the presence of MgCl2 withk −1 = 0.013 ± 0.001 min−1 (n = 2). Inclusion of L-168,049 (1 μm) increases the rate of dissociation 4-fold (Fig.4). These data confirm thatL-168,049 is a noncompetitive antagonist of glucagon. The nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analog, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)-triphosphate, which reduces glucagon affinity by uncoupling the receptor from G-protein, increases the rate of dissociation 29-fold. These data suggest that L-168,049 does not inhibit glucagon binding by this mechanism. Although the data shown are in the presence of divalent cation, L-168,049 also increases the rate of dissociation of 125I-glucagon 4-fold in the absence of divalent cation. To confirm that L-168,049 binds within the transmembrane domain of the glucagon receptor, 19 residues predicted to be within this region (8MacNeil D.J. Occi J.L. Hey P.J. Strader C.D. Graziano M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were separately mutated to alanine, and the binding affinities of these mutants for glucagon and L-168,049 were determined following transient transfection into COS cells. These include Tyr-145, Tyr-149, Ser-152, Phe-184, Ser-190, Gln-232, Tyr-233, Asn-238, Tyr-239, Phe-278, Phe-312, Phe-319, Phe-320, Lys-381, Phe-383, Phe-384, Phe-387, Ser-390, and Phe-391. Alanine substitution of these individual residues does not alter affinity for labeled glucagon. Whereas most of these substitutions also do not alter affinity for L-168,049, the substitution of alanine for Phe-184 and Tyr-239 results in a 46- and a 4.5-fold reduction in the affinity for L-168,049, respectively (TableI). Inclusion of divalent cation reduced the affinity of the compound for both the wild-type and mutant receptors, indicating that these residues were not involved in mediating the effect of divalent cations on compound affinity (data not shown).Table IAnalysis of the affinity of L-168,049 for glucagon receptor mutantsReceptorInhibition of125I-glucagon binding (IC50)aEach value is mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab The affinity was determined after transient transfection of either wild-type or mutant receptors into COS cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” The triarylpyrrole glucagon antagonists have poor affinity for the rat, guinea pig, and rabbit glucagon receptors (>1 μm). However, L-168,049 inhibits labeled glucagon binding to the murine and canine glucagon receptors with IC50 = 63 ± 44 nm (n = 3) and 60 nm, respectively. As with the human receptor, these affinities are reduced ≥20-fold in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2(IC50 = 331 ± 122 nm (n = 3)) and >1 μm for the murine and dog receptors, respectively. We have identified a structural class of non-peptidyl glucagon antagonists. Preliminary data indicate that these compounds are absorbed systemically after oral administration (11de Laszlo S.E. Hacker C. Li B. Kim D. MacCoss M. Mantlo N. Pivnichny J.V. Colwell L. Koch G.E. Cascieri M.A. Hagmann W.K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that they have the potential to be useful, orally active hypoglycemic agents. The prototype of this class, L-168,049, is a high affinity, noncompetitive antagonist of the human glucagon receptor, which inhibits glucagon-stimulated adenylyl cyclase with aK b of 25 nm. This compound has poor affinity for the highly homologous GLP-1 receptor and for a panel of other G-protein-coupled receptors, indicating that it is a selective glucagon antagonist. The observation that inclusion of L-168,049 alters both the apparent affinity and maximal receptor activation of glucagon suggests that these compounds are noncompetitive glucagon antagonists. The demonstration that L-168,049 increases the dissociation rate of labeled glucagon confirms this hypothesis, because these data suggest that both glucagon and L-168,049 are able to bind to the receptor at the same time. Whereas mutagenesis data suggest that the binding site for glucagon is within the amino-terminal domain and other extracellular domains of the glucagon receptor (13Unson C.G. Cypress A.M. Kim H.N.

Receptors Channels. 1996; 4: 9-17PubMed Google Scholar), our data suggest that the L-168,049 binding site is within the transmembrane domain. The binding of glucagon to the 19 transmembrane domain mutant receptors is unaltered, suggesting that these mutations did not dramatically effect overall receptor conformation. Phenylalanine 184 and tyrosine 239, the two mutations with altered affinity for L-168,049, are predicted to be within the second and third transmembrane domains, respectively. Thus, these compounds appear to bind in the same common binding pocket that has been postulated for other G-protein-coupled receptors (9Cascieri M.A. Fong T.M. Strader C.D. Drugs Future. 1996; 21: 521-527Google Scholar). These data, and the observation that L-168,049 is a noncompetitive antagonist of glucagon, suggest that the compound allosterically modulates the binding of glucagon to the receptor. Divalent cations have been shown to allosterically enhance the binding of agonists to many types of G-protein-coupled receptors, including the binding of glucagon to the human glucagon receptor (12Chicchi G.G. Graziano M.P. Koch G. Hey P. Sullivan K. Vicario P.P. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7765-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but divalent cation effects on antagonist binding affinity are less well documented. However, inclusion of 5 mm divalent cation decreases the affinity of L-168,049 48-fold. The activity of antagonists in the cellular functional assays that are performed under more physiologically relevant buffer conditions correlates more closely with the binding affinity measured in the presence of divalent cation. More importantly, because circulating levels of MgCl2 are in the low mm range, the decrease in affinity observed in the presence of divalent cation would be expected to be important for the activity of antagonists in vivo. We previously showed that the deletion of residues 252–259 in the second intracellular domain of the glucagon receptor attenuates the effects of divalent cation on the binding affinity for glucagon (12Chicchi G.G. Graziano M.P. Koch G. Hey P. Sullivan K. Vicario P.P. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7765-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, this mutation does not significantly alter the affinity for L-168,049, and inclusion of divalent cation reduces affinity of L-168,049 for this mutant protein 30-fold. Thus, the effects of divalent cation on agonist and antagonist binding appear to be distinct. Because L-168,049 has poor affinity for all of the species orthologs of the glucagon receptor tested to date, it has been difficult to test itsin vivo efficacy. However, L-168,049 has the highest affinity for the murine receptor of any compound in this series identified to date, and high levels of compound (3 μm) increase the apparent EC50 for glucagon-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activation in murine liver membranes by >10-fold. These data suggest that the compound is an antagonist of glucagon activity in a physiological tissue preparation. However, the compound (50 mg/kg, per os) does not inhibit glucagon-stimulated increases in the blood glucose in mice, suggesting that its activity at the murine receptor is insufficient to be a useful tool in this species. Thus, identification of a suitable animal model is required for the analysis of the effects of this class of orally active glucagon antagonists on glucose homeostasis in vivo. Recently we have generated a murine line in which the native murine glucagon receptor has been replaced with the human receptor by homologous recombination, and preliminary data suggest that the activity of compounds in liver membranes from these mice correlates with their affinity as measured using the cloned human receptor. 2L.-L. Shiao, K. A. Sullivan, and M. A. Cascieri, unpublished data. Our current efforts are focused on expanding this murine line to extend these observations and to determine the effect of this class of compounds on glucose homeostasis."

The ribosome coordinates and facilitates the biosynthesis of the polypeptide chain by the addition of new amino acids, which are brought to the ribosome by transfer RNAs (tRNAs), according to genetic instructions stored on the messenger RNA (mRNA). tRNA is known to occupy successive positions in the intersubunit space (see Ref. 1Frank J. Agrawal R.K. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 589-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of the ribosome in the course of the elongation cycle. There are mainly three such biochemically characterized positions that are referred to as A (for incoming aminoacyl tRNA), P (for peptidyl tRNA), and E (for deacylated exiting tRNA) sites. In addition to mRNA and tRNA, ribosomes also interact with various protein factors, e.g.initiation, elongation, and release factors, which facilitate different steps of the protein biosynthesis.

Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) in different ligand·ribosome complexes. Of the various tRNA binding positions on the ribosome, the position of P-site tRNA has been unambiguously defined in a 3D map of the fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex at 15 Å resolution (8Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I. Grassucci R.A. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because this position differs from the position of P-site tRNA inferred from an earlier experiment in our laboratory (4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Science. 1996; 271: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a clarification of the cause of the discrepancy was needed. As in these two studies (4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A.

To this end, we prepared tRNA·ribosome complexes using both acylated and deacylated tRNAs, each under two different buffer conditions, and analyzed them using the 3D cryoelectron microscopy technique. Different laboratories use somewhat different buffer conditions for tRNA binding experiments. However, many of the laboratories generally ignore the possible influence of the buffer conditions on the binding properties of tRNA. Three principally different buffer systems are used nowadays for in vitro analysis of tRNA·ribosome complexes: (i) the conventional buffer systems, containing essentially only Mg2+ (5 to 25 mm) and monovalent ions (K+ and NH4+ in the range of 50 to 200 mm), which fails to match the relevant parameters of protein synthesis, viz. rate and accuracy, by more than one order of magnitude; (ii) the polymix system (9Jelenc P.C. Kurland C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3174-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Bilgin N. Claesens F. Pahverk H. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1011-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); and (iii) the much simpler polyamine system (11Bartetzko A. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Kutay U.R. Spahn C.M.T. Nierhaus K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Both the polymix and the polyamine systems contain ions and polyamines in concentrations comparable with those observed in vivo; in both systems the ribosomal activities, in terms of rate and accuracy, are near those observedin vivo. Furthermore, the tRNA binding sites can be occupied up to 100% and the fraction of ribosomes participating in protein synthesis is up to 70% in the polyamine system, whereas the corresponding values in the polymix system are lower by a factor of two (for more details, see Ref. 13Nierhaus K.H.

This article presents the cryoelectron microscopy results of experiments in which two buffer conditions (conventional and polyamine) and two states of tRNAs (aminoacylatedversus deacylated) were used to investigate the properties of tRNA at the ribosomal P site. Tight-couple ribosomes and ribosomal subunits were prepared from Escherichia coli MRE-600 strain as described by Agrawal and Burma (14Agrawal R.K. Burma D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21285-21291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and Bommer and co-workers (15Bommer U. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Spahn C.M.T. Triana-Alonso F.J.

A 32P-labeled tRNAPhe·ribosome complex was prepared in a conventional buffer (containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 15 mm magnesium acetate, 160 mm NH4Cl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) as described by Agrawal and co-workers (4Agrawal R.K.

The extent of tRNA binding to the ribosome, as determined by filter binding assays, was 2.3 tRNA molecules per molecule of ribosome. The initiation-like ribosomal complexes were prepared by binding fMet-tRNAfMet to the P site of ribosomes programmed with a 46-nucleotide mRNA fragment that carries unique AUG and UUC codons in its middle (MF-mRNA) as described by Malhotra and co-workers (8Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I. Grassucci R.A. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol.

The tRNA binding under polyamine and conventional buffer conditions were 0.81 and 0.85 tRNA molecules per ribosome molecule, respectively, as checked by filter binding assay. The specificity of binding was ascertained by the puromycin reaction (15Bommer U. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Spahn C.M.T. Triana-Alonso F.J. Nierhaus K.H. Graham J. Rickwood D. Subcellular Fractionation—A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, DC1997: 271-301Google Scholar). The other two complexes were prepared by incubating deacylated tRNAfMet with the ribosome programmed with the same MF-mRNA under polyamine as well as under conventional buffer conditions. The tRNA binding under polyamine and conventional buffer conditions were 0.92 and 0.87 tRNA molecules per ribosome molecule, respectively, as checked by filter binding assay. All these complexes yielded a homogeneous 70 S peak in the analytical sucrose density gradients, prepared in the corresponding buffers. In each case, samples were diluted in the corresponding conventional or polyamine low Mg2+-containing buffers to a concentration of 1.0–1.2A 260/ml. Grids were prepared for cryoelectron microscopy according to standard methods (16Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Frank J. J. Mol.

Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Micrographs were recorded using low-dose protocols on a Philips EM420 equipped with low-dose kit and a GATAN (model 626) cryotransfer holder at a magnification of 52,200 × ±2% as checked by a tobacco mosaic virus standard. Each exposure corresponds to an electron dose of about 10 e−/Å2. Micrographs were checked for drift, astigmatism, and presence of Thon rings by optical diffraction. Scanning was done with a step size of 25 μm, corresponding to 4.78 Å on the object scale, on a Perkin Elmer PDS 1010A microdensitometer. 3D reconstructions were calculated and refined using the 3D projection alignment procedure (18Penczek P.

The resolution of 3D maps of 70 S ribosomes (naked controls) in both buffer conditions and that of the poly(U)-programmed tRNAPhe·ribosome complex was 22 Å in each case. In the case of the fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex in polyamine buffer condition, a difference map was computed by subtracting the map of the fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex (resolution 19.5 Å) having 41% tRNA occupancy from that obtained for 81% tRNA occupancy, and was low-pass filtered to 19.5 Å (Fig. 1; for details, see Ref. 8Malhotra A.

Other difference maps (Figs. 2,a-d, and 3a) were computed by subtracting the corresponding control (naked 70 S) 3D map in conventional buffer or polyamine buffer. Difference maps were also computed (Figs. 2, e and f, and 3 b), by subtracting the 3D maps of fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex from the 3D maps of tRNAfMet·ribosome complexes (Fig. 2,e and f) and poly(U)-programmed tRNAPhe·ribosome complex (Fig. 3 b) in the corresponding buffer conditions. The latter difference map was useful in revealing the boundary between tRNAs at A and P sites of our earlier results (4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Science. 1996; 271: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In each case difference maps were low-pass filtered to a common resolution of 22 Å. We have been careful not to consider any minor or weak difference peak, which could result from minor conformational changes of ribosomes based on variation of buffer and binding states, in assigning a particular position for the tRNA.Figure 2Difference maps computed for various tRNA·ribosome complexes.

In addition, 3D maps of two naked 70 S ribosome controls under both buffer conditions were also computed and used to obtain difference maps. Thus, altogether seven 3D reconstructions were used in this study. The fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex, in which single fMet-tRNAfMet was bound in the P site (8Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K.

The position of tRNA in the 3D map of this complex is the same in conventional (Fig.2 a) and polyamine (Fig.2 b) buffer conditions. When a deacylated tRNAfMet is used in place of fMet-tRNAfMet, the position of tRNA is found to vary depending upon the buffer conditions (Fig. 2, c andd). In the conventional buffer system (Fig. 2 c), a very weak difference peak (marked with an asterisk) is observed in a position that overlaps with the tRNA position obtained with fMet-tRNAfMet, and most of the difference mass (more than 85%) is found on the L1 side of the ribosome. In the polyamine buffer system (Fig. 2 d), on the other hand, the reverse situation is observed; a strong mass of density is found in a position superimposing with the fMet-tRNAfMetand a very weak (less than 25%) mass of density is found on the L1 side. It should be pointed out that the difference masses shown in Fig.2, a–d, also include a mass of density associated with the portion of mRNA involved in codon-anticodon interaction. As the mRNA-associated mass has been subtracted from the difference map presented in Fig. 1 (see Ref. 8Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I. Grassucci R.A. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar for details), the size of the difference mass associated with P-site tRNA is different in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, a–d. It has been found that binding of the first copy of tRNA to the ribosome induces some conformational changes in the L1-protein and the central protuberance regions (21Agrawal R.K. Lata R.K. Frank J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 31: 243-254Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These conformational changes, in general, have positional consistency in all tRNA-bound ribosomes. Therefore, we computed difference maps by subtracting the 3D maps of fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex from the 3D maps of tRNAfMet·ribosome complexes (Fig. 2,e and f) and from the 3D map of poly(U)-programmed tRNAPhe·ribosome complex (Fig.3 b). The use of the 3D map of fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex as control appears to offset most of the effects of ribosomal conformational changes associated with the binding of the first tRNA. However, its use as a control results in the elimination of a mass of densities related to the P/P position and the overlapping anticodon portion of the tRNA at the P/E position. In our earlier study (4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Science. 1996; 271: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a deacylated tRNAPhe·ribosome complex was prepared using poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosomes in a conventional buffer system. Since then the resolution of the 3D map of the same complex has been improved. The overall difference map at improved resolution (Fig. 3 a), computed by subtracting the 3D map of naked control 70 S ribosome, remains the same as shown earlier (4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Science. 1996; 271: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and did not show a strong mass of density that would superimpose with the position of fMet-tRNAfMetbut had a very weak density (marked with an asterisk) in that region (compare with position of difference peaks in Fig. 2, a andb). However, that result was very similar to the result now obtained, except for the absence of a difference mass in the A-site region, with a single deacylated tRNAfMet, which was bound to the ribosomes containing only one AUG codon in conventional buffer conditions (Fig. 2, c and e). It is apparent that under the conventional buffer conditions, deacylated tRNAs, irrespective of the nature of mRNA (poly(U) or MF-mRNA), acquire a different preferred orientation, in which most of the 50 S side portion of the tRNA is found on the L1 side. The position of P-site tRNA in the fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex agrees with the tRNA position observed in the P site in the pre- and post-translocational complexes. 2R. K. Agrawal, P. Penczek, C. M. T. Spahn, R. A. Grassucci, K. H. Nierhaus, and J. Frank, manuscript in preparation. Although by definition, a peptidyl-tRNA occupies the authentic P site (Fig. 1) and a similar site is occupied by the fMet-tRNAfMetunder both buffer conditions, it is mainly the presence of the peptidyl residue that helps to orient the tRNA in the classical P site. Most of the deacylated tRNAfMet under the polyamine buffer conditions (Fig. 2 d) also acquire the same position. The results of these experiments reveal that under optimal buffer conditions, i. e., when the polyamine system is used, a deacylated tRNA can occupy the P site (Fig. 2 d), in contrast to conventional buffer conditions in which only a weak signal is observed in that region (Figs. 2 c and 3 a). Because the complex prepared using tRNAfMetcontained only a single AUG codon, it was expected that no tRNA would be present at the A or E sites under the conditions of the polyamine system (22Gnirke A. Geigenmüller U. Rheinberger H.-J. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7291-7301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the generally accepted view (23Zimmermann R.A. Thomas C.L. Wower J. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D. Warner R. The Ribosomes: Structure, Function, and Evolution. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1990: 331-347Google Scholar), the A site is on the L7/L12 side, whereas the E site is on the L1 side of the P-site tRNA. Although the P site proves to be well occupied (Fig.2 d) in the polyamine buffer, there is indeed no difference mass attributable to tRNA seen at the A site. However, the mass of densities observed on the L1 side (Fig. 2, c andd) cannot be explained by an E-site tRNA, as the E-site position, inferred from a separate 3D study of a post-translocational complex,2 is different (though partially overlapping) from the additional mass of densities seen here. The anticodon end and the elbow of the E-site tRNA is found between the anticodon ends and elbows of tRNAs at the P/P and E2 (see below) positions. In contrast, in this study, a portion of the mass of densities on the L1 side of the P site is connected to the codon-anticodon region of the P-site tRNA (compare the difference masses shown in Fig. 2, a and bwith Fig. 2, c and d, respectively). Thus, the anticodon of the tRNA appears to be still in the place of the P site, whereas elbow and CCA arm point to the E-site region. It is therefore justified to call this a P/E hybrid position. Another connected mass, not explained by the presence of a deacylated tRNA at the observed P/E position, clings to the L1 protein and is weakly developed in the polyamine buffer conditions (Fig. 2,d and f), as compared with the conventional buffer (Fig. 2, c and e, and Fig. 3). It represents another tRNA that can be more clearly seen in the difference map in Fig. 3 b (see Ref. 4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Science. 1996; 271: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, where it was first observed and assigned as the E-site tRNA) and will now be called E2 position. As the E-site position obtained in a well defined post-translocational complex (see above) is different from P/E and E2 positions, it appears that the reconstruction of poly(U)-programmed ribosomes shows an average mass in the intersubunit space, which is probably formed by superposition of tRNAs situated in P/E, E, and E2 positions (Fig. 3 b). Thus, apart from P and A sites, deacylated tRNAs can bind at three additional positions that are probably not occupied simultaneously for two reasons: (i) the maximal capacity of tRNA binding to programmed ribosomes is three deacylated tRNAs per 70 S ribosome (24Rheinberger H.-J. Sternbach H. Nierhaus K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 76: 5310-5314Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Grajevskaja R.A. Ivanov Y.V. Saminsky E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); and (ii) the various positions partially overlap (see below). Difference maps (shown in Fig. 2,a–d) obtained by subtracting the 3D maps of corresponding naked control 70 S ribosome from tRNA·ribosome complexes, altogether yield two distinct masses that could be assigned to two different positions of tRNA related to the P site, the P/P and P/E positions. The next step was to find out the exact positions and orientations of the tRNAs by fitting the tRNAPhe x-ray structure (26Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To obtain an accurate fitting of the tRNA x-ray structure into these discrete masses, we applied a three-dimensional spherical mask, large enough to accommodate a tRNA (43 Å radius), around the centers of these masses. This gave us a clear 3D view of the difference mass corresponding to each of the two particular tRNA positions and thus allowed us to obtain an unequivocal fitting of the tRNA x-ray structure. The P-site tRNA was identified by fitting the x-ray structure of initiator tRNA (27Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3105-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) directly into the 15-Å resolution electron microscopy density map (8Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I. Grassucci R.A. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) of the ribosome·fMet-tRNAfMet complex. However, the difference map obtained by subtracting the two MF-mRNA-programmed ribosome·fMet-tRNAfMet complexes containing the same level of mRNA but different levels of tRNA (see Ref. 8Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I. Grassucci R.A. Burkhardt N. Jünemann R. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar; and shown in Fig. 1 in green) precisely matches and tightly accommodates the x-ray structure of the initiator tRNA (Fig.4, bottom panel) and also that of tRNAPhe. Furthermore, the difference map reveals a conformational change in the region of the anticodon loop, which appears to be bent toward the L1 side. The tRNA x-ray structure fitting for the P/E position (Fig. 4,top panel) was done into the spherically masked difference map that was obtained by the subtraction of the 3D map of the naked ribosome from that of tRNAfMet·ribosome complex in the conventional buffer (Fig. 2 c). Unlike P-site tRNA, the difference map for the P/E position is fused with an extra mass of density on the L1-protein side (region marked with # in Fig.4), which is associated with the partially occupied E2 position (see Fig. 2, c and e and Fig. 3 b). Three independent attempts to obtain the best overall fit of x-ray structure into the difference map resulted in virtually congruent positions. The fit showing highest cross-correlation value (7Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) was assigned as the P/E position. The anticodon loops of tRNAs in the P/P and the P/E positions are found in overlapping positions, whereas their 3′-OH groups of bases 76 are approximately 45 Å apart, and the angle between the equivalent planes of the two tRNAs is approximately 35o. Deacylated tRNAfMet is observed mainly in the P/P position (the classical P site) and only weakly in the P/E position if the polyamine buffer is used (Fig. 2, dand f), whereas the preference is reversed under the conditions of the conventional buffer, containing higher Mg2+ and lacking polyamines (Fig. 2, c ande). It follows that a ribosome binding a singletRNA at the operationally defined P site may carry that tRNA at strikingly different locations, namely at the P site corresponding to a peptidyl-tRNA analog (e.g.fMet-tRNAfMet), and also at the P/E position if the tRNA is deacylated. The only feature that the two tRNAs, in the P/P and P/E positions, have in common is that they share the region where the anticodon of the P-site tRNA interacts with the mRNA codon, whereas the rest of the tRNA molecule is located in different ways (Fig. 5). Under conventional buffer conditions, the P site is exclusively occupied for peptidyl-tRNA analogs (Fig. 2 a), and the P/E position is preferably occupied by deacylated tRNAs (Fig. 2 c), an observation that substantiates older findings of fluorescence transfer measurements, which show the peptidyl-tRNA analog, AcPhe-tRNAPhe, at the P site changes its position when it is deacylated via a puromycin reaction (28Hardesty B. Odom O.W. Deng H.-Y. Hardesty B. Kramer G. Structure Function and Genetics of Ribosomes. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 495-508Google Scholar). Similarly, the nucleotides of the 23 S rRNA within the 50 S subunit that are protected by the 3′-end of the tRNA against chemical modifications change from the P-site pattern to the E-site pattern upon the puromycin reaction (29Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), one of the results on which the hybrid-site model (29Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) is based. The fact that tRNAs at the P site and P/E position overlap significantly (Fig. 5) excludes the possibility that the P/E site can be occupied simultaneously either with the P or with the E site. The anticodon of a tRNA at the P/E position overlaps with that of the tRNA in the P site as mentioned already, but it is turned by an angle of 35o (±5o) as compared with the latter, a movement presumably facilitated by the flexibility of the anticodon loop. The anticodon of P-site tRNA is found in the immediate vicinity of the channel passing through the neck of 30 S subunit. This channel was first observed by Frank and co-workers (2Frank J. Zhu J. Penczek P. Li Y. Srivastava S. Verschoor A. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Lata R.K. Agrawal R.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and postulated to be the conduit for mRNA (2Frank J. Zhu J. Penczek P. Li Y. Srivastava S. Verschoor A. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Lata R.K. Agrawal R.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J.

Biol. 1996; 262: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The anticodon of the A-site tRNA is found on the shoulder side (Fig. 3 band Refs. 4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Science. 1996; 271: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar and 5Stark H. Orlova E.V. Rinke-Appel J. Jünke N. Mueller F. Rodnina M. Wintermeyer W. Brimacombe R. van Heel M. Cell. 1997; 88: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), whereas that of P-site tRNA is situated on the platform side of the channel. A recent 16 S RNA model (31Mueller F. Stark H. van Heel M. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 566-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which incorporates cross-linking data between rRNA and mRNA, strongly favors this channel as the conduit for the mRNA. The tRNA in the P/E position observed here adopts a similar orientation as reported earlier for the P-site tRNA (4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Science. 1996; 271: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); however, the whole molecule is shifted toward L1 by approximately 30 Å. The different positional assignment for the P-site tRNA in our earlier study (4Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. Science. 1996; 271: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was because of two main reasons: (i) as the current study shows, the deacylated tRNA preferably assumes the P/E position for the conventional buffer system used in the earlier study; and (ii) the anticodons and elbows of the A-site and the weakly occupied P-site tRNAs appeared fused. This latter problem was solved in this study (Fig. 3 b) where the 3D map of fMet-tRNAfMet·ribosome complex, visualized in the same conventional buffer (Fig. 2 a), was used as control to compute the difference map. This subtraction helped in determining the boundary between the A- and P-site tRNAs and gave distinct and separate masses related to A and E2 (see “Results”) positions and partially overlapping P/E and E positions. Because this article is mainly concerned with the P and P/E states, detailed results about other superimposable tRNA positions will be presented elsewhere. The P-site assignment of Stark and co-workers (5Stark H. Orlova E.V. Rinke-Appel J. Jünke N. Mueller F. Rodnina M. Wintermeyer W. Brimacombe R. van Heel M. Cell. 1997; 88: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) appears to be similar to the P-site position described here, as far as it can be inferred from the published information, but a detailed comparison of the maps has not been made thus far. Interestingly, a different location for P-site tRNA, similar to P/E position seen here, was also suggested by Mueller and co-workers (31Mueller F. Stark H. van Heel M. Rinke-Appel J. Brimacombe R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 566-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) on the basis of experiments where single deacylated tRNAfMet was bound to the ribsome under the conventional buffer conditions. Furthermore, a cross-linking result between the L1 protein and elbow region (through nucleotide 20) of the deacylated tRNAmMet (32Podkowinski J. Gornicki P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), bound at the presumed P site, can only be explained by the P/E position. The hybrid-site model (29Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) describes the translocation of tRNA as an alternating movement of the two ends of the molecule on one or the other subunit. Accordingly, the states A/P and P/E might be observable between the pre- and the post-translocational steps of the elongation cycle. We do see a mass attributable to a tRNA in the hybrid P/E position, a position which is occupied by a deacylated tRNA and apparently predominant under conventional buffer conditions (Fig. 2,c and e, and Fig. 3). In the polyamine buffer a strong P site and a weak P/E position are observed (Fig. 2,d and f). It should be pointed out that the hybrid-site model (29Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) was suggested from experiments done in conventional buffer conditions. Thus, our results are of crucial importance in evaluating the functional relevance of this model. Results presented here clearly show that under the polyamine buffer conditions, even the deacylated tRNA mostly occupies the P site, whereas the same tRNA moves mostly to the P/E position under the conventional buffer condition. Our observation is also supported by the studies of Lill and Wintermeyer (33Lill R. Wintermeyer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which indicated that the higher concentration of Mg2+, in general, triggers the tRNA movement toward the L1 side. It is possible that under the conventional buffer condition, a change in local conformation or the microenvironment of the ribosome is induced in a way that favors the binding of tRNA in the P/E position. In this context, a detailed cryoelectron microscopy analysis of various tRNA·ribosome complexes should be mentioned, which has shown that the L1-protein conformation is substantially altered by switching the buffer conditions. 3R.

In vivo footprinting studies demonstrated that both the CRE and the NFI-binding site are occupied by transcription factors, regardless of the presence of factors that stimulate (dibutyryl cAMP or dexamethasone) or inhibit (insulin) transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter. The NFI effects on transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter were observed even in the absence of the NFI binding site, suggesting the possibility of other weaker binding sites on the promoter or an interaction of NFI with a transcriptional co-activator.

Overexpression of a gene fragment encoding the CREB binding domain of CBP stimulates transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter. The inhibitory effect of NFI on transcription of the PEPCK gene induced by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A appears to be the result of an interaction between NFI and the CREB-binding protein in which NFI competes with CREB for binding to the CREB-binding site on CBP. In contrast, glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone use the steroid hormone receptor binding domain of CBP to stimulate transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter.

In this study we examine how nuclear factor I (NFI) transduces its signal to the initiation complex and how it interacts with other transcription factors, either competitively or cooperatively. In general transcription factor activation domains fall into four main groups based on recurring motifs (12Martin K.J. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). NFI has a proline-rich transactivation domain and a DNA binding domain that is highly conserved among the various NFI isoforms but shows no homology to other well characterized domains (13Bandyopadhyay S.

Many transcription factors are capable of interacting cooperatively. The NFI cis-element on the PEPCK promoter is located immediately adjacent to the CRE. Altering the relative positions of the NFI site and CRE on the PEPCK gene promoter did not affect the ability of NFI to abrogate CRE-mediated PKA-c induction of transcription in hepatoma cells (14Crawford D.R. Leahy P. Hu C.Y. Gronostajski R. Grossman G. Woods J. Hakimi P. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13387-13390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, the proximity of P1 and CRE sites in the PEPCK gene promoter was not critical for the NFI effect. The ability of NFI to block CRE-mediated stimuli such as that achieved by the co-transfection of PKA-c, apparently without direct interaction between the proteins, suggested that another signal transduction pathway must exist. Recently we have studied the effects of the various isoforms of NFI on cAMP induction of transcription of the PEPCK gene (14Crawford D.R. Leahy P. Hu C.Y. Gronostajski R. Grossman G. Woods J.

The NFI site in the PEPCK gene promoter contains the consensus NFI binding sequence TTGGC(N)5GCCAA (16Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R.

There are four genes encoding NFI proteins, all of which are expressed in the liver (19Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mutating the NFI-binding site (P1) of the PEPCK gene promoter results in a marked increase in the level of basal expression of a linked structural gene (bGH) in the livers of transgenic mice and the premature expression of bGH mRNA in the liver in utero, as compared with control mice carrying a transgene with an intact PEPCK promoter (20Patel Y.M. Yun J.S. Liu J. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5619-5628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that NFI serves the important function of maintaining a low basal level of transcription of the PEPCK gene in the liver until stimulation by hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormone occurs. In the current study we confirm the function of NFI in the control of PEPCK gene transcription, and we describe the key role of CBP in coordinating not only the effects of NFI but other transcription factors involved in determining the level of hepatic PEPCK gene transcription. [3H]Chloramphenicol (30–60 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [32P]dCTP (3000Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Bt2cAMP and butyryl-coenzyme A were bought from Sigma. HepG2 cells were originally purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD). The Checkmate® mammalian two-hybrid assay kit was purchased from the Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The expression vector for catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was a gift from Dr. Masa-Aki Muramatsu. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 cell culture medium and fetal calf serum were from Life Technologies Inc. All other reagents used in this study were of the highest quality obtainable. All expression vectors for the NFI proteins were the same as those used in an earlier study (19Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev.

Beyreuther K. Sippel A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The expression vectors for the full-length CBP and the fragments of CBP was generous gifts from Dr. Richard Goodman, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR. In vivophoto-footprinting was carried out essentially as described by Becker and Grossmann (21Becker M.M. Grossmann G. Revzin A. Footprinting of Nucleic Acid-Protein Complexes. Academic Press, New York1993: 129-157Crossref Google Scholar). Minimal deviation H4 hepatoma cells were grown to 70% confluence in 100-mm plates in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and Ham's F-12 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Before hormone treatment, cells were grown for 20 h in serum-free medium. Four hours prior to UV irradiation, hormones were added to modulate endogenous PEPCK expression as follows: basal (serum-free), stimulatory (0.5 mm Bt2cAMP, 1 mm theophylline and 1.0 μm dexamethasone), or inhibitory (0.5 mm Bt2cAMP, 1 mmtheophylline, 1.0 μm dexamethasone, and 50 nminsulin). The medium was then removed from the cells, and the cell monolayer was irradiated with 254 nm UV light at 1200J/m2. Genomic DNA was then harvested from the irradiated cells. An oligonucleotide primer specific to bases −399 to −341 of the PEPCK gene promoter was labeled to high specific activity with32P, hybridized to the endogenous PEPCK gene, and extended using Taq DNA polymerase at 74 °C. Synthesis of the complementary DNA by Taq DNA polymerase is terminated one nucleotide before sites of photo-damage on the template DNA. The extended products were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Sites of photoproduct formation were mapped against Sanger di-deoxy sequence patterns in parallel lanes. Non-irradiated genomic DNA from H4 hepatoma cells was analyzed as a control to display sequence-dependent extension artifacts. Signals were visualized using a PhosphorImager®. Enhanced bands (relative to those found in the control DNA) are indicative of an increased rate of photoproduct formation, whereas a weaker band is indicative of a decreased rate of photoproduct formation. Proteins bound to DNA may lead to either increased or decreased rates of photoproduct formation depending upon the properties of the protein binding to the DNA. Changes in the rate of UV photoproduct formation in the genomic DNA of the treated cells are taken as evidence of protein-DNA interaction. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan absorb relatively weakly at 254 nm. The changes in band intensity is likely to be caused by a DNA structural distortion brought about by the binding of a protein at that locale, which forces photosensitive bases into a geometry less favorable to the formation of photoproduct. As a negative control, genomic DNA was recovered from untreated H4 cells, purified, and irradiated for similar periods with UV light. The banding pattern on the control DNA is used for comparison with the banding pattern on the stimulated DNA. The details of the construction of the chimeric PEPCK-CAT and the P1-CAT genes used in the transfection experiments were outlined previously (22Park E.A. Roesler W.J. Liu J. Klemm D.J. Gurney A.L. Thatcher J. Shuman J. Friedman A. Hanson R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6264-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Block mutations were introduced into the PEPCK gene promoter at the P1 (NFI-binding site) as described by Liu et al. (23Liu J. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 738-741PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations eliminate binding of the respective cognate binding proteins to the PEPCK gene promoter. NFI expression vectors were as described previously (14Crawford D.R. Leahy P. Hu C.Y. Gronostajski R. Grossman G. Woods J. Hakimi P. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13387-13390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HepG2 human hepatoma cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 50% F-12 nutrient mixture (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12). Cells were passaged at least four times prior to use and were allowed to grow to 30–40% confluence prior to DNA transfection. The H4 hepatoma cells used for the in vivo footprinting study were grown as described previously (24Wynshaw-Boris A. Short J.M. Loose D.S. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9714-9720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeric genes containing the PEPCK gene promoter, modified as described above, were transfected into HepG2 cells using calcium phosphate as described previously (7Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In practice, three replicate 100-mm plates of 30–40% confluent HepG2 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of 490-CAT. Other plasmids were co-transfected into HepG2 cells as indicated under “Results.” Control cells were transfected with buffer alone. The cells were given fresh medium at 24 h after transfection, harvested at 48 h, and cell extracts prepared for the determination of CAT activity. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Plates were drained and cells were rinsed in 1× PBS buffer. Ice-cold 1× PBS (1 ml) was added to each plate, and cells were scraped free of the surface and transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube kept on ice. Samples were centrifuged for 20 s at 10,000 rpm; the supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 250 mm Tris-Cl, at pH 7.8. Samples were subjected to three freeze-thaw vortex cycles using ethanol/dry ice and a 37 °C water bath and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and placed in a 58 °C water bath for 10 min to denature inhibitors of CAT (25Leahy P. Carmichael G.C. Rossomando E.F. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 894-898PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mandel H.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The samples were centrifuged again for 10 min at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatant was used to assay CAT activity using [3H] chloramphenicol, butyryl-CoA, and the xylene phase extraction method (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 101-120Google Scholar). All transfection studies were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Differences between means of each treatment were tested for statistical significance using Student's t test (one-tailed) (28Zar J.H. McElroy W.D. Swanson C.P. Biostatistical Analysis. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1974: 101-120Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least twice with three values per experiment. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the mean for the number of determinations noted in the legends to the figures. Plasmids encoding the CREB and E1A binding domains of CBP (amino acid residues 451–682 and 1678–2441, respectively) linked to amino acids 1–147 of Gal4 (the DNA binding domain) were gifts from Dr. Richard Goodman, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR. For brevity these plasmids have been renamed pBCBP451 and pBCBP1678, the initial “B” indicating its role of “Binding” the luciferase promoter. Two other regions of CBP encompassing the steroid binding domain (amino acids 1–299) and a more restricted E1A binding domain (amino acids 1678–1843) were also subcloned into the pBIND vector supplied as a part of the mammalian two-hybrid kit (Promega). The primer pairs used for these were 5′-GCTAGGATCCATGGCCGAGAACTTGCTGC-3′/5′-GCTAGCTAGCGGCCGCTTTGCTGGCTAACTGGGG-3′ for the steroid binding domain and 5′-GCTAGGATCCGAATTCTCTTCCTTACGCCGC-3′/5′-GCTAGCGGCCGCGAGGCAGAAGGGCACAGGGC-3′ for the restricted E1A binding domain. The region of the pHANFI-C plasmid encoding the C-terminal transactivation domain (amino acids 220–499) was amplified using these polymerase chain reaction primers, 5′-GCTAGGATCCTTTGTCACGTCAGGTGTGTTC-3′, in which the addedBamHI site is underlined and immediately precedes the codon for amino acid 220 of NFI-C. The downstream primer 5′-GCTAGCGGCCGCCTAATCCCACAAAGGGACTGTCTG-3′ has an introduced NotI site (underlined) immediately following the stop codon of NFI-C. The amplified fragment was subcloned into theNotI/BamHI-digested pACT vector supplied as part of the Checkmate® mammalian two-hybrid kit (Promega). The resultant plasmid was named pAC220, the initial “A” indicating its putative “Activator” role in the two-hybrid system. The luciferase reporter gene contained five tandem repeats of the Gal4-binding site. The plasmids pBCBP451, pBCBP1678, and pAC200 were then used in co-transfection experiments to test for the presence of an interaction with Gal4-CBP fragment fusion proteins, along with the pertinent controls. A base line was generated by co-transfecting HepG2 cells with a plasmid, pBind, that contains the Gal4 DNA binding domain together with pACT containing the VP16 transactivation domain and a luciferase reporter gene (pG5Luc). DNA structural changes and the binding of sequence-specific binding proteins to DNA may be detected by comparing the rate of UV photoproduct formation in naked DNA irradiated in vitro with the rate of UV photoproduct formation in DNA irradiated in vivo. In order to determine the physiological circumstances under which the NFI-binding sites, CRE and TATA box on the PEPCK gene promoter (see Fig. 1 A for organization of the promoter) were occupied by transcription factors, we carried out in vivo irradiation. UV photo-footprinting of the endogenous PEPCK gene was carried out using H4 cells treated in a manner calculated to provide widely divergent transcriptional responses (Fig. 1 B). These cells were maintained for 3 h in a serum-free (basal conditions) medium or were treated with a combination of Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone to stimulate PEPCK gene transcription or with a combination of three hormones (Bt2cAMP, dexamethasone, and insulin). Insulin inhibits PEPCK gene transcription (29Granner D.K. Andreone T. Sasaki K. Beale E. Nature. 1983; 305: 549-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cells treated as above were subjected to UV irradiation for the time indicated in Fig. 1 B in order to introduce covalent bonding between consecutive pyrimidine moieties in the genomic DNA. Proteins bound to the DNA can act in a manner that either magnifies the effect of UV irradiation or deflects and thereby decreases the rate at which inter-pyrimidine covalent bonds are formed.Taq DNA polymerases used in subsequent primer extension analyses have difficulty reading through the modified pyrimidines leading to pausing and banding patterns that correlate with the location of pyrimidines (see Ref. 21Becker M.M. Grossmann G. Revzin A. Footprinting of Nucleic Acid-Protein Complexes. Academic Press, New York1993: 129-157Crossref Google Scholar for a detailed description of the method and its limitations). Proteins bound to the DNA increase or decrease the banding patterns and thereby provide a unique footprint. Several significant differences in UV photoproduct signal intensity are evident between H4 DNA irradiated in vivo under different PEPCK transcription states (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–3) and H4 genomic DNA irradiated in vitro (lanes 4 and5). The banding patterns in the P1, CRE, and TATA box sites in the PEPCK gene promoter, under a variety of hormonal treatment conditions, are different from the patterns seen in the control cells (lanes 4 and 5). Four changes of footprint map to the TATA box and early RNA coding regions. These have been designated with plus symbols next to the vertical bar and are seen only in the presence of the Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone. These bands are consistent with initiation site occupancy by the TATA box binding factor and RNA polymerase, respectively. The rate of UV photoproduct formation at the CRE and NFI-binding site (bands e and f in lanes 1–3) is markedly and reproducibly different in vivofrom the corresponding DNA sites irradiated in vitro(bands e and f in lanes 4 and 5). We interpret the differences in the rate of UV photoproduct formation within the NFI-binding site/CRE in vivo, relative to the naked DNA, to signify that these promoter elements are continuously occupied regardless of the transcriptional state of the PEPCK gene. Faber et al. (30Faber S. O'Brien R.M. Imai E. Granner D.K. Chalkely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported a similar finding using hepatoma cells treated with Bt2cAMP. Since the NFI-binding site appears to be continuously occupied by proteins, modulation of transcription caused by NFI may reflect the binding of different NFI isoforms during different physiological stimuli. The extent to which the P1 site on the PEPCK promoter is necessary for the NFI effects was determined by transfecting a PEPCK-CAT reporter gene containing a block mutation in the P1 site (“P1-CAT”) into HepG2 cells in the presence and absence of the various NFI-A and NFI-C isoforms (Fig.2). NFI-A induced transcription from the intact PEPCK promoter 6-fold but increased transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter with a mutation in the P1 site only 2.5-fold (Fig.2 A). Similar results were observed for NFI-C (Fig.2 B). NFI-C blocked PKA-c-induced transcription from the intact PEPCK gene promoter by 60%, whereas PKA induction of the chimeric PEPCK-CAT gene with a mutation in the P1 site was inhibited by only 25%. Thus, removal of the NFI-binding site clearly reduced the effectiveness of NFI in altering PEPCK gene. There are two possible explanations for the partial effects observed in the absence of the NFI site: (i) NFI may be promiscuous in its binding and have other weaker binding sites on the promoter, and (ii) NFI may be capable of direct interaction with components of the initiation complex. Mutant transcription factors that cannot dimerize or bind DNA have been shown to be capable of activating or repressing transcription (31Heck S. Kullman N. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 32Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). One candidate for mediating these site-independent effects is a co-activator molecule such as the CBP/p300 family of proteins. Members of this family have multiple binding domains and have been implicated as co-activators in the signal transduction of members of the steroid receptor superfamily as well as members of the leucine zipper group of transcription factor such as c-Fos and c-Jun (33Shikama N. Lyon J. LaThangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Although the transcriptional regulation of the PEPCK gene promoter has never been linked directly to CBP/p300, such an interaction is likely since PEPCK gene expression is induced by thyroid hormone (34Giralt M. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Liu J.S. Hakimi P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21991-21996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glucocorticoids (5Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18133-18139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all of which are known to bind to CBP. In addition, the adenovirus early protein, E1A, which binds to CBP, markedly inhibits cAMP-induced transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter in hepatoma cells (36Kalvakolanu D.V.R. Liu J. Hanson R.W. Harter M.L. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2530-2536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However there has been no report of a direct interaction of members of the NFI family of transcription factors with CBP. Co-transfection of increasing amounts of an expression vector for CBP caused a linear, 7-fold increase in expression of the PEPCK-CAT gene (Fig. 3 A). Further increasing the amount of transfected CBP plasmid caused a dramatic decrease in CAT activity. Another indication that CBP coordinates the transduction of a stimulus to the initiation complex on the PEPCK gene promoter is its susceptibility to the action of E1A, which binds CBP at the E1A binding domain located near the C-terminal of CBP (37Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). E1A has only a marginal effect on the low level of basal transcription from the PEPCK gene promoter but can markedly inhibit the induction of transcription by PKA-c (Fig. 3 B). An E1A mutant (Δ2-36), defective in its ability to bind CBP by virtue of a mutation in its N-terminal region, did not block the expected stimulation of expression of the PEPCK-CAT gene by PKA-c (Fig. 3 B, inset).

The constructs have been expressed in two eukaryotic model systems, baculoviral and CHO-K1. Post-translational modifications that normally occur in fibrillin-1, including glycosylation, signal peptide cleavage, and carboxyl-terminal processing, occur in the three constructs in both cell systems. Amino-terminal sequencing of secreted protein revealed leader sequence processing at two sites, a primary site between Gly-24/Ala-25 and a secondary site of Ala-27/Asn-28. Processing of the carboxyl-terminal domain could be observed by migration differences in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was evident in both mammalian and insect cells. Immunological identification by Western blotting confirmed the loss of the expected region.

Near the amino terminus, fibrillin-1 contains a proline-rich domain that is unique to the molecule, whereas fibrillin-2 contains a glycine-rich domain in the analogous location. Both proteins have homologous carboxyl-terminal domains of about 185 residues. No functions have yet been ascribed to any fibrillin domains, and nothing is known about their role in the assembly of fibrillin-containing microfibrils. The fibrillins are known to undergo several post-translational modifications that include β-hydroxylation of Asn/Asp residues,N-linked glycosylation, and proteolytic cleavage of both the leader sequence and the carboxyl-terminal domain (10Glanville R.W.

J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2373-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Due to the large size and great degree of similarity of fibrillin-1 and -2, it is difficult to distinguish between the two molecules much less experimentally evaluate the proteolytic processing of their carboxyl-terminal domains. To better understand the processing of the fibrillin-1 carboxyl-terminal domain, we have developed three truncated fibrillin expression constructs, one with the full-lengthFBN1 carboxyl-terminal domain, one with the domain deleted, and one with a mutation near the putative cleavage site. These protein constructs have been expressed in two eukaryotic model systems, baculoviral expression in SF9 insect cells and CHO-K1 mammalian cell lines. Both systems are able to produce and secrete each of the three constructs. Here we show that proteolytic processing of the fibrillin-1 carboxyl-terminal domain occurs in the constructs expressed in these systems. The loss of the expected region can be seen by SDS-PAGE migration differences and immunologically by Western blotting. Impaired cleavage observed in the construct with a mutated multi-basic site confirms the involvement of that region in normal processing. The use of secretion blocking agents shows that processing occurs intracellularly in the CHO-K1 cells and most likely by an early secretory pathway resident furin-like enzyme. The LEEC construct was amplified from human mRNA and was initially cloned in four parts (Figs. 1 and 2). The first part is “L,” the leader sequence of FBN1 (exon 1). The second part is “E1,” first half of the EGF-like and 8-cysteine domains (FBN1 exons 23–33). The third part is “E2,” the second half of the EGF-like and 8-cysteine domains (FBN1 exons 30–44); and the fourth part is “C,” the carboxyl-terminal domain (FBN1 exon 64–65). The FBN1 leader sequence and carboxyl-terminal domains were each amplified using the primers described below by reverse transcription of 2.0 μg of total RNA isolated from human foreskin fibroblasts with 20 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction under standard conditions. Each cDNA was isolated from a low melting point agarose gel and ligated into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The E1 and E2 inserts were similarly amplified using 40 cycles of polymerase chain reaction and Vent polymerase and cloned into the pGEM-t vector (Promega, Madison, WI).Figure 2Amino acid sequence of expression constructs. The sequences of LEE, LEEC, and LEEC-P1 are identical from residue 1 to 1002. The LEEC and LEEC-P1 proteins also contain the FBN1 carboxyl-terminal domain. The Arg to Ser substitution present in the LEEC-P1 mutant is shown in bold above the sequence. Residues introduced by restriction sites are shown in bold letters. The putative FBN1 carboxyl-terminal domain cleavage site is boxed. The peptide sequences used for the Fib15D and 386 antibodies are underlined. The first 54 residues of FBN1 (exon 1) were used as the leader sequence in all of our constructs. Protein secreted by CHO and SF9 cells contains two populations of amino-terminally processed LEEC as indicated byarrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These primers are designed to amplify the coding region of the first exon of the FBN1gene. The sense primer begins with an EcoRI restriction site and Kozak consensus sequence followed by the initiating ATG codon. The antisense primer contains two other unique restriction sites,BspEI and BsiWI, that allow splicing to the next domain or the in frame replacement or removal of the leader sequence. Together they amplify a 195-bp product that encodes the first 56 amino acids of fibrilin-1 that contain the putative hydrophobic signal peptide leader sequence: leader sense primer, 5′-GGAATTCGCCACCATGCGTCGAGGGCGTCTG-3′; and leader antisense primer 5′-CCCCTCCGGATCCCGTACGGACATTG GGTCCTTTAAGC-3′. This primer pair is designed to amplify a 1,455-bp product that corresponds to the first codon of FBN1 exon 23 and continues into exon 33. The sense primer begins with a BsiWI restriction site to allow ligation to the 3′ end of the leader sequence: E1 sense primer, 5′-GACTCGTACGGATATAGATGAATGTGAAGTGTTCC-3′; and E1 antisense primer, 5′-TCCTTCCTTGCACAGACAGCGG-3′. These primers are designed to amplify a 1,771-bp product that begins in exon 30 and continues through exon 44 of FBN1. This sequence overlaps with clone E1 and can be joined to it by a common SmaI restriction site. The antisense primer contains a BspEI site for ligation to the carboxyl-terminal domain sequence: E2 sense primer, 5′-TTGTGTTATGATGGATTCATGG-3′; and E2 antisense primer, 5′-TCAGTCCGGAATTGCACTGTCCTGTGGA-3′. These primers are designed to amplify 572-bp coding sequence that begins with the first amino acid after the last EGF-like domain of FBN1and continues to the termination codon. The sense primer contains 5′-BspEI-NheI-3′ sites to facilitate assembly and substitution or removal of the domain. The antisense primer contains 5′-XbaI-NheI-3′ sites to facilitate vector transfer and carboxyl-terminal domain substitution or removal. The carboxyl-terminal sense primer is 5′-GTCATCCGGAGCTAGCTCTGGAATGGGCATGGG-3′ and the carboxyl-terminal antisense primer is 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTAGCTTAATGAAGCAAAACCTGGAT-3′. The FBN1 leader sequence clone insert was excised, gel-purified, and ligated to the 5′ end of the EGF1 clone usingXbaI and BsiWI restriction sites. As blue/white selection was already disrupted, positive clones were identified by colony lifts screened with polymerase chain reaction-generated radioactive probe. The LS/EGF1 cDNA sequence was excised, gel-purified, and ligated into position 5′ of the EGF2 clone with 5′-ApaI and 3′-SmaI restriction sites thus producing the sequence referred to as “LEE.” The LEE sequence was then inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) usingEcoRI and XbaI sites. The carboxyl-terminal domain was inserted into the pcDNA/LEE with 5′-BspEI and 3′-XbaI sites to yield the sequence referred to as “LEEC.” The leader sequence and carboxyl-terminal domains were sequenced in both directions upon initial cloning. The E1 and E2 clones were sequenced at each end. After each assembly step, the junctions were sequenced to ensure the maintenance of the reading frame. The −P1 mutant was produced by site-directed mutagenesis using theFBN1 carboxyl-terminal clone C. Primer 90 (5′-CGTTTGTGCTGCTCCGTTTC-3′) and CT sense were used to amplify a 200-bp 5′ fragment, and primer 89 (5′-GAAACGGAGCAGCACAAACG-3′) and CT antisense were used to amplify a 400-bp 3′ fragment. Equimolar amounts of the two fragments were then used as templates to amplify the full-length mutant carboxyl-terminal fragment using the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C/2 min, annealing at 55 °C/3 min, and extension at 72 °C/1 min for six cycles. The carboxyl-terminal sense and antisense primers were then added to the reaction, and 30 additional cycles were carried out. Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T and sequenced. The FBN1 carboxyl-terminal domain was excised from the initial clone described above using the 5′-BspEI and 3′-HindIII sites and ligated into the pQE32 expression vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using the 5′-XbaI and 3′-HindIII restriction sites. This vector contains an initiating ATG followed by a sequence that codes for six histidine residues, all of which are upstream of the inserted sequence. The resulting protein contains an amino-terminal His-tag that can bind a Ni2+ ion containing solid support resin to facilitate purification (Qiagen). The recombinant FBN1carboxyl-terminal protein contains the following additional residues amino-terminal to the first residue of the domain: MRGSHHHHHHGIRMRARYPGAS + (FBN1-Ser-2688 to His-2871 terminus). The full-length recombinant peptide contains 206 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 23,266 Da and an isoelectric point of pH 8.4. The protein sequence was confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing of 15 residues. Log phase cells growing in 500 ml of Luria broth at 37 °C were induced to produce protein with 1.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Five hours post-induction, the cultures were pelleted, lysed with 8 m urea, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The recombinant protein with the 6× His tag was purified from the other bacterial proteins in the crude lysate by binding to Ni2+ resin column (Qiagen) and washing out non-bound contaminating proteins, followed by elution with a low pH, 8 m urea wash. The recombinant protein was then dialyzed in 12,000–14,000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis tubing (Spectrum Medical, Laguna Hills, CA) against a 0.5 m acetic acid solution and lyophilized. The LEE, LEEC, and LEEC-P1 coding sequences were each cloned into the pFastbac shuttle vector using 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XbaI sites, and this was used to transform DH10′ cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing bacmid. Plasmid/bacmid recombination occurred through bacterial transposon Tn7 regions flanking the coding insert, and positives were identified with blue/white selection. Bacmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis and transfected into serum-free SF9 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h at 27 °C. Five days after lipofection, conditioned medium was removed, centrifuged to remove debris, and used to infect new cultures of SF9 cells. Cultures expressing protein were determined by Western blot of conditioned medium. Subsequent expression experiments were conducted in either serum-free SF-900IISFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) or IPL41 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The LEE, LEEC, and LEEC-P1 coding sequences were each inserted into the pEE14 vector using the 5′-EcoRI and 3′-BclI sites. This vector employs the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer to drive expression and glutamine synthase minigene driven by the SV40 late promoter to provide selection with methionine sulfoximine (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 16.14.6-16.14.13Google Scholar). The cell lines were established as described previously (14Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, three 60-mm dishes containing adherent CHO-K1 cells (ATCC, CCL-61) at approximately 50% confluency were transfected with 9 μg/dish of purified plasmid DNA that had been previously incubated with 30 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 200 μl of serum-free medium (Glasgow minimum essential medium from Washington University TC Support Center, St. Louis) for 30 min at room temperature. Total volume per dish was 2.0 ml, and the duration of transfection was 5 h after which 3.0 ml of normal serum-containing non-selective medium was added overnight. The following day, each 60-mm dish was subcultured into three 100-mm dishes in selective medium (Glasgow minimum essential medium without glutamine and containing 10% 10,000 molecular weight cut-off dialyzed FBS and 25 μmmethionine sulfoximine). After 14 days under selection, clonal colonies were subcultured into 15-mm wells and screened for expression by Western blot of conditioned medium. Approximately 20 colonies were isolated for each clone and of those 10, 50, and 90% were positive by Western blot of conditioned medium for LEEC, LEE, and LEEC-P1, respectively. For each construct, one clone was chosen based on expression levels and was used in all subsequent experiments. SF9 cells were infected in either serum-free medium (SF900II from Life Technologies, Inc.) or in the presence of 10% FBS in IPL41 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein could be detected as early as 24 h postinfection and continued to be produced up to 90 h postinfection. To protect against degradation under serum-free conditions, medium was collected after 48 h postinfection and (4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride (Life Technologies, Inc.) to 2 mm was added followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C prior to purification. Harvest of protein from serum-containing medium was performed at 90 h postinfection. Various methods were used to purify and concentrate protein from serum-free conditioned medium; these include dialysis in 12,000–14,000 molecular weight cut-off tubing (Spectrum) against PBS and then lyophilization, 40% ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by dialysis and lyophilization, trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by EtOH:ether wash and resuspension, and concentration by 50,000 molecular weight cut-off centrifuge filters (Spectrum). Highest purity and yield were achieved with pressurized ultrafiltration through Diaflow YM100 molecular weight cut-off filters (Amicon, Beverly, MA) followed by fast protein liquid chromatography size fractionation using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.5 ml/min 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.5. To produce conditioned medium containing recombinant protein, LEE-, LEEC-, or LEEC-P1-expressing cells were grown in selective medium until confluency and switched to Hy-Q CCM5 serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) where they were grown for up to 4 days. After conditioning, the medium was withdrawn and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min to pellet debris. Next the medium underwent stirred ultrafiltration under 2.5 pounds/square inch at 4 °C through a YM100 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Amicon) as a purification and concentration step. Cell cultures established from fetal bovine nuchal ligament, fetal bovine vascular smooth muscle (BSMC), and fetal bovine chondrocytes (FBC) were used as a source of fibrillin for positive controls. Protein was harvested in a manner similar to that described for the CHO-K1 lines with the exception that when grown in serum-free medium, DMEM with ITS+3 (Sigma) was used instead. The conditioned medium was used directly or concentrated approximately 25× with ultrafiltration at 2.5 pounds/square inch through XM300K molecular weight cut-off filters (Amicon). The peptides Fib15D (YLDIRPRGDNGDTAC) and FBN1–386 (GNEDGFFKINOKEGC) were made using an Applied Biosystems 431A protein synthesizer by standard FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (Fig. 1 and 2). The peptides were purified and cross-linked to rabbit serum albumin (Sigma) using the heterobifunctional cross-linkerm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pierce) at a molar ratio of approximately 15:1 peptide to rabbit serum albumin. One milligram of peptide-rabbit serum albumin conjugate was emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant for the initial injection into rabbits and Freund's incomplete adjuvant for subsequent injections at 2-week intervals. After 6 weeks, the resulting polyclonal antisera were collected and subjected to a caprylic acid precipitation step, followed by dialysis against PBS, lyophilization, and affinity purification against the immunogen peptide linked to Sulfa-link support (Pierce). After elution with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.3, the purified antibody was dialyzed, lyophilized, and resuspended in PBS at approximately 1.0 mg/ml. The recombinant FBN1 carboxyl-terminal domain was expressed in bacteria, column purified as described above, and used to generate polyclonal antibodies. The immune serum was subjected to a caprylic acid precipitation followed by affinity purification against the protein bound to the Ni2+ resin support. After elution with 8 m urea, pH 8.0, the purified antibody was dialyzed, lyophilized, and resuspended in PBS at approximately 1.0 mg/ml. Medium was removed 24 h postinfection from a 35-mm well containing 1 × 106 SF9 cells, and the infected cells were washed with and then incubated for a 2-h starvation in Cys-free Grace's medium with 5% dialyzed FBS. This was then replaced with Cys-free Grace's medium supplemented with 100 μCi/1.0 ml/well [35S]Cys and 5% dialyzed FBS. Labeling continued for 24 h after which the conditioned medium was collected. Confluent 15-mm wells were incubated in Cys-free DMEM with 5% dialyzed FBS for a 2-h starvation period and then incubated for various times in the presence of 50 μCi of [35S]Cys/200 μl medium/well. Chase medium was non-selective Glasgow minimum essential medium 175 μl/well with 5% FBS. The chase medium was collected after various times points. To collect cell lysate, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and lysed with 175 μl/15-mm well of 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, with 1.5 mm (4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μm aprotinin, 100 μmleupeptin, and 4 mm Pefabloc (Life Technologies. Inc.). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. For SDS-PAGE analysis, 15 ml per lane of labeled medium or supernatant was typically loaded. 5.0 ml of conditioned medium was collected for 24 h from SF9 cells infected with LEEC baculovirus and immunoprecipitated with FBN1 carboxyl-terminal antibody at 1:250 overnight at 4 °C. The IgG-protein complex was bound to solid support with 100 μl of protein A-Trisacryl (Pierce) by a 1-h incubation at room temperature followed by centrifugation and two washes with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. For the PNGase F digestion, 5 μl of the Trisacryl beads were added to each of two parallel tubes containing 9 μl of water and 1.5 μl of 10× denaturing buffer and boiled for 10 min. The tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed to other tubes with 1.0 μl of 10× buffer, 1.0 μl of 10× Nonidet P-40 solution, and 1.0 μl of PNGase (500 New England Biolabs units) and digested at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of reducing loading buffer, and the contents were electrophoresed through a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by Western blot. CHO-K1 cell line stably expressing the LEE construct was washed with and incubated in Cys-free DMEM for 2 h (1 × 106 cells/35-mm well) and then incubated with 125 μCi of [35S]Cys/1.0 ml of medium/well for 24 h in Cys-free DMEM with 5% dialyzed FBS. Medium was collected and spun through a 50,000 molecular weight cut-off column to remove unincorporated label and resuspended in fresh medium at the original volume. Two 20-μl aliquots of conditioned medium were processed in parallel. Each tube received 2.0 μl of denaturing buffer, was boiled for 10 min, centrifuged, and then received 2.0 μl each of Buffer G7 and Nonidet P-40 10× (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and one tube also received 2.5 μl of PNGase F (1,250 NEB New England Biolabs units), and both were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of reducing loading buffer, and the contents were electrophoresed through a 5.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 6 h. Baculoviral- and CHO-K1-expressed protein was collected from conditioned medium and concentrated by ultrafiltration as described above. Twenty μl of concentrated sample was loaded with reducing buffer onto SDS-PAGE and run at 20 mA for 1.5 h. Proteins were transferred onto ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride support (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and detected with Coomassie stain. Appropriate bands were excised and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems model 473A automated sequencer using Edman degradation. CHO-K1 cells expressing LEEC were grown to confluency with normal medium in 15-mm wells. Before the introduction of [35S]Cys pulse, all wells underwent a 2-h Cys-free starvation as described above. Thirty min prior to the pulse, A23187 was added to a final concentration of 2 μm to the appropriate wells. Fifteen min before the pulse, brefeldin A, ammonium chloride, and monensin were added to the appropriate wells in final concentrations of 10 μg/ml, 50 mm, and 10 μm, respectively. All cells were then pulsed for 30 min as described above. After the pulse, the wells were washed once with normal medium containing blocking agents and then incubated with 175 μl of normal cold chase medium containing blocking agents for 2 h. Chase medium was retained and analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells were washed 3× with PBS then lysed as described above. Cell lysate was microcentrifuged 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Using the primers described under “Experimental Procedures,” each of the target sequences was amplified and assembled as described in Figs.1 and 2. All three constructs, LEE, LEEC and LEEC-P1, begin with the first 56 amino acids (exon 1) of fibrillin-1. This is spliced to exons 23–44 of fibrillin-1 which contains 17 calcium binding EGF-like domains, three LTBP-like repeats, one RGD sequence, and eight potential sites of N-linked glycosylation. In the LEEC and LEEC-P1 proteins, exon 44 is spliced to the entire carboxyl-terminal domain of FBN1 which contains the putative cleavage site and three potential sites ofN-linked glycosylation. The carboxyl-terminal domain of LEEC-P1 contains the Arg to Ser mutation at the tetrabasic cleavage site. The entire LEEC construct contains 1189 amino acids, has a pI of pH 4.6, and a predicted molecular mass of 129,907 daltons. As seen in other proteins containing several EGF-like domains, all constructs run at a higher than expected molecular weight on SDS-PAGE. Each of the three fibrillin-1 constructs was expressed in SF9 insect cell lines. All were produced at high levels with the expected post-translational modifications (see below). Protein was produced in SF9 cells under both serum-containing and serum-free conditions. Time course experiments revealed that peak protein production occurred between 24 and 48 h postinfection, although a significant amount of production continued out to 90 h (data not shown). Harvest of protein from serum-containing medium was performed at 90 h postinfection and was often used for Western blots without further purification. In general, production in the absence of serum resulted in higher levels of protein degradation but had greater ease of purification due to lower amounts of background serum proteins. The extent of degradation was related to the progression of infection and subsequent lysis of the host SF9 cells. Protein produced under both serum-free and serum-containing conditions was used for glycosylation analysis, amino-terminal sequencing, Western blots, and the solubility experiments. The FIB15D, FBN1-CT, and FBN1–386 antibodies recognized the appropriate constructs on Western blot (Fig. 3). Transfection of each of the thr"
https://openalex.org/W1967072563,"Recently, we reported that, in contrast to protein kinase C (PKC)α and βII, PKCδ does not require phosphorylation of a specific threonine (Thr505) in the activation loop for catalytic competence (Stempka et al. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6805–6811). Here, we show that the acidic residue glutamic acid 500 (Glu500) in the activation loop is important for the catalytic function of PKCδ. A Glu500 to valine mutant shows 76 and 73% reduced kinase activity toward autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation, respectively. With regard to thermal stability and inhibition by the inhibitors Gö6976 and Gö6983 the mutant does not differ from the wild type, indicating that the general conformation of the molecule is not altered by the site-directed mutagenesis. Thus, Glu500 in the activation loop of PKCδ might take over at least part of the role of the phosphate groups on Thr497and Thr500 of PKCα and βII, respectively. Accordingly, PKCδ exhibits kinase activity and is able to autophosphorylate probably without posttranslational modification. Autophosphorylation of PKCδ in vitro occurs on Ser643, as demonstrated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides of autophosphorylated PKCδ wild type and mutants. A peptide containing this site is phosphorylated also in vivo, i.e. in recombinant PKCδ purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells. A Ser643 to alanine mutation indicates that autophosphorylation of Ser643 is not essential for the kinase activity of PKCδ.

Recently, the role of phosphorylation of PKCδ,i.e. either autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by an exogenous protein kinase, for the regulation of its enzymatic activity could, to some extent, be elucidated and compared with that of other PKC isoforms. It was shown that, in contrast to PKCα (37Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and PKCβII (38Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKCδ does not require phosphorylation of a specific threonine (Thr505 corresponding to Thr497 and Thr500 of PKCα and βII, respectively) in the activation loop for catalytic competence (39Stempka L.

PKCδ wild type as well as a Thr505 to alanine mutant were expressed in bacteria in a catalytically competent form. Specific activities of these enzymes were comparable with that of native PKCδ from porcine spleen (39Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent studies with a Ser643 to alanine mutant of PKCδ indicated that phosphorylation of this residue might be required for enzymatic activity (40Li W. Zhang J. Bottaro D.P. Li W. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24550-24555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ser643 was not unequivocally identified as an autophosphorylation site of PKCδ but corresponds to one of thein vivo autophosphorylation sites of PKCβII,i.e. Thr641 (41Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M.

Finally, it was reported by several groups that tyrosine phosphorylation affects the kinase activity of PKCδ and also other PKC isoforms in vitro andin vivo (10Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M.

Here we demonstrate that glutamic acid 500 is important for the catalytic function of PKCδ and thus might take over at least part of the role of the phosphate groups of Thr497 and Thr500 of PKCα and βII, respectively. By MALDI mass spectrometry of tryptic PKCδ peptides we provide evidence that Ser643 is an autophosphorylation site of PKCδin vitro and that a PKCδ peptide containing Ser643 is phosphorylated also in vivo. TPA was supplied by Dr. E. Hecker (German Cancer Research Center). Gö6976 and Gö6983 were kindly provided by Goedecke AG (Freiburg, Germany). The rat PKCδ full-length cDNA clone (3000 bp) containing the sequence coding for PKCδ was a gift from Dr. C. Polke (University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany). The vectors pET28δAla505 and pET28δAla504/5 were provided by Dr. D. Bossemeyer and Dr. A. Girod (German Cancer Research Center). The pseudosubstrate-related peptide δ (MNRRGSIKQAKI) was synthesized by Dr. R. Pipkorn (German Cancer Research Center). Other materials were bought from the following companies: PS from Sigma; [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 5000 Ci/mmol) from Hartmann Analytic (Braunschweig, Germany); mouse monoclonal anti-PKCδ antibody P36520 from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany); expression vector pET28 and Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS from AGS GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany); T7-Sequencing kit and Mono-Q from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Pwo DNA polymerase from Boehringer Mannheim; modified trypsin, sequencing grade, from Promega; and nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid resin from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany). As described previously (39Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) a PKCδ full-length cDNA with an NdeI restriction site at the initiation signal ATG and an EcoRI restriction site behind the stop codon TGA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the expression vector pET28. The plasmid was termed pET28δwt. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the “overlap extension” method as described previously (39Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A rat PKCδ full-length clone of 3000 bp served as a template. The following pairs of mutagenic oligonucleotides were used (only the sense oligonucleotides are given, and changed bases are underlined): (E/V)500, 5′-GAAT ATA TTT GGG GTG AAC CGG GCT* AGC ACA TTC-3′; (S/A)643, 5′-GAG AAA CCC CAA CTT GCC TTC AGT GAC AAG AAC C-3′; and (S/A)643(S/A)645, 5′-G AAA CCC CAA CTTGCC TTC GCT GAC AAG AAC CTC-3′ (synthesized by Dr. W. Weinig, German Cancer Research Center). Successful mutation was confirmed by sequencing and, in the case of (E/V)500, in addition by introducing a new NheI restriction site that was created by a silent point mutation (see base with asterix). The mutant cDNAs were cloned into pET28 and were termed pET28δVal500, pET28δAla643, and pET28δAla643/5. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were used for expression of the recombinant PKCδ wt and mutants. Cells were grown under conditions described previously (39Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Washed and sedimented cells were cracked by the method of freezing and thawing and resuspended in ice-cold buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). After sonication with a Branson sonifier and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to an nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid column following the manufacturer's recommendation. Bound proteins, eluted with 50 mm and 100 mm imidazole, were pooled, diluted 1:5 with buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors), and further purified by chromatography on a Mono-Q column. Elution of bound proteins was achieved with NaCl (steps of 100, 200, 300, and 500 mm). The 200 mm NaCl fraction was selected, because it contained PKCδ with the highest specific activity. According to Coomassie Blue staining a 75% purity of PKCδ was estimated. Eluted PKCδ was stabilized by addition of 10% glycerol and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and stored at −70 °C. For the cloning of PKCδ full-length cDNA into the pBac1 baculovirus transfer plasmid (Novagen), a PKCδ cDNA with an EcoRI restriction site at the initiation signal ATG and an XhoI restriction site following the removed stop codon TGA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction as described for the pET28δwt-plasmid (39Stempka L.

The oligonucleotides 5′-GAC GAA TTC ATG GCA CCG TTC-3′ and 5′-GGA CCC TCG AGT TCC AGG AAT TGC-3′ were used as 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The construction and amplification of recombinant baculovirus were performed using the Bac Vector 2000 transfection kit (Novagen) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Sf9 cells were harvested after 65 h of infection with the recombinant baculovirus, and recombinant PKCδ was partially purified as described above for the bacterially expressed enzyme. According to Coomassie Blue staining, 80% purity of PKCδ was estimated. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 5 min as described previously (39Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.J.

The pseudosubstrate-related peptide δ was used as a substrate.32P-labeled phosphoproteins were visualized and quantitated by measuring the intensity of photo-stimulated luminescence using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Bas 1500). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%). PKCδ was detected and quantitated by immunoblotting using the monoclonal anti-PKCδ antibody P36520 as the first antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody. The blots were scanned using a scanner (MacIntosh), and the values were expressed as arbitrary units relative to the background. Autophosphorylation of 10 μg of partially purified PKCδ wild type and mutants was performed as described above, but [γ-32P]ATP was omitted, and the reaction was terminated by precipitation of the proteins with methanol-chloroform (49Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%, 0.75 mm). After staining with Coomassie R250 (Bio-Rad), the PKCδ bands were excised, cut into small pieces (1 × 1 mm), washed, dehydrated (2 × 30 min with H2O, 3 × 15 min with 50% acetonitrile, and 1 × 15 min with acetonitrile), and incubated with 2 μg of trypsin in 50 μl of digest buffer (50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0) at 37 °C for 16 h. The digest was sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subsequently analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry using the thin film preparation technique (50Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 0.3 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetone containing nitrocellulose were deposited onto individual spots on the target. Subsequently, 1 μl of 10% formic acid and 0.5 μl of the digest were loaded on top of the thin film spots and allowed to dry slowly at ambient temperature. The spots were washed with 10% formic acid and deionized water to remove salts. MALDI mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode on a Reflex II time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a SCOUT multiprobe inlet and a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Ion acceleration voltage was set to 25 kV, and the reflector voltage was 26.5 kV. When using delayed extraction the first extraction plate was set to 18.5 kV. Mass spectra were obtained by averaging 20–50 individual laser shots. Calibration of the spectra was performed externally by a two-point linear fit using angiotensin I and oxidized insulin β-chain. Phosphorylation of Thr497 and Thr500 in the activation loop of PKCα (37Cazaubon S. Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and PKCβII (38Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, is known to be required for catalytic competence of the enzymes. Recently, we demonstrated that PKCδ exhibits full enzymatic activity without phosphorylation of the corresponding Thr505 (39Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As previously discussed, a structural difference in the activation loops of the isoenzymes could possibly explain the differential behavior of PKCδ to PKCα and βII. In contrast to PKCα and PKCβII, PKCδ contains a glutamic acid in position 500 (Glu500) that might take over the role of the phosphorylated threonines of PKCα and βII. To test this possibility, we mutated Glu500 to the neutral amino acid valine and determined the enzymatic activity of the bacterially expressed PKCδVal500 mutant. All phosphorylation assays were performed in the presence of PS and TPA. Autophosphorylation of partially purified wild type and PKCδVal500 mutant is shown in Fig.1. Approximately equal amounts of the enzymes were applied to the assay. The values determined by autoradiography were normalized according to the slight difference in the amount of wild type and mutant enzyme (factor, 1.2) that was observed by immunoblotting with an anti-PKCδ antibody and scanning the immunoblots (Fig. 1). Using different preparations of the enzymes in two independent experiments, one of which is shown in Fig. 1, a 76 ± 4% reduction in PKCδVal500autophosphorylation activity, compared with the wild type, was observed. A similar decrease in enzymatic activity after mutation of Glu500 to Val was seen when substrate phosphorylation by wild type and mutant were compared. Phosphorylation of the pseudosubstrate-related peptide δ by PKCδVal500 was reduced by 73 ± 2% compared with that by the wild type (TableI). The low incorporation of phosphate into the peptide by PKCδVal500 was essentially attributable to a slower velocity of the phosphorylation reaction.V max of the PKCδVal500 catalyzed reaction was reduced by 72% compared with V maxof the wild type, whereas the K m values for the peptide substrate did not differ significantly (Table I). TheK m value for ATP, however, was approximately three times higher with PKCδVal500 (116 μm) than with the wild type (42 μm; Fig.2 and Table I). Thus, binding of ATP appeared to be impeded with mutation of Glu500 to Val. For comparative purposes, some kinetic data of the partially purified PKCδAla505 and PKCδAla504/505 mutants are also shown in Table I. The kinase activities of these mutants did not differ from the wild type, as reported previously (39Stempka L. Girod A. Müller H.J. Rincke G. Marks F. Gschwendt M. Bossemeyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6805-6811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Taking the autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation data together, mutation of Glu500 to Val causes an ∼75% reduction in PKCδ kinase activity. These results clearly support the idea that the negatively charged carboxylate of Glu500 in the activation loop is important for the kinase activity of PKCδ and might function in a similar way as the phosphate groups of Thr497 and Thr500 in PKCα and βII, respectively, in correctly aligning residues involved in catalysis by interaction with positively charged residues of the catalytic core. However, the residual activity of PKCδVal500 (∼25%) indicates that, in addition to Glu500, some as yet unknown structural features of PKCδ might be required for its catalytic function. Several kinases are known that contain acidic residues such as Glu, instead of phosphorylated residues, in the activation loop (51Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). Moreover, catalytic competence of PKCβII could be attained by mutation of Thr500 to Glu (38Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No other PKC isoenyzme contains a glutamic acid residue in a position corresponding to position 500 of PKCδ; however, aspartic acid is located in this position in some isoforms (PKCζ, ι/λ, and θ). It is not yet known whether these aspartic acid residues function similarly to the glutamic acid 500 of PKCδ. According to Orr and Newton (38Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aspartic acid may be less suited than glutamic acid for the electrostatic interactions that cause correct alignment of catalytic residues.Table IKinase activities and Km and Vmax values of PKCδ wild type and mutantsKinase activityaAccording to slightly different amounts of PKCδ wild type and mutants in the enzyme preparations (e.g. see immunoblots of Figs. 1 and 8), kinase activities andV max of mutants were normalized in comparison with that of wild type (see text).K m (peptide δ)K m (ATP)V maxaAccording to slightly different amounts of PKCδ wild type and mutants in the enzyme preparations (e.g. see immunoblots of Figs. 1 and 8), kinase activities andV max of mutants were normalized in comparison with that of wild type (see text).%μmμm%wt100542100Ala504/5102 ± 5540104Ala505110 ± 5NDNDNDVal50027 ± 2311628Ala643/5108 ± 13243111Ala643113 ± 12NDNDNDPhosphorylation of the pseudosubstrate-related peptide δ (peptide δ) with partially purified PKCδ wild type (wt) and mutants (0.3 μg each of protein) in the presence of PS and TPA was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ND, not determined.V max of wt (100%), 384 units/mg; kinase activity of wt (100%), 259,700 cpm.

Mutation of Glu500 to Val affected neither the thermal stability of PKCδ nor its inhibition by the specific PKC inhibitors Gö6983 and Gö6976. The kinase activity of the mutant, like wild type PKCδ, remained relatively stable at room temperature for at least 40 min (Fig. 3). Inhibition of mutant and wild type PKCδ was almost identical, either by Gö6983 in the nm range or by Gö6976 in the μm range (Fig. 4). These data indicate that site-directed mutagenesis did not alter the general conformation of the molecule.Figure 4Suppression of the kinase activity of recombinant PKCδ wild type (wt) and PKCδ Val500 (Val500) mutant by the inhibitors Gö6983 (A) and Gö6976 (B).

https://openalex.org/W2044052218,"In search for effectors of the Ras-related GTPase Rap2, we used the yeast two-hybrid method and identified the C-terminal Ras/Rap interaction domain of the Ral exchange factors (RalGEFs) Ral GDP dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), RalGDS-like (RGL), and RalGDS-like factor (Rlf). These proteins, which also interact with activated Ras and Rap1, are effectors of Ras and mediate the activation of Ral in response to the activation of Ras. Here we show that the full-length RalGEFs interact with the GTP-bound form of Rap2 in the two-hybrid system as well as in vitro. When co-transfected in HeLa cells, an activated Rap2 mutant (Rap2Val-12) but not an inactive protein (Rap2Ala-35) co-immunoprecipitates with RalGDS and Rlf; moreover, Rap2-RalGEF complexes can be isolated from the particulate fraction of transfected cells and were localized by confocal microscopy to the resident compartment of Rap2, i.e. the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the overexpression of activated Rap2 neither leads to the activation of the Ral GTPase via RalGEFs nor inhibits Ras-dependent Ral activation in vivo. Several hypotheses that could explain these results, including compartmentalization of proteins involved in signal transduction, are discussed. Our results suggest that in cells, the interaction of Rap2 with RalGEFs might trigger other cellular responses than activation of the Ral GTPase."

In the present study, we investigated whether scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) is responsible for this process. At 30 min after injection, the selective uptake of oxidized cholesterol esters from HDL for liver and adrenal was 2.3- and 2.6-fold higher, respectively, than for native cholesterol esters, whereas other tissues showed no significant difference. The selective uptake of oxidized cholesterol esters from HDL by isolated liver parenchymal cells could be blocked for 75% by oxidized LDL and for 50% by phosphatidylserine liposomes, both of which are known substrates of SR-BI.In vivo uptake of oxidized cholesterol esters from HDL by parenchymal cells decreased by 64 and 81% when rats were treated with estradiol and a high cholesterol diet, respectively, whereas Kupffer cells showed 660 and 475% increases, respectively. These contrasting changes in oxidized cholesterol ester uptake were accompanied by similar contrasting changes in SR-BI expression of parenchymal and Kupffer cells. The rates of SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of oxidized and native cholesterol esters were analyzed in SR-BI-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. SR-BI-mediated selective uptake was 3.4-fold higher for oxidized than for native cholesterol esters (30 min of incubation). It is concluded that in addition to the selective uptake of native cholesterol esters, SR-BI is responsible for the highly efficient selective uptake of oxidized cholesterol esters from HDL and thus forms an essential mediator in the HDL-associated protection system for atherogenic oxidized cholesterol esters.

Schouten D. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). First, reverse cholesterol transport, as originally proposed by Glomset (3Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a widely accepted mechanism of anti-atherogenic action. In this concept, HDL accepts excessive cholesterol from extrahepatic cells for transport to the liver parenchymal cells (3Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Bakkeren H.F. Esbach B. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The direct uptake of native HDL cholesteryl ester (HDL-CE) by liver parenchymal cells is fundamentally different from that of the classical LDL receptor pathway in that HDL-CEs are taken up selectively without simultaneous uptake of the holoparticle (5Pittman R.C.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This so-called selective uptake of HDL-CE in the liver parenchymal cells is efficiently coupled to bile acid formation and secretion (4Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Bakkeren H.F. Esbach B. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A second mechanism for the anti-atherogenic action of HDL is related to its antioxidative properties (7Mackness M.I. Durrington P.N. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 115: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed by which HDL can prevent oxidative damage of LDL. One of the possible mechanisms that have been suggested involves the transfer of reactive oxidized lipids from LDL to HDL and the subsequent efficient transport to the liver for biliary secretion (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Sattler W. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Sattler W. Christison J. Stocker R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The rapid removal of the oxidized lipids may prevent the propagation of an oxidation cascade in LDL. Bowry et al. (10Bowry V.W. Stanley K.K. Stocker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10316-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) showed that HDL is the predominant carrier of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxides (CEOOH) in humans. The first step in LDL oxidation involves hydroperoxide formation, and it is suggested that HDL may accept CEOOH from LDL and that this process is possibly mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (11Christison J.K. Rye K.A. Stocker R. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2017-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a HDL-associated hydroperoxide-reducing activity was found that converted the reactive CEOOH to the less reactive cholesteryl ester hydroxides (CEOH) (9Sattler W. Christison J. Stocker R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous studies (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that oxidized cholesterol esters are taken up extremely efficiently as compared with native cholesterol esters by the liver parenchymal cells and this uptake is coupled to an increased rate of biliary secretion, indicating that the efficient liver uptake indeed might lead to the irreversible removal from serum of the reactive oxidized cholesterol esters in vivo. The hypothesis was put forward that this antioxidant mechanism may use the same selective uptake pathway as that used during normal reverse cholesterol transport but with a much higher efficiency (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Acton et al. (12Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) recently provided the first evidence that scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI), a member of the CD 36 family (13Acton S. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), binds HDL and can also mediate the selective uptake of HDL-CE. SR-BI was found to bind a broad spectrum of ligands, including both modified and native lipoproteins and anionic phospholipids (14Rigotti A. Acton S. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The binding of HDL to SR-BI was shown to be mediated by the major apolipoproteins of HDL, e.g. apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoC-III (15Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed recently that the selective uptake of HDL-CE by isolated rat liver parenchymal cells can be inhibited completely by ligands specific for SR-BI (16Fluiter K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), indicating that the expression of SR-BI can be solely responsible for the selective HDL-CE uptake in this cell type. In vivo, SR-BI is expressed in the steroidogenic organs and liver of rodents (12Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 17Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 18Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which all display selective uptake of HDL-CE. In the steroidogenic tissues, SR-BI expression is coordinately regulated with the steroidogenesis by adrenocorticotropic hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin, and estrogen (17Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 19Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. De Mattos R.B. Temel R.E. Krieger M. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33545-33549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SR-BI expression in adrenals is up-regulated in apoA-I knockout mice, hepatic lipase knockout mice, and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase knockout mice (18Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 20Ng D.S. Francone O.L. Forte T.M. Zhang J. Haghpassand M. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15777-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Unlike the steroidogenic tissues, SR-BI expression in the liver is down-regulated by estrogen treatment of rats (17Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We showed recently that the down-regulation of SR-BI expression in the liver is limited to the parenchymal cells and is correlated with a decrease in the selective HDL-CE uptake (21Fluiter K. van der Westhuijzen D.R. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8434-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, SR-BI expression and the selective HDL-CE uptake is up-regulated in Kupffer cells after 17-α-ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment or a high cholesterol diet, pointing to a different regulatory response in tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells) as compared with parenchymal cells (21Fluiter K. van der Westhuijzen D.R. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8434-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our present goal was to analyze whether SR-BI may mediate the increased hepatic uptake of oxidized cholesterol esters in vitro andin vivo. We investigated the potential role of scavenger receptor BI in the efficient removal of HDL-CEOH by rat liver cells by performing in vitro competition studies with ligands specific for scavenger receptor BI. In vivo, the effect of the regulation of SR-BI in liver cells by EE treatment or a high cholesterol diet on the selective uptake in vivo of oxidized cholesterol esters was studied. Finally, the uptake of both native and oxidized HDL cholesterol esters was determined in SR-BI-transfected CHO cells. These experiments indicate that SR-BI can mediate the highly efficient selective uptake of oxidized cholesterol esters from HDL. [Cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H(N)]-linoleate was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [1α,2α(n)-3H]Cholesteryl linoleate ([3H]CH18:2) and 125I (carrier free) in NaOH were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 2,2′-Azobis-(2,4-dimethyl-valeronitrile) was purchased from Polyscience (Warrington, Florida). 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)(NBD)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3β-yl linoleate and carboxyfluorescein diacetate was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine was obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) the phospholipid, cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase aminophenazone, and glycerolphosphate oxidase-peroxidase aminophenazone kits from Boehringer Mannheim. Ethylmercurithiosalicylate (thimerosal), bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fraction V), and collagenase type I and type IV were from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. [3H]Cholesteryl-linoleate-hydroperoxide ([3H] Ch18:2-OOH) was prepared by peroxidation of (cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H(N))-linoleate with a lipid-soluble peroxyl radical generator 2,2′-azobis-(2,4-dimethyl-valeronitrile). 200 μCi of [3H]Ch18:2 in toluene (final volume, 1 ml) was peroxidized with 2,2′-azobis-(2,4-dimethyl-valeronitrile) (0.4m at 37 °C for 5 h). The incubation mixture was dried under nitrogen and purified by reversed phase HPLC on an LC-18 column as described in Ref. 22Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar. The fraction eluting between 8 and 9 min (corresponding to the retention time of an unlabeled Ch18:2-OOH standard) was collected and dried in a SpeedVac (Savant, Bierbeek, Belgium). The resulting [3H]Ch18:2-OOH was then chemically reduced to the corresponding [3H]Ch18:2-OH by NaBH4 (10 mg) reduction in methanol (1 ml) on ice (1 h) as described by Van Kuijk et al. (23Van Kuijk F.J.G.M. Thomas D.W. Stephens R.J. Dratz E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). [3H]Ch18:2-OH was extracted into hexane and purified in a second HPLC step (LC-18 column, mobile phase acetonitrile/isopropanol/H2O, 22:27:1, v/v) (24Kritharides L. Jessup W. Gifford J. Dean R.T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Fluorescent NBD-cholesteryl linoleate was oxidized with 70%tert-butyl OOH and 100 μmFe(II)SO4 over night at 45 °C. This method yielded a 100% oxidation of the fluorescent cholesterol ester as checked by TLC. Human HDL was isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers by differential ultracentrifugation as described by Redgrave et al. (25Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C.K. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). HDL (1.063<d < 1.21) was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline/1 mm EDTA and labeled with either [3H]Ch18:2 or [3H]Ch18:2-OH by exchange from donor particles as reported previously (1Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). HDL was labeled by incubating HDL with donor particles (mass ratio of HDL protein:particle phospholipid, 8:1) in the presence of human lipoprotein-deficient serum as cholesteryl ester transfer protein source (1:1 v/v) for 8 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath under argon as described (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Fluiter K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the labeled HDL was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline/1 mm EDTA and passed through a heparin-Sepharose affinity column to remove apoE-containing particles (26Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 316-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the labeling procedure, the radiolabeled HDL was checked for hydrolysis of the cholesteryl ester labels by a Bligh and Dyer extraction (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biol. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar) followed by thin layer chromatography. The effect of the labeling procedure on HDL was analyzed by measurement of phospholipid, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and triglyceride content (with the phospholipid, cholesterol oxidase-peroxidase aminophenazone, and glycerolphosphate oxidase-peroxidase aminophenazone kits, respectively). The density, electrophoretic α-mobility, and particle size (photon correlation spectroscopy, System 4700 C, Malvern Instruments) were also analyzed. Labeled HDL was only used when there was no change observed in the measured composition or physical characteristics as compared with the original unlabeled HDL batch. Additionally, to exclude the possibility that endogenous HDL lipids or tracers were oxidized during the labeling procedure, HPLC analyses of lipid extracts obtained from [3H]Ch18:2-labeled HDL were performed. HDL lipids were extracted into methanol/hexane (1:5), and the hexane phase, containing the neutral lipids, was dried and analyzed by HPLC as described (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). HDL was iodinated by the ICl method of McFarlane (28McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) as modified by Bilheimer et al. (29Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Before use, LDL was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline with 10 μm EDTA. Acetylation of LDL was performed by acetic anhydride as described (30Van Berkel T.J.C. Nagelkerke J.F. Harkes L. Kruijt J.K. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). LDL was oxidized by exposure to CuSO4 as described in detail earlier (31Van Berkel T.J.C. De Rijke Y.B. Kruijt J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2282-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unilamelar liposomes were obtained by sonication of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine/cholesterol in a molar ratio of 1:1:1 as described previously (16Fluiter K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Male Wistar WU rats (200–250 g) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg of Nembutal. Body temperature was maintained with a heating lamp. After opening of the abdomen, radiolabeled HDL was injected into the inferior vena cava. At the indicated time point, blood sampling and adrenal and liver excision were performed as described previously (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The hepatic cellular distribution of HDL was studied by using a low temperature cell isolation technique as described (32van Berkel T.J.C. Kruijt J.K. Kempen H.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12203-12207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By means of centrifugal elutriation, the Kupffer cells were purified from the non-parenchymal cell preparation (33Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12221-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of each cell fraction was checked by light microscopy after staining for peroxidase activity. Cellular cholesterol concentrations were measured with a commercial kit as mentioned above after a Bligh and Dyer extraction (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biol. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar) of the cellular lipids. Liver cells were isolated by perfusion of the livers of male Wistar WU rats (200–250 g) with collagenase at 37 °C as described (33Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12221-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By means of centrifugal elutriation, the Kupffer cells were purified from the non-parenchymal cell preparation (33Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12221-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The viability (>95%) of the obtained parenchymal cells was checked by trypan blue exclusion. The cells from the last centrifugation step were resuspended in oxygenated DMEM supplemented with 2% BSA, pH 7.4. Forin vitro competition studies, the liver cells were incubated with the indicated amount of radiolabeled HDL and competitors for 180 min in 1 ml of DMEM containing 2% BSA at 37 °C. The temperature dependence studies were performed at the indicated temperatures for 15 min. All cell incubations were performed in a circulating laboratory shaker (Adolf Kühner AG, Basel, Switzerland) at 150 rpm. Every hour, the incubations were briefly oxygenated. The viability of the cells remained higher than 88% during these long term incubations (33Nagelkerke J.F. Barto K.P. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12221-12227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, the cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 50 × g for parenchymal cells and 500 × g for Kupffer cells in an Eppendorf centrifuge and washed two times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4 at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cell pellet was washed in a similar medium without BSA. The cells were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH, and the protein content and radioactivity were determined. ldlA cells (clone 7), an LDL receptor-deficient CHO line (provided by M. Krieger) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Stable transfectants expressing mouse SR-BI were prepared as described previously using the expression vector pCMV5 (37Webb N.R. Connel P.M. Graf G.A.

Expressing lines were isolated and maintained in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G-418. Binding and uptake assays with transfected CHO cells were carried out following the procedure of Acton et al. (12Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) as described previously (37Webb N.R. Connel P.M. Graf G.A.

Freshly isolated parenchymal cells were incubated on glass coverslips in 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge MA) for 2 h at 4 °C in DMEM supplemented with 2% BSA and the indicated amount of oxidized NBD cholesteryl linoleate-labeled HDL or carboxyfluorescein diacetate. Cells on the coverslips were transferred to a Zeiss IM-35 inverted microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) with a × 63, NA 1.4 planapochromatic objective that was equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal visualization system. The microscope was fitted with a incubation chamber to allow incubation of the cells at 37 °C. The expression levels of SR-BI in membranes of isolated parenchymal and Kupffer cells were measured on Western blot as described (21Fluiter K. van der Westhuijzen D.R. Van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8434-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein was determined according to Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. We showed earlier that the selective uptake of HDL-CE by parenchymal cells could almost be completely inhibited by OxLDL and liposomes containing phosphatidylserine, e.g. known substrates for SR-BI (16Fluiter K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As for native cholesterol esters, the increased selective uptake of HDL-CEOH by the liver is mediated by the parenchymal cells in vivo (2Fluiter K. Vietsch H. Biessen E.A.L. Kostner G.M. van Berkel T.J.C. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To answer the question of whether SR-BI is mediating this increased selective uptake of HDL-CEOH, the inhibitory effects of known SR-BI substrates on HDL-CEOH uptake by isolated parenchymal cells were compared with the inhibitory effects on the selective uptake of HDL-CE and HDL particle association as measured by iodinated HDL. Freshly isolated rat liver parenchymal cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with HDL, either iodinated or labeled with [3H]CE or [3H]CEOH. At this time point, the apparent association as calculated according to Pitmann (5Pittman R.C.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of [3H]CE-labeled HDL (202 ± 14 ng of HDL/mg of cell protein) exceeded 125I-HDL (36 ± 3 ng of HDL/mg of cell protein) association by 5.6 times, whereas the association of [3H]CEOH-HDL (966 ± 150 ng of HDL/mg of cell protein) apparently exceeded 125I-HDL association by 27 times. The ability of (modified) lipoproteins to compete for [125I]HDL and selective HDL-CE and HDL-CEOH uptake was tested by co-incubation with either 100 μg/ml LDL, acetylated LDL, or OxLDL and either neutral liposomes or liposomes containing phosphatidylserine (Fig. 1). Addition of either 100 μg/ml LDL or modified LDL only marginally (<10%) decreased the cell association of [125I]HDL. [3H]CE-HDL and [3H]CEOH-HDL association was also not significantly affected by addition of LDL. However, addition of acetylated LDL led to a 35 and 30% inhibition of [3H]CE-HDL and [3H]CEOH-HDL association, respectively, whereas OxLDL decreased their uptake by 75 ± 2.4 and 75 ± 5.4%, respectively. Liposomes consisting of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine inhibited both HDL-CE and HDL-CEOH uptake by almost 50% (Fig. 1), whereas [125I]HDL association was increased. Neutral liposomes, consisting only of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, did not influence HDL-CE and HDL-CEOH uptake. The possibility of exchange of [3H]CE and [3H]CEOH to the other lipoproteins and liposomes was tested by isolating the lipoproteins after incubation for 3 h at 37 °C. Both gradient density ultracentrifugation and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed. Less than 5% of both [3H]CE and [3H]CEOH was recovered in the LDL, acetylated LDL, OxLDL, or liposomal fraction after incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, establishing that exchange to competitors could not explain the achieved results. Therefore, both OxLDL and the phosphatidylserine liposomes were effective inhibitors of HDL-CEOH uptake by the liver parenchymal cells, and the inhibition of HDL-CEOH uptake was comparable to the inhibition of HDL-CE uptake. The effective inhibition of the selective uptake of oxidized cholesterol esters, like that of native cholesterol esters from HDL, did not correlate with a similar inhibition of the HDL particle association (16Fluiter K. Van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Apparently, the total amount of HDL binding sites in liver exceeds the amount of SR-BI-mediated binding sites, albeit these latter are efficiently coupled to selective uptake. This is in agreement with the limited amount of poly I-insensitive binding sites for OxLDL on parenchymal cells (31Van Berkel T.J.C. De Rijke Y.B. Kruijt J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2282-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as compared the total amount of HDL binding sites (less than 10%). The inhibitory effect of OxLDL on the the selective uptake of HDL-CEOH was further analyzed with respect to efficiency of competition. Increasing concentrations of OxLDL were added to freshly isolated parenchymal cells in the presence of [3H]CEOH-labeled HDL. Already at 20 μg/ml OxLDL, the uptake of HDL-CEOH was inhibited by more than 70% (Fig. 2). Poly I, an established inhibitor of scavenger receptor class A, did not lower the cell association"
https://openalex.org/W2087245406,"RGS proteins (regulators of G protein signaling) are potent accelerators of the intrinsic GTPase activity of G protein α subunits (GAPs), thus controlling the response kinetics of a variety of cell signaling processes. Most RGS domains that have been studied have relatively little GTPase activating specificity especially for G proteins within the Gi subfamily. Retinal RGS9 is unique in its ability to act synergistically with a downstream effector cGMP phosphodiesterase to stimulate the GTPase activity of the α subunit of transducin, Gαt. Here we report another unique property of RGS9: high specificity for Gαt. The core (RGS) domain of RGS9 (RGS9) stimulates Gαt GTPase activity by 10-fold and Gαi1 GTPase activity by only 2-fold at a concentration of 10 μm. Using chimeric Gαt/Gαi1 subunits we demonstrated that the α-helical domain of Gαt imparts this specificity. The functional effects of RGS9 were well correlated with its affinity for activated Gα subunits as measured by a change in fluorescence of a mutant Gαt (Chi6b) selectively labeled at Cys-210.K d values for RGS9 complexes with Gαtand Gαi1 calculated from the direct binding and competition experiments were 185 nm and 2 μm, respectively. The γ subunit of phosphodiesterase increases the GAP activity of RGS9. We demonstrate that this is because of the ability of Pγ to increase the affinity of RGS9 for Gαt. A distinct, nonoverlapping pattern of RGS and Pγ interaction with Gαt suggests a unique mechanism of effector-mediated GAP function of the RGS9.

The α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins function as molecular switches that determine active and inactive states of signaling pathways. The crystal structures of Gαt 1The abbreviations used are:Gαt, G protein α subunit of transducin; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GAP, GTPase-accelerating protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Pγ, γ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase; ROS, rod outer segment(s); LY, Lucifer Yellow; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; GAIP, Gα-interacting protein.1The abbreviations used are:Gαt, G protein α subunit of transducin; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GAP, GTPase-accelerating protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; Pγ, γ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase; ROS, rod outer segment(s); LY, Lucifer Yellow; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; GAIP, Gα-interacting protein. and Gαi1 in their activated, inactive, and transition state forms have revealed the nature of the molecular switches (switches I, II, and III), which are local conformational changes in the regions around the nucleotide binding pocket depending on whether GTP or GDP is bound (1Noel J.P.

G protein α subunits are activated by seven helical membrane receptors that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP by decreasing the affinity of GDP for the α subunit. The lifetime of the active state of an α subunit is defined by the rate of intrinsic GTPase activity that converts GTP to GDP. Therefore, termination of the signal response is dependent on Gα GTPase activity. Purified Gα subunits typically display slow (∼ 4/min) GTP hydrolysis that often cannot account for the deactivation rates of G protein-controlled processes, for example phototransduction (5Arshavsky V.Y. Pugh E.N. Neuron. 1998; 20: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and ion channel regulation (6Kurashi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C821-C830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A large family of regulatory proteins that modulate the inactivation rate of Gα subunits by accelerating their intrinsic GTPase activity has recently been identified (7Berman D.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These proteins, known as regulators of G protein signaling (RGS), are encoded by at least 19 genes and have been identified in mammalian tissues based on homology to the diagnostic RGS core domain of ∼ 120 amino acid residues. It is not yet certain that all RGS proteins are GAPs (GTPase-accelerating proteins) because several very recently identified RGS domains of D-AKAP (9Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11184-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), axin (10Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18643-18650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are less conserved, especially at the positions that correspond to the contact sites of RGS4 with Gαi1 (12Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). However, the RGS domain of p115, which belongs in this less conserved RGS family, has been shown to have GAP activity for Gα12 and Gα13 but not for Gs, Gi, and Gq subfamilies of Gα proteins (13Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), suggesting that these new RGS proteins may have GAP activity toward other G proteins.The crystal structure of the RGS4·Gαi1 complex identified the three conformational switch regions of Gα subunits as the major structural determinants of RGS4 binding to Gαi1(12Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Unlike Ras·GAP, which contributes a catalytic Arg (14Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to the active site of Ras, the core domain of RGS4 does not contribute catalytic residues and is thought to accomplish its GAP function primarily by stabilizing the switch regions of Gα in the transition state. The crystal structure also suggests that RGS proteins may down-regulate the activity of Gα subunits not only by acting as GAPs but also by competing for effector binding to Gα switch regions because these switches are involved in effector binding. Indeed, RGS4 and GAIP can block activation of phospholipase Cβ1 by constitutively active Gαq·GTPγS (15Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made for RGS4, GAIP, and RGSr, which compete with the Gαt effector, the γ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (Pγ), for interaction with Gαt (16Wieland T. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,17Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Most RGS proteins studied to date show relatively little specificity for members of the Gi subfamily of Gα proteins and discriminate minimally among them. Some RGS proteins, for example RGS4 and GAIP, are not selective among several subfamilies of G proteins, being able to act as GAPs toward members of the Gqsubfamily as well. Surprisingly, no RGS proteins accelerating Gs GTPase activity have been identified so far, but Gαs can be converted into a substrate for RGS16 and RGS4 by a single mutation Asp229→Ser (18Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13776-13780Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lack of RGS specificity was studied mainly by in vitro assays using expressed RGS domains; thus, the data do not necessarily exclude higher specificity between particular RGS proteins and G proteins in the cellular environment. Lipid modification and membrane association domains can target RGS proteins to certain cellular compartments (19De Vries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For example, RGS12 contains a PDZ domain, which could specifically target it to certain G protein-coupled receptors (20Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Additionally, the regions flanking the core domain of RGS proteins may possess other structural determinants for specific interaction with Gα subunits. Finally, an effector-mediated modulation of RGS function may provide another selectivity filter.In rod photoreceptor cells transducin GTPase activity is too slow (1–2/min) to account for the physiologically measured light response. The clear functional requirement for transducin inactivation promoted biochemical studies that demonstrated that the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of transducin is enhanced significantly by concentrated suspensions of rod outer segment membranes (21Arshavsky V.Y. Antoch M.P. Lukjanov K.A. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Dratz E.A. Lewis J.W. Schaechter L.E. Parker K.R. Kliger D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further studies have identified that the inhibitory subunit of Pγ, together with a membrane factor, cooperatively stimulate the GTPase rate of transducin (23Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol.

Antonny B. Vuong T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15215-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal 25 amino acids of Pγ possess the GAP determinants (24Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Trp70 located within this region is critical for GAP activity of Pγ (27Slepak V.Z. Artemyev N.O. Zhu Y. Dumke C.L.

A Pγ Trp70 → Ala mutant expressed in transgenic mouse rods caused a decrease in the recovery rate of the flash response (28Tsang S.H. Burns M.E. Calvert P.D. Gouras P. Baylor D.A. Goff S.P. Arshavsky V.Y. Science. 1998; 282: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggesting that the normal deactivation of transducin in vivo, similar to its deactivation in reconstituted membranes, requires its interaction with Pγ. Very recently the membrane factor was identified as RGS9 (29He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of bovine RGS9 revealed a conserved RGS domain located at the COOH terminus of the molecule. The extended NH2 terminus of RGS9 contains approximately a 190-amino acid region that is homologous to the NH2-terminal domain of RGS7 and Egl-10. Within this region there is an approximately 80-residue subdomain homologous to the consensus sequence of the DEP domain of unknown functional significance, found in a number of signaling proteins (30Ponting C.P. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 245-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).RGS9 is expressed predominantly in the retina at levels significantly higher in cones than in rods (31Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). RGS9 is tightly associated with membranes and can be solubilized at high concentrations of detergent. There is no evidence for lipid modification or membrane-spanning regions for RGS9, based on analysis of its primary structure. However, Cowan et al. (31Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have proposed that a strong electrostatic interaction with the membranes might be the dominant force in its membrane localization. Several other RGSs found in the retina have been shown to stimulate the GTPase activity of transducin: RGSr/16 (16Wieland T. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and RET-RGS1 (33Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, unlike other retinal RGS proteins, the GAP activity of RGS9 is substantially (3-fold) accelerated by Pγ (29He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of RGS9 from detergent extracts of rod outer segments (ROS) demonstrated that RGS9 is the predominant source of GAP activity in ROS. All of the immunological and biochemical data (29He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 31Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) indicate that RGS9 is the membrane-associated Gαt GAP that acts cooperatively with Pγ in stimulation of Gαt GTPase (24Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Very recently another important function has been defined for RGS9 in photoreceptor cells. Retinal RGS9 is able to inhibit the activity of guanylyl cyclase, thus controlling the levels of cGMP (35Seno K. Kishigami A. Ihara S. Maeda T. Bondarenko V.A. Nishizawa Y. Usukura J. Yamazaki A. Hayashi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22162-22172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This finding suggests an additional modulatory role of RGS9 downstream of the effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase, as the linker between phosphodiesterase and guanylyl cyclase.In this study we focus on further biochemical characterization of RGS9. First, we have examined the specificity of RGS9 GAP activity using homologous Gαt and Gαi1 as the substrates and found that RGS9 is a more potent GAP for Gαt. An analysis of various Gαt/Gαi1 chimeras for their ability to be substrates for RGS9 has revealed that the GAP-responsive determinants reside within the α-helical domain of Gαt. Kinetic analysis of RGS9 binding to the Gαt·Pγ complex shows a distinct, nonoverlapping pattern of a cooperative interaction of RGS9 and Pγ with Gαt, providing the structural basis for the acceleration of RGS9 GAP activity by Pγ.DISCUSSIONVisual stimuli produce very rapid activation of rod photoreceptors, and the inactivation must be very rapid as well for perception of movement. Early biochemical measurements of the GTPase rate of the rod G protein transducin showed the same slow GTPase rate as other G proteins. Because of the clear functional requirement for rapid turn-off, transducin was the first heterotrimeric G protein whose GTPase activity was shown to be regulated. The intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of transducin is enhanced significantly by concentrated suspensions of ROS membranes, providing the initial evidence for GAPs in the ROS (21Arshavsky V.Y. Antoch M.P. Lukjanov K.A. Philippov P.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Dratz E.A. Lewis J.W. Schaechter L.E. Parker K.R. Kliger D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis showed that the inhibitory subunit (Pγ) of the visual cascade effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase, could accelerate the GTP hydrolysis rate of transducin (23Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that Pγ alone is not the transducin GAP and requires another unknown membrane protein to activate GTP hydrolysis by transducin (24Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Otto-Bruc A. Antonny B. Vuong T.M.

Together Pγ and the membrane factor cooperatively accelerate the GTPase rate of transducin. Very recently this unknown membrane protein was identified to be a member of a large family of RGS proteins, RGS9 (29He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).Retinal RGS9 is a unique GAP in its ability to act synergistically with Pγ. Stimulation of the Gαt GTPase activity by RGS9 is potentiated by Pγ (29He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), unlike other RGS proteins found in the retina RGSr, RET-RGS1, RGS4, GAIP (17Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Does this imply that the effector-mediated mechanism of GTPase stimulation by RGS9 is different from that for other effector-independent RGS proteins highlighted by the crystal structure of the RGS4·Gαia1 complex? To answer this question we first studied the specificity of GTPase activation by retinal RGS9. The majority of mammalian RGS proteins studied to date can stimulate GTP hydrolysis of several members of the Gαi family proteins. However, accurate comparisons of kinetic parameters of a particular RGS protein interaction with different G proteins have been difficult because of a lack of methods to compare binding and functional effects. Comparison of the affinity of RGS for structurally homologous proteins may provide important information on the molecular principles of this interaction.Specificity Determinants of RGS9 Interaction with GαtOur data indicate that the core domain of the RGS9 is a more potent accelerator of the Gαt GTPase than of its close structural homolog Gαi1. The same stimulation effect of RGS9 on Gαt was detected at 10-fold lower concentrations than on Gαi1. The difference in the maximal effect by RGS9 on Gαt (10-fold) and Gαi1 (5-fold) is also evident. The less potent Gαi1 GTPase stimulation by RGS9 compared with Gαt is a result of its decreased affinity for Gαi1. What is the structural basis for such a specificity for RGS9? The crystal structure of the RGS4-Gαi1 complex combined with the data on mutational analysis of Gαs (12Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

These switch regions are highly homologous in Gαi1 and Gαt, and we showed that they are not responsible for the specificity. We found instead that the helical domain determines the specificity of RGS-Gα interaction. We can switch the specificity by switching the helical domains. This region is less homologous between Gαi1 and Gαt.There are several structural differences in the α-helical domain of Gαt and Gαi1 which potentially could participate in contacts with RGS9. One of the local differences is evident in the conformation of residues 108–120 (Gαi1), which correspond to the distal end of helix B and the following loop (4Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 45Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). It is noteworthy that Glu116, the only contact of the helical domain of Gαi1 with RGS4, is located in this region. Glu116 is conserved in Gαi1 and Gαt and interacts with Glu161 and Arg166 of RGS4 which correspond to Lys387 and Ala392 of RGS9. Therefore, the different conformation of Glu116 in the α-helical domain of Gαi1 and Gαt (Fig. 6) may result in abolishing this contact with RGS9 for Gαi1. Alternatively, the slight difference in the packing of the helical and GTPase domains of Gαt and Gαi1 may result in extended orientation of the switch regions and potential RGS9 contact forming residues in the helical domain for Gαi1 compared with Gαt. However, conserved interdomain contacts for Gαi1(Asp150-Lys270 and Arg178-Glu43) and Gαt(Asp146-Lys266 and Arg174-Glu39) most likely assure a similar domain packing in both chimeras.Pγ Accelerates Gαt GTPase Activity Stimulated by RGS9 by Increasing Its Affinity for GαtAmong the many RGS proteins found in the retina only RGS9 can stimulate the GTPase activity of Gαt synergistically with Pγ. Unlike RGS9, other retinal RGSs are either not responsive to (33Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or are inhibited by Pγ (17Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17444-17449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In some cases it was shown that Pγ competes with RGS proteins for binding to Gαt, indicating that Pγ and RGS binding sites on Gαt may overlap (16Wieland T. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,17Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that RGS9 did not significantly change the binding of Pγ to the labeled derivative of Gαt(p value = 0.31, t test), indicating that Pγ and RGS9 binding sites on Gαt do not overlap. The lack of effect of RGS9 on Pγ binding to Gαt also indicates that there is no direct interaction of Pγ with RGS9 in the Gα·Pγ·RGS9 complex. On the other hand, Pγ in complex with Gα increases the binding of RGS9 to the complex approximately 3-fold (p value = 0.035, t test). The increased affinity of RGS9 to the Chi6b·Pγ complex closely corresponds to the stimulatory effect of Pγ on enhancement of Gαt GTPase by RGS9. The two distinct effects of Pγ and RGS9 on the binding of each other to Gα suggest an allosteric effect of Pγ on binding of RGS9 to Gαt.The crystal structure of the Gαi1·RGS4 complex complemented by the mutational analysis suggests a mechanism by which RGS proteins stimulate GTPase reaction by Gα. According to this mechanism RGS binds to the switch regions of Gα and stabilizes the transition state of the GαGTP. Unlike for Ras·GAP, no residues of RGS4 contribute catalytically to the active site of Gα. It is appropriate to assume based on the sequence similarity (35% identity, 58% homology) that the core domain of RGS9 has a similar fold to that of RGS4 and analogous to the Gαi1·RGS4 interface with Gαt. What is the structural basis for the Pγ effect on the RGS GAP activity? It is known that Pγ contacts Gαtat α-helices 3 and 4 as well as α3-β5 and α4-β6 loops and switch II and III regions of the α subunit (36Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23611-23615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two residues from the switch II region (Trp207, Ile208) have been identified to interact directly with Pγ (49Natochin M.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The increased fluorescence of the reporter group attached to Cys210indicates that RGS9 contacts the switch II region as well. Our data indicate, however, that there is no steric conflict in the trimeric Gαt·RGS9·Pγ complex. Earlier we demonstrated that the last 25 COOH-terminal amino acid residues of Pγ are critical for this GTPase activation (24Arshavsky V.Y. Dumke C.L. Zhu Y. Artemyev N.O. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19882-19887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that this region binds to the switch regions of Gαt (36Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Trp70 located within this region plays a critical role in the Pγ activation of the transducin GTPase rate (27Slepak V.Z. Artemyev N.O. Zhu Y. Dumke C.L. Sabacan L. Sondek J. Hamm H.E.

This suggests that the structural basis for enhancement of RGS9 GAP activity by Pγ could be a conformational change in the vicinity of the switch II region induced by the COOH terminus of Pγ which increases the affinity of RGS9 for Gαt.Natochin et al.

However, Pγ does not synergize with RGS16. Thus, a nonoverlapping pattern of RGS and Pγ interaction with Gαt is not sufficient for cooperative stimulation of the transducin GTPase function. We speculate that the determinants of RGS9 specificity located in the α-helical domain of"

The present study demonstrates that CR-1 indirectly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of erb B-4 but not of the epidermal growth factor-related receptors erb B-2 anderb B-3 in different mouse and human mammary epithelial cell lines. In addition, down-regulation of erb B-4 in NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells and in T47D human breast cancer cells, using an anti-erb B-4 blocking antibody or a hammerhead ribozyme vector targeted to erb B-4 mRNA, impairs the ability of CR-1 to fully activate mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, chemical cross-linking of 125I-CR-1 to mouse and human mammary epithelial cell membranes results in the labeling of two specific bands with a molecular weight of 130 and 60 kDa, suggesting that the CR-1 receptor represents a novel receptor structurally unrelated to any of the known type I receptor tyrosine kinases. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that CR-1, upon binding to an unknown receptor, can enhance the tyrosine kinase activity oferb B-4 and that a functional erb B-4 receptor is required for CR-1-induced MAPK activation.

A homologous gene has also been identified in the mouse from an F-9 mouse embryonal carcinoma cDNA expression library (2Dono R. Scalera R. Pacifico F. Acampora D. Persico M.G. Simeone A. Development. 1993; 118: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, additional Cripto-related genes have been identified in Xenopus laevis(FRL1), in mouse embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm cells (Cryptic), and in Zebrafish (One-eyed pinhead) (3Kinoshita N. Minshull J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 83: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Shen M.M. Wang H. Leder P.

Based on the strong sequence similarities, CR-1, FRL1, Cryptic, and One-eyed pinhead represent a new family of growth factor-like molecules named CFC (CR-1, FRL1, and Cryptic) family. These genes share a potential N-terminal leader sequence, a modified EGF-like domain, a second cysteine-rich region, and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain (5Zhang J. Talbot S.W. Schier A.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar,6Dono R. Montuori N. Rocchi M. De Ponti-Zilli L. Ciccodicola A. Persico M.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 555-565PubMed Google Scholar). The modified EGF-like domain found in the CFC family is highly conserved. All EGF-like motifs contain six cysteines, which form three disulfide bonds in the case of EGF and the other related peptides in this family. In CR-1, FRL1, Cryptic, and One-eyed pinhead, the EGF-like domain is quite unusual. In fact, the first two cysteines are adjacent, thereby eliminating the A loop that is normally found between these residues. In addition, the spacing between the third and fourth cysteines is reduced relative to other EGF-like repeats, resulting in a smaller B loop (6Dono R. Montuori N. Rocchi M. De Ponti-Zilli L. Ciccodicola A. Persico M.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 555-565PubMed Google Scholar). Because these three disulfide-linked loops are important in the ability of these proteins to assume a specific secondary structure that is essential for binding to specificerb B type I receptor tyrosine kinases, it has been proposed that the presence of an unusual EGF-like domain in the CFC family may indicate that this subfamily of peptides binds to a unique receptor. In fact, we have previously shown that CR-1 does not bind directly to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/erb B-1) or toerb B-2, erb B-3, or erb B-4 type 1 receptor tyrosine kinases that have been ectopically expressed in Ba/F3 mouse pro-B lymphocytes or in 32-D mouse myeloid cells either alone or in various pairwise combinations (7Kannan S. De Santis M. Lohmeyer M. Riese II D.J. Smith G.H. Hynes N. Seno M. Brandt R. Bianco C. Persico M.G. Kenney N. Normanno N. Martinez-Lacaci I. Ciardiello F. Stern D.F. Gullick W.J. Salomon D.S. J.

CR-1 binds to a high affinity, saturable receptor in HC-11 mouse mammary epithelial cells and in several different human breast cancer cell lines. This receptor is specific for CR-1, because it does not bind other EGF-related peptides, such as EGF, heparin binding EGF-like growth factor, transforming growth factor α, amphiregulin, betacellulin, or heregulin β1 (HRGβ1) (7Kannan S. De Santis M. Lohmeyer M. Riese II D.J. Smith G.H. Hynes N. Seno M. Brandt R. Bianco C. Persico M.G. Kenney N. Normanno N. Martinez-Lacaci I. Ciardiello F. Stern D.F. Gullick W.J. Salomon D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3330-3335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The erb B family is characterized by extensive receptor-receptor interactions leading to an enormous degree of signal diversification through ligand-activated dimerization (8Carraway K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 9van der Geer P. Hunter T. Linderberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). By binding to the extracellular domain of their respective receptors, EGF-related peptides induce receptor homodimerization and the subsequent stimulation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase, which leads to the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the receptor (10Heldin C.-H. Ostman A. Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 33-40Google Scholar). This process generates docking sites for cytoplasmic signaling molecules, such as the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 and the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which link receptor tyrosine kinases to intracellular signal transduction pathways (9van der Geer P. Hunter T. Linderberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Moreover, ligand binding induces not only receptor homodimers but also heterodimers between different erb B receptors. The first evidence for the ability of these receptors to form heterodimers was derived from the observation that erbB-2 undergoes transactivation and phosphorylation by both EGF and neu differentiation factor/heregulins, which do not bind directly to this receptor but bind to either the EGFR or erbB-3 or erb B-4 receptors, respectively (11King C.R.

Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6496-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, erb B-2 appears to be the preferred heterodimerization partner with the other erb B molecules (14Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Another example of heterodimerization is the interaction witherb B-3. Erb B-3 has an impaired tyrosine kinase activity, but it can undergo transactivation and phosphorylation by other erb B members (15Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 8131-8136Crossref Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 16Riese D.J. van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The extensive receptor interactions within the erb B family raise the possibility that although CR-1 does not directly bind to any of the erbB receptors, it may be able to transactivate members of theerb B receptor family by triggering heterodimerization and transphosphorylation through another receptor. In the present study, we demonstrate that CR-1 specifically activates erb B-4 in several mouse and human mammary epithelial cell lines, whereas it does not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of the other threeerb B members. Furthermore, down-regulation oferb B-4 expression in T47D human breast carcinoma cells expressing a specific hammerhead ribozyme targeted to erbB-4 mRNA results in a reduction in the ability of CR-1 to fully activate MAPK. In addition, a specific erb B-4-blocking antibody can also interfere with the capacity of CR-1 to activate MAPK in mouse and human mammary epithelial cell lines. These data suggest that erb B-4, although not a direct receptor for this growth factor, is required for the activation of the signal transduction cascade by CR-1. Finally, chemical cross-linking of125I-CR-1 to several cell lines identifies a novel receptor with properties that are different from the other erb B receptors. In fact, the presence of two specific bands of 60 and 130 kDa suggests the possibility that this receptor has a multicomponent structure that renders the CR-1 receptor unique among the othererb B receptors. NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells, human breast carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-453, T47D, and SKBr-3, the human glioblastoma cell line A172, and NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing erb B-4 (kindly provided by Dr. C. Arteaga, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The T47D cells transfected with the ribozyme vector (Rz6) targeted toerb B-4 mRNA were generated as described previously (17Tang C.K. Goldstein D.J. Payne J. Czubayko F. Alimandi M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Lippman M.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3415-3422PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human CR-1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (18Seno M.

Recombinant human EGF and HRGβ1 were purchased from Collaborative Research and R & D Systems, respectively. Cells were grown until they reached 70–80% confluence and then switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing human transferrin (10 μg/ml) and type IV Pedersen fetuin (1 mg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were treated with EGF, HRGβ1, or CR-1 at 100 ng/ml for various times. To block erb B-4 activation, the cells were pretreated for 30 min with a mouse monoclonal anti-erb B-4 blocking antibody (Neo marker Ab-3) and then stimulated with HRGβ1 or CR-1 for 5 min. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride. Lysates were immunoprecipitated (0.5 mg/sample) with the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (1005, Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal anti-erb B-2 antibody (neu C-18, Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal anti-erb B-3 antibody (C-17, Santa Cruz), or rabbit polyclonal anti-erb B-4 antibody (Neo marker Ab-1). Crude protein lysates (30 μg/sample) or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% dry milk in 20 mmTris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight with one of the following antibodies: 1:1000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories), 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho MAPK antibody (Biolab Laboratories), or a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (1005, Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal anti-erb B-2 (neu C-18, Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal anti-erb B-3 antibody (C-17, Santa Cruz), or rabbit polyclonal anti-erb B4 antibody (C-18, Santa Cruz). The bound rabbit or mouse antibodies were detected using a 1:2000 dilution of either goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image program 1.58. 125I-CR-1 protein was prepared using IODOGEN (Pierce) as described previously (7Kannan S. De Santis M. Lohmeyer M. Riese II D.J. Smith G.H. Hynes N. Seno M. Brandt R. Bianco C. Persico M.G. Kenney N. Normanno N. Martinez-Lacaci I. Ciardiello F. Stern D.F. Gullick W.J. Salomon D.S. J. Biol.

Cell membranes were prepared from NMuMG or MDA-MB-453 cells after lysis in hypotonic buffer containing 20 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After discarding the pellet, 1% Triton X-100 was added, and the membrane fraction was isolated by centrifuging the samples at 100,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. Cell membranes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with 125I-CR-1 (1 × 106 cpm) in the absence or in the presence of an excess of unlabeled CR-1 protein (1 μg). The chemical cross-link reagent bis(sulfosuccinimdyl)suberate (BS3 (Pierce)) was then added (1 mm) for 30 min on ice. Cell membranes were lysed and resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel or 4–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gel. Cross-linked bands were visualized by autoradiography. We have previously shown that CR-1 does not directly activate any of the four known erb B receptor tyrosine kinases that have been ectopically expressed in Ba/F3 pro-B lymphocyte cells or in 32-D mouse myeloid cells, either alone or in various pairwise combinations (7Kannan S. De Santis M. Lohmeyer M. Riese II D.J. Smith G.H. Hynes N. Seno M. Brandt R. Bianco C. Persico M.G. Kenney N. Normanno N. Martinez-Lacaci I. Ciardiello F. Stern D.F. Gullick W.J. Salomon D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3330-3335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These results do not formally exclude the possibility that the CR-1 receptor cannot heterodimerize with or indirectly transactivate one or several of the type I receptor tyrosine kinases. In fact, the generation of heterodimeric receptor complexes represents a model for signal diversification and amplification in response to different EGF-like type I receptor ligands (19Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Seala M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 20Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells express moderate levels of all fourerb B receptors and mitogenically respond to CR-1 with an increase in the phosphorylation of Shc and MAPK (18Seno M. De Santis M. Kannan S. Bianco C. Tada H. Kim N. Kosaka M. Gullick W.J. Yamada H. Salomon D.S. Growth Factors. 1997; 15: 215-229Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of CR-1 on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR,erb B-2, erb B-3, and erb B-4 was examined in NMuMG cells. Treatment of serum-starved NMuMG cells with CR-1 resulted in a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of erb B-4 but not of the EGFR, erb B-2, or erb B-3, as determined by immunoprecipitation with receptor monospecific polyclonal antibodies and Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Fig. 1). A nearly 1.5-fold increase in phosphorylation of erb B-4 was observed within 5 min of stimulation. As an internal control, treatment with EGF was found to stimulate a 3-fold increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, and HRGβ1 induced a 4-fold increase in the phosphorylation oferb B-2, a 0.8-fold increase in the phosphorylation oferb B-3, and a 2-fold increase in the phosphorylation oferb B-4, indicating that the other three erb B receptors are functionally able to respond to ligand stimulation in these cells. Each Western blot was stripped and reprobed with the respective anti-erb B receptor antibodies to ensure that equal amounts of the immunoprecipitates had been loaded (Fig. 1). To exclude the possibility that this phenomenon might be unique to NMuMG cells, several additional cell lines were tested. CR-1 stimulation of erb B-4 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-453. Activation of theerb B-4 receptor was observed at 3 min, with a 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of erb B-4, which remained high even after 10 min of stimulation (Fig.2). HRGβ1 induced a 3-fold increase of the tyrosine phosphorylation of erb B-4. No activation of the other three erb B receptors could be detected. To determine whether functional erb B receptors were expressed in these cells, MDA-MB-453 cells were treated with either EGF or HRGβ1. EGF was found to stimulate a 3-fold increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR (21Yang D. Kuan C.-T. Payne J. Kihara A. Murray A. Wang L.-M. Alimandi M. Pierce J.H. Pastan I. Lippman M.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 993-1004PubMed Google Scholar), and HRGβ1 could enhance a 2.2-folderb B-2 and 3.1-fold erb B-3 increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Western blot analysis with monospecific anti-receptor antibodies showed that equal amounts of protein were loaded in the various experiments (Fig. 2). A 2-fold increase of erb B-4 phosphorylation by CR-1 could also be observed in another human breast cancer cell line, SKBr-3 (Fig.3 A), which expresses very low levels of this receptor (21Yang D. Kuan C.-T. Payne J. Kihara A. Murray A. Wang L.-M. Alimandi M. Pierce J.H. Pastan I. Lippman M.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 993-1004PubMed Google Scholar), and in A172 human glioblastoma cells (Fig. 3 B). The effect of CR-1 on the tyrosine phosphorylation of erb B-4 in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding for erb B-4 (NIH 3T3erb B-4) was then ascertained (22Cohen B.D.

NIH 3T3 parental cells have no detectable erb B-4 expression, whereas the transfected cells express high levels of erb B-4 as determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot using an anti-erb B-4 antibody (Fig.4 A). CR-1 induced a 4-fold increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of erb B-4 in NIH 3T3 erb B-4 cells, as does the natural ligand of this receptor, HRGβ1 (Fig. 4 B). It has previously been demonstrated that CR-1 does not bind directly to erb B-4. Therefore, the CR-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of erbB-4 is mediated by an additional receptor for CR-1 or a tyrosine kinasein trans. We have been unable to demonstrate a physical association between erb B-4 and this receptor. Attempts to chemically cross-link recombinant E. coli-derived125I-CR-1 protein followed by immunoprecipitation with several different anti-erb B-4 antibodies have proven unsuccessful in identifying a specific binding component for this protein.Figure 3Erb B-4 phosphorylation by CR-1 in SKBr-3 human breast cancer cells and in A172 glioblastoma cells.Serum-starved SKBr-3 (A) and A172 (B) cells were treated without or with 100 ng/ml CR-1 or HRGβ1 for 5 min.

CR-1 can function through a receptor that activates intracellular components in the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway (7Kannan S. De Santis M. Lohmeyer M. Riese II D.J. Smith G.H. Hynes N. Seno M. Brandt R.

In fact, treatment of several mouse and human mammary epithelial cell lines with CR-1 can lead to a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p66, p52, and p46 isoforms of Shc, which can then associate with the Grb2-mSOS-signaling complex. CR-1 can then subsequently activate MAPK by rapidly inducing the phosphorylation of p42 and p44 isoforms of MAPK (7Kannan S. De Santis M. Lohmeyer M. Riese II D.J. Smith G.H. Hynes N. Seno M. Brandt R. Bianco C. Persico M.G. Kenney N. Normanno N. Martinez-Lacaci I. Ciardiello F. Stern D.F. Gullick W.J. Salomon D.S. J. Biol.

Becauseerb B-4 is specifically tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to CR-1, we investigated whether MAPK activation by CR-1 requires priorerb B-4 activation. We used two different approaches to inactivate erb B-4. First a monoclonal blocking anti-erb B-4 antibody that is able to block the ability of HRGβ1 to bind to its receptor and that impairs erb B-4 dimerization was tested in NMuMG cells and in T47D human breast carcinoma cells to evaluate its effect on CR-1-stimulated MAPK activity. Pretreatment with the blocking anti-erb B-4 antibody in both cell lines reduced by 50% the phosphorylation of MAPK induced by CR-1 (Fig. 5). As expected, the blocking anti-erb B-4 antibody impairs the ability of HRGβ1 to activate MAPK in NMuMG cells with a 40% reduction of MAPK phosphorylation observed. However, treatment with the blocking anti-erb B-4 antibody does not significantly interfere with the activation of MAPK by HRGβ1 in T47D cells. However, in T47D cells, pretreatment with the blocking anti-erb B-4 antibody was able to reduce by 25% or by 70% erb B-4 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation that was induced by HRGβ1 or CR-1, respectively (Fig. 6). The second strategy was to inactivate erb B-4 by utilizing T47D breast cancer cells that had been transfected with a specific hammerhead ribozyme targeted to erb B-4 mRNA. Expression of this functional erb B-4 ribozyme in T47D breast carcinoma cells leads to a 70% down-regulation of erb B-4 expression as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, a decrease in erb B-4 mRNA levels, and a significant reduction in anchorage-independent colony formation (17Tang C.K. Goldstein D.J. Payne J. Czubayko F. Alimandi M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Lippman M.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3415-3422PubMed Google Scholar). CR-1 is able to activate MAPK in the parental T47D cell line, with 2.4-fold increase of MAPK phosphorylation, whereas HRGβ1 induced a 3.3-fold increase in the phosphorylation of MAPK (Fig. 7). In theerb B-4 ribozyme expressing T47D cells, a 50% reduction in MAPK activation could be detected following CR-1 treatment (Fig. 7). In contrast, there was no reduction of MAPK activation after treatment with HRGβ1 in the T47D cells expressing the specific anti-erb B4 ribozyme.Figure 6Inhibition of erb B-4 phosphorylation by HRGβ1 and CR-1 in the presence of a blocking anti-erb B-4 antibody in T47D cells. Serum-starved T47D cells were stimulated for 5 min with 100 ng/ml HRGβ1 or CR-1 for 5 min or pretreated with a blocking anti-erb B-4 antibody (α erb B-4) (Neo marker AB-3) (5 μg/ml) for 30 min and then stimulated with the growth factors.

Chemical cross-linking of125I-CR-1 to NMuMG and MDA-MB-453 cell membranes with BS3 results in the specific labeling of two bands at 150 and 80 kDa (Fig. 8). These two species do not resemble any of the erb B receptors in size, because the molecular weight of the erb B receptors range from 170 to 185 kDa. In fact, the two bands identified as possible binding components of CR-1 have an expected size of 130 and 60 kDa, after accounting for the size of bound iodinated CR-1 protein. This result demonstrates that, although CR-1 is an EGF-related peptide, the receptor for this growth factor seems to be quite different from the other erb B receptors. Cripto-related proteins including FRL-1 in Xenopus, One-eyed pinhead in Zebrafish, and Cryptic in the mouse possess a modified EGF-like motif. This modified EGF motif is unique and consequently distinguishes these proteins from other classical EGF-like peptide growth factors, because the modified EGF-like motif in the Cripto-related proteins lacks an A loop, possesses a truncated B loop, and has a complete C loop. This suggests that peptides that contain this modified EGF-like domain probably do not directly bind with high affinity to any of the known type I erb B receptor tyrosine kinases, because conserved amino acid residues in the A loop of the N-terminal portion are obligatory for high affinity receptor binding of either HRG, EGF, or transforming growth factor α to eithererb B-3, erb B-4, or the EGFR, respectively (23Brandt R.

This is the case because in mouse Ba/F3 lymphoid cells or in 32-D myeloid cells that are ectopically expressing different members of theerb B tyrosine kinase family either individually or in different pairwise combinations, CR-1 does not directly bind to any homodimers or heterodimers within this family (7Kannan S.

GH priming of cells was required before the induction of terminal differentiation by a combination of epidermal growth factor, tri-iodothyronine, and insulin. Cellular depletion of Janus kinase-2 (JAK-2) using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) prevented GH-stimulated JAK-2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-5 tyrosine phosphorylation and severely attenuated the ability of GH to promote differentiation. Although p42MAPK/p44MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinases were activated during GH priming, treatment of cells with PD 098059, which prevented activation of these kinases, did not block GH priming. However, antisense ODN-mediated depletion of mitogen-activated protein kinases from the cells showed that their expression was necessary for terminal differentiation. Similarly, although p70s6k was activated during GH priming, pretreatment of cells with rapamycin, which prevented the activation of p70s6k, had no effect on GH priming.

The differentiation of adipocyte precursor cells (preadipocytes) into mature adipocytes involves a coordinated program of gene induction and repression, which is under the influence of hormonal, neural, and dietary signals (1MacDougald O.A.

The dual effector theory has been proposed to explain the actions of GH upon differentiation of preadipocyte cells (3Zezulak K.M. Green H. Science. 1986; 233: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). GH is thought to induce a primed state in the preadipocytes (Gp) in which cells acquire increased responsiveness to insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which then promote terminal differentiation. However, the intracellular signaling mechanisms underpinning these actions have not been established. We have been studying the differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes, which is dependent on both GH and insulin, with other factors exerting a modulatory influence (6Guller S. Corin R.E. Mynarick D.C. London B.M. Sonenberg M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recent work from several laboratories has begun to define the signaling pathways induced by GH in various cell types. GH induces activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase JAK-2, an event that is believed to initiate multiple downstream signaling pathways including activation of STAT transcription factors and the MAP kinase and p70s6k cascades (reviewed in Ref. 10Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, the roles played by these signals in biological actions of GH, such as the promotion of preadipocyte differentiation, have not been fully elucidated. Studies in this area have been hampered by the lack of a system allowing the action of GH to be studied in the absence of other extracellular factors. The development of serum-free media capable of supporting adipocyte differentiation has permitted the analysis of specific combinations of agents on the process (6Guller S. Corin R.E. Mynarick D.C. London B.M. Sonenberg M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Schmidt W. Pöll-Jordan G. Löffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15489-15495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a serum-free protocol for the differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells in which the priming effects of GH can be separated from the actions of other factors that subsequently induce terminal differentiation. This system has been used to investigate the importance of JAK-2 and the STAT, MAP kinase, and p70S6kcascades in regulating GH-induced priming of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes.RESULTSPrevious work has shown that differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes can be induced in a serum-free medium (6Guller S. Corin R.E. Mynarick D.C. London B.M. Sonenberg M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Kilgour E. Anderson N.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). GH, insulin, and EGF are essential components of this medium, with other factors exerting modulatory influences. In order to study GH action independently, we developed a two-step protocol (described under “Experimental Procedures”) for differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. Cells were grown to confluence in the presence of serum depleted of GH and then primed for 48 h with or without GH. Cells were then exposed to EGF, T3, and insulin (ETI) to induce terminal differentiation that was quantitatively assessed by measuring the cellular activity of the adipocyte-specific marker GPDH and qualitatively assessed morphologically (Fig.1). These data show that cells must be primed with GH before the induction of terminal differentiation by ETI and that terminal differentiation is GH-independent. Because IGF-1 is known to mediate many of the biological effects of GH (18Froesch E.R. Schmid C. Schwander J. Zapf J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 443-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether IGF-1 alone could prime cells for differentiation. Fig. 1 shows that, although pretreatment of cells with IGF-1 promoted the subsequent terminal differentiation to a degree, the magnitude of this effect was much less than that induced by GH. This indicates that the priming effect of GH is primarily due to direct actions of the hormone.Cellular Depletion of JAK-2 Blocks GH-dependent DifferentiationActivation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase JAK-2 is considered to be essential for GH-dependent signal transduction (19Argetsinger L.S.

To test whether JAK-2 is necessary for GH-induced priming of preadipocytes, we used an antisense ODN to deplete JAK-2 from the cells. Preadipocytes, which had been grown to confluence in GH-depleted medium to ensure that subsequent differentiation took place under GH-dependent conditions, were treated with the JAK-2 antisense ODN before the induction of differentiation. The extent of differentiation was then assessed by measurement of GPDH activity. These experiments revealed that depletion of cellular JAK-2 almost completely blocked the subsequent adipogenic differentiation of the cells assessed by GPDH activity (Fig.2). In contrast, preincubation of cells with the corresponding sense ODN failed to significantly affect the extent of differentiation (Fig. 2). Immunoblotting of JAK-2 immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies after the antisense treatment confirmed an almost complete depletion of GH-activable JAK-2 from the cells (Fig. 2). These experiments indicate that JAK-2 is essential for GH-dependent differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes.Figure 2Effect of JAK-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides on GH-dependent differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells.

The immunoprecipitates were then blotted with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. B, after antisense treatment, cells were incubated in the defined differentiation medium (see “Experimental Procedures”), and GPDH activity was measured after 8 days. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. relative to GPDH activity in control cultures treated with Lipofectin alone (100%) from three independent experiments.

The addition of GH to cells grown to confluence in GH-deficient medium induced a small activation of p42MAPK, as assessed by decreased electrophoretic mobility, that was transient and returned to basal levels after around 30 min (Fig. 3). A similar response was observed for activation of p44MAPK(data not shown). These data confirm that MAP kinases are activated during GH priming under these cell culture conditions. To test whether activation of these kinases is required for GH-dependent priming, we made use of the inhibitor PD 098059, which specifically inhibits the activation of mitogen-activated kinase and extracellular-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), the immediate upstream activator of p42MAPK and p44MAPK (22Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with PD 098059 during the 48-h priming period completely blocked the activation of MAP kinase by GH as assessed electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4). Despite this blockade of MAP kinase activation, PD 098059 failed to inhibit the ability of GH to prime cells (Fig. 4). This was not due to a loss of PD 098059 activity during the 48-h priming period because the inhibitor retained its ability to block the activation of MAP kinase by GH after a 48-h preincubation (Fig. 4).Figure 3Time course for activation of p42MAPK by GH and by EGF/T3/insulin.

However, because previous studies (14Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G.P. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) with another preadipocyte cell line have shown a requirement of MAP kinases for adipogenic differentiation in the presence of serum, we tested whether they played any role in the differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes under serum-free conditions. Using our two-stage differentiation procedure, we first showed that the addition of ETI to primed cells resulted in a strong activation of p42MAPK, indicated by the conversion of essentially all of the cellular p42MAPK to the more slowly migrating hyperphosphorylated form (Fig. 3). Moreover, this activation persisted above basal levels for at least 24 h (Fig. 3). The addition of PD 098059 at concentrations of up to 100 μm failed to block the potent activation of MAP kinase by ETI (data not shown; see Ref.22Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar), thus precluding its use in testing the requirement for MAP kinases solely during terminal differentiation. We therefore made use of an antisense ODN to p42MAPK and p44MAPK to deplete these kinases from the cells. Treatment of cells with 5 μm antisense EAS1 for 48 h caused a dramatic (>90%) depletion of cellular p44MAPK when compared with cells treated with the transfection agent alone (Fig.5). The p42MAPK isoform of MAP kinase exhibited an even greater sensitivity to depletion with antisense EAS1 because levels of the protein were undetectable (Fig. 5) even with long exposures of the immunoblot (data not shown). Incubation of cells with sense or scrambled ODNs did not significantly affect the expression of p42MAPK or p44MAPK (Fig. 5). To test the requirement for p42MAPK and p44MAPK in the differentiation process, cells were transfected with 5 μm antisense EAS1 or control ODNs and then subjected to differentiation using the defined differentiation medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). EAS1 caused a striking reduction in the extent of differentiation, as judged by lipid accumulation (data not shown), and a corresponding 98 ± 0.02% (p < 0.001; n = 3) reduction in GPDH activity (Fig. 5). Incubation with sense or scrambled ODNs did not significantly affect the extent of differentiation (Fig. 5). Therefore, the specific depletion of cellular MAP kinase blocks the transmission of differentiative stimuli in 3T3-F442A cells under serum-free conditions. The combined results of using antisense ODNs and the PD 098059 inhibitor strongly support the conclusion that activation of MAP kinases is not required for GH priming of confluent cells but that MAP kinases are required for the induction of terminal differentiation events by EGF, T3, and insulin.Figure 5Effect of p42MAPK and p44MAPK depletion on terminal differentiation.Confluent cells were treated with antisense EAS1 (5 μm), scrambled oligonucleotides (5 μm), or sense oligonucleotides (5 μm) for 48 h with Lipofectin present for the first 8 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the level of p42MAPK was assessed by Western blotting with specific antisera as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of three experiments. B, cells were grown to confluence and treated with antisense EAS1 or control oligonucleotides. Cells were then transferred to the DDM in the continued presence of oligonucleotides. After 10 days, cells were harvested and processed for the assay of GPDH activity. Activity obtained in cultures differentiated with DDM medium alone was 180 ± 24 units/mg DNA (n = 3), and all values are expressed as a percentage of this activity. Results are the means ± S.E. for three observations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Role of the p70s6k Pathway in DifferentiationWe next examined the requirement of the p70s6k signaling pathway for GH-dependent differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells under our defined serum-free conditions. GH induced an activation of p70s6k, as assessed by reduced electrophoretic mobility, that was sustained for at least 5 h (Fig. 6). To test the requirement for p70s6k activation, we used rapamycin, which blocks activation of p70s6k by all known agents (23Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Rapamycin completely inhibited the activation of p70s6k by GH (Fig. 7) but failed to affect the subsequent terminal differentiation as assessed by GPDH activity (Fig.7), indicating that p70s6k does not mediate the priming action of GH. Control experiments confirmed that rapamycin retained its ability to block p70s6k activation at the end of the 48-h incubation period (Fig. 7). Because an obligatory role for the p70S6k pathway in the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of serum and insulin has been reported (24Yeh W.-C. Bierer B.E. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11086-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), we wished to establish whether it was similarly required for the overall process of differentiation under serum-free conditions. The activation of p70s6k by ETI was strong and was sustained above basal levels for 5–12 h (Fig. 6). The inclusion of rapamycin during terminal differentiation induced by ETI was found to inhibit adipogenic conversion by 58.7 ± 1.1% (p < 0.01;n = 3; Fig. 7). Thus, the p70s6k signaling pathway contributes significantly to the action of ETI during terminal differentiation but is not required for GH to prime cells for differentiation.Figure 6Time course for activation of p70s6k by GH and by EGF/T3/insulin. Cells were treated for the indicated times with 2 nm GH (top panel) or with a combination of EGF (100 ng/ml), T3 (100 pg/ml), and insulin (1.8 μm) (E/T/I, lower panel). Lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with anti-p70s6k antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells treated with EGF, T3, and insulin had undergone priming in the presence of GH for 48 h. The relative positions of the hyperphosphorylated (upper arrow) and hypophosphorylated (lower arrow) forms of p70s6k are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Effect of rapamycin on the priming and terminal differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells. A, confluent cells were treated as follows: no additions, lane 1; GH (2 nm, 20 min), lane 2; rapamycin (20 nm, 20 min) and then GH, lane 3; ETI, lane 4; rapamycin (20 min) and then ETI, lane 5; rapamycin (48 h) and then GH, lane 6. Lysates were then prepared and immunoblotted with anti-p70s6k antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.”B, cells were grown to confluence in the presence of GH-depleted calf serum. The medium was removed, and cells were primed for 2 days in standard serum-free medium containing 2 nm GH. After this, the medium was replaced with medium containing EGF, T3, and insulin. Rapamycin (20 nm) was not added (NO ADDITION) or was added to cells during priming (GH PRIMING) or during terminal differentiation (TERMINAL DIFFN.). GPDH activities are the means ± S.E. for three observations and are expressed relative to activity measured in control (NO ADDITION) cultures (100%). Control GPDH activity was 213 ± 21 units/mg DNA (n = 3). * signifies that the value differs significantly from that for cells differentiated in the absence of rapamycin (NO ADDITION);p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Role of the STAT Pathway in DifferentiationThe above data indicate that the ability of JAK-2 antisense ODNs to block GH-dependent differentiation is not due to the subsequent blocking of the MAP kinase or p70s6k pathways. In addition to activation of these pathways, JAK-2 activation leads to the phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors (see Ref. 10Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with JAK-2 antisense ODNs but not sense or scrambled ODNs almost completely prevented GH-stimulated STAT-5 tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). To investigate whether STAT-5 was required for GH-dependent differentiation, we used an antisense ODN specifically to deplete STAT-5 from cells. Preincubation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes with STAT-5 antisense ODNs caused a complete and specific depletion of cellular STAT-5a protein (Fig.8), whereas the expression of STAT-1 and STAT-3 were unaffected (Fig. 8). These cells also contain STAT-5b, and the antisense treatment also resulted in a complete depletion of this isoform (data not shown). Treatment of cells with the corresponding sense or scrambled ODNs failed to affect the level of STAT-5a (Fig. 8) or STAT-5b (data not shown) protein expression. The requirement of STAT-5 proteins to support GH-dependent differentiation under serum-free conditions was then evaluated. Cells were transfected with 5 μm antisense STAT-5 or control ODNs before the induction of differentiation using the defined differentiation medium. Antisense STAT-5 ODNs caused a dramatic reduction (>99%) in the extent of differentiation, as judged GPDH activity (Fig.8 B). Incubation with sense or scrambled ODNs did not significantly affect the extent of differentiation. These results strongly implicate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in transducing GH-dependent signals during the initiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocyte differentiation.Figure 8Effect of STAT-5 depletion on terminal differentiation. Confluent cells were treated with antisense STAT-5 (10 μm), scrambled oligonucleotides (10 μm), or sense oligonucleotides (10 μm) for 48 h with Lipofectin present for the first 8 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, the levels of STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5a were assessed by Western blotting with specific antisera as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are representative of three experiments. B, cells were grown to confluence in medium depleted of endogenous GH and then treated with antisense STAT-5 or control oligonucleotides. Cells were then transferred to the DDM in the continued presence of oligonucleotides. After 10 days, cells were harvested and processed for the assay of GPDH activity. Activity obtained in cultures differentiated with DDM alone was 192 ± 36 units/mg DNA (n = 3), and all values are expressed as a percentage of this activity. Results are the means ± S.E. for three observations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONAlthough GH is well known to promote the differentiation of preadipocytes, the relevant intracellular signaling pathways involved have not been clearly identified. Because preadipocyte differentiation requires many extracellular factors individually acting at particular stages, it is difficult to dissect the contribution made by individual agents to the overall process. In this study, we have developed a serum-free system for the differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes in which the GH-dependent aspect of the process can be separated from the influence of other hormones. Several studies have indicated that GH acts at an early stage in differentiation by inducing an anti-mitogenic state and sensitizing cells to the actions of factors such as insulin, which then promote terminal differentiation (3Zezulak K.M. Green H. Science. 1986; 233: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 4Morikawa M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 5Doglio A. Dani C.

Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2084-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we show that confluent cells can be primed with GH alone before the addition of other hormones which then induce terminal differentiation. Differentiation required treatment of cells with exogenous GH only if cells had been grown to confluence in medium containing serum depleted of GH. Thus, if cells are grown in normal calf serum, the endogenous GH present is sufficient to sensitize cells at confluence to the action of agents that induce terminal differentiation.A wide body of evidence indicates that activation of the tyrosine kinase JAK-2 is critical and perhaps essential to GH action. Notably, mutant receptors, which do not interact with JAK-2, fail to activate MAP kinases and to induce gene activation (20Sotiropoulos A. Perrot-Applanat M. Dinerstein H. Pallier A.

Ap3A has been proposed as a component of the interferon-induced antiproliferative response in mammalian cells (1Vartanian A. Prudovsky I. Suzuki H. Dal Pra I. Kisselev L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas Ap4A, the intracellular level of which has long been known to be associated with proliferation (2Rapaport E. Zamecnik P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3984-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 3Baxi M.D. Vishwanatha J.K. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Method. 1995; 33: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), may be an antagonist of this pathway. A key factor in this response in humans is the fragile histidine triad (FHIT) protein, an Ap3A hydrolase that is absent or defective in many common cancers (4Barnes L.D. Garrison P.N. Siprashvili Z. Guranowski A. Robinson A.K. Ingram S.W. Croce C.M. Ohta M. Huebner K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11529-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Sozzi G. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Adv. Cancer. Res. 1998; 74: 141-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Precisely how this protein and its substrate, Ap3A, contribute to antiproliferation is not clear, but there is little doubt that the regulation of the intracellular levels of specific diadenosine polyphosphates is of great importance. Eukaryotic Ap3A hydrolases exhibit an approximately 10-fold preference for Ap3A over Ap4A as substrates 2All the enzymes mentioned are active toward other dinucleoside polyphosphates in addition to diadenosine polyphosphates. (6Guranowski A. Sillero A. McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 81-133Google Scholar). They are members of the histidine triad (HIT) family of proteins and possess the catalytic sequence motif HXHXHX in which the central histidine residue forms a covalent enzyme-AMP reaction intermediate (4Barnes L.D. Garrison P.N. Siprashvili Z. Guranowski A. Robinson A.K. Ingram S.W. Croce C.M. Ohta M. Huebner K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11529-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Animals and higher plants also possess an asymmetrically cleaving Ap4A hydrolase that prefers Ap4A but is also active toward higher homologues, such as Ap5A and Ap6A, but inactive toward Ap3A (6Guranowski A. Sillero A. McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 81-133Google Scholar). This enzyme belongs to the MutT motif (or nucleoside diphosphate linked to x (nudix)) family of nucleotide hydrolases (7Thorne N.M.H. Hankin S. Wilkinson M. Nuñez C. Barraclough R. McLennan A.G. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Together, these two enzymes are probably crucial for regulating the Ap3A/Ap4A ratio. Many lower eukaryotes appear unusual in possessing one or more Ap4A phosphorylases in place of Ap4A hydrolase. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two Ap4A phosphorylases, Apa1 and Apa2, in addition to an Ap3A hydrolase (6Guranowski A. Sillero A. McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates.

Like the Ap4A hydrolases, the yeast phosphorylases can also degrade Ap5A but not Ap3A (6Guranowski A. Sillero A. McLennan A.G. Ap4A and Other Dinucleoside Polyphosphates.

The phosphorylases appear to be distantly related to the HIT proteins, having an HXHXQ motif in place of the HXHXH histidine triad (10Kaushal V. Avila D.M. Hardies S.C.

Although S. cerevisiae does not have an Ap4A hydrolase, genes for five potential MutT motif proteins can be discerned in the genomic sequence. Here, we report that one of these, YOR163w (GenBank™ accession no. Z75071) from chromosome XV, encodes an Ap6A hydrolase that is also active against Ap5A and the adenosine 5′-polyphosphates p5A and p4A, but not Ap4A or Ap3A. This is the first time that an enzyme with this substrate specificity has been described. A preliminary report of this work has appeared (13Cartwright J.L. McLennan A.G. Biochem. Soc.

The cosmid clone pUOA1258, which carries the complete YOR163w open reading frame from yeast chromosome XV, was a gift from B. Dujon. The vector pPGY1 was a gift from L. D. Barnes. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (2000 units/mg) and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (200 units/mg) were from Boehringer Mannheim. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. H218O (97.66 atom %) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The YOR163w gene was amplified from the cosmid clone pUOA1258 (GenBankTM accession no.U55021) using the polymerase chain reaction. The 29-mer oligonucleotide primers d(AACACACCATGGGCAAAACCGCGGATAAT) and d(AGGAATGGATCCATATGTTTGCGGTGGCT) were synthesized to provide anNcoI restriction site at the start of the amplified gene and a BamHI site at the end. After amplification withPfu DNA polymerase, the DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and digested with NcoI andBamHI, and the gel-purified restriction fragment was ligated into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen), thus regenerating the ATG initiator in theNcoI site and eliminating the His tag sequence from the vector. The resulting plasmid, pET163W, was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue cells for propagation. The YOR163w gene was amplified as above using the primers d(GTGGGGGAATTCAAAATGGGCAAAACCGC) and d(GAATAGCTCGAGATGTTTGC GGTGGCTTG). These primers provided anEcoRI restriction site at the start of the amplified gene and a XhoI site at the end. After amplification, the recovered DNA was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the gel-purified restriction fragment was ligated into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the yeast centromere vector, pPGY1. The resulting construct, pPGY163W, generated the ATG initiator downstream of GAL1p, a galactose-inducible promoter. The plasmid was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue cells for propagation. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET163W. A single colony was picked from an LB agar plate containing 20 μg/ml ampicillin and inoculated into 10 ml of LB medium containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin. After overnight growth, the cells were transferred to 1 liter of LB medium containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin and grown to anA 600 of 0.9. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.4 mm, and the cells were induced for 4 h. The induced cells (5.1 g) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 50 ml of breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1 m NaCl). The cell suspension was sonicated, and the inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. After washing by resuspension in breakage buffer containing 2.5 m urea, the inclusion bodies were dispersed in 6 ml of 6 m guanidinium-HCl, 10 mmDTT, and the extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatant was applied in 1-ml aliquots to a Bio-Rad Hi-Pore RP-304 reversed phase column (250 × 4.6 mm), and the protein was eluted with a nonlinear gradient from 0.15% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 80% (v/v) CH3CN. Homogeneous YOR163w gene product eluted at 50% (v/v) CH3CN. S cerevisiae strain INVScI was transformed with pPGY163W. A single colony was picked from an SC-Ura (Synthetic Complete medium without uracil) agar plate and inoculated into 100 ml of SC-Ura medium supplemented with 5% glucose. After 36 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 liter of SC-Ura (5% glucose), and further grown for 24 h. The cells (4.27 g) were again recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 liter of SC-Ura (2% galactose, 1% raffinose), and grown for 16 h to fully induce expression of YOR163w. The induced cells (8.1 g) were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 8 ml of breakage buffer (50 mmTris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, and 1 mm benzamidine). An equal volume of 0.5-mm glass beads was added, and the cells were disrupted by shaking at 1600 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Mikro-Dismembrator U (B. Braun Biotech). The homogenate was decanted, and a cytosolic extract was recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Crude extract (13.5 ml) was applied at 0.5 ml/min to a 50 × 15-mm column of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Sigma) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.3m NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. After eluting the unbound protein, a linear gradient of 0–30 mmhistidine in equilibration buffer was applied at 1 ml/min. Fractions (4 ml) were assayed for Ap6A hydrolytic activity, pooled, and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.01 mm CaCl2. The dialysate (20 ml) was applied at 1 ml/min to a 100 × 7.8-mm Bio-Gel HPHT column (Bio-Rad), and the protein eluted with a linear gradient from 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.01 mm CaCl2 to 350 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 0.01 mmCaCl2. Homogeneous YOR163w gene product eluted at 180 mm sodium phosphate. Potential substrates were screened by measuring the Pi released by co-incubation of substrate with YOR163w protein and either inorganic pyrophosphatase or alkaline phosphatase. The standard assay (200 μl) with phosphomonoester substrates was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and contained 50 mm Bis-Tris Propane buffer, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.35 mm substrate, 1 μg (1 milliunit) YOR163w protein and 0.5 μg (100 milliunit) inorganic pyrophosphatase. Assays with phosphodiester substrates contained 1 μg (2 units) alkaline phosphatase instead of the pyrophosphatase. The Pi released in each case was measured colorimetrically (17Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). Chromatographic fractions were screened for activity with 100 μmAp6A using a rapid luminometric assay supplemented with 1 mm DTT (18Prescott M. Milne A.D. Thorne N.M.H. McLennan A.G. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The reaction products were identified by high performance ion-exchange chromatography. Assay mixtures (100 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.16 mm substrate and 1 μg of YOR163w protein were incubated for up to 10 min at 37 °C and applied to a 1-ml Resource-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 2 ml/min in 35 mmNH4HCO3, pH 9.6. The elution system comprised Buffer A (H2O) and Buffer B (0.7 mNH4HCO3, pH 9.6, with a gradient of 5–100% Buffer B over 10 min. Peaks were identified with the aid of standards and quantified by area integration. Kinetic parameters for p5A and p4A were calculated by measuring the initial rate of product formation by high performance liquid chromatography as described above. Because some of the products of Ap6A and Ap5A breakdown are also substrates for the enzyme, parameters for the dinucleotides were calculated from the initial rate of adenosine production upon co-incubation of the substrates with YOR163w protein and alkaline phosphatase. Assays containing 50 mm Bis-Tris Propane buffer, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmDTT, substrate (various concentrations), 0.2 μg (0.2 milliunit) of YOR163w protein, and 0.4 μg (0.8 unit) of alkaline phosphatase were incubated for 5–10 min at 37 °C and then applied at 1 ml/min to a 250 × 4.6-mm Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column in 4 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.1, 8% (v/v) methanol. The adenosine peak was integrated. A reaction mixture containing 100 mmBis-Tris Propane buffer, pH 6.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 6 μg of YOR163w protein was prepared in a final volume of 50 μl. After freezing at −70 °C, 50 μl of ice-cold 2.0 mm Ap6A was added, and the mixture was immediately returned to −70 °C and then lyophilized. The reaction was initiated by reconstitution in 100 μl of H218O, and Ap6A was hydrolyzed completely to yield the major reaction products by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. Products were separated by high performance anion-exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Resource-Q column as described above. Peaks, monitored by their absorbance at 259 nm, were collected manually and lyophilized, and the distribution of the 18O between AMP, ADP, and p4A was determined by positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Masses were also determined for the products of a control assay reconstituted in H216O. Samples for electrospray mass spectrometry were reconstituted in 20 μl of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and injected at 10 μl/min in to a VG-Quattro quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass U.K., Ltd.). Analysis was performed at a source temperature of 60 °C, capillary voltage of 3.1 kV, and cone voltage of 45 V and with the skimmer offset to 5 V. A scan time of 1 s was employed, and the mass ranges of m/z330–365 Da, m/z 420–455 Da, m/z 570–630 Da were scanned for AMP, ADP, and p4A, respectively. Protein extracts were analyzed on a 90 × 50 × 0.75-mm 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was equilibrated immediately after electrophoresis in transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS-NaOH, pH 11.0, 10% (v/v) methanol) for 10 min before electrophoretic transfer of the separated polypeptides to a nitrocellulose membrane at 150 mA and 4 °C for 2 h. The membrane was blocked for 2 h at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% fat-free powdered milk and 0.2% Tween-20 and then probed with a 1:5000 dilution of whole rabbit anti-YOR163w antiserum (raised by standard procedures) followed by a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit second antibody. After washing, the membrane was developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit. Protein concentrations were measured by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method (19Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 91: 95-119Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), using a mixture containing equal weights of bovine serum albumin, conalbumin, cytochromec, and myoglobin as a standard. Open reading frame YOR163w potentially encodes a 188-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 21,575 Da. The intronless gene was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the cosmid clone pUOA1258 using 29-base forward and reverse primers that included NcoI and BamHI sites, respectively, and the polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into the pET-15b expression vector.E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transfected with the recombinant plasmid, and exponentially growing cells were induced for up to 3 h with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell extracts revealed the presence in both the soluble fraction (10–20%) and inclusion bodies (80–90%) of a major band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa, which increased with induction time and so was presumed to be the required product (Fig. 1). Inclusion bodies were then isolated after 4 h of induction and solubilized, and the protein was purified in a single step to homogeneity by reversed phase chromatography (Fig. 2). The N-terminal sequence of the purified recombinant protein was determined to be GKTADNHGPVRS by Edman degradation, and its mass was measured as 21,443 Da by electrospray mass spectrometry. These correspond exactly to the predicted sequence and mass (21,443.6 Da) for the 187-amino acid polypeptide lacking the N-terminal methionine. These data confirm the accuracy of the cloning procedure and the identity of the protein.Figure 2Purification of YOR163w gene product.YOR163w gene product was purified in a single step from solubilized inclusion bodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” - - - - -, acetonitrile gradient.

The enzyme binds tightly to the nickel column even though it was not expressed with a histidine tag. Both procedures yielded enzyme with very similar properties. The data presented here were obtained with the bacterially expressed protein. Almost all MutT motif proteins studied so far are nucleotide pyrophosphatases that hydrolyze compounds containing an NDP linked to another moiety, hence the alternative name of nudix hydrolase (8Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). A wide range of nucleotides was assayed to determine the substrate(s) of the YOR163w protein. Of these, only Ap6A, p5A, Ap5A, and p4A yielded significant activity (Table I). ATP was very slowly degraded to ADP + Pi, whereas no activity was detectable with the following compounds in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions: Ap4A, Ap3A, Ap2A, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, desamino-NAD+, FAD, coenzyme A, (deoxy)nucleoside 5′-triphosphates (GTP, CTP, UTP, ITP, dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and TTP), nucleoside 5′-diphosphates (ADP, GDP, CDP, and UDP), nucleoside 5′-monophosphates (AMP, GMP, CMP, and UMP), nucleotide sugars (ADP-ribose, IDP-ribose, ADP-glucose, GDP-glucose, GDP-mannose, CDP-glucose, UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine), or nucleotide alcohols (CDP-glycerol, CDP-choline, and CDP-ethanolamine). Diguanosine polyphosphates were not tested as substrates. Table I shows the kinetic constants obtained with the active substrates. K mvalues were all within the range 30–70 μm and had apparent catalytic constants (k cat) below 1 s−1. According to the calculated catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K m), Ap6A is an 8-fold better substrate than Ap5A, the overall preference being Ap6A > p5A ≫ p4A > Ap5A. Kinetic parameters for p5A were calculated using subsaturating substrate concentrations only because substrate inhibition by this compound was observed above 50 μm. Given the preference for Ap6A, we propose that this protein should be described as a diadenosine 5′,5‴-P 1,P 6-hexaphosphate hydrolase.Table IProducts and kinetic constantsSubstrateProductsV maxk catK mk cat/K munits mg−1s−1μm103m−1 s−1Ap6Ap4A + ADP (76%)1.00.4566.4p5A + AMP (24%)Ap5Ap4A + AMP (96%)0.170.06700.9ATP + ADP (4%)p5Ap4A + Pi0.50.2345.2p4AATP + Pi0.20.07501.4Products were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinetic parameters were determined by hyperbolic regression analysis from duplicate determinations of enzyme activity over the substrate concentration range 5–90 μm.

One unit hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min. With 160 μmAp6A as substrate, the enzyme displayed optimal activity at pH 6.9, 50 °C, and 4–10 mm Mg2+. Mn2+ at 200 μm also sustained optimal activity, but Ca2+ inhibited with an IC50 of 3.3 mm. F− was also inhibitory (noncompetitive), with a K i of 80 μm. In this respect, the yeast Ap6A hydrolase is similar to but less sensitive than the plant and animal Ap4A hydrolases, which have K i values for F− in the ranges 2–3 and 20–30 μm, respectively (20Guranowski A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The enzyme had an absolute requirement for a reducing agent, such as DTT (optimal at 1 mm). The reaction products generated from each of the four active substrates were determined after various incubation times by ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography (Table Iand Fig. 3). From the kinetics of product formation, the following overall conclusions were drawn. Ap6A yielded mainly p4A + ADP (76%) but also p5A + AMP (24%). AMP must be a primary breakdown product because ADP is resistant to further hydrolysis, hence the enzyme displays two alternative modes of attack on the Ap6A substrate. p5A, either alone or as a product of Ap6A breakdown, generated almost exclusively p4A + Pi. The example high performance liquid chromatography profile in Fig. 3 shows only a small amount of p5A; however, assays using shorter incubation times clearly showed the generation of equimolar amounts of p5A and AMP before the p5A itself is degraded to p4A + Pi. ATP was also observed, most likely due to the breakdown of the primary p4A product (see below). Similarly, Ap5A yielded predominantly p4A + AMP (96%), but with a small amount of ATP + ADP (4%), whereas p4A broke down to ATP + Pi. The preferential generation of p4A from both Ap6A and Ap5A suggests a reaction mechanism similar to the plant and animal Ap4A hydrolases, which always generate ATP from ApnA substrates (n ≥ 4). A binding pocket on these enzymes accommodates a pppA moiety, with the fourth phosphorus distal to the A being subject to nucleophilic attack by water (21McLennan A.G. Taylor G.E. Prescott M. Blackburn G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Guranowski A. Brown P. Ashton P.A. Blackburn G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By analogy, the yeast Ap6A hydrolase appears to preferentially accommodate a ppppA moiety in the substrate binding site. Regarding the generation of alternative products, this could occur in one of three ways. Using Ap6A as an example, these are (i) exclusive attack of the nucleophile (presumed to be water) on Pβ, with elimination of the Pβ—O(Pγ) bond, yielding p4A + ADP, and elimination of the Pβ—O(Pα) bond, yielding p5A + AMP; (ii) attack on Pγ and elimination of the Pγ—O(Pβ) bond, yielding p4A + ADP, and attack on Pβ and elimination of the Pβ—O(Pα) bond, yielding p5A + AMP; (iii) attack on Pβ and elimination of the Pβ—O(Pγ) bond, yielding p4A + ADP, and attack on Pα and elimination of the Pα—O(Pβ) bond, yielding p5A + AMP. These possibilities can be distinguished by carrying out the reaction in the presence of H218O and following the fate of the18O by mass spectrometry (23McLennan A.G. Evershed R. Prescott M. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1989; 18: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). When Ap6A was hydrolyzed in the presence of H216O, the AMP and ADP products had masses of 348 and 428 Da, respectively (Fig.5, A and C), whereas hydrolysis in the presence of H218O resulted in fully 18O-labeled AMP and ADP, with masses of 350 and 430 Da, respectively (Fig. 5, B and D). In both cases, the p4A product was unlabeled, with a mass of 588 Da (Fig. 5, E and F), whereas rapid degradation of the p5A prevented an assessment of its labeling pattern. Because only mechanism iii leads to labeling of both AMP and ADP and lack of labeling of p4A (Fig. 4), this must be the normal mode of attack and is, therefore, identical to that previously established for the Artemia and lupin Ap4A hydrolases (22Guranowski A.

DNase I footprinting with Neuro2A cell nuclear extract identified protected PNMT promoter regions spanning the –168/–165 and –48/–45 base pair Sp1/Egr-1 binding sites. Gel mobility shift assays and transient transfection assays using site-directed mutant PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs indicated that the elevated basal luciferase activity in the Neuro2A cells was mediated by Sp-1. Furthermore, activation of the PNMT promoter by Sp1 depends on both its binding affinity for its cognate target sequences and its intracellular concentrations. When Sp1 levels were increased through an expression plasmid, luciferase reporter gene expression rose well beyond basal wild-type levels, even with either Sp1 binding element mutated. Finally, another transcription factor expressed in the Neuro2A cells competes with Sp1 by interacting with DNA sequences 3′ to the –48 base pair Sp1 site to prevent Sp1 binding and induction of the PNMT promoter. The DNA consensus sequence, Southwestern analysis, and gel mobility shift assays with antibodies identify MAZ as the competitive factor.

We have previously demonstrated for the rat PNMT gene that one stimulatory transcriptional regulator is the factor Sp1 for which two binding elements exist within the proximal –863 bp of 5′ upstream PNMT promoter/regulatory sequence at –48 and –168 bp relative to the site of transcription initiation, +1 (7Ebert S.N.

Binding elements for the immediate early gene transcription factor Egr-1 overlap 6 bp of the 3′ end of each of these Sp1 sites. Although both sites can function as Sp1 or Egr-1 activation sites, it appears thatin vivo, the distal overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 binding element (–168 bp) may preferentially serve as a site for Egr-1 induction, whereas the proximal binding element (–48 bp) likely functions as an Sp1 site. This motif of overlapping or closely adjacent Sp1 and Egr-1 binding elements seems to be common among genes that possess these regulatory sites (9Ackerman S.L. Minden A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C.

The present studies further examine the role of Sp-1 in the regulation of PNMT gene expression. We demonstrate that the high basal activity of the PNMT promoter in the neuroblastoma-derived Neuro2A cell line is due to Sp1 acting through its –48 and –168 bp binding elements. In the case of the –48 bp Sp1 binding element, another transcription factor can bind to a recognition site 3′ to this Sp1 site, thereby preventing Sp1 binding and activation of the PNMT promoter through this proximal element. Consensus sequence match, Southwestern analysis, and gel mobility shifts assays with antibodies indicate that this factor is the transcription protein MAZ (13Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7452-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that Sp1 may be an important regulator of tissue-specific PNMT gene expression and that the exclusionary competition between Sp1 and MAZ may provide additional tissue-specific control.

Two additional 21-bp oligonucleotides were synthesized to use as mutant probes for the distal and proximal Sp1 sites at –168 and –48 bp, respectively: 1) mut168 (5′-CCTCaaCGCCCCCGCGCGTCC-3′; mutated –168 bp Sp1 binding element), and 2) mut48 (5′-GTCTaaGCGGGGGGGAGGGGA-3′; mutated –48 bp Sp1 binding element).

For transient cotransfection assays, cells were plated in 24-well culture dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 7% CO2-93% air overnight, and transfection was performed using SuperFect according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Each transfection assay included 1.0 μg of wild-type or mutant PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, 0–1.5 μg of expression construct, and 0.3 μg of pRSV-LacZ. Following transfection, the cells were exchanged to culture medium and maintained for 36 h at 37 °C and 7% CO2-93% air. Cells were processed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase as described below Following two phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) washes, cells were lysed in 120 μl of lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured as previously using the luciferase assay system (7Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified luciferase was used to define the linear range of the assay, and luciferase activity was then determined in 20 μl of appropriately diluted cell lysate. Protein was measured by the Bradford method (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was expressed as pg of product/μg of protein. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (7Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and luciferase activity was then corrected for transfection efficiency and expressed relative to control values as follows (7Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity expressed from the plasmid vector pGL3Basic was first subtracted from the luciferase activity generated from each of the PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs. Then, luciferase activity was expressed relative to β-galactosidase expressed from the pRSV-LacZ control. To correct for variable transfection within the same cell line, β-galactosidase activity from the pRSV-LacZ construct used for cotransfection with the full-length pGL3RP863 was set as unity and β-galactosidase activity in the cotransfections with the other constructs expressed relative to it. The ratios so generated were then used to correct each luciferase:β-galactosidase ratio so that β-galactosidase activity in each transfection was effectively identical. In a similar fashion, luciferase activity was normalized across cell lines. In this case, β-galactosidase activity from the pRSV-LacZ construct for the cotransfection using the full-length pGL3RP863 in the RS1 cell line was used as unity. Luciferase activity was then expressed relative to luciferase activity for the pGL3RP863 construct in RS1 cells set to unity. At least six replicates were included for each sample group, and experiments were repeated at least twice. Two single-stranded 21-mer mutagenic primers corresponding to the mut168 and mut48 sequences identified above were used for site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the distal and proximal Sp1 sites, respectively. First, mutagenic megaprimers were generated for each mutant sequence by PCR using the 21-bp mutagenic primers paired with GLprimer2, a primer binding to the extreme 22 bp of 5′ coding region of the firefly luciferase gene contained within the pGL3Basic vector (Promega), pGL3RP863 as template, and VentR® DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) to amplify the DNA (30 cycles, 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min). Then, a second PCR (10 cycles) was performed to extend each megaprimer using pGL3RP392 as template, followed by 20 cycles of PCR using RVprimer3 and the GLprimer2 once again to produce 392-bp oligonucleotides with either the –48 or –168 bp Sp1 mutated. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and agarose was removed using a QIAXII Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc.). The PCR products were then subcloned into the pGL3Basic plasmid to generate pGL3RP392mut168 and pGL3RP392mut48. The double mutant construct pGL3RP392 mut168/48 was generated identically by using the mut48 primer and pGL3RP392mut168 as a template. Following selection and screening, the mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.78-13.104Google Scholar). Cells were propagated as described above using 100-mm culture dishes and nuclear extracts prepared according to the procedure of Andrews and Faller (15Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the cells reached a density of 5 × 105–1 × 107 per dish, they were collected into 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and washed once with cold PBS. The cells were then lysed in 400 μl of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 10 min. Following collection of the nuclei by centrifugation for 10 s at 17,000 × g and 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, nuclear extract was prepared by hypotonic lysis. The nuclei were resuspended in 20–100 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and maintained on ice for 20 min, followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 17,000 × g and 4 °C. Extracts were separated from pelleted debris and stored at −70 °C until use for footprinting or mobility shift assays. To generate the DNA probes for footprinting analysis, two oligomers, 5′-AAAGGGCGCCCTCCACATCTC-3′ (nucleotides –204 to –184) and 5′-TCCTGTTGAGGCCGCCTATCT-3′ (nucleotides +18 to –3) were uniquely labeled at their 5′ terminus using [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc), and PCR was performed as described for site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting PNMT promoter fragments (222 bp) were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and Qiagen gel extraction as described above. Approximately 7.5 × 104 dpm of each DNA probe was incubated with 70 μg of nuclear extract from Neuro2A or COS1 cells in 30 μl of binding buffer consisting of 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, 50 mmKCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol and containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) for 30 min on ice. After 10 min at room temperature, DNase I footprinting was performed. The optimal RQ1 DNase I (Promega) concentration (0.3 units/reaction) was determined empirically in preliminary experiments. DNase I cleavage patterns were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% sequencing gel), mapping protected sequences by comparison of the autoradiographic banding patterns to sequencing ladders run in adjacent lanes on the gel (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.78-13.104Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays were performed using 1 ng of the probes described above, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (3 nm, specific activity = 2.5 × 108dpm/μg) and 3 μg of nuclear extract in 20 μl of binding buffer (see DNase I footprinting) containing 0.5 μg poly (dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC). To identify the transcription factors constituting the protein-DNA binding complexes, anti-Egr-1 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Sp1 (PEP2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-MAZ (Dr. Kenneth Marcu, State University of New York, Stonybrook, NY) antibody was included in the binding reactions. Purified human Sp-1 protein was used as a control (Promega). Protein-DNA complex formation and antibody supershifts were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide gels by autoradiography. Twenty μg of Neuro2A cell nuclear protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) as described previously (17Duncan D.D. Stupakoff A. Hedrick S.M. Marcu K.B. Siu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3179-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), along with human Sp1 as a control. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and renatured by incubation in binding buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 45 min. After prehybridization with binding buffer containing 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × 106 cpm/ml of [32P]WTB probe at 4 °C overnight, the filter was rinsed and washed twice for 15 min with binding buffer. Protein-DNA complexes were then visualized by autoradiography, and the relative molecular weight of the complexing proteins determined using the prestained protein standards. Specifically, the lnM r for each protein standard was plotted as a function of electrophoretic migration. Regression analysis was used to generate a linear equation from which the M r of the unknown proteins could be determined by interpolation. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. with an n ≥ 6 for each experimental group. The statistical significance of the difference between two groups was determined using Student's t test. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To examine the dependence of PNMT promoter activity on potential cell-specific transcription factors, three nested deletion PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs, pGL3RP863, pGL3RP444, and pGL3RP392, containing 863, 444, and 392 bp of PNMT 5′ upstream promoter sequence, respectively, were cotransfected into PC12, RS1, Neuro2A, 3T3 or COS1 cells along with the β-galactosidase control construct pRSV-LacZ, and relative luciferase activity was determined (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Aprovides a schematic representation for each PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, identifying the KpnI andNheI restriction sites used to generate the deletion constructs. Because transfection efficiency may vary between transfections and with different constructs, luciferase activity was corrected for variable expression of both the control pRSV-LacZ construct and PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” When transfection efficiency for each construct was normalized within a given cell line (Fig. 1 B), the highest basal luciferase activity was observed in the Neuro2A cells with 10–100-fold lower expression (p ≤ 10−3) of luciferase from the nested deletion constructs transfected into the COS1, RS1, 3T3, and PC12 cells. Transfection efficiency may also vary between different cell lines. Two control constructs, pRSVLacZ and pRSVLUC (data not shown), showed that the COS1 and Neuro2A cells had the highest transfection efficiency, i.e. expressed higher β-galactosidase or luciferase activity, with lower transfection efficiency in the 3T3 cells, and the lowest transfection efficiency in PC12 and RS1 cells. When PNMT promoter driven luciferase reporter gene activity was corrected to account for these inter-cell line differences (Fig.1 C), the Neuro2A cells still showed the highest levels of luciferase expression, although luciferase levels expressed from the constructs in the PC12 and RS1 cells approached that in the Neuro2A cells. However, luciferase activity generated from the same PNMT promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs in the 3T3 and COS1 cells remained markedly lower and barely detectable. Thus, PNMT promoter activity appears highest in cell lines derived from tissues likely to express PNMT. In addition, in the Neuro2A cells, the construct pGL3RP444 showed the highest basal luciferase expression. By comparison, luciferase activity expressed from the pGL3RP863 and pGL3RP392 plasmid constructs in the Neuro2A cells was approximately 20 and 50% lower, respectively. Together these results suggest that basal PNMT promoter activity varies depending on the host cell line as well as the extent of PNMT promoter sequences included in the reporter gene constructs. This specificity is likely due to the fact that the tissues from which these cell lines were derived express different transcriptional proteins, some of which may be important for PNMT promoter activity and, hence, PNMT gene expression. As PNMT promoter activity was greatest in the Neuro2A cells and low in the COS1 cells, DNaseI footprinting was performed using uniquely labeled [32P]DNA probes spanning nucleotides +18 → –204 bp and nuclear extracts from these cell lines to identify proximal DNA sequences to which transcription factors specific to the Neuro2A cells bind to stimulate the PNMT promoter. As shown in Fig. 2 B, (lane 2), protected sequences using the Neuro2A cell nuclear extract included the nucleotide sequences from –32 to –55 bp, –97 to –110 bp, and –156 to –200 bp. On the complementary DNA strand (lane 5), corresponding footprints were observed spanning nucleotides –55 to –31 bp, –111 to –95 bp, and –195 to –161. In contrast, only sequences spanning nucleotides –32 to –55 bp (–55 to –31 bp on the complementary strand) showed a definite footprint with the COS1 cell extracts (lanes 3 and 6). The footprinted regions coincided with previously identified binding elements for several transcription factors shown to activate PNMT gene expression, including Sp1 (–168 bp)/Egr-1 (–165 bp), AP-2 (–103 bp), and Sp1 (–48 bp)/Egr-1 (–45 bp). The putative AP-2 site at –103 bp shows low identity to the AP-2 consensus sequence and low affinity for AP-2 protein. In addition, gel mobility shift assays using an oligonucleotide spanning this region and nuclear extracts from the Neuro2A and COS1 cells showed no protein-DNA complex formation (data not shown). Therefore, attention was focused on the proximal and distal overlapping Sp1 and Egr-1 consensus sites. To determine whether Sp1 or Egr-1 was expressed in the Neuro2A cells and responsible for the high basal levels of PNMT promoter activity in these cells, gel mobility shift assays were performed in the presence of specific antibodies.32P-labeled 21-bp oligonucleotide probes for both the –168/–165 and –48/–45 bp Sp1/Egr-1 sites (WTA, 5′-CCTCCCCGCCCCCGCGCGTCC-3′; WTB, 5′-GTCTGGGCGGGGGGGAGGGGA-3′, respectively, Fig. 3 A) were combined with Neuro2A or COS1 cell nuclear extract in the presence or absence of an anti-Egr-1 antibody (C-19) or an anti-Sp1 antibody (PEP2). As shown in Fig. 3 B, the WTA probe, spanning the distal Sp1/Egr-1 site, produced several protein-DNA complexes with the nuclear extract from the Neuro2A cells (lanes 1 and2). The major protein-DNA complex was supershifted by anti-Sp1 antibody (lane 4), whereas no supershifted complexes (Ref. 7Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were observed with anti-Egr-1 antibody (lane 3). Several protein-DNA complexes were also observed using the duplex oligonucleotide probe WTB spanning the proximal Sp1/Egr-1 binding element and Neuro2A cell nuclear extract (Fig. 3 B) or the WTA oligonucleotide probe and COS1 cell nuclear extract (Fig. 3 C). However, neither the anti-Egr-1 nor anti-Sp1 antibody supershifted any of these complexes (Fig. 3,B and C, lanes 3 and 4). Finally, no protein-DNA complexes were observed when the WTB oligonucleotide probe was combined with nuclear extract from the COS1 cells (data not shown). Thus, it would appear that the transcription factor Sp1 is one factor expressed by the Neuro2A cells that may be responsible for the higher basal activity of the PNMT promoter observed in these cells. However, binding of Sp1 was only evident at –168 bp Sp1 site and not at the –48 bp Sp1 site. The proximal –48 bp Sp1 binding element has been reported to be the higher affinity Sp1 site, and evidence suggests that it may be the biologically functional Sp1 site (8Ebert S. Wong D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17299-17305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was therefore puzzling why the WTB probe spanning this Sp1 site did not form an Sp1-DNA complex with the Neuro2A cell nuclear extract. The possibility that another transcription factor expressed in the Neuro2A cells might be binding to the WTB oligonucleotide probe, thus preventing Sp1 binding, was examined. Gel mobility shift assays were performed with both the oligonucleotides WTA and WTB (Fig. 4 A) and Neuro2A cell nuclear extract or purified Sp1 protein. In addition, an oligonucleotide, mut45 (Fig. 4 A), with point mutations in the DNA sequences 3′ to the proximal –48 bp Sp1 consensus site (GCGGGGaaa, within the Egr-1 site), leaving the Sp1 element intact, was also examined in the gel mobility shift assays. As shown in Fig.4 B, the WTA oligonucleotide probe again formed several protein-DNA complexes with the Neuro2A cell nuclear extract (lane 3). The major complex showed the same electrophoretic mobility as the protein-DNA complex formed with pure Sp1 protein (lane 2) and, as described above, was supershifted by anti-Sp1 antibody. The WTB oligonucleotide again formed several protein-DNA complexes with the Neuro2A cell nuclear extract as well (lane 6). The major and slowest migrating complex was not identical to the Sp1 complexes formed with the Neuro2A cell nuclear extract (Fig. 4 B, lane 3) or Sp1 protein (lane 2) because it had a faster electrophoretic mobility and was not supershifted by either anti-Sp1 or anti-Egr-1 antibody as described above. However, Sp1 protein could form a protein-DNA complex with the WTB probe that did migrate identically. Moreover, the mut45 probe also formed a protein-DNA complex with both Sp1 protein (lane 8) and the Neuro2A cell nuclear extract (lane 9) with identical electrophoretic mobilities to the Sp1-DNA complexes seen with the WTA oligonucleotide. A second, less intense protein-DNA binding complex with slower electrophoretic mobility was also observed with both pure Sp1 protein and Neuro2A cell nuclear extract. The Neuro2A cells therefore appear to contain a transcriptional protein, other than Egr-1, that binds to DNA sequences overlapping the –45 bp Egr-1 site and thereby precludes Sp1 from binding to its consensus element at –48 bp. To confirm that the protein-DNA complex formed with Neuro2A cell nuclear extrac"

It has been suggested that alternative mechanisms, such as disruption of transcription, may also be involved in the suppression of BRCA1 gene expression/function in breast cancers. Therefore, we initiated studies on the BRCA1 transcriptional promoter. Utilizing systematic promoter deletions and transient transfection assays, a 36-base pair region was determined to be important for the positive regulation ofBRCA1 transcription. Deletion of this positive regulatory region resulted in a significant loss of promoter activity. Utilizing DNA binding assays, proteins with specific affinities for the positive regulatory region were detected. Disruption of the DNA-protein complexes could affect normal BRCA1 transcription and may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in American women, accounting for more than 50,000 deaths each year. Current estimates place the average American woman's lifetime risk of developing breast cancer at approximately 11%. However, women with two or more first degree relatives with breast cancer have an estimated 13-fold increased risk over the general population (1Sattin R.W. Rubin G.L. Webster L.A. Huezo C.M. Wingo P.A. Ory H.W. Layde P.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1985; 253: 1908-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Breast cancer in such families has an inheritance pattern consistent with a highly penetrant autosomal dominant allele (2Newman B. Austin M.A. Lee M. King M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3044-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 3Claus E.B. Risch N. Thompson W.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 232-242PubMed Google Scholar). BRCA1, the first breast cancer susceptibility gene to be identified (4Hall J.M. Lee M.K. Newman B. Morrow J.E. Anderson L.A. Huey B. King M.C. Science. 1990; 250: 1684-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar), was isolated in 1994 (5Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck E.D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. et al.Science. 1994; 266: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (5330) Google Scholar). An interesting fact regarding BRCA1 is that although the mutations in the gene in familial breast cancers are of high penetrance, very few mutations in the BRCA1 gene have been found in sporadic forms of the cancer. These findings are prompting researchers to study the possibility of disruption of BRCA1function through epigenetic mechanisms. Consistent with this notion, it has been suggested that transcriptional dysregulation ofBRCA1 may play a role in suppressing BRCA1expression in breast cells, perhaps contributing to the development of a neoplastic phenotype. Two studies have demonstrated a decrease ofBRCA1 expression in sporadic breast cancer (6Thompson M.E. Jensen R.A. Obermiller P.S. Page D.L. Holt J.T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 7Sourvinos G. Spandidos D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Another set of studies describe CpG methylation of BRCA1transcriptional promoter in a number of sporadic breast cancers, in contrast to the lack of methylation in normal breast tissues samples (8Dobrovic A. Simpfendorfer D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3347-3350PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mancini D.N. Rodenhiser D.I. Ainsworth P.J. O'Malley F.P. Singh S.M. Xing W. Archer T.T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1161-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, we initiated a study to characterize the BRCA1 transcriptional promoter. Previously, the structural features of the BRCA1 promoter were described (10Brown M.A. Nicolai H. Xu C.-F. Griffiths B.L. Jones K. Solomon E. Hosking L. Trowsdale J. Black D.M. McFarlane R. Nature. 1994; 372: 733Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Xu C.-F. Brown M.A. Chambers J.A. Griffiths B. Nicolai H. Solomon E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and preliminary descriptions of modest and indirect effects of estrogen on the BRCA1 promoter activity were reported (12Marks J.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20994-20997Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, no information was available regarding regulatory sites and specific regulatory factors. In this report we provide evidence for a positive regulatory region (PRR) 1The abbreviations used are:PRR, positive regulatory region; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; Py-Pu, polypyrimidine-polypurine; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein. in theBRCA1 promoter and show data that suggest that multiple proteins bind specifically to the site. The BRCA1promoter was subcloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, BAC 694 (kindly provided by Dr. Sean Tavtigian, Myriad Genetics) (14Neuhausen S.L. Swensen J. Miki Y. et al.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1919-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, PstI linker (5′-GCTGCAGC-3′) was ligated into the blunted HindIII site in the pGL2 vector (Promega vector with the firefly luciferase reporter gene). BAC 694 was digested withPstI, and the resulting fragments were shotgun cloned into the pGL2 vector and transformed into competent DH5-αEscherichia coli cells. The transformed bacterial colonies were screened by colony hybridization with a radiolabeledBRCA1 cDNA probe (BRCA1 cDNA was kindly provided by Frank Calzone) (15Wilson C.A. Payton M.N. Elliott G.S. Buaas F.W. Cajulis E.E. Grosshans D. Ramos L. Reese D.M. Slamon D.J. Calzone F.J.

Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5190) Google Scholar), and clones with a 3.8-kilobase insert containing theBRCA1 5′ genomic fragment were selected. The cloned fragment was sequenced completely and is identical to the previously described genomic fragment encompassing the BRCA1 promoter (GenBankTM accession number U37574) (11Xu C.-F. Brown M.A. Chambers J.A. Griffiths B. Nicolai H. Solomon E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The nucleotide position of mutants are numbers from the P1 promoter initiation site at nucleotide 1582. Systematic promoter deletions were constructed by unidirectional exonuclease III digestion. 10 μg of BRCA1 promoter-luciferase construct was digested withMluI restriction enzyme and blunted with α-phosphorothioate nucleotides using Klenow enzyme. This treatment rendered the ends of the linearized plasmid resistant to exonuclease III digestion. The linearized DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and digested withXhoI restriction enzyme, generating a 5′ end susceptible to the exonuclease digestion. The fragment was purified and then subjected to exonuclease III digestion. Aliquots of the reaction were removed at regular intervals, and the reactions were terminated. Finally, the fragments were blunted using S1 nuclease, religated, and transformed into DH5-α competent cells. DNA preparations (using Qiagen columns) made from selected colonies were screened by analytical restriction enzyme digestions. Mutants −202 and +20 were constructed by exploiting the restriction enzyme sites present on the BRCA1 promoter (EcoRI, −202; SacI, +20) and also the sites present in the polylinker of the luciferase vector. TheBRCA1-luciferase construct was digested withEcoRI/XhoI (XhoI site is present in the polylinker) and SacI (SacI site is also present in the polylinker), respectively, and blunted with Klenow enzyme, and the larger fragment gel was purified and religated. Additional mutants to generate progressive deletions were constructed by a polymerase chain reaction based strategy. 5′ primers were designed at regular intervals along the sequence of the BRCA1promoter: −245, 5′-CTC ACG CGT TAG AGG CTA GAG GGC AGG-3′; −198, 5′-CTC ACG CGT TCC TCT TCC GTC TCT TTC-3′; −177, 5′-CTC ACG CGT TTA CGT CAT CCG GGG GCA-3′; −162, 5′-CTCACG CGT GCA GAC TGG GTG GCC AAT-3′; −152, 5′-CTC ACG CGT TGG CCA ATC CAG AGC CCC-3′; −118, 5′-CTC ACG CGTCTT TCT GTC CCT CCC ATC-3′; −86, 5′-CTC ACG CGT GAT TTC GTA TTC TGA GAG-3′; −43, 5′-CTC ACG CGT GGT TTC CGT GGC AAC GGA-3′; −34, 5′-CTC ACG CGT GGC AAC GGA AAA GCG CGG-3′; −26, 5′-CTC ACG CGT AAA GCG CGG GAA TTA CAG-3′; −17, 5′-CTC ACG CGT GAA TTA CAG ATA AAT TAA-3′; −7, 5′-CTC ACG CGT TAA ATT AAA ACT GCG ACT-3′. The 5′ primers included three bases, CTC, followed by the MluI enzyme site, which is underlined. The single 3′ primer used was: +36, 5′-TAGCTC GAG GGA AGT CTC AGC GAG CTC-3′. This primer included TAG followed by a XhoI site, which is underlined, at the 5′ end. The amplification conditions used were as follows (1 cycle for 2 min at 94 °C and 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 30 s), and 1 ng of the clonedBRCA1 promoter plasmid was used as template DNA. The amplified products were digested with MluI andXhoI restriction enzymes and ligated into the restrictedMluI-XhoI site of the pGL3 basic vectors (Promega). In addition, two synthetic primers (+5, 5′-CGC GTT GCG ACT GCG CGG CGT GAG CTC GCT GAG ACT TCC TC-3′ and +36, 5′-TCG AGA GGA AGT CTC AGC GAG CTC ACG CCG CGC AGT CGC AA-3′) designed to include theBRCA1 promoter region from +5 to +36 were annealed. The annealed primers generated a MluI compatible site at the 5′ end and a XhoI compatible site at the 3′ end, which were utilized in ligation of the annealed primers directly into theMluI and XhoI site of the pGL3 vector. All the constructs were verified by sequencing. TK-TS13 cells (hamster kidney cells kindly provided by Dr. Bruno Calabretta) were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. A total of 3 μg of DNA was used in each transfection (1 μg of BRCA promoter, 1 μg of pUC19 plasmid, and 1 μg of pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase vector purchased from Promega). The cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/liter gentamycin sulfate. MCF-7 cells (maintained in minimum essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, 2 mm sodium pyruvate and glutamine) were transfected using Fugene-6 reagent manufactured by Boehringer Mannheim. A total of 2 μg of DNA (0.5 μg of promoter construct and 1.5 μg of pRL-CMV) with 10 μl of Fugene reagent was used in each transfection. All the transfections were optimized for six-well plates. The transfected cells were lysed after 48 h by addition of 250 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). 20 μl of the lysed cell extract was added to 100 μl of luciferase substrate, and the light emissions were measured in a scintillation counter. Renilla luciferase readings (which were utilized to normalize the transfection efficiencies) were measured in the same tube using conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The experiments were performed essentially as described previously (17Thakur S. Lin H.-C. Tseng W.-T. Kumar S. Bravo R. Gelinas C. Rabson A.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2335-2344PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with a double-stranded probe encompassing the PRR (see Fig. 3 B). Two single-stranded oligonucleotides (−197 to −161, 5′-CCT CTT CCG TCT CTT TCC TTT TAC GTC ATC CGG GGG CAG ACT-3′, and −161 to −171, 5′-AGT CTG CCC CC-3′) were annealed, and the gap was filled by Klenow polymerase in the presence of deoxyribonucleotides dATP, dGTP, dTTP, α-32P-radiolabeled dCTP and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) as described (17Thakur S. Lin H.-C. Tseng W.-T. Kumar S. Bravo R. Gelinas C. Rabson A.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2335-2344PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extract (5 μg), made from MCF-7 breast cancer line as described previously, was mixed with 100,000 cpm of probe in Yanos buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 15% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0 or 1.5 or 3 μg of poly(dI·dC)) and incubated for 20 min. Competitions were performed with 50-fold excess of nonradiolabeled annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides contained palindromic C/EBP mutant (5′-TGC AGA GAC TAG TCT CTG CA-3′), p53 (5′-CCC AAA CAA GCT CCC CTG AAA CAA GCC CGT T-3′ and 5′-AAC GGG CTT GTT TCA GGG GAG CTT GTT TGG G-3′), and palindromic C/EBP canonical sites (5′-TGC AGA TTG CGC AAT CTG CA-3′). In addition, sheared salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and PRR cold probes were also used in competitions. After the incubations, loading dye was added (final concentrations: 0.06% bromphenol blue, 0.06% Xylene cyanole, and 7.2% glycerol), and the reactions were electrophoresed in a 5% nondenaturing gel, resolved for 3 h at 200 V in 0.25× TBE buffer, and after drying the gel exposed for 5 h to a film. In experiments involving UV radiation-induced cross-linking of DNA and protein, each electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction was transferred into a 96-well plate at 4 °C and exposed to UV radiation in a UV-Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) for 20 min. After the addition of sample buffer (1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) and boiling for 5 min, the reaction was resolved in a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was exposed to film. Negative control experiments with a random probe were also performed. The random probe was synthesized (in a manner similar to the PRR probe) by the extension of a DNA oligonucleotide (5′-CCC GGG AGT AGA-3′) annealed to a longer complementary oligonucleotide (5′-CTA GTC AGA CAC GTA GAC TCT ACT CCC GGG-3′) in the presence of BrdUrd and dCTP containing α-32P label. In order to identify the minimal promoter containing the essential regulatory regions, systematically deleted mutants of the BRCA1 promoter region were constructed (Fig. 1). The transcriptional activities of these mutants were tested in TK-TS13 and MCF-7 cells by luciferase reporter gene assays (Fig. 2). The TK-TS13 cells were used in initial studies (Fig. 2 A), due to the ease with which they are transfected and because of their ability to support high levels of BRCA1 promoter activities. Subsequent detailed studies were performed in MCF-7 breast epithelial cell line (Figs. 2 B and3 A).Figure 2Minimal BRCA1promoter. Luciferase activities of the deletion mutants in TK-TS13 (A) and MCF-7 cells (B). Deletions that result in loss of promoter activities are indicated and are found to be consistent for the two cell lines. The data are representative of three independent transfections for each line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Results of transfections of the mutants in TK-TS13 cell indicated that on the deletion of 1380 bases from mutant −1582 (and generating −202), there is a 2.5-fold drop of luciferase activity, which is not significant considering the high sensitivity of the luciferase assays and the number of bases deleted (Fig. 2 A). Within the same tract of promoter DNA (−1582 to −202), the two most wide ranging luciferase values were 6127 (for −1244) and 308 (for −329) normalized light units, a difference of 20-fold. However, this difference was accompanied by a loss of 915 bases from −1244. Overall, the data suggest that short deletions within the segment −1582 to −202 do not cause a significant change in promoter activity. However, gross deletions (−1582 to −202) do alter the configuration of the promoter sufficiently to affect the promoter activities significantly, because several weak regulatory sites (both enhancers and repressors) with additive effects may be deleted. Transfections of selected BRCA1 promoter mutants in MCF-7 cells also indicated that essential transcriptional regulatory sites (which could have a strong effect on the transcription ofBRCA1) were not present in the tract from −1582 to −202 (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, in MCF-7 cells mutant −202 was observed to possess a transcriptional activity that was comparable (and slightly higher) to that of construct −1582. Finally, results from both cell lines indicated the presence of a sensitive region of 222 bases (−202 to +20), which on deletion resulted in a 100% loss of BRCA1 promoter activities (Fig.2). These experiments strongly suggested that the essential regulatory elements of the BRCA1 promoter reside within the deleted segment. Furthermore, the mapped segment encompassed the P1 promoter region, suggesting that the activity of the P1 promoter was predominant in both the transfected cell lines. Curiously, P2 did not demonstrate any functional activity in either of the cell lines tested (Fig. 2). It is possible that sequences within the P1 promoter region may regulate the transcriptional initiation from P2. Following the identification of the −202 to +20 segment as essential for BRCA1transcription, detailed characterization of the segment was undertaken. Additional unidirectional, polymerase chain reaction-based deletion mutants were constructed, and their activities were tested (Fig.3 A). With the aid of these promoter mutants, it was determined that deletion of a short 22-base pair region between −198 and −177 (Fig. 3 B) resulted in a significant loss (14.5-fold) of luciferase activity. Further removal of 15 more nucleotides (−162) led to an additional 4-fold loss in activity. Overall, the removal of 36 bases (from −198 to −162) results in a 56-fold loss in luciferase activity, indicating a PRR. Interestingly, the PRR contains a short polypyrimidine-polypurine (Py-Pu) tract (the majority of nucleotides on the sense strand are pyrimidines and by extension the complementary strand is mostly purine) (Fig. 3 B). The first 22 bases in the site are almost exclusively Py-Pu (21 of 22 or 95%). This Py-Pu-rich tract is followed by a putative CREB site. Overall the pyrimidines in the sense strand make up 75% (27 of 36) of PRR. In order to characterize the proteins binding to the PRR site, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using MCF-7 nuclear extracts. Retarded protein-DNA complexes were detected (Fig. 4 A,lanes 2–8). Lane 2 lacked poly(dI·dC), and therefore the factors binding the probe largely represented nonspecific proteins. Addition of poly(dI·dC) (lanes 3–9), cleared nonspecific bands, and three protein-DNA complexes were detected (except in lane 9); a single intense, higher mobility band and two weaker bands with lower mobility, were observed. Addition of 50-fold excess of double-stranded nonlabeled oligonucleotides or sheared salmon sperm DNA (lanes 5–8) did not compete away the protein-DNA complexes. In sharp contrast, the proteins binding the labeled probe were efficiently competed out by a 50-fold excess of nonlabeled PRR probe (lane 9). This experiment indicates that the PRR-binding proteins bind in a sequence-specific manner. In order to further characterize the components of the protein complex that assembled on the PRR, UV cross-linking experiments (involving DNA-protein linkage) were performed (Fig. 4 B). This involved incubation of radiolabeled, BrdUrd-containing PRR probe, with MCF-7 nuclear extracts in the presence of UV radiation. The radiation induced covalent linking of proteins to the BrdUrd residues present in the PRR probe. All the reactions contained 3 μg of poly(dI·dC), and one of the reactions was supplemented with 0.5 μg of double-stranded oligonucleotides to increase the stringency of binding to the probe (lane 3). Lane 2 exhibits three diffuse and indistinct bands. The intensity of these bands increased on the addition of 0.5 μg of double-stranded oligonucleotides (lane 3), reinforcing the possibility that they represent specific protein-DNA interactions. The approximate molecular masses of the protein-DNA complexes observed were 55, 150, and 230 kDa. Additional experiments were performed to exclude the possibility that the covalent protein-DNA complexes were formed due to nonspecific interactions. A random oligonucleotide labeled with α-32P and BrdUrd residues was used in UV cross-linking experiments (Fig.4 C). Lane 2 of the figure demonstrates the characteristic three-band pattern representing proteins bound to the PRR. In contrast, no significant protein-DNA complexes were observed when the random probe was incubated with MCF-7 nuclear extract (lane 4). This experiment suggests that the proteins detected by cross-linking experiments recognized and bound the PRR specifically. Finally, it is probable that each of the DNA-protein complexes observed do not represent multiple proteins linked to a single DNA probe but a single protein molecule bound to one molecule of the PRR probe. This conclusion is based on the fact that the UV-induced protein-DNA cross-linking is inefficient; therefore it is unlikely that more than one protein molecule will link to a single molecule of DNA probe. Evidence for important roles of BRCA1 in normal functioning of cells is accumulating. Specifically, a strong role forBRCA1 in DNA repair mechanisms (18Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D.

Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 801-809PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in transcriptional regulation (21Chapman M.S. Verma I.M. Nature. 1996; 382: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 22Monteiro A.N. August A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 5605-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) has been suggested. This theme is reinforced in a recent report that cites the involvement ofBRCA1 in transcription-coupled repair of DNA (24Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that suppression of BRCA1expression may cause defects in the DNA repair machinery, leading to chromosomal defects and tumorigenesis. BRCA1 expression may be suppressed through transcriptional silencing in a subset of sporadic breast cancers, underscoring the importance of studies to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms involved in the regulation of BRCA1 expression. The present studies strongly suggest that intact and functional PRR may be crucial for normal transcription of BRCA1. Hindrance of the PRR function may occur either by methylation of proximate sequences or by alterations in the properties of the regulatory factors, leading to suppression of BRCA1 expression. Furthermore, elucidation of the factors that regulate BRCA1 transcription could provide additional clues regarding its function. It is interesting that the PRR encompasses a CpG dinucleotides reported by Mancini et al. (9Mancini D.N. Rodenhiser D.I. Ainsworth P.J. O'Malley F.P. Singh S.M. Xing W. Archer T.T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1161-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) to be methylated in one case of sporadic breast cancer. The methylated cytosine was present in the putative CREB site present in the PRR (Fig. 3 B). CREB proteins are known to mediate hormone stimulation of a variety of genes (25Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 26Comb M. Birnberg N.C. Seascholtz A. Herbert E. Goodman H.M. Nature. 1986; 323: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and BRCA1 is known to be indirectly responsive to estrogen stimulation (27Marks J.R. Huper G. Vaughn J.P.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), prompting speculation of a regulatory role of CREB in BRCA1 transcription. However, treatment of cells with forskolin (a reagent that stimulates post-translational activation of CREB by phosphorylation; Ref. 28Gonzalez G.A. Montminy R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar) did not show any effect on the activities of transiently transfected BRCA1 promoter (data not shown). In addition, forskolin treatment and cotransfection of a CREB-binding protein (a CREB coactivator; Refs. 29Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G.

Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) expression plasmid elicited no response from the BRCA1 promoter (data not shown). Attempts to identify CREB proteins in the DNA-protein complex, either by supershift assays or immunoprecipitation (of cross-linked DNA-protein complexes) with CREB antibodies, were not successful (data not shown). The composition of the PRR (21 of the first 22 bases are pyrimidines on the sense strand) provides possible hints regarding mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation of BRCA1. Previous studies have described the tendency for such Py-Pu domains to form triplex DNA, which influence transcription (31Hoffman E.K. Trusko S.P. Murphy M. George D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2705-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32Santra M. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 579-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These tracts have been reported to be sensitive to S-1 nuclease digestion and are believed to influence the conformation of the chromatin assembly in the promoter region. In addition, a nuclear factor has been reported to bind a Py-Pu tract in the c-Ki-ras promoter (31Hoffman E.K. Trusko S.P. Murphy M. George D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2705-2709Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that 1) the Py-Pu domain may alter the chromatin structure of theBRCA1 promoter region and 2) it may also be involved in specific recognition and binding by transcription factors. There is no additional information available at present regarding the factors binding the PRR. Studies are being initiated to definitively identify and characterize the binding proteins in order to investigate their effects on BRCA1 transcription and their potential role in breast cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2049175114,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules present antigenic peptides to CD8 T cells. The peptides are generated in the cytosol, then translocated across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). TAP is a trimeric complex consisting of TAP1, TAP2, and tapasin (TAP-A) as indicated for human cells by reciprocal coprecipitation with anti-TAP1/2 and anti-tapasin antibodies, respectively. TAP1 and TAP2 are required for the peptide transport. Tapasin is involved in the association of class I with TAP and in the assembly of class I with peptide. The mechanisms of tapasin function are still unknown. Moreover, there has been no evidence for a murine tapasin analogue, which has led to the suggestion that murine MHC class I binds directly to TAP1/2. In this study, we have cloned the mouse analogue of tapasin. The predicted amino acid sequence showed 78% identity to human tapasin with identical consensus sequences of signal peptide, N-linked glycosylation site, transmembrane domain and double lysine motif. However, there was less homology (47%) found at the predicted cytosolic domain, and in addition, mouse tapasin is 14 amino acids longer than the human analogue at the C terminus. This part of the molecule may determine the species specificity for interaction with MHC class I or TAP1/2. Like human tapasin, mouse tapasin binds both to TAP1/2 and MHC class I. In TAP2-mutated RMA-S cells, both TAP1 and MHC class I were coprecipitated by anti-tapasin antiserum indicative of association of tapasin with TAP1 but not TAP2. With crosslinker-modified peptides and purified microsomes, anti-tapasin coprecipitated both peptide-bound MHC class I and TAP1/2. In contrast, anti-calreticulin only coprecipitated peptide-free MHC class I molecules. This difference in association with peptide-loaded class I suggests that tapasin functions later than calreticulin during MHC class I assembly, and controls peptide loading onto MHC class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2000055613,"NF-κB/Rel family proteins form a network of post-translationally regulated transcription factors that respond to a variety of extracellular stimuli and mediate distinct cellular responses. These responses include cytokine gene expression, regulated cell cycle activation, and both the protection from and induction of the cell death program. To examine the function of individual Rel family proteins in B cell development and resolve their role in the signaling of apoptosis, we used a tetracycline-regulated gene expression system to overexpress either c-Rel or RelA in the transformed pro-B cell line 220-8. Elevated levels of RelA, but not c-Rel, induced a G1 cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of RelA were required for this effect. When RelA was overexpressed in the immature B cell line WEHI 231 or the mature B cell line M12, neither cell cycle arrest nor apoptosis was evident. The differential effects of elevated RelA levels in these cell lines suggests that susceptibility to NF-κB-induced apoptosis may reflect a relevant selection event during B cell development.

This region contains sequences for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear localization. Association of Rel family dimers with a second family of proteins, the IκBs, is responsible for the cytoplasmic sequestration of inactive NF-κB in unstimulated cells (7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). NF-κB was originally identified as a B cell-specific transcription factor that bound to a decameric sequence within the intronic enhancer of the immunoglobulin (Ig) κ light chain gene (8Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). It had been shown previously that the κB site within this enhancer is critical for enhancer activity in reporter assays (9Lenardo M. Pierce J.W. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 236: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and that NF-κB activation controlled the ability of this enhancer to activate transcription (10Atchison M.L. Perry R.P. Cell. 1987; 48: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Kallenbach S. Babinet C. Pournin S. Cavelier P. Goodhardt M. Rougeon F. Eur. J.

These observations led to the hypothesis that NF-κB played a critical role in the activation of Ig κ locus transcription and rearrangement during early B cell development (9Lenardo M. Pierce J.W.

It was later appreciated that NF-κB was in fact a ubiquitously expressed, inducible factor (17Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar), responsible for the activation of a diverse array of genes (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

Whereas none of the single knock-out mice showed any obvious defect in early B cell development, a recent report of mice deficient in both p50 and p52 revealed an essential role for NF-κB in the generation of mature B cells (24Franzoso G. Carlson L. Xing L. Poljak L. Shores E. Brown K. Leonardi A. Tran T. Boyce B. Siebenlist U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3482-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice deficient in either p50 or c-Rel have normal numbers of mature B cells, but these cells fail to activate appropriately in response to antigen receptor stimulation leading to humoral immunodeficiency (18Sha W. Liou H.-C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 20Kontgen F. Grumont R. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Li R. Tarlinton D. Gerondakis S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The role of RelA in B cell development could not be assessed since deficiency in this factor proved lethal by day 15 of embryogenesis, although adoptive transfer experiments suggested that B cell expression of RelA was not required for normal development (21Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar, 25Horwitz B. Scott M. Cherry S. Bronson R. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1997; 6: 765-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Evaluation of RelA-deficient pre-morbid fetuses attributed death to massive liver cell apoptosis. Thus, whereas their precise role in early B cell development remains uncertain, genetic studies implicate Rel family members in the regulation of both cell activation and cell death. A variety of other studies has demonstrated a role for NF-κB in both protection from and induction of apoptosis (26Abbadie C. Kabrun N. Bouali F. Smardova J. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B. Enrietto P.J.

Additional observations have suggested a role for NF-κB in growth arrest and differentiation (24Franzoso G. Carlson L. Xing L. Poljak L. Shores E. Brown K. Leonardi A. Tran T. Boyce B. Siebenlist U.

Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). These observations lead to the conclusion that the cell type and context of an NF-κB-inducing stimulus are critical determinants in the outcome of a signal that can lead to proliferation, differentiation, or death. In an effort to clarify the effects of NF-κB on cell proliferation and viability during B cell development, we utilized the tetracycline-regulated expression system (39Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 40Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) to examine the individual effects of either RelA or c-Rel overexpression in a pro-B cell line. Whereas elevated levels of RelA resulted in a G1cell cycle arrest followed by the induction of apoptosis, the overexpression of c-Rel did not affect cell growth or viability. Both the transactivating potential and the DNA binding specificity of RelA were required for these effects. To investigate cell type specificity, RelA was also overexpressed in immature and mature B lymphoma cell lines. Interestingly, elevated levels of RelA in these lymphoma cell lines did not result in apoptosis. From these observations, we conclude that RelA expression can result in cell growth arrest, leading to the induction of apoptosis, and that this apoptotic potential may be developmentally stage-specific. The pro-B cell line, 220-8, the immature B cell lymphoma, WEHI 231, and the mature B cell lymphoma M12 were cultured in RPMI 1640 with glutamine, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Biological Products), 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10−4mβ-mercaptoethanol. Cells were transfected by electroporation, and stable transfectants were selected in either mycophenolic acid or G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfectant pools were single cell-cloned by limiting dilution into antibiotic-containing media to establish clonal populations. All selections were performed and cultures maintained in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma) to repress tTA expression. Expression was induced by harvesting cells by centrifugation and then replating them into media lacking tetracycline. The gpt expression cassette from pSV2-gpt was cloned into the pTet-tTA plasmid ((41) a gift from Dr. David Schatz) (pTet-tTAgpt) to allow establishment of stable transfectants. Correspondingly, the neomycin drug resistance cassette from pGK-neo was cloned into the target plasmid of the inducible system, pTet-splice (41Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), to create pTetspliceneo (pTSN). Finally, a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA-tag) consisting of three tandem HA epitopes (a generous gift from Dr. Susan Michaelis) was cloned into the EcoRV site of the pTSN polylinker to generate pTSN.flu. When HindIII was used as a cloning site, an in-frame C-terminal HA epitope tag was generated. A custom-designed linker (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing a stop codon, was added at the end of the HA epitope. All cDNA fragments were then cloned into the HindIII site of pTSN.flu. In each case, translational reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The murine relA cDNA (a gift from Dr. Sankar Ghosh) was digested with Bsu36I and blunted with mung bean nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim), truncating the gene at the 3′ end of the open reading frame. Custom-made oligonucleotide linkers (Life Technologies, Inc.) were designed to maintain the reading frame and ligated to the 3′ end. A fragment containing the relA open reading frame was then cloned into pTSN.flu. The RelA TADt construct, containing a deletion of the C-terminal transactivation domains, was cloned using a polymerase chain reaction strategy, resulting in a gene fragment missing the 79 C-terminal amino acids. The c-rel cDNA (a gift from Sankar Ghosh) was excised by DraI digestion (eliminating the last two amino acids of the reported open reading frame), and then cloned into pTSN.flu using oligonucleotide adapters. The mutated relA cDNA (RRPA) obtained from Dr. Sankar Ghosh was similarly cloned into pTSN.flu. TherelA-c-rel chimeric genes were created using a polymerase chain reaction protocol. The 79 C-terminal amino acids (amino acid 471–549) of RelA were fused to the N terminus (433 amino acids) of c-Rel to generate c-Rel.TAD, and the C-terminal 135 amino acids of the c-Rel protein (amino acids 434–568) were fused to the N terminus (470 amino acids) of the RelA cDNA. These gene fusions were then cloned into pTSN.flu. Nuclear extracts were prepared using an Nonidet P-40 lysis method (42Schreiber E. Mattias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were spun down and washed once in 1× PBS, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μl/ml aprotinin (Sigma)), and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cells were then lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and the nuclei pelleted. The nuclei were salt-extracted (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μl/ml aprotinin) and incubated with vigorous shaking for 15 min at 4 °C. Nuclear remnants were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing extracted protein was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined via a BCA colorimetric assay (Pierce). 5–10 μg of nuclear extract was added to 2 μl of 10× binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol), 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 6 μg of poly(dI-dC), 3 mm GTP, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (included only in NF-κB DNA binding analysis), and 105 cpm polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) end-labeled oligonucleotide probe. A final salt concentration of 10 mm was established by adding the appropriate amount of 1 m NaCl to the volume of the protein extract. The NF-κB probe used in these experiments was 5′ TAACAGAGGGGACBBBCCGAGAGCCA (B indicates BrdUrd nucleotides). The quality of all extracts was monitored by gel mobility shift assay using an octamer binding site oligonucleotide: 5′ GCCTCATTTGCATGGACTTAGCTTGTCCATGCAAATGAGG. The 20-μl binding reactions were incubated 10 min at room temperature, loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel (that had been pre-run for 60 min at 150 V with buffer recirculation) in 0.25× TBE, and electrophoresed at 150 V for 3–4 h. The gel was dried under vacuum and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics) for 12–36 h. Where indicated, supershift analysis was performed by incubating anti-RelA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-c-Rel antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with the protein extract for 60 min at 4 °C. The binding buffer was then added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature before gel loading. Whole cell extracts were prepared by harvesting 5 × 105-106 cells, washing once in 1× PBS, and then lysing in sample buffer (10% glycerol, 3% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris pH 6.8). The samples were then mixed with an equal volume of bromphenol blue loading dye (containing 1m β-mercaptoethanol), boiled, and then electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was blotted onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell) by electroelution. The blots were stained with Ponceau S to assess protein transfer and then blocked 30 min to overnight in 5% powdered milk/PBS-T (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20). Primary antibodies included anti-c-Rel and anti-RelA (listed above), used at 1:1000 dilutions in 5% powdered milk/PBS-T and anti-HA-epitope (Boehringer Mannheim, clone 12CA5) used at a 1:400 dilution in 5% milk/PBS-T. Incubations with the primary antibodies were 1–3 h at room temperature, and subsequent washes were done in PBS-T. Secondary antibody incubations, either anti-mouse Ig or anti-rabbit Ig, were performed at 1:3000 dilution in 5% milk/PBS-T for 30–60 min. The blots were imaged using chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell viability was assessed via the trypan blue exclusion properties of a cell culture. Cultures were analyzed in duplicate as follows: 4 × 105 cells were harvested by centrifugation (to remove tetracycline) and resuspended in 20 ml of complete media lacking tetracycline. Control cultures were similarly prepared with the addition of tetracycline to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. 1.5-ml aliquots were removed from cultures at the indicated time points. Each aliquot of cells was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume (varying with expected cell numbers) of PBS, diluted 1:1 with a trypan blue solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and counted using a hemacytometer. The total number of cells in 1.5 ml was calculated and recorded as the cell number for the appropriate time point. 106 cells were pelleted, washed in wash buffer (1× PBS, 3% fetal bovine serum, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), resuspended in 100 μl of wash buffer, and split into duplicate tubes. Each sample was pelleted and resuspended in wash buffer supplemented with either 2 mmCaCl2 or 2 mm EDTA. The FITC-Annexin V reagent (CLONTECH) was added at a 1:20 dilution, and samples were incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed once with 1.5 ml of wash buffer with or without CaCl2 and resuspended in 500 μl of the appropriate wash buffer. 7-AAD was added at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, and cells were incubated 10 min at room temperature before analysis on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Cell cycle analysis was performed as reported previously (43Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were pulsed with 30 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma B5002) for 60 min. 3 × 106 cells were pelleted and washed in PBS, 5 mm EDTA. The cells were fixed in methanol, pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of 2 n HCl, 0.2 mg/ml pepsin, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 3 ml of 0.1 msodium tetraborate, pH 8.5 (Sigma), was added to neutralize the HCl, the cells were pelleted, washed once in IFA (0.009 mHepes/0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.7, 4% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1% sodium azide), washed once in IFA + 0.5% Tween 20, resuspended in anti-BrdUrd antibody (PharMingen Clone 3D4) diluted 1:1000 in IFA + 0.5% Tween 20, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed in IFA, 0.5% Tween 20 and resuspended in 100 μl of anti-mIgG1 (PharMingen) diluted 1:200 in IFA, 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. A final wash was done in IFA, 0.5% Tween 20, and the cells were resuspended in PBS, 20 μg/ml RNase and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 7-AAD was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and the samples were analyzed using the FACScan and CellQuest software. An inducible expression system was used to individually overexpress the RelA and c-Rel proteins in the Abelson virus-transformed pro-B cell line 220-8 (14Schlissel M.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In this system, the DNA binding domain of the Tet repressor protein (TetR), whose DNA binding is inhibited in the presence of tetracycline, is fused to the transactivation domain of the herpesvirus VP16 protein, resulting in a tetracycline-regulated transactivator protein (tTA) (39Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). When Tet operator sequences are positioned upstream of a minimal promoter, the binding of tTA results in transcriptional activation of a downstream target gene. In the presence of tetracycline, tTA protein cannot bind its operator sequences, and the target gene is not transcribed. By placing the tTA gene itself under control of the tTA-inducible promoter, an autoregulatory loop is established resulting in tight control of target gene expression (41Shockett P. Difilippantonio M. Hellman N. Schatz D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6522-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A vector containing tTA expression and mycophenolic acid resistance cassettes was used to generate stable 220-8 transfectants. Single cell clones were screened for inducible expression of the tTA fusion protein and a clone expressing high levels of tTA10 was identified for use in subsequent experiments (data not shown). A second vector, in which either the relA or c-rel cDNA (fused in-frame with an HA epitope tag) was placed under the regulatory control of tet operator sequences, was transfected into tTA10, and stable transfectants were selected for G418 resistance. Single cell clones were analyzed by Western blot for inducible expression of either RelA or c-Rel protein. In the presence of tetracycline, no detectable protein was made, but upon removal of tetracycline, protein expression was seen as early as 5 h after antibiotic removal, and expression was stable for up to 5 days (Fig. 1,A and B). Levels of the induced RelA and c-Rel proteins were similar to the levels of the corresponding endogenous proteins (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The appearance of NF-κB binding activity in nuclear extracts paralleled the accumulation of induced protein (Fig. 1 C), with maximal binding detected after 72 h of induction. Supershift analysis of these complexes using specific antibodies identified the presence of both RelA and c-Rel in these induced κB site-binding complexes (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). Thus, induction of either RelA or c-Rel protein resulted in both activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB in the absence of an additional stimulus. NF-κB can also be induced in untransfected cells by culturing them in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS induces nuclear NF-κB complexes containing predominantly RelA (Fig. 1 C) and p50 (35Miyamoto S. Schmitt M. Verma I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5056-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 36Liou H. Sha W. Scott M. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Lernbecher T. Muller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). During our initial analysis of induced RelA or c-Rel protein expression, we noted a significant amount of cell death in pro-B cell clones expressing the RelA construct, but not in those cultures expressing either the c-Rel construct or the parental tTA construct itself. Untransfected LPS-treated 220-8 cultures failed to show increased cell death, however (data not shown). A cell viability analysis, utilizing trypan blue exclusion, revealed a striking loss of cells upon induction of the RelA protein (Fig.2). In contrast, cells expressing either the tTA regulatory protein or the c-Rel protein show only a modest decrease in cell growth compared with control 220-8 clones. A kinetic analysis of the effect of RelA expression on cell number revealed a time lag between protein expression and cell death. Although we could detect RelA as soon as 5 h after the removal of tetracycline, with its expression peaking at 36 h (Fig. 1,A and B), significant cell loss was not seen until 72 h. Interestingly, this onset of cell loss coincided with the maximal induction of nuclear κB site binding activity (Fig.1 C and data not shown). This implies that the observed cell death might depend upon the nuclear translocation of RelA and subsequent activation of cellular gene expression. To characterize cell death in this system, we stained cells with FITC-conjugated recombinant Annexin V (Fig. 3). Annexin V is a protein that binds phosphatidylserine. During the early stages of apoptosis, phosphatidylserine, which is primarily localized to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes in healthy cells, is exposed on the outer leaflet where it can be detected by Annexin V binding (45Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2556) Google Scholar, 46Koopman G.

Cells were also stained with 7-AAD, a DNA-binding dye that stains cells that have lost their membrane integrity (a late event in both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death). Induction of tTA expression in control cultures resulted in a moderate increase in cell death. When cultures expressing elevated levels of RelA were compared with parental cultures, we found that clones overexpressing RelA had 2–3-fold more Annexin V binding 7-AAD excluding cells, indicative of the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3). We detected twice the number of dead cells in the RelA-expressing clones as we did in control cultures. In addition, we performed a gel electrophoretic analysis of DNA purified from these cultures. RelA expression was associated with internucleosomal cleavage of DNA characteristic of apoptosis (data not shown). The lag between induction of RelA expression and the apparent onset of apoptosis led us to investigate whe"
https://openalex.org/W2068013527,"We have previously identified two enzyme activities that transfer the acetyl group from platelet-activating factor (PAF) in a CoA-independent manner to lysoplasmalogen or sphingosine in HL-60 cells, endothelial cells, and a variety of rat tissues. These were termed as PAF:lysoplasmalogen (lysophospholipid) transacetylase and PAF:sphingosine transacetylase, respectively. In the present study, we have solubilized and purified this PAF-dependent transacetylase 13,700-fold from rat kidney membranes (mitochondrial plus microsomal membranes) based on the PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase activity. The mitochondria and microsomes were prepared and washed three times, then solubilized with 0.04% Tween 20 at a detergent/protein (w/w) ratio of 0.1. The solubilized fractions from mitochondria and microsomes were combined and subjected to sequential column chromatographies on DEAE-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, phenyl-Sepharose, and chromatofocusing. The enzyme was further purified by native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and affinity gel matrix in which the competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine was covalently attached to the CH-Sepharose. On SDS-PAGE, the purified enzyme showed a single homogeneous band with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa. The purified enzyme catalyzed transacetylation of the acetyl group not only from PAF to lysoplasmalogen forming plasmalogen analogs of PAF, but also to sphingosine producing N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide). In addition, this enzyme acted as a PAF-acetylhydrolase in the absence of lipid acceptor molecules. These results suggest that PAF-dependent transacetylase is an enzyme that modifies the cellular functions of PAF through generation of other diverse lipid mediators.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). PAF is produced by either de novo or remodeling pathway (1Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, we found the PAF could also be metabolized by a novel pathway catalyzed by membrane-associated transacetylase that transfers the acetate group of PAF to lysoplasmalogen in HL 60 cells (3Lee T. Uemura Y. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is CoA-independent and transfers the acetyl group from PAF to a variety of lysophospholipids acceptors in the order of radyl-GPC > radyl-glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) > acyl-glycerophosphoserine > acyl-glycerophosphoinositol > acyl-glycerophosphate > alkyl-glycerophosphate > fatty alcohol, whereas alkylglycerol, acylglycerol, or cholesterol are inactive as acceptors. This PAF-dependent transacetylase is participated in the biosynthesis of acyl analog of PAF (4Balestrieri M.L. Servillo L. Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is the predominant molecular species of PAF in hematopoietic cells including endothelial cells, mast cells, and basophils, etc. (5Triggiani M. Schleimer R.P. Warner J.A. Chilton F.H. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 660-666PubMed Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, PAF-dependent transacetylase activity is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (4Balestrieri M.L. Servillo L. Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that a similar PAF-dependent transacetylase transfers the acetyl group of PAF to sphingosine in HL 60 cells (6Lee T. Ou M. Shinozaki K. Malone B. Snyder F. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Lee T. Nigam S. Kumkel G. Prescott S.M. Platelet-activating Factor and Related Lipid Mediators in Health and Disease. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1996: 113-119Google Scholar). This enzyme activity appears to be responsible for the presence of acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) in the biological systems. For instance, C2-ceramide occurred in the micromolar range in undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells (6Lee T. Ou M. Shinozaki K. Malone B. Snyder F. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This is the concentration range that C2-ceramide has been shown to exert as a second messenger and a lipid mediator by many investigators (8Hannum Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 9Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Halmovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Since C2-ceramide has many biological activities that differ from PAF and sphingosine, therefore, this enzyme may serve as a modifier for the functions of PAF and sphingosine (6Lee T. Ou M. Shinozaki K. Malone B. Snyder F. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both enzyme activities are also found in rat tissues (6Lee T. Ou M. Shinozaki K. Malone B. Snyder F. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rat kidney membrane fractions have the highest PAF:sphingosine transacetylase activity, while both rat kidneys and lung have the highest PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase activity. To elucidate the relationship of both enzyme activities, we attempted to purify the transacetylase from rat kidney membranes, in which the highest enzyme activity toward both lipid acceptors (6Lee T. Ou M. Shinozaki K. Malone B. Snyder F. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Lee T. Nigam S. Kumkel G. Prescott S.M. Platelet-activating Factor and Related Lipid Mediators in Health and Disease. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1996: 113-119Google Scholar). In the present report, we have achieved purification of the transacetylase to homogeneity and shown that this enzyme possesses three catalytic activities, namely, PAF-acetylhydrolase, PAF:lysophospholipid transacetylase, and PAF:sphingosine transacetylase. l-O-Hexadecyl-2-acetyl-GPC was obtained from Sigma. 1-O-Hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamyl-GPC and C2-ceramide were purchased from Biomol. 1-O-Alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC was from Avanti. Sphingosine was bought from Matreya, Inc. Alkenyllyso-GPE was a product from Serdary Research Lab. 1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H]acetyl-GPC was the product of NEN Life Science Products. DEAE-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, activated CH-Sepharose, PBE 94, and Polybuffer 74 were from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Hydroxyapatite was obtained from Bio-Rad. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were from Taconic. PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase and PAF:sphingosine transacetylase activities were determined according to our previously described methods (3Lee T. Uemura Y. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lee T. Ou M. Shinozaki K. Malone B. Snyder F. J Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The assay system of PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase consisted of 50 μm1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H]acetyl-GPC (0.3 μCi), 300 μm lysoplasmalogen (suspended in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)-saline), 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm sodium acetate, and 10 mm EDTA in a total volume of 250 μl. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min. The lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (10Bligh E.G. Dyer W.T. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 261: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42411) Google Scholar). The lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a solvent system of CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/H2O (50:25:8:4, v/v/v/v), and the radioactivities of the areas corresponding to PAF and alk-1-enylacetyl-GPE were counted using liquid scintillation fluid. The assay system of PAF:sphingosine transacetylase contained 15 μm1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H]acetyl-GPC (1 μCi), 50 μm sphingosine (suspended in equal molar ratio of BSA), 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm sodium acetate, and 10 mm EDTA in a total volume of 250 μl. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min. The lipids were separated by TLC using a solvent system of CHCl3/CH3OH (90:10, v/v). The radioactivities of the areas corresponding to PAF and C2-ceramide were measured. PAF-AH activity was assayed according to the method previously described (11Blank M.L. Lee T. Fitzgerald V. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay system of PAF-AH was composed of 20 μm1-O-hexadecyl-2-[3H]acetyl-GPC (0.1 μCi), 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 500 μl. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by sequential additions of 1 ml of CHCl3, 1 ml of CH3OH, and 0.5 ml of 10% sodium bicarbonate. The upper phase was washed with 1 ml of CHCl3 three times, and the radioactivities in an aliquot of 0.4 ml were determined. The kidneys were dissected out from male rats weighing 150–250 g and homogenized with four volumes of 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenates were centrifuged at 440 × gfor 10 min; the supernatant was collected as postnuclear fraction. The postnuclear fraction was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to isolate the mitochondrial pellets. The postmitochondrial fractions were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the microsomal fractions. Both mitochondrial and microsomal fractions were washed with the same buffer solution twice, and the washed mitochondria and microsomes were used as a source for enzyme purification. Mitochondrial fractions were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.04% Tween 20, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT at a detergent/protein (w/w) ratio of 0.1. The mixture was gently stirred at 0 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The enzyme activity was twice extracted from microsomal fractions by detergent in the same way as described for the mitochondria. High salt wash (0.5 mNaCl) without the presence of detergent (data not shown) could not further elute the enzyme activity from mitochondria or microsomes. We have observed that the mitochondrial fraction had the highest specific activity and the microsomal fraction contained the highest total activity of transacetylase among the subcellular fractions isolated from HL-60 cells (7Lee T. Nigam S. Kumkel G. Prescott S.M. Platelet-activating Factor and Related Lipid Mediators in Health and Disease. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1996: 113-119Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to combine both solubilized mitochondria and microsomes as the starting materials for column chromatography. The solubilized enzyme was applied onto a column of DEAE-Sepharose (2.5 × 6.11 cm, 30 ml), which was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.02% Tween 20. The column was washed with the same buffer solution and was then eluted with 0.15 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, and 0.02% Tween 20. During initial experiments, the solubilized enzyme bound to the DEAE-Sepharose column was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl. There was only one major eluted peak of enzyme activity that started to come out at 0.15 m NaCl from the column. Based on this information, stepwise elution of the enzyme activity with 0.15m NaCl from the DEAE-Sepharose column was performed subsequently in order to speed up the purification process. Active fractions of DEAE-Sepharose were applied onto a column of hydroxyapatite (1.5 × 8.49 cm, 15 ml), which was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.02% Tween 20. The column was washed with the same buffer solution, and the enzyme activity was eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmDTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.02% Tween 20. The rationale to use the stepwise elution from hydroxyapatite with 50 mm potassium phosphate was similar to that of the experiments with DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography. We had previously found that the most of the enzyme activities was eluted from hydroxyapatite column starting at 50 mm potassium phosphate during a linear gradient run of the chromatography. The active fractions isolated from hydroxyapatite column chromatography were applied onto a column of phenyl-Sepharose (1.0 × 6.37 cm, 5 ml), which was equilibrated with 5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.02% Tween 20. The column was washed with the same solution, and the enzyme activity was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 0.02% Tween 20. The active fractions pooled from phenyl-Sepharose were applied onto a column of PBE94 (1.0 × 6.37 cm, 5 ml), which was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.02% Tween 20. The column was washed with 25 mm histidine-HCl (pH 6.2), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.02% Tween 20, and the enzyme activity was eluted by decreasing pH with Polybuffer 74 (pH 4.0) in 1 mm DTT and 0.02% Tween 20. Five-ml fractions were collected into the tube containing 0.7 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to neutralize the pH. The enzyme activity was unstable at pH 5.0, and 88% of enzyme activity was lost 16 h thereafter. It was necessary to neutralize the pH of the sample solution soon after the enzyme was eluted from the column. The active fractions from chromatofocusing were concentrated into 4.5 ml by using a small size of hydroxyapatite column (1 × 0.27 cm, 1 ml). The enzyme was further purified by native-PAGE according to the method of Ornstein and Davis (12Ornstein L. Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3328) Google Scholar). Separating gel (2 ml) consisting of 7.5% polyacrylamide, 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and 0.02% Tween 20 was prepared in a glass tube (15 × 0.5 cm). Stacking gel (0.1 ml) composed of 5% polyacrylamide, 0.125m Tris-H3PO4 (pH 6.8), and 0.02% Tween 20 were overlaid to the separating gel. The enzyme solution (0.4 ml) was added to each tube. Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage of 80 V and 4 °C until the dye migrated toward the end of the gel. The gels were then removed from the glass tubes and horizontally sliced into fragments (2 mm distance). The individual pieces were transferred into microtiter plate wells, soaked in 50 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Tween 20 for 16 h, and the supernatants with the highest enzyme activities were collected. 1-O-Hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamyl-GPC (5 mg, 9.28 μmol) dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.16 m acetate (pH 5.6) containing 80 mm CaCl2 was combined with 1 ml of cabbage phospholipase D and 0.5 ml of 20% ethanolamine. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 16 h (similar to that described in Ref. 13Uemura Y. Lee T. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8268-8272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the lipid was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (10Bligh E.G. Dyer W.T. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 261: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42411) Google Scholar). The reaction product, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamyl-GPE, was purified by TLC using a solvent system of CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/H2O (50:25:8:4, v/v/v/v). The purified phospholipid (8.36 μmol) was dissolved in 2 ml of 50 mm borate (pH 8.0) in CH3OH and reacted with activated CH-Sepharose (2 ml) suspended in the same solution for 16 h at 22 °C. The resulting gel was washed with 50 mm borate (pH 8.0) in CH3OH thoroughly, and the remaining reactive sites were blocked with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 16 h at room temperature. Based on results from phosphorus determinations (14Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar), 0.98 μmol of ligand was bound to 1 ml of CH-Sepharose The active fractions of native-PAGE were combined with 50 μl of affinity gel matrix in a microcentrifuge tube, which was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.02% Tween 20 and mixed gently at 4 °C for 30 min. The gel was washed with the same buffer and followed by the same solution without NaCl. The washed gel was combined with 5 mm alkylacetyl-GPC dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in 1 mm DTT, and 0.02% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant with enzyme activity was transferred into another tube. PAF in this enzyme preparation was removed by hydroxyapatite (0.5 ml) column chromatography. The resulting enzyme solution was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 40% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.02% Tween 20. The purified preparation was stored at −20 °C, and no significant decrease in enzyme activity was observed at least for 1 month. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar) using 10% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were visualized by silver staining using a silver staining kit for protein (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals). The sequencing of the protein was carried out at Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Boston, MA) by tandem mass spectrometry and Edman degradation analysis. The purified protein was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein band on the gel was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The sliced gel was subjected to digestion with trypsin and microsequencing. In most instances, protein was measured by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using BSA as the standard. However, when the protein concentrations in the samples were low (e.g. Table III, steps 3–7), a series of one to one (1:1) dilutions of 1 μg/ml BSA (ranging from 31.25 ng to 1 μg per spot) and the samples in duplicates were spotted on a 3MM filter paper. The spots were allowed to air-dry and were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad), 45% CH3OH, 10% CH3COOH for 30 min. The paper was destained with 45% CH3OH, 10% CH3COOH until the background was nearly white. Then, the protein amount was determined by comparing the intensities of the spots from samples with those from BSA standards. The amount of protein in the final enzyme preparation (Table III, step 8) was estimated by comparing the intensity of the protein band with those of standard proteins after SDS-PAGE and silver staining.Table IIIPurification of PAF-dependent transacetylase from rat kidney membranesStepsProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgnmol/minnmol/min·mg-fold%1Mitochondria82117042.101100Microsome58034086.02Solubilization from mitochondria (1st)98.4140414.75.968.9Solubilization from Microsome (1st)73.2171623.6Solubilization from Microsome (2nd)69.64045.93DEAE-Sepharose36.1375810428.573.54Hydroxyapatite9.93318932188.062.45Phenyl-Sepharose4.50274260916753.66Chromatofocusing1.131823161044135.77Native PAGE0.025668926900737013.58Affinity gel matrix0.0044622350000137004.4 Open table in a new tab Table IISolubilization of PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase from mitochondrial and microsomal fractions of rat kidneysProteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoverymgnmol/minnmol/min·mg%Mitochondria68.4 ± 1.2142 ± 18.52.1 ± 0.3100Microsome48.3 ± 3.2284 ± 13.16.0 ± 0.4100First solubilization from mitochondria8.2 ± 1.0117 ± 3.914.7 ± 1.282.3Second solubilization from mitochondria10.4 ± 0.811.6 ± 2.21.2 ± 0.38.2First solubilization from microsome6.1 ± 0.4143 ± 8.923.6 ± 1.750.4Second solubilization from microsome5.8 ± 0.633.7 ± 2.25.9 ± 0.511.9Four groups of mitochondrial and microsomal fractions were independently prepared from 21 rats as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The solubilization of enzyme was carried out with 0.04% Tween 20 at a detergent/protein (w/w) ratio of 0.1.

The membrane fraction suspended in 0.25m sucrose and 10 mm Hepes, (pH 7.0) was mixed with 0.2% Tween 20 to attain the desired Tween 20 concentration and Tween 20/protein ratio. The mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the supernatant and pellet fraction. Transacetylase activities and protein concentrations in both fractions were measured to ensure proper recovery. Data represent the average of at least duplicate determinations.

Transacetylase activities and protein concentrations in both fractions were measured to ensure proper recovery. Data represent the average of at least duplicate determinations. An essential step in purifying the membrane enzyme is to first solubilize the enzyme from the membrane. Although there are assortments of detergents (ionic and non-ionic) and chaotropic agents available commercially, the detergent selected will be the one that does not inhibit or inactivate enzyme activity, does not present the enzyme in an aggregated form, and has a high critical micellar concentration. Additionally, the ratio of protein to detergent concentration is important. In preliminary experiment, among the several ionic and non-ionic detergents we tested (such as CHAPSO, octylglucoside, and Triton X-100), PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase activity was most effectively solubilized by Tween 20. Enzyme activity was solubilized from rat kidney membrane fractions (mitochondria plus microsomes, 100,000 × g pellets) by Tween 20 at a concentration of 0.02–0.05%, and the maximal specific activity was observed at a detergent/protein (w/w) ratio of 0.1 (TableI). When the efficiency of the solubilization was tested on mitochondrial and microsomal fractions separately instead of using total membrane fraction, it was found that substantial amounts of enzyme activity still remained in the 100,000 × g pellets, especially with that of the microsomal fractions (TableII). Therefore, a second attempt on the solubilization of the remaining pellets was carried out. Around 8% and 10% of transacetylase activities were obtained from the second solubilization of the mitochondrial and microsomal pellets, respectively. However, the second solubilization from the mitochondrial fraction decreased the specific activity of the enzyme because relatively large amounts of unspecific proteins were concomitantly released. Thus, solubilization procedures were performed twice for the microsomal fraction and once for the mitochondrial fraction hereon. Overall, Tween 20 (0.02%) was included in all purification steps because it maintained the stability of enzyme activity. The apparent isoelectric point of the enzyme was estimated to be 5.0 by chromatofocusing (data not shown). Native-PAGE was the crucial step for the purification of this enzyme. The specific activity was increased 17-fold, as compared with that in the previous step (TableIII). It should be noted that the enzyme activity was easily extracted from the polyacrylamide gel by soaking the gel slice in the buffer solution without squeezing the gel or the aid of electricity, as commonly performed as a method to extract the proteins from the polyacrylamide gel. 1-O-Hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (data not shown) and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-N-methylcarbamyl-GPE, which are structurally related to PAF, competitively inhibit PAF:lysoplasmalogen transacetylase activity in Tween 20 (0.05%) solubilized membrane fraction from rat kidneys with K m = 9.1 μm, and K i = 10.1 μm for hexadecylacetyl-GPC and hexadecyl-N-methylcarbamyl-GPE, respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, hexadecyl-N-methylcarbamyl-GPE is expected to be useful as a specific ligand for the affinity gel matrix. This lipid has the advantage of being resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis, while acetyl ester of PAF is easily degraded by PAF-acetylhydrolase(s) in the cells. Additionally, the amino group of hexadecylmethylcarbamyl-GPE can be linked to the carboxyl-terminal group of CH-Sepharose covalently. All the enzyme activity was adsorbed to the resulting gel matrix, while enzyme activity was not adsorbed to the CH-Sepharose without ligand at all (data not shown). The enzyme activity was not eluted from the gel matrix by 0.5% CHAPS, 1% Triton X-100, 50% ethylene glycol, or 0.5m NaCl. In order to elute the enzyme activity from the column with a reasonable recovery, more than 5 mm PAF was required. The concentration of the ligand in the gel matrix was estimated to be 0.98 mm; therefore, a relatively high concentration of PAF was needed for replacement. These results also indicate that the enzyme specifically recognizes the ligand at the site, which is necessary for the interaction with the substrate.

https://openalex.org/W1989046199,"The mouse leukotriene B4receptor (m-BLTR) gene was cloned. Membrane fractions of human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing m-BLTR demonstrated a high affinity and specific binding for leukotriene B4(LTB4, K d = 0.24 ± 0.03 nm). In competition binding experiments, LTB4was the most potent competitor (K i = 0.23 ± 0.05 nm) followed by 20-hydroxy-LTB4(K i = 1.1 ± 0.2 nm) and by 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4 and LTD4(K i > 1 μm). In stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, LTB4 inhibited forskolin-activated cAMP production and induced an increase of intracellular calcium, suggesting that this receptor is coupled to Gi- and Go-like proteins. In Xenopus laevis melanophores transiently expressing m-BLTR, LTB4 induced the aggregation of pigment granules, confirming the inhibition of cAMP production induced by LTB4. BLT receptors share significant sequence homology with chemokine receptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) that act as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coreceptors. However, among the 16 HIV/SIV strains tested, the human BLT receptor did not act as a coreceptor for virus entry into CD4-expressing cells based on infection and cell-cell fusion assays. In 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice, the absence of leukotriene B4 biosynthesis did not detectably alter m-BLT receptor binding in membranes obtained from glycogen-elicited neutrophils. Isolation of the m-BLTR gene will form the basis of future experiments to elucidate the selective role of LTB4, as opposed to cysteinyl-leukotrienes, in murine models of inflammation.

Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar). The biological actions of the cysteinyl-leukotrienes are mediated through at least two G protein-coupled receptors referred to as CysLT1 and CysLT2 whose molecular identities remain uncharacterized (2Metters K.M. J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). LTB4 mediates its effects through a membrane G-protein-coupled receptor termed BLTR (3Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Additionally, LTB4 was shown to bind to the intracellular transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (4Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). This facet of binding has been proposed to be part of a negative feedback mechanism to limit the inflammatory actions of LTB4. However the binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor has been questioned in recent experiments (5Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). LTB4, a dihydroxy fatty acid, is one of the most potent known chemoattractant mediators, acting mainly on neutrophils but also on related myeloid cells, mast cells, and endothelial cells (6Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Bray M.A. Doig M.V. Shipley M.E. Smith M.J. Nature. 1980; 286: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 7Nohgawa M. Sasada M. Maeda A. Asagoe K. Harakawa N. Takano K. Yamamoto K. Okuma M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). LTB4 induces chemotaxis, chemokinesis, and aggregation, causing the migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation where the cells degranulate, resulting in the release of lysosomal enzymes in addition to other antibacterial and anti-microbicidal agents (8Henderson Jr., W.R. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 121: 684-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). LTB4 also promotes the adherence of neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells and their transmigration, which amplifies the inflammatory response. LTB4 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases like arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. The exact role of LTB4 in the etiology of these disorders has been debated vigorously. Inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase and the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein have been used efficiently in models of ulcerative colitis (9Kjeldsen J. Laursen L.S. Hillingso J. Mertz-Nielsen A. Bukhave K.

The development of specific and highly potent BLTR antagonists has lagged behind cysteinyl receptor antagonists, which are currently available in the clinic for treatment of asthmatic inflammatory symptoms. One BLTR antagonist has shown encouraging results in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis (15Griffiths R.J. Pettipher E.R. Koch K. Farrell C.A. Breslow R. Conklyn M.J. Smith M.A. Hackman B.C. Wimberly D.J. Milici A.J. Scampoli D.N. Cheng J.B. Pillor J.S. Pazoles C.J. Doherty N.S. Melvin L.S. Reiter L.A. Biggars M.S. Falkner F.C. Mitchell D.Y. Liston T.E. Showell H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). There has been considerable controversy about the molecular identification of the BLTR. In 1996 two independent research groups (16Owman C. Nilsson C. Lolait S.J. Genomics. 1996; 37: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Chantry D. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Godiska R. Gray P.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) cloned identical orphan receptor genes believed to encode members of the chemotactic factor subfamily of G protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptors. Initially, one group indicated that the receptor was unable to bind LTB4 (16Owman C. Nilsson C. Lolait S.J. Genomics. 1996; 37: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but later retracted this finding to indicate specific binding (18Owman C. Lolait S.J. Santen S. Olde B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A third group cloned the identical receptor sequence, which was classified as a purinergic P2Y7 receptor on the basis of its affinity for binding ATP (19Akbar G.K.M. Dasari V.R. Webb T.E. Ayyanathan K. Pillarisetti K. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Daniel J.L. Ashby B. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18363-18367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, Yokomizo et al. (3Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) challenged this identification and provided convincing proof that the human BLTR (h-BLTR) had been cloned. Intense interest in the role of chemokine receptors for facilitation of HIV entry into CD4-positive cells is evident from recent surveys of the literature (20Doms R.W. Peiper S.C. Virology. 1997; 235: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 21Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). The h-BLTR is structurally related to chemokine receptors (e.g. CCR5) and is expressed in various immune cells. Recent evidence has suggested that the h-BLTR may function as a coreceptor for entry of primary HIV-1 isolates into CD4-positive cells (22Owman C. Garzino-Demo A. Cocchi F. Popovic F. Sabirsh A. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). If true, this finding would add a significant new dimension to the interplay of leukotrienes, inflammation, and AIDS pathogenesis. We report here the cloning and characterization of the m-BLTR, the signaling pathways for this G protein-coupled receptor, and a detailed analysis as to whether the h-BLTR can function as an HIV coreceptor. [α-32P]dCTP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products and [3H]LTB4 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The mouse strain 129 Sv genomic library in Lambda Fix II and the cloning vector pBluescript II KS were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 Uni was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). LTB4, 20-hydroxy-LTB4, 6-trans-12-epi LTB4, and LTD4 were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F-12, Opti-MEM, L-15, conditioned frog medium, phosphate-buffered saline, fetal bovine serum, and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc., and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase was obtained from Perkin-Elmer. A 1.1-kb fragment (NheI-PstI) from the cDNA, described in Ref.19Akbar G.K.M. Dasari V.R. Webb T.E. Ayyanathan K. Pillarisetti K. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Daniel J.L. Ashby B. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18363-18367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, was used as probe to screen the genomic mouse library by standard procedures. Putative positive clones were taken through two additional rounds of screening until plaque-purified. Phage DNA was purified and subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and Southern blot analysis. A 2.2- kb XbaI fragment that hybridized to the probe was gel extracted and inserted into theXbaI site of pBluescript II KS. The insert was sequenced entirely on both strands using automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems Big Dye Terminator, Ready Reaction Kit Reagents; ABI 373 sequencer) at the Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania. The open reading frame was amplified by PCR using primers CDF367 (5′-GCCATGGCTGCAAACACTACATCTC-3′) and CDF370 (5′-AGTTCACTTCGAAGACTCAGG-3′). The sequence of the amplified product was verified and cloned into pCR3.1 Uni. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12, respectively, containing 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at a density of 1–1.5 × 106cells/100-mm dish. Plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE were mixed with Opti-MEM and added for 12 h on cells, at 70–80% confluence for transient transfection or at 40–50% confluence to select stable transfected cell lines. Cells were selected 24 h after transfection with G418. Isolation of stable clones was achieved by serial dilution or pipette lifting colonies followed by trypsinization and replating colonies in medium containing 2 mg/ml G418. When single clones where isolated and passed several times, the G418 concentration was reduced gradually to 0.5 mg/ml. Experiments were performed on two cell lines transfected with pCR3.1-m-BLTR (HEK-m-BLTR and CHO-m-BLTR). Total RNA was prepared from different murine tissues using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA blot analysis was carried out with 15 μg of total RNA from different tissues. The full-length m-BLTR DNA was used as probe, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Blots were prehybridized 20 min at 68 °C in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) and hybridized at 68 °C for 1 h. The final washing conditions were 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA with random primers (for reverse transcriptase-PCR). PCR primers CDF370 and CDF367 were used to amplify m-BLTR cDNA. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium, harvested, and homogenized with a hand-held Polytron on ice in 5 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim)). The homogenate was centrifuged 5 min at 140 × g, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A to 2 mg/ml of protein for [3H]LTB4 binding experiments performed within several hours. To determine the specific binding on membrane fractions isolated from transiently transfected cells, cells were isolated 36–40 h after transfection. For cold competition experiments, HEK-m-BLTR cell membrane fractions (200 μg/ml of protein) were incubated with 0.1 nm[3H]LTB4 in 0.5 ml of 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm MgCl2 and various concentrations of either LTB4 (0.01–100 nm), 20-hydroxy-LTB4, 6-trans-12-epi LTB4, or LTD4 (0.1 nm-1 μm). For saturation experiments, stable transfected cell membranes (200 μg/ml of protein) were incubated with various concentrations of [3H]LTB4 (0.01–2.5 nm) in 0.25 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm LTB4. All samples, in duplicate, were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The total and nonspecific binding were determined as the amount of [3H]LTB4 bound to the membrane fractions in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm LTB4. Bound and free radioligand were separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters presoaked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mmHEPES. Confluent CHO-m-BLTR cells were harvested and washed with HEPES-buffered saline. Cells were then loaded with the fluorescent dye FURA-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 10 μm, washed and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline containing: 142 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm K2HPO4, 1.3 mm Ca2+, 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 250 μm sulfinpyrazone, the latter being added in order to reduce excretion of the dye (23Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steinberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Measurements of change in Ca2+ levels in stirred cell suspensions were made using a Perkin-Elmer model LS50B luminescence spectrometer and were expressed as ratios of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm in response to excitation at 340 and 380 nm (data sampling interval, 0.5 s). Calcium concentrations were calculated from these ratios after determining the maximum and minimum ratios of fluorescence in the presence and absence of saturating levels of Ca2+, respectively, according to the ratiometric method described previously (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Xenopus laevis melanophores were maintained in culture and used as described previously (25Graminski G.F. Jayawickreme C.K. Potenza M.N. Lerner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5957-5964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lerner M.R. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 142-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Potenza M.N.

Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, transient expression of pCR3.1-m-BLTR in melanophores was achieved by electroporation. Melanophores were plated (15,000/well) in 96-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 2 days. Before the addition of agonist, cells were washed, incubated with 0.7 × L-15, 0.1% bovine serum albumin as described (25Graminski G.F. Jayawickreme C.K. Potenza M.N. Lerner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5957-5964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then exposed to room light for 1 h. This exposure causes the cells to disperse their pigment granules and darken. The plates were incubated for 1 h in room light and base-line absorbance (A 0) reading obtained at 620 nm using a Molecular DevicesV max kinetic microtiter plate reader. The agonist LTB4 was added to the microtiter wells in 20-μl aliquots at 10 × their final concentration. Dose-response data were obtained 1 h later (A f). Data were plotted with y = 1 − (A f/A 0). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. CHO-m-BLTR were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well. 2 days later, the cultured medium was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of culture medium with 25 μm forskolin. After 15 min, different concentrations of LTB4 were added. The medium was removed 10 min after the addition of agonist, and the cAMP produced was extracted by adding 0.5 ml of ethanol to each well. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness, and the pellet was dissolved in Tris (0.05 m) EDTA (4 mm) buffer, pH = 7.5. The cAMP content was measured using a [3H]cAMP radioimmunoassay kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 5-Lipoxygenase-deficient mice (29Chen X.S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E.N. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and wild-type controls (five mice each) from our colony were injected intraperitoneally with glycogen and the neutrophils harvested 5 h later as described previously (29Chen X.S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E.N. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Binding was carried out on membranes as mentioned above. For cell-cell fusion assays, quail QT6 target cells were transfected with plasmids expressing CD4, the desired coreceptor, and luciferase under control of the T7 promoter. The h-BLTR, previously characterized as the P2Y7 receptor (gift from S. Kunapuli; Ref. 19Akbar G.K.M. Dasari V.R. Webb T.E. Ayyanathan K. Pillarisetti K. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Daniel J.L. Ashby B. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18363-18367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), was used for these studies (see “Results”). The next day, QT6 effector cells expressing the desired Env protein by transfection and T7 polymerase as a consequence of infection by recombinant vaccinia viruses were added. In this assay, cell-cell fusion results in cytoplasmic mixing and luciferase production, which can be easily quantified. Additional details can be found in previous papers (30Nussbaum O. Broder C.C. Berger E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5411-5422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rucker J. Doranz B.J. Edinger A.E. Long D. Berson J.F. Doms R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 288: 118-133PubMed Google Scholar). For infection assays, we used luciferase reporter viruses. Human 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the desired Env (in a pcDNA3 or psv7d background) and with the NL4–3 luciferase virus backbone (pNL-Luc-E−R−) (32Chen B.K. Saksela K. Andino R. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Virus was harvested from the media the next day and used to infect feline CCCS cells (for HXBch) or 293T cells (for all other Evs) expressing the indicated CD4/coreceptor combinations. Infection was quantified by measuring luciferase activity 3-days postinfection. Multiple analysis of variance tests followed by Bonferroni analysis were performed on cAMP data. *p< 0.05; ***p < 0.001. To clarify the confusion surrounding the molecular identity of the h-BLTR and to advance the study of the role of LTB4 in murine inflammation models, we sought to clone and characterize the m-BLTR. A mouse genomic library was screened using a 1.1-kb fragment from the cDNA identified previously as encoding the purinergic P2Y7 receptor (19Akbar G.K.M. Dasari V.R. Webb T.E. Ayyanathan K. Pillarisetti K. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Daniel J.L. Ashby B. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18363-18367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Among the positive clones that hybridized to the probe, one genomic clone with a 2.2-kb XbaI fragment was found to display an open reading frame of 1.056 kb, encoding a 351-amino acid receptor with seven putative transmembrane domains, two potential glycosylation sites, and several phosphorylation sites (GenBank accession numberAF077673). This open reading frame revealed a deduced amino acid sequence with 77% identity to the h-BLTR (3Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). The third intracellular loop of the m-BLTR showed 100% identity to the human receptor, with two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. TheN-glycosylation sites and several of the phosphorylation sites are conserved between both species. The putative promoter region (−1 to −618) contained a CAAT-like box, a 36-nucleotide poly(A) tract, and several other conserved sequences for the putative binding of GATA-1, PEA-3, c-Myc, c-Myb, Sp-1, and NF-IL6 transcription factors. While this manuscript was under review, Huang et al. (34Huang W.-W. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Sauty A. Oettgen H.C. Rothenberg M.E. Luster A.D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) published a m-BLTR sequence cloned from a murine eosinophil cDNA library that was identical to the m-BLTR gene cloned here. Because the genomic clone appeared to be intronless, we proceeded directly to expression studies. m-BLTR was subcloned in the expression vector pCR3.1 and used to transfect HEK 293 cells. Transient transfected HEK cells displayed specific binding for LTB4 (Fig.1 A), as did cells transfected with the original human P2Y7 receptor clone (not shown), whereas nontransfected (Ct) and mock transfected cells did not. Membrane fractions of HEK-m-BLTR cells showed a reversible, saturable and high affinity binding for LTB4 with aK d = 0.24 ± 0.03 nm andB max = 743 ± 168 fmol/mg of protein (Fig.1 B). Displacement curves of [3H]LTB4 binding indicated that the binding site was specific for LTB4 with a K i of 0.23 ± 0.05 nm (n = 4), followed by 20-hydroxy-LTB4, a metabolite of LTB4(K i = 1.1 ± 0.2 nm,n = 4), and by the nonenzymatic breakdown product of LTA4, 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4, and LTD4 (K i > 1 μm) (Fig.1 C). The tissue distribution of the m-BLTR was investigated by Northern blot analysis of total RNA using two different probes. No signal was detected in the tissues tested (spleen, lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, uterus, testis, heart, aorta, brain). However, using reverse transcriptase-PCR, the m-BLTR mRNA was detected in all tissues, but not aorta (data not shown). The mouse heart and lung cDNAs were sequenced and found to be identical with the positive clone identified by mouse genomic library screening. X. laevis melanophores provide a rapid, functional and visual readout of receptor activation. These cells disperse their pigment granules upon stimulation of receptors that are coupled to Gs, Go, and Gq and lead to accumulation of second messengers and thus appear dark. In contrast, stimulation of receptors that are coupled to Gi cause a decrease in second messenger levels and result in pigment granule aggregation, and the cells appear light (27Potenza M.N. Graminski G.F. Schmauss C. Lerner M.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1463-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A long term culture of melanophores was used to evaluate the functional activation of the m-BLTR. Stimulation of the receptor caused pigment aggregation in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC50 = 0.13 nm (Fig. 2) consistent with coupling to Gi. In CHO-m-BLTR cells, LTB4 inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the cAMP production induced by 25 μm forskolin (Fig.3 A). Maximum inhibition (58%) was obtained at 100 nm. With the same cell line, LTB4 induced a concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular calcium levels (EC50 = 4.4 nm; Fig.3 B). With 1 μm thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump, the intracellular increase of calcium induced by 100 nm LTB4 was inhibited by 89.5 ± 1.4% (n = 4). Previously, we (29Chen X.S. Sheller J.R. Johnson E.N. Funk C.D. Nature. 1994; 372: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and another group (35Goulet J.L. Snouwaert J.N. Latour A.M. Coffman T.M. Koller B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12852-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) developed mice with disruptions in the 5-lipoxygenase gene. These mice were unable to synthesize cysteinyl-leukotrienes or LTB4 in various inflammatory cell types. To test whether the absence of ligand influences receptor expression, we tested 5-lipoxygenase-deficient and control mice for alterations in LTB4 binding using membranes from glycogen-elicited neutrophils. Although we obtained specific and competitive binding in these membranes, the lack of ability to synthesize LTB4 in 5-lipoxygenase deficient mice did not substantially alter BLTR binding (Fig.4). Primate lentiviruses utilize CD4 and a coreceptor (most often the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4) to enter target cells (20Doms R.W. Peiper S.C. Virology. 1997; 235: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The importance of CCR5 as a HIV-1 coreceptor was demonstrated by the finding that individuals who lack CCR5 because of a naturally occurring polymorphism are highly resistant to HIV infection (36Samson M. Libert F. Doranz B.J. Rucker J. Liesnard C. Farber C.M. Saragosti S. Lapoumeroulie C. Cognaux J. Forceille C. Muyldermans G. Verhofstede C. Burtonboy G. Georges M. Imai T. Rana S. Yi Y. Smyth R.J. Collman R.G. Doms R.W. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Nature. 1996; 382: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). In addition to CCR5 and CXCR4, approximately one dozen other chemokine and related orphan receptors have been shown to function as coreceptors for more limited numbers of virus strains in vitro (37Hoffman T.L. Doms R.W. AIDS. 1998; 12: S17-S26PubMed Google Scholar). However, the in vivo relevance of these alternative coreceptors is uncertain. Recently, using a PCR-based entry assay, h-BLTR was shown to serve as a coreceptor for some X4 HIV-1 stains (22Owman C. Garzino-Demo A. Cocchi F. Popovic F. Sabirsh A. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of the BLTR to serve as a coreceptor for SIV and additional HIV-1 strains using a virus infection assay, we expressed CD4 and h-BLTR in human 293T or CCCS cells. The cells were then infected with luciferase reporter viruses bearing various HIV-1 and SIV Env proteins (Fig.5). None of the viral Env proteins tested could mediate infection of cells expressing CD4 and h-BLTR, although infection was readily observed when cells expressed either CCR5 or CXCR4 (depending on the virus strain).

The telomeres of linear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of yeastCandida parapsilosis consist of tandem arrays of large repetitive units possessing single-stranded 5′ extension of about 110 nucleotides. Recently we identified the first mitochondrial telomere-binding protein (mtTBP) that specifically binds a sequence derived from the extreme end of C. parapsilosis linear mtDNA and protects it from attack by various DNA-modifying enzymes (Tomás̆ka, L'., Nosek, J., and Fukuhara, H. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3049–3059). Here we report the isolation of MTP1, the gene encoding mtTBP of C. parapsilosis. Sequence analysis revealed that mtTBP shares homology with several bacterial and mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding proteins that nonspecifically bind to single-stranded DNA with high affinity. Recombinant mtTBP displays a preference for the telomeric 5′ overhang of C. parapsilosis mtDNA. The heterologous expression of a mtTBP-GFP fusion protein resulted in its localization to the mitochondria but was unable to functionally substitute for the loss of the S. cerevisiae homologue Rimlp.

Analysis of the MTP1 gene and its translation product mtTBP may provide an insight into the evolutionary origin of linear mitochondrial genomes and the role it plays in their replication and maintenance. Terminal structures (telomeres) of eukaryotic chromosomes and telomerases (specialized nucleoprotein enzymes that maintain the telomere length) are involved in several important cellular processes as senescence, immortalization, and carcinogenesis. Telomerase activation appears to be critical for cell immortalization and represents a promising target for cancer therapy. However, several studies have demonstrated that cells lacking functional telomerase utilize an alternative mechanism to elongate the chromosome ends, suggesting that some tumor cells may survive following treatment with telomerase inhibitors (1Autexier C. Greider C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore a more detailed understanding of both telomerase-dependent and -independent replication mechanisms is crucial for cancer therapy and the design of therapeutic agents capable of specifically blocking telomere replication. Furthermore, the study of various linear genophores might shed some light on alternative solutions to the end-replication problem. In contrast to the generally held belief that mitochondrial genomes are circular molecules, a large number of organisms contain linear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules possessing a homogeneous terminal structure. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial telomeres from various organisms revealed that they do not conform to a single consensus sequence or structural motif (2Nosek J. Tomás̆ka L'. Fukuhara H. Suyama Y. Kovác̆ L. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). According to their terminal structures, two types of linear mtDNA have been identified in yeasts. Linear mtDNA of the yeast species in closely related generaWilliopsis and Pichia terminates at both ends with an inverted terminal repeat possessing a covalently closed single-stranded hairpin loop resembling the structure of the vaccinia virus genome (3Fukuhara H. Sor F. Drissi R. Dinouël N. Miyakawa I. Rousset S. Viola A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2309-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Dinouël N. Drissi R. Miyakawa I. Sor F. Rousset S. Fukuhara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2315-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The terminal structures of type 2 linear mtDNA of a pathogenic yeast Candida parapsilosis are represented by inverted terminal repetitions consisting of tandem arrays of a 738-bp 1The abbreviations used are:bp, base pair(s); mtTBP, mitochondrial telomere-binding protein; SSB protein, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GFP, green fluorescence protein; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.-long repetitive unit. This structure remotely resembles the organization of telomeres of nuclear chromosomes, although their repetitive unit is considerably shorter (5–8 bp). The variable number of tandem units generates a population of mtDNA molecules of heterogeneous size where the shortest molecules containing only incomplete repetitive unit predominate. A more detailed analysis of C. parapsilosis mitochondrial telomeres revealed that mtDNA molecules terminate at a defined position within a repetitive unit, thus generating a 5′ single-stranded extension of about 110 nucleotides (5Nosek J. Dinouël N. Kovác̆ L. Fukuhara H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This unique telomeric structure has raised several important questions: (i) how the mitochondrial telomere is stabilized, (ii) how the 5′ single-stranded extension is generated, (iii) why DNA polymerase does not fill the protruding 5′ overhang, and (iv) how the shortest mtDNA molecules that do not possess a complete tandem unit restore the missing sequence. Several proteins that specifically bind either double-stranded or single-stranded DNA of telomeres of nuclear chromosomes have been identified. These proteins mediate telomere functions such as capping the ends of chromosomes, preventing nucleolytic degradation and end-to-end fusions, promoting the formation of telomere chromatin structure and nuclear architecture, participating in the replication and regulation of telomere length, etc. (6Fang G. Cech T.R. Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 69-105Google Scholar). To decipher the role of mitochondrial telomeres, we have initiated a search for proteins interacting with terminal sequence of linear mtDNA. Recently, we identified the first protein specifically recognizing the terminal structure of linear mtDNA from C. parapsilosis. Mitochondrial telomere-binding protein (mtTBP) is a heat- and protease-resistant protein that specifically recognizes the synthetic oligonucleotide identical to the terminal 51 nucleotides of the 5′ single-stranded overhang of C. parapsilosis mitochondrial telomere and protects it from various DNA modifying enzymes. Affinity-purified mtTBP exhibits a molecular mass of 15 kDa in its monomeric state under denaturing conditions but forms homo-oligomers under native conditions (7Tomás̆ka L'. Nosek J. Fukuhara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3049-3056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The properties of mtTBP suggested that it may play an important role in the stabilization and/or replication of linear mtDNA of C. parapsilosis. In this report we describe the isolation and characterization of a nuclear gene, MTP1, that encodes the mtTBP of the yeastC. parapsilosis. Surprisingly, the sequence analysis of mtTBP revealed a striking homology to a family of bacterial and mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) proteins. Although other members of the SSB protein family bind with high affinity to single-stranded DNA without apparent sequence specificity, mtTBP preferentially binds the terminal 5′ single-stranded overhang of the mitochondrial telomere. It has been proposed that the evolutionary appearance of linear mtDNA led to adaptation of the replication machinery to ensure complete replication of the linear genophore. In mitochondria of C. parapsilosis, such adaptation might have forced the conversion of a sequence-nonspecific mitochondrial SSB protein to a telomere binding factor. C. parapsilosis SR23 (CBS 7157) is a laboratory strain from the collection of the Department of Biochemistry (Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia). Escherichia coli DH5α (deoR, endA1, gyrA96, hsdR17 (r k− , m k+ ), recA1, relA1, supE44, thi-1, Δ(lac-argFV169), φ80δlacZΔM15, F−, λ−) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae S150–2B (MATa, leu2–3, 112, his3-Δ, trp1–289, ura3–52) strains were used in cloning experiments. S. cerevisiae strains αEVΔRIM1–8b (MATα, rim1::URA3, ade2–1, leu2–3, 112, his3–11, 15, trp1–1, ura3–1, can1–100, ρ 0) and aDBY754 × αEVRT-7b (MATa/MATα, RIM1/rim1::URA3, leu2/leu2, ura3/ura3, ρ +) were kindly provided by F. Foury (Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium). S. cerevisiae D22 strain (MATa, ade2, ω +) was used as a source for mitochondrial protein extracts. Mitochondrial protein extracts from C. parapsilosis and S. cerevisiaeD22 were prepared as described previously (7Tomás̆ka L'. Nosek J. Fukuhara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3049-3056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). mtTBP was purified using an affinity chromatography step (7Tomás̆ka L'. Nosek J. Fukuhara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3049-3056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), except that the protein was concentrated by binding to Fast Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted by 1 m NaCl, dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7, and stored in 100-μl aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by a method of Bradford (8Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). The sequence of three peptides (HAEIVQWGK, YSLAVNK, and LDKFEDP, respectively) was determined by the Harvard Microchem (Cambridge, MA). The sequences of oligonucleotides (synthesized by Genset, France) used in this study are shown in Table I. Oligonucleotide I was used for priming the synthesis of cDNA on C. parapsilosis total RNA template using the First-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer instructions. The sequence of peptide HAEIVQWGK was used to designMTP1-specific degenerate oligonucleotide II. The PCR reaction for amplification of the 3′ end of MTP1 cDNA contained 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (at 25 °C), 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, single-stranded cDNA prepared as described above as the template and 1 μm oligonucleotide I and 5 μmoligonucleotide II as the upstream and downstream primer, respectively. Amplification was performed in DNA Thermal Cycler 480 (Perkin-Elmer) with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and final polymerization at 72 °C for 5 min. The 125-bp PCR product was gel-purified and sequenced. The DNA sequence upstream of the stop codon of putative open reading frame was used to design downstreamMTP1-specific primer (oligonucleotide III). The 5′ end ofMTP1 was amplified using linker-ligation-mediated PCR strategy (9Garrity P.A. Wold B. Mueller P.R. McPherson M.J. Hames B.D. Taylor G.R. PCR 2 : A Practical Approach.

Briefly, total genomic DNA of C. parapsilosiswas digested with AvaII endonuclease, denatured, annealed with MTP1 specific downstream primer, then extended with Vent(exo−) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), followed by ligation of the primer extension products with a synthetic linker. The MTP1 sequence was then PCR-amplified usingMTP1-specific downstream (oligonucleotide III) and 25-nucleotide-linker primers. The DNA sequence analysis of 600-bp PCR product revealed a putative 399-bp open reading frame containing the sequences corresponding to three known peptides. The integrity ofMTP1 gene was confirmed by sequencing of several independent PCR products obtained using MTP1 oligonucleotides IV and V on C. parapsilosis genomic DNA and cDNA as the template, respectively.Table IThe sequences of synthetic oligonucleotidesOligonucleotideI5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTV-3′II5′-CAYGCIGARATHGTNCARTGGGGNAA-3′III5′-TTCTGTAGCTTCGGCTCTATCCTCA-3′IV5′-CAGATTTTATGTAACAACCCACG-3′V5′-GACATAGAAATATATTATACCAATAC-3′Linker5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′3′CTAGACTTAAG-5′TEL315′-TAGGGATTGATTATTTACCTATATATTATCA-3′OLI315′-TAAAAATAGAGAGAAATGTATATATTTTACC-3′ Open table in a new tab The plasmid pGFP-C-FUS-mtTBP containing the whole MTP1 open reading frame (lacking stop codon) fused with green fluorescent protein was prepared by ligation of PCR product amplified using 5′-ATGTTGCGAGCATTCACTAGATCA-3′ and 5′-TTCTGTAGCTTCGGCTCTATCCTCA-3′ primers into SmaI-digested pGFP-C-FUS vector (10, provided by J. H. Hegemann, Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany). The expression of fusion protein in this construct is driven by S. cerevisiae MET25 promoter. The plasmid YEplac181-PMET-mtTBP-tCYC1 was constructed as follows. First, the plasmid pGFP-C-FUS was digested withSalI to remove green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequences. The termini were filled with a Klenow enzyme and then ligated with theMTP1 PCR product amplified using 5′-ATGTTGCGAGCATTCACTAGATCA-3′ and oligonucleotide V (Table I) primers. Subsequently, the KpnI-SacI restriction fragment containing a cassette MET25 promoter, MTP1 open reading frame, CYC1 terminator was blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase and then ligated into SmaI site of YEplac181 vector (11Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). pGEX-2T-mTBP designed for production of recombinant mtTBP in E. coli was constructed by insertion of Sau3A fragment of MTP1 gene into the BamHI site of pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). TheMTP1 sequence in the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant mtTBP was purified according to the instructions of the supplier of the expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Briefly, 20 ml of an overnight bacterial culture was inoculated into 1 liter of Superbroth media (3.2% tryptone (Difco), 2% yeast extract (Difco), 0.5% NaCl) and grown at 37 °C to a final A 600 = 0.7. The culture was then induced for 3 h at 30 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma). Cells were washed once with ice-cold double-distilled water, resuspended in 20 ml of buffer G (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Boehringer Mannheim), sonicated, and centrifuged at 25,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was mixed with 0.3 ml of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) prewashed with buffer G and incubated for 60 min on ice with occasional mixing. Beads were loaded onto a 5-ml column, washed with 100 ml of buffer G (without protease inhibitor mixture) followed by 50 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4). The washed beads were resuspended in 0.45 ml of PBS containing thrombin (0.05 units/μl, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The cleaved mtTBP was eluted in 3 × 0.5 ml of PBS and stored at −70 °C. Rabbit polyclonal antisera was raised against 100 μg of purified recombinant thrombin-cleaved mtTBP and purified by Protein A-Sepharose (Eurogentec, Belgium). C. parapsilosis SR23 was grown until the late logarithmic phase in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone) supplemented with glucose (2% w/v), glycerol (3% w/v), or galactose (2% w/v), and cells (0.1 ml of the culture) were lysed as described by Horváth and Riezman (12Horváth A. Riezman H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by a method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters in the transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3) using a semidry electroblotter system (Owl Scientific) for 45 min at 250 mA. Filters were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with blocking solution (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% (w/v) skim milk (Difco)) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the blocking solution containing anti-mtTBP antibody (1:200). Membranes were washed four times with rinsing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), one time with rinsing buffer without Tween 20, and then incubated with blocking solution containing goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma, 1:3,000) for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were washed as described above and developed by incubating with 0.3 mg/ml p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Sigma) and 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate toluidine salt (Sigma) in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8) for 5–20 min at room temperature. Purified mitochondrial DNA (3 μg) from C. parapsilosis was digested with BglII (30 units) in a final volume of 250 μl, followed by heat-inactivation of the restriction enzyme by incubation of the sample for 10 min at 65 °C. Digested mtDNA (100 μl) was mixed with 5 μg of recombinant mtTBP in a final volume of 250 μl of the DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To immunoprecipitate mtTBP-DNA complexes, the binding reaction was combined with 50 μl of anti-mtTBP antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were immobilized by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) for an additional 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 5 s in a microcentrifuge at maximal speed, and the supernatant was removed and placed on ice. The pellet was washed 5 times with 1 ml of PBS containing 200 mm NaCl. The immunoprecipitated complexes were separated from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 300 μl of PBS containing 0.1% SDS. This step was repeated two more times, and the resulting fractions were saved as eluates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled using [γ32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and separated from nonincorporated nucleotides by chromatography on a BioSpin-6 column (Bio-Rad). 10 ng of purified recombinant mtTBP was incubated with 1 ng of labeled oligonucleotide in 10 μl of DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl) containing 1 mg/ml poly(dI:dC) for 10 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (4.5 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 10 V/cm for 90 min. Gels were dried under vacuum at 80 °C and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −70 °C between intensifying screens. 1 μg of recombinant mtTBP was incubated with various concentrations of glutaraldehyde in 10 μl of PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by heating the samples in 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by a method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207523) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and mtTBP was detected by immunoblot analysis as described above. Alternatively, cAMP-dependent protein kinase assays were performed as described previously (14Resnick R.J. Racker E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2474-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Tomás̆ka L'. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of recombinant mtTBP, 50 ng of the purified catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (kindly provided by E. Fisher, Seattle, WA), and 250 μm [γ32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol) and were incubated for 240 min at 30 °C. After the phosphorylation of mtTBP, glutaraldehyde and bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate were added to the corresponding samples to final concentrations indicated in legend to Fig. 4. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by a method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207523) Google Scholar). Gels were heat-dried under vacuum and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −70 °C between intensifying screens. DNA samples were prepared as described previously (16Nosek J. Fukuhara H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5622-5630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were lysed in agarose blocks by sequential treatment with zymolyase and proteinase K. Samples were electrophoretically separated in a 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) buffer in a Pulsaphor apparatus (LKB) in contour-clamped homogeneous electric field configuration. Pulse switching involved three steps of linear interpolation as follows: (i) 10 to 200 s for 48 h, (ii) 200 to 400 s for 16 h, (iii) 400 to 600 s for 48 h, at 100 V and 9 °C throughout. C. parapsilosisgenomic DNA was isolated using a protocol described for S. cerevisiae (17Phillippsen P. Stotz A. Scherf C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs and used according to manufacturer instructions. Southern and Northern blotting, DNA hybridization, DNA cloning, and sequencing were performed essentially as described in Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Intact cells of S. cerevisiae were transformed by standard lithium acetate/ssDNA/polyethylene glycol protocol (19Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Previously we reported the purification of a 15-kDa protein designated mtTBP that selectively bound to an affinity matrix containing the terminal 51 nucleotides of the 5′ overhang of mitochondrial telomere from C. parapsilosis (7Tomás̆ka L'. Nosek J. Fukuhara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3049-3056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of three peptides were determined (HAEIVQWGK, YSLAVNK, and LDKFEDP), and the corresponding DNA sequence of the peptide HAEIVQWGK was used to design a degenerated oligonucleotide primer for polymerase chain reaction. The entire coding sequence of mtTBP was isolated using two strategies: (i) amplification of the 3′ end of the cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR followed by (ii) amplification of the 5′ end by a linker ligation-mediated PCR approach. The full-length PCR product was obtained, and its DNA sequence was verified by hybridization to total genomic DNA digested with several restriction enzymes (data not shown). The sequences of several PCR products were determined, and the computer sequence analysis identified a 399-bp open reading frame containing regions corresponding to all three peptides (Fig.1 A). The gene coding for mtTBP was assigned MTP1 (mitochondrialtelomere protein 1). A GenBank™ data base search revealed that mtTBP displays significant homology to a family of bacterial and mitochondrial SSB proteins. Its amino acid sequence exhibits 33.8% identity and 62.4% homology to the mitochondrial SSB protein encoded by the S. cerevisiaenuclear gene RIM1 (Fig. 1 B). Although theRIM1 gene contains an intron, we were unable to detect any intervening sequences in the C. parapsilosis gene when we compared the sequence of MTP1 PCR products amplified from both a cDNA and genomic DNA template. To rule out the possibility that MTP1 is encoded by the mitochondrial genome, we examined restriction enzyme-digested mtDNA and pulsed field gel electrophoresis-separated C. parapsilosischromosomes, respectively, by Southern blot analysis. Results indicated that MTP1 is localized on the 2.2 Mbp chromosome, thereby confirming its nuclear localization (Fig.2). In addition, the sequence analysis predicted putative mitochondrial import signal at the N terminus of deduced MTP1 protein product. To determine whether C. parapsilosis does not contain homologous sequences that might encode additional mitochondrial SSB protein(s), we performed the Southern hybridization of restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA withMTP1 probe at both high and low stringency conditions. The results revealed that MTP1 represents a single copy gene (data not shown). To study mtTBP in vitro,we used an E. coli expression system to produce sufficient quantities of recombinant protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using the pGEX-2T vector, mtTBP lacking the first seven amino acid residues was fused to glutathione S-transferase containing a thrombin cleavage site. Treatment with protease releases a soluble mtTBP protein containing one additional glycine residue at its N terminus. To assess the specificity of the recombinant mtTBP for the telomeric sequence, an oligonucleotide identical to the terminal 31 nucleotides (TEL31) from the 5′ end of mitochondrial telomere was used as a probe in a gel-retardation assay (Fig.3). Mixing of TEL31 with purified recombinant mtTBP resulted in a DNA-protein complex that migrated slower than the free probe alone (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and2). A 3- to 300-fold molar excess of unlabeled TEL31 quantitatively competed with the labeled probe for complex formation (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5). In contrast, oligonucleotide OLI31 (see Table I) derived from another part of C. parapsilosis mtDNA did not compete with labeled TEL31 as effectively as homologous competitor under identical conditions (Fig. 3, lanes 6–8). These data demonstrate that the preference of recombinant mtTBP for the telomeric sequence parallels the behavior of the natural mtTBP isolated from C. parapsilosis mitochondria (7Tomás̆ka L'. Nosek J. Fukuhara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3049-3056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recombinant mtTBP was used to raise the rabbit polyclonal antisera, which ultimately recognized a single 15-kDa protein under denaturing conditions in cell extracts prepared from C. parapsilosis. No similar size protein has been detected in several other yeast species from various genera including Candida,Williopsis, Pichia, Saccharomyces, andKluyveromyces. It was shown previously that mtTBP forms homo-oligomeric complexes in its native state. Using two chemical cross-linkers, glutaraldehyde andbis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, we now demonstrate that recombinant mtTBP also undergoes homo-oligomerization in vitro. Dimers were the predominant oligomeric form in the presence of either cross-linker (Fig. 4). To compare the DNA binding properties of mtTBP with a homologous protein from a yeast with circular mitochondrial DNA, we performed a gel retardation experiment using mitochondrial protein extracts fromC. parapsilosis and S. cerevisiae, respectively. Both extracts contained ssDNA binding activity. It was shown previously that the factor responsible for the ssDNA-protein complex formation is mtTBP in C. parapsilosis (7Tomás̆ka L'. Nosek J. Fukuhara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3049-3056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Rim1p in S. cerevisiae (20Van Dyck E. Foury F. Stillman B. Brill S.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), respectively. However, in contrast to C. parapsilosis, 300-fold excess of OLI31 competed quantitatively with the labeled TEL31 probe for complex formation in mitochondrial lysates of S. cerevisiae (Fig.5). This suggests that, in addition to general ssDNA binding activity, mtTBP gained a preference for a telomeric sequence. Next we tested whether mtTBP was capable of binding natural mitochondrial telomeres in a reconstitution experiment. (Fig.6). Recombinant mtTBP was incubated withBglII-digested mtDNA of C. parapsilosis, and the DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-mtTBP and Protein A-Sepharose. DNA-mtTBP complexes were eluted from the beads, and the fractions were examined by Southern blot analysis following hybridization to either a specific 738-bp EcoRI fragment representing the telomere repeat unit or to a control 2.9-kilobaseBglII fragment derived from an internal region of mtDNA. The results shown in Fig. 6 demonstrate that anti-mtTBP antiserum immunoprecipitated mtTBP complexed to terminal mtDNA fragments, producing a ladder pattern typical of telomeric DNA (5Nosek J.

Recent studies indicate that activation of JNK is necessary for induction of apoptosis in response to diverse agents. Here we demonstrate that methylmethane sulfonate (MMS)-induced activation of JNK is inhibited by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, but not by caspase inhibitors CrmA and p35. By contrast, UV-induced JNK activity is insensitive to Bcl-xL. The results demonstrate that treatment with MMS is associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK)/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), an upstream effector of JNK and that this phosphorylation is inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-xL. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of RAFTK (RAFTK K-M) inhibits MMS-induced JNK activation. The results indicate that inhibition of RAFTK phosphorylation by MMS in Bcl-xL cells is attributed to an increase in tyrosine phosphatase activity in these cells. Hence, treatment of Bcl-xL cells with sodium vanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, restores MMS-induced activation of RAFTK and JNK. These findings indicate that RAFTK-dependent induction of JNK in response to MMS is sensitive to Bcl-xL, but not to CrmA and p35, by a mechanism that inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation and thereby activation of RAFTK. Taken together, these findings support a novel role for Bcl-xL that is independent of the caspase cascade.

Methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) is a monofunctional alkylating agent and is a potent inducer of cellular stress leading to chromosomal aberrations, point mutations, and cell killing (12Beranek D.T.

Previous studies have shown that reactivity of MMS with the ring nitrogens of the purine bases, particularly N-7 of guanine, correlates with induction of cell killing (12Beranek D.T. Weis C.C. Swenson D.H. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that treatment of a variety of cell types with MMS is associated with induction of JNK and p38 MAPK (15Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but the signaling mechanisms involved in this response are unclear. The stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) (also known as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)) is induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), anisomycin, and interleukin-1 (16Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H.

Other studies have shown that JNK is activated by immediate upstream kinases such as SEK-1/MKK4 and/or MKK7 (27Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

The finding that certain DNA damaging agents, but not TNF, induce JNK by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism has also supported distinct upstream effectors to JNK activation (20Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T. Feller S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 22Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Shafman T. Emoto Y. Taneja N. Rubin E. Weichselbaum R.

Accordingly, JNK has been implicated as a potential mediator of the apoptotic pathway in response to IR, TNF, certain other inducers (30Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yhao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar). By contrast, other studies have shown that TNF-induced apoptosis is independent of JNK activation (32Liu Z.G. Hsu H.L. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of JNK in mediating apoptosis may be inducer- and cell type-specific. Activation of the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) has been shown to be upstream to JNK in the response to TNF or UV in certain cell types (33Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RAFTK (also known as PYK2 and Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK)) is involved in signaling upstream to the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (34Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). RAFTK is a close relative of the pp125 FAK tyrosine kinase and is activated by various extracellular signals that increase intracellular calcium concentrations (34Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R.

Moreover, RAFTK can tyrosine phosphorylate and thereby modulate the action of ion channels. Thus, RAFTK may function as an intermediate that links various calcium signals with both short and long term responses in neuronal cells (34Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E.

In this study, we demonstrate that MMS-induced activation of JNK in U-937 cells is blocked by overexpressing Bcl-xL and not CrmA or p35.

Lysates were incubated with anti-RAFTK antibody (43Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L.M. White R.A. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol.

The immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-RAFTK antibodies. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with vector or Flag-RAFTK (K-M) with pEBG-SAPK using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, cells were treated with MMS, and total cell lysates were subjected to incubation with GST protein adsorbed on GSH beads. The protein precipitates were analyzed by GST-Jun immune complex kinase assays as described above. Total cell lysates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GST-SAPK. U-937 or U-937/Bcl-xL cells were treated with 200 μmSV and harvested after 3 h. Cells were lysed in phosphate-free 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer using a sonicator. The PTPase activity in whole cell lysate was measured by a nonradioactive photometric enzyme immunoassay kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The reactions were performed directly in the wells of a microtiter plate with biotin-labeled synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide substrate (100 mm) bound to the streptavidin matrix. Following the addition of vanadate (500 μm) to quench the reactions, the fractions of unmetabolized substrate in the reactions were determined immunochemically using peroxidase conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The development of color was monitored at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader. To determine the involvement of Bcl-xL in MMS- and UV-induced apoptosis, we assessed cleavage of the 116-kDa PARP protein to an 85-kDa fragment in response to these agents. As expected, MMS-treatment of U-937 cells resulted in PARP cleavage (Fig.1 A). Similar findings were obtained when U-937 cells were treated with UV, and there was no detectable cleavage of PARP when U-937/Bcl-xL cells were treated with MMS or UV (Fig. 1 A). Previous studies have shown that PKCδ undergoes caspase-3-mediated proteolytic cleavage in an apoptotic pathway induced in response to diverse forms of stress (7Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G.

To further determine the activation of caspase-3 by MMS or UV, cell lysates from MMS- or UV-treated U-937 and U-937/Bcl-xLcells were analyzed by immunoblotting with PKCδ. Similar to PARP cleavage, the results demonstrate that MMS or UV-treatment of U-937 cells results in PKCδ cleavage (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, there was no detectable cleavage of PKCδ when U-937/Bcl-xLcells were treated with MMS or UV (Fig. 1 B). We also compared the proliferation of U-937 and U-937/Bcl-xL cells in the presence of varying concentrations of MMS. At lower MMS concentrations (25–50 μm), there was little if any effect of MMS on proliferation of either cell type. At higher concentrations of MMS (1 mm), in contrast to U-937/Bcl-xL, approximately 50% of U-937 cells were dead (based on trypan blue exclusion) by 12–16 h. Moreover, more than 75% U-937 cells were dead when treated with 1 mm MMS for 24–36 h. These findings indicate that overexpression of Bcl-xL significantly blocks MMS-induced cell death. Moreover, overexpression of Bcl-xL also blocked MMS- and UV-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis (data not shown). Taken together, these findings indicated that overexpression of Bcl-xL is associated with inhibition of apoptosis in the response to MMS and UV. Whereas JNK activation has been associated with induction of apoptosis, we assayed anti-JNK immunoprecipitates for phosphorylation of GST-Jun. The results demonstrate increased JNK activity and no change in JNK protein levels in wild type cells treated with MMS or UV (Fig. 1, C andD, and data not shown). Importantly, MMS-induced JNK activity was completely inhibited in cells overexpressing Bcl-xL (Fig. 1 C). By contrast, Bcl-xL had no detectable effect on UV-induced JNK activity (Fig. 1 D). To rule out a clonal effect, three additional, independently selected clones of U-937/Bcl-xL cells (clones 2, 9, and 10) that express high levels of this protein (data not shown) were treated with MMS. Analysis of anti-JNK immunoprecipitates from these clones also demonstrated inhibition of JNK activation by Bcl-xL (Fig. 1 E). Thus, whereas both MMS- and UV-induced apoptosis is inhibited in U-937/Bcl-xL cells, only MMS-induced JNK activity is blocked by Bcl-xL. These findings suggest that Bcl-xL functions upstream to the activation of JNK by MMS, but not UV. Previous studies have shown that Bcl-xL functions upstream to activation of caspase 3 (7Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 44Ghayur T.

Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Because MMS- and UV-induced PARP cleavage is inhibited in U-937/Bcl-xL cells, we asked whether this event is also sensitive to CrmA or p35. There was no detectable cleavage of PARP in MMS-treated U-937/CrmA or U-937/p35 cells (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained when cell lysates were analyzed for cleavage of PKCδ (data not shown). However, the finding that p35, but not CrmA, blocks UV-induced cleavage of PARP (Fig. 2 B) indicated that UV and MMS activate caspases by different mechanisms. Analysis of U-937/CrmA and U-937/p35 cells for MMS- or UV-induced JNK activity demonstrated that, in contrast to Bcl-xL, overexpression of CrmA or p35 in U-937 cells has no detectable effect on activation of JNK in response to these agents (Fig. 2 C). The inhibition of JNK by MMS in U-937/Bcl-xL, but not in U-937/CrmA or U-937/p35 cells, suggested that activation of JNK by MMS is upstream to caspase activation. To further assess this issue, U-937 cells treated with MMS for various times were analyzed for activation of JNK and cleavage of procaspase-3. The results demonstrate that whereas JNK is activated by MMS at 1 h, cleavage of procaspase-3 is detected only after 4–6 h (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these findings indicate that in U-937 cells treated with MMS, Bcl-xLfunctions upstream of JNK activation by a mechanism either upstream from or independent of caspase inhibition. In this context, previous studies have shown that caspases act both upstream and downstream to JNK activation depending upon cell type and inducer (45Cahill M. Peter M. Kischkel F. Chinnaiyan A.

Previous studies have shown that activation of JNK by TNF, MMS, or UV is induced by c-Abl-independent mechanisms (20Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T. Feller S. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D.

In this context, other studies have shown that the RAFTK tyrosine kinase plays a key role as an upstream regulator of the JNK pathway in response to UV in PC12 cells (33Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RAFTK is activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine (33Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Treatment of U-937 cells with MMS, but not UV, resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK (Fig.3 A). There was also no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK following treatment with agents, such as cis-platinum and IR, that activate c-Abl (data not shown). Whereas Bcl-xL blocks MMS-induced JNK activation and MMS induces tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK, we asked whether Bcl-xL functions upstream to RAFTK. The results demonstrate that Bcl-xL blocks MMS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, inhibition of caspases by overexpressing CrmA or p35 had no effect on RAFTK tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). RAFTK is also expressed in PC12 neuroblastoma cells (34Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Llowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 43Avraham S. London R. Fu Y.

To determine the role of RAFTK in MMS-induced activation of JNK in PC12 cells, total lysates from control and MMS-treated PC12 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RAFTK, and the protein precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). The results demonstrate that, similar to U-937 cells, treatment of PC12 cells with MMS is associated with increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, JNK activation is also increased in response to MMS in these cells (Fig.4 B). To further confirm a direct role for RAFTK in MMS-induced activation of JNK, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with a dominant negative mutant of RAFTK (RAFTK K-M), treated with MMS, and assayed for activation of JNK. As a control, PC12 cells expressing the empty vector were also treated with MMS. The results demonstrate that treatment of PC12 cells expressing RAFTK K-M mutant, but not the empty vector, with MMS is associated with a significant inhibition of JNK activity (Fig. 4 C). Other studies have shown that the protein-tyrosine kinase c-Src functions upstream to JNK in response to MMS (48Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Because c-Src is activated by a RAFTK-dependent mechanism (35Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), these results together indicate that RAFTK acts as an upstream activator of the JNK signaling pathway in the cellular response to MMS.Figure 4RAFTK-dependent activation of JNK by MMS.

Previous studies have shown that treatment of certain cell types with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, SV, is associated with the regulation of apoptosis (49Yang C. Chang J. Gorospe M. Passaniti A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 161-171PubMed Google Scholar, 50Yousefi S. Green D.R. Blaser K. Simon H.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because the results of the present study demonstrate that overexpression of Bcl-xL inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK, we sought to determine whether a tyrosine phosphatase is involved in this regulation. To compare the overall tyrosine phosphatase activity in U-937 and U-937/Bcl-xLcells, we measured the background tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in these cell types and total tyrosine phosphatase activity. U-937 and U-937/Bcl-xL cells treated with SV were also assayed for total tyrosine phosphatase activity. The results demonstrate that overexpression of Bcl-xL in U-937 cells is associated with an increase (approximately 3–4-fold) in total tyrosine phosphatase activity, and as expected, treatment with SV inhibited this activity to basal levels (Fig. 5 A). In concert with the increase in phosphatase activity, background tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in U-937/Bcl-xL cells is significantly lower than that in U-937 cells (Fig. 5 B). To determine the role of a tyrosine phosphatase in the regulation of RAFTK activity by MMS, cells were treated with SV with or without MMS, and anti-RAFTK immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P). The results demonstrate that treatment with SV increases MMS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in U-937 cells (Fig.5 C). Importantly, treatment of U-937/Bcl-xLcells with SV restores tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in response to MMS (Fig. 5 D). Taken together, these findings indicate that MMS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of RAFTK is regulated by a tyrosine phosphatase in U-937 cells. The 4-fold higher basal activity of tyrosine phosphatases in U-937/Bcl-xLcells contributes to inhibition of MMS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. To determine whether treatment of cells with SV affects MMS-induced JNK activity, U-937 and U-937/Bcl-xL cells were treated with SV with or without MMS, and anti-JNK immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immune complex JNK kinase assays. The results demonstrate that treatment with SV significantly increases MMS-induced JNK activity in U-937 cells (Fig. 6 A). More importantly, treatment of U-937/Bcl-xL cells with SV restored JNK activation in response to MMS (Fig. 6 B). In this context, a recent study has suggested that activation of JNK by MMS and UV is mediated by distinct upstream modulators and that the MMS-response may be regulated by a tyrosine phosphatase (15Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of RAFTK by MMS is regulated by a tyrosine phosphatase and functions upstream to the activation of caspases. Taken together, the findings of our study indicate that MMS induces tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK and contributes directly to the activation of JNK. To determine whether inhibition of phosphatase activity by SV also affects MMS-induced cell death, U-937 and U-937/Bcl-xLcells were treated with SV with or without MMS, and cell death was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The results demonstrate that treatment with SV increases MMS-induced cell death in U-937 cells (not shown). More importantly, SV treatment of U-937/Bcl-xLcells, which are resistant to MMS, was associated with approximately a 30% increase in cell death in response to MMS (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of phosphatase activity by SV potentiates cell death in response to MMS. Control of apoptosis and progression of cell cycle are closely linked processes, acting to preserve homeostasis and developmental morphogenesis. Proteins that regulate apoptosis, such as Bcl-2, have also been implicated in control of the cell (51Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2912-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this context, previous studies have shown that the hypoxia-induced genes involved in cell cycle regulation are p53, p21, and Bcl-2(51Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M. Neeman M. Bono F. Abramovitch R. Maxwell P. Koch C.J. Ratcliffe P. Moons L. Jain R.K. Collen D. Keshet E. Nature. 1998; 394: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that overexpression of Bcl-2 in breast cancer cells is associated with prolongation of the cell cycle, particularly at the G1/S boundary (54Knowlton K. Mancini M. Creason S. Morales C. Hockenbery D. Anderson B.O. J. Surg. Res. 1998; 76: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By contrast, overexpression of Bcl-xL in U-937 cells is associated with more rapid growth kinetics as compared with parent cells. Thus, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL may function differently in control of cell cycle progression. Nevertheless, the role of Bcl-xL in regulating the cell cycle, which is different from its anti-apoptotic function, could contribute the levels and/or activation of phosphatases observed in these cells. CrmA is a member of the serpin family that inhibits ICE by forming an active site-directed complex (10Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). CrmA expression blocks apoptosis induced by TNF or activation of Fas (55Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that p35 inhibits the proteolytic activity of Ced-3, ICE, CPP32, Ich-1, and Ich-2 but not granzyme B (11Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. Licari P. Mankovich J. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Miller L.K. Wong W.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that in contrast to UV, MMS-induced cleavage of PARP, PKCδ, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is blocked by overexpression of CrmA (Fig. 2 and data not shown). These findings suggest that MMS induces apoptosis by a mechanism that is distinct, at least in part, from that induced by UV. Recent work has shown that whereas induction of apoptosis by TNF and Fas is sensitive to CrmA, DNA damage-induced apoptosis is dependent on activation of caspases that are CrmA insensitive (56Datta R. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20317-20320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, a CrmA-sensitive caspase is necessary for induction of apoptosis by only certain stress inducers that include TNF, Fas, and MMS. The activation of a CrmA-sensitive or -insensitive caspase appears nonetheless to be independent of JNK activation, because neither CrmA nor p35 affects the induction of this kinase by diverse classes of inducers. Other studies have shown that a caspase-mediated cleavage of MEKK-1, a kinase that acts upstream to activation of JNK (57Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), is necessary for anoikis (46Frisch S. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J.

Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The present findings demonstrate that MMS, but not UV, induces JNK activity in U-937 cells by a RAFTK-dependent mechanism. Previous work has shown that whereas IR-, cis-platinum- and ara-C-induced activation of JNK is c-Abl-dependent, MMS and UV induce JNK by c-Abl-independent mechanisms (16Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 18Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The present finding that MMS-induced, but not UV-induced, JNK involves activation of RAFTK provides further support for distinct signaling pathways in the responses to diverse stress causing agents. We also show that Bcl-xL blocks MMS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK and activation of JNK. The effects of Bcl-xL on a RAFTK → JNK pathway are selective for MMS-induced signals because Bcl-xL had no effect on UV-induced JNK activity. MMS is a monofunctional alkylating agent that alkylates DNA and damages membrane proteins (14Smith G.J. Grisham G.W. Fatteh M.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 488-492PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the UV response is initiated in the cytoplasm by a Ha-Ras-dependent mechanism (16Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 59Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Thus, sensitivity of JNK activation to Bcl-xL could be dependent on subcellular localization of the stress signal and whether RAFTK is involved as an upstream effectors. Although Bcl-xL blocks activation of caspases, the effects of Bcl-xL on the RAFTK → JNK pathway are independent of p35 expression and thereby caspase activity. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of RAFTK is associated with induction of apoptosis in 293 cells (60Xiong W.C. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, the finding that inhibition of JNK significantly blocks ionizing radiation- or TNF-induced apoptosis has supported a direct role for JNK in apoptosis (30Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yhao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). The present findings demonstrate that in contrast to CrmA or p35, Bcl-xL blocks MMS-induced activation of RAFTK, JNK, and induction of apoptosis. Thus, the RAFTK → JNK pathway is upstream to caspase activation in the cascade of MMS-induced apoptosis. We thank Drs.

Here we have studied AR and EGF mitogenic signaling in EGFR-devoid NR6 fibroblasts that ectopically express either wild type EGFR (WT) or a truncated EGFR that lacks the three major sites of autophosphorylation (c′1000). COOH-terminal truncation of the EGFR significantly impairs the ability of AR to (i) stimulate DNA synthesis, (ii) elicit Elk-1 transactivation, and (iii) generate sustained enzymatic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. EGFR truncation had no significant effect on AR binding to receptor but did result in defective GRB2 adaptor function. In contrast, EGFR truncation did not impair EGF mitogenic signaling, and in c′1000 cells EGF was able to stimulate the association of ErbB2 with GRB2 and SHC. Elk-1 transactivation was monitored when either ErbB2 or a truncated dominant-negative ErbB2 mutant (ErbB2-(1–813)) was overexpressed in cells. Overexpression of full-length ErbB2 resulted in a strong constitutive transactivation of Elk-1 in c′1000 but only slightly stimulated Elk-1 in WT or parental NR6 cells. Conversely, overexpression of ErbB2-(1–813) inhibited EGF-stimulated Elk-1 transactivation in c′1000 but not in WT cells. Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR plays a critical role in AR mitogenic signaling but is dispensable for EGF, since EGF-activated truncated EGFRs can signal through ErbB2.

Thus, the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR plays a critical role in AR mitogenic signaling but is dispensable for EGF, since EGF-activated truncated EGFRs can signal through ErbB2.

The EGFR is an 1186-amino acid residue protein that consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and a COOH-terminal region that contains autophosphorylation sites at tyrosines 992, 1068, 1086, 1148, and 1173 (1Ullrich A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal tail of the EGFR is believed to regulate access of substrates to the catalytic domain and, when phosphorylated, to provide docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins (37Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar, 38Carpenter G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3283-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, several studies have shown that this EGFR region is not required for EGF-stimulated mitogenesis or transformation (39Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). With the exception of EGF, little is currently known regarding the structural requirements within the EGFR that are critical to signaling by the various EGFR ligands. Previous work has demonstrated a requirement for EGFR kinase activity but not for COOH-terminal autophosphorylation sites in ligand-stimulated activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1, 3, and 5 by either AR or EGF, and no significant differences were observed between the ligands (45David M.

In contrast to those findings we report here that the COOH-terminal region of the EGFR is critical for AR-induced mitogenic signaling, whereas it appears to be expendable for EGF-mediated mitogenesis. The purpose of this work was to identify the molecular basis for this difference. The results revealed that this differential requirement for the cytoplasmic tail of the EGFR in AR and EGF mitogenic signaling can be attributed to ErbB2. Either human wild type (WT) or truncated EGFR corresponding to the amino-terminal 1000 residues (c′1000) was expressed in EGFR-devoid NR6 fibroblasts (46Pruss R.M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These polyclonal cell lines have been shown to express comparable levels of EGFR and bind EGF with very similar affinities (40Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J.

Antibodies to the EGFR (Ab-5) and ErbB2 (c-neu, Ab-3) were obtained from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY), and biotinylated PY-20 antibody was purchased from ICN Biomedical, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). The human-specific antibody against ErbB2 (Ab-10) was obtained from NeoMarkers (Union City, CA), and antibodies to SHC, SHP-2 (PTP1D), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (anti-pan ERK) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The biotinylated 4G10 and anti-EGFR LA22 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies directed against the phosphorylated activated form of p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). GRB2-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The 87-amino acid residue form of recombinant human AR was generated as described previously (12Thompson S.A. Harris A. Hoang D. Ferrer M. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17927-17931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recombinant human EGF was obtained from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). The pFR-Luc and pFA2-Elk-1 plasmids were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the pcDNA 3.1/His/lacZ plasmid was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). An XhoI fragment encoding full-length human ErbB2 cDNA was generously provided by Jacalyn Pierce (National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health) and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding ErbB2-(1–813) was generated by digesting the full-length ErbB2 construct with SacII and HindIII, blunting the ends with the large Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and ligating the ends of the plasmid. The sequence of this construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were grown to confluency in 96-well plates, serum-starved for 3 h, and treated with serum-free medium containing EGF or AR. After 6 h, the cells were pulsed for an additional 16 h with [3H]thymidine (2 mCi/well; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA was harvested, and the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into newly synthesized DNA was quantitated as described previously (23Johnson G.R. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. Stromberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18835-18843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells in 6-well plates were incubated with 1 ml of Pfx-6 transfection lipid (Invitrogen) in Opti-Mem (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.5 μg of pFR-Luc, 50 ng of pFA2-Elk-1, and 100 ng of pcDNA 3.1/His/lacZ for 4 h at 37 °C. In some experiments cells were also transfected with 1.35 μg of pcDNA 3.1 or pcDNA 3.1 encoding either ErbB2 or ErbB2-(1–813). The cells were then allowed to recover overnight in serum-containing medium, serum-starved, and stimulated for 6 h with growth factor. Cells were lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured with the Luciferase Assay system (Promega) and Galacto-Light Plus System (Tropix), respectively. Cells were grown to confluency in 12-well plates, washed in binding buffer (Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mmHepes, pH 7.2), and incubated in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. One ml of ice-cold binding buffer containing 100 pm of 125I-EGF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each well in the absence or presence of unlabeled EGF or AR ranging in concentration from 0.1 to 200 nm. After 3 h at 4 °C the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and lysed in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH, and radioactivity was quantitated. Specific binding was defined as the quantity of125I-EGF that bound in the presence of excess (200 nm) unlabeled EGF subtracted from that which bound in the absence of unlabeled EGF. Specific binding of 125I-EGF was greater than 96% in all experiments performed. The IC50was defined as the concentration of unlabeled ligand that inhibited specific binding by 50%. Cell monolayers were serum-starved for 3 h and treated with serum-free medium containing EGF or AR for the indicated times at 37 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, 100 NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2 (lysis buffer). The lysate was vortexed, incubated on ice for 10 min, and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad detergent-compatible protein assay. One μg of antibody was added to 0.5 mg of whole cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, and 5 μl of protein G-agarose was added. After 1 h at 4 °C, the immune complexes were pelleted at 15,000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 4 min. Whole cell lysates (0.5 mg) were incubated with 1 μg of GRB2-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose for 12 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-agarose resin was pelleted at 15,000 × g for 2 min and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 4 min. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride (Novex). Membranes were probed with 0.3 μg/ml primary antibody, and detection was performed using the Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Either wild type (WT) or truncated EGFR lacking the COOH-terminal 186 amino acid residues (c′1000) was expressed in EGFR-devoid NR6 fibroblasts (46Pruss R.M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3918-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) via retrovirus-mediated transduction (40Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The WT and c′1000 polyclonal cell lines possess comparable numbers of EGF-binding sites with similar affinities as described previously (40Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Both WT and c′1000 receptors undergo ligand-dependent endocytosis with rates of 0.080 and 0.042 per min, respectively. 2A. Wells, unpublished observations. WT and c′1000 cells express detectable levels of murine ErbB2 (see below) but do not respond to heregulin α or β indicating that these cells do not express significant quantities of the EGFR-related receptors, ErbB3 or ErbB4. 3L. Wong, T. B. Deb, S. A. Thompson, A. Wells, and G. R. Johnson, unpublished observations. The WT and c′1000 cell lines express equivalent levels of GRB2, ErbB2, SHP-2, SHC, and ERK 2 as confirmed by Western blotting of whole cell lysates (data not shown). To understand better the role of the COOH-terminal region of the EGFR in mitogenic signaling, we assessed the ability of various concentrations of AR and EGF to stimulate DNA synthesis in serum-starved parental NR6, WT, and c′1000 cells (Fig.1). As expected, neither AR nor EGF had any effect on DNA synthesis in NR6 parental cells (Fig. 1, top panel), whereas cells expressing WT EGFR acquired the ability to respond to both AR or EGF (middle panel). In WT cells the approximate concentration of growth factor necessary to achieve one-half of the maximal DNA synthesis response (EC50) was ∼0.12 and ∼0.30 nm for EGF and AR, respectively. The EC50 for DNA synthesis by EGF in c′1000 cells was ∼0.12 nm (Fig. 1, bottom panel) demonstrating that removal of the 186 amino acid residues from the COOH terminus of the receptor had no significant effect on the ability of EGF to stimulate DNA synthesis. However, in striking contrast to EGF, AR was impaired in its ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in c′1000 cells such that, relative to WT cells, the EC50 was shifted 67-fold to ∼20 nm (bottom panel). Furthermore, no significant increase in DNA synthesis occurred in c′1000 cells in response to AR until the concentration was escalated to 3.3 nm, whereas a significant response was observed in WT cells at the lowest AR dose tested (41 pm). In c′1000 cells the EC50 for growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis was 167-fold higher for AR than EGF. These results demonstrate that the COOH-terminal region of the WT EGFR is critical to the ability of AR to generate a strong mitogenic signal in NR6 cells. The simplest explanation for the defect in the ability of AR to stimulate DNA synthesis effectively in c′1000 cells is that the truncated EGFR does not bind AR with the same affinity as the WT receptor. To test this hypothesis we studied the ability of AR and EGF to inhibit the binding of 125I-EGF to intact cells at 4 °C (Table I). In these experiments the concentration of unlabeled ligand that was necessary to inhibit the specific binding of radiolabeled EGF by 50% (IC50) was determined in each of the two cell lines. This analysis demonstrated that truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the EGFR had no significant effect on the binding of AR to the extracellular domain of the receptor (Table I). As expected, WT and c′1000 receptors bound EGF with comparable affinities consistent with previous observations (40Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J.

Open table in a new tab Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase) plays a critical role in mitogenic signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGFR (47Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar). MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the transactivation domain of the ternary complex factor Elk-1 results in binding of Elk-1 to the serum response element in the promoters of growth factor-induced genes and the stimulation of transcription (48Marais R. Wyne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 49Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of the two ligands to transactivate Elk-1, cells were cotransfected with a plasmid that constitutively expresses a fusion protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of the yeast protein Gal4 and the transactivation domain of Elk-1, along with a reporter plasmid that expresses luciferase under the control of five tandem repeats of the Gal4-binding element. The WT and c′1000 cells were stimulated with various concentrations of AR or EGF for 6 h and lysed, and luciferase activity was quantitated (Fig.2). Both ligands were potent stimulators of Elk-1 transactivation in WT cells with EC50 values of ∼0.1 nm for EGF and ∼0.4 nm for AR (Fig. 2,top panel). The EC50 for EGF-stimulated Elk-1 transactivation in c′1000 cells was found to be ∼0.2 nmand thus was comparable to WT cells (Fig. 2, bottom panel). However, the EC50 value for AR in c′1000 cells, increased to ∼7 nm. Little or no expression of the luciferase reporter occurred in response to AR in these cells except at the highest concentration tested (10 nm, bottom panel). In general, the ability of the two growth factors to stimulate Elk-1 transactivation in WT and c′1000 cells (Fig. 2) correlated well with the ability of the ligands to stimulate DNA synthesis in these cells (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the COOH-terminal region of the EGFR plays a critical role in the capability of AR to elicit transcriptional activation that is mediated by Elk-1. To determine whether the defect in the ability of AR to stimulate DNA synthesis and Elk-1 transactivation in c′1000 cells could be explained by a defect in MAPK activation, we performed a time course experiment to monitor the enzymatic activation of MAPK. To reveal a potential defect in AR signaling in c′1000 cells, we used a concentration of ligand (1 nm) that was mitogenic for EGF but not for AR (Fig. 1,bottom panel). Cells were lysed at various time points, and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies that specifically detect the phosphorylated activated form of MAPK (Fig.3). As expected, bot"
https://openalex.org/W2075825702,"In the course of delineating the regulatory mechanism underlying phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) metabolism, we have discovered three distinct phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase D (PI-PLD) isozymes from rat brain, tentatively designated as PI-PLDa, PI-PLDb, and PI-PLDc. These enzymes convert [3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 to generate a novel inositol phosphate, d-myo-[3H]inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ([3H]Ins(3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidic acid. These isozymes are predominantly associated with the cytosol, a notable difference from phosphatidylcholine PLDs. They are partially purified by a three-step procedure consisting of DEAE, heparin, and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. PI-PLDa and PI-PLDb display a high degree of substrate specificity for PI(3,4,5)P3, with a relative potency of PI(3,4,5)P3 ≫ phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI(4)P) > phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) > phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). In contrast, PI-PLDc preferentially utilizes PI(3)P as substrate, followed by, in sequence, PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(4,5)P2. Both PI(3,4)P2 and PI(4,5)P2 are poor substrates for all three isozymes, indicating that the regulatory mechanisms underlying these phosphoinositides are different from that of PI(3,4,5)P3. None of these enzymes reacts with phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidylethanolamine. All three PI-PLDs are Ca2+-dependent. Among them, PI-PLDb and PI-PLDc show maximum activities within a sub-μm range (0.3 and 0.9 μmCa2+, respectively), whereas PI-PLDa exhibits an optimal [Ca2+] at 20 μm. In contrast to PC-PLD, Mg2+ has no significant effect on the enzyme activity. All three enzymes require sodium deoxycholate for optimal activities; other detergents examined including Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40 are, however, inhibitory. In addition, PI(4,5)P2 stimulates these isozymes in a dose-dependent manner. Enhancement in the enzyme activity is noted only when the molar ratio of PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3 is between 1:1 and 2:1.

Here we report the identification of three distinct cytosolic PI-PLD isozymes that convert [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 to a novel inositol phosphate [1-3H]Ins(3,4,5)P3 and PA. The present data raise a possibility that these PI-PLDs act as a regulator of PI(3,4,5)P3 in vivo. This premise connotes physiological implications conforming to that of the PTEN tumor suppressor. Furthermore, because PA is generated, these isozymes may provide a putative link between PI 3-kinase and other signaling pathways mediated by PA or its metabolites.MATERIALS AND METHODS[1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 (specific activity 13.5 mCi/mmol), [1-3H]PI(3,4)P2(38.8 mCi/mmol), [1-3H]PI(4,5)P2 (11.7 mCi/mmol), [1-3H]PI(4)P (16.3 mCi/mmol), [1-3H]PI(3)P (40 mCi/mmol), [palmitoyl-14C(U)]PI(3,4,5)P3 (1.6 mCi/mmol), [1-3H]Ins(3,4,5)P3, [1-3H]Ins(3,4)P2, and [1-3H]Ins(4,5)P2 were synthesized according to a modification of the synthetic methods described previously for the respective nonradioactive counterparts (19Lu P.-J.

Toyopearl DEAE-650M was purchased from Tosohaas. [3H]PC, [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, and [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Recombinant PLCδ-1, PLCγ-1, and PLD1 were kind gifts of Drs. Jon Lomasney (Northwestern University Medical School), Sue Goo Rhee (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health), and John H. Exton (Vanderbilt University Medical School), respectively. Unstripped rat brain was purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals. Enzyme inhibitors such as aristolochic acid, ET-18-OCH3, and dihydro-d-erythro-sphingosine were products of Calbiochem.Assay of PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing or PI-PLD ActivityDuring purification, PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing or PI-PLD activity in all enzyme preparations was assayed by monitoring the liberation of the 3H-labeled phosphoinositol head group from [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 into the medium. [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 (0.8 μg; total radioactivity, 0.2 μCi), PE (40 μg), and PS (5 μg) were suspended in 1 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7, containing 120 mmKCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.8 mm sodium deoxycholate. Various amounts of CaCl2 were added to the mixture before assays, and the free Ca2+ concentration was calculated by a computer program developed by Karl-Josef Foehr and programmed by Wokciech Warchei (1990, version 2.1). The suspension was sonicated in a water bath-type sonicator for 5 min, and mixed vigorously with a vortex mixer before assays. Various enzyme preparations (10 μl) were incubated with 40 μl of the aforementioned Hepes buffer. The reaction was initiated by adding 50 μl of the phospholipid mixture, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and stopped by adding 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 150 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation. The composition of the control was identical to that mentioned above except that the enzyme preparation was replaced by an equal amount of distilled H2O.Partial Purification of PI-PLD Isozymes from Rat Brain CytosolRat brain was minced and suspended in 8 volumes of ice-cold 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm AEBSF. The small pieces were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with six strokes up and down. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g to remove cell debris and intact nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to prepare the cytosolic fraction.Step 1. DEAE ChromatographyAfter being dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmdithiothreitol (buffer A) for 12 h, the cytosolic fraction (1.8 g of protein; 0.039 nmol/mg/min PIP3-metabolizing activity) was loaded onto a Toyopearl DEAE-650M column (3 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 400 ml of buffer A followed by 300 ml of a linear NaCl gradient of 0–200 mm in the same buffer. Fractions of 2.25 ml were collected after the gradient started. PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity was analyzed as described above at two different free Ca2+ concentrations, 0.3 and 20 μm, respectively. Two different activity profiles were noted under these two Ca2+ levels (Fig. 1), indicating the presence of more than one PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing enzyme. Fractions 271–289 and 295–312, designated as D1 and D2, were pooled separately, concentrated over a molecular weight 10,000 cutoff ultrafiltration membrane (Filtron Omega unit), and dialyzed against buffer A for 12 h.Step 2. Heparin ChromatographyThe dialyzed D1 and D2 samples (76.7 and 79.7 mg of protein; 0.6 and 0.58 nmol of PIP3/min/mg specific activity, respectively) from step 1 were individually applied to a heparin-agarose column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 85 ml of buffer A, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 150 ml of a linear gradient of 0–400 mm NaCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, both D1 and D2 were resolved into two PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity peaks. For D1, fractions 145–160 (designated as D1/H1) and fractions 177–192 (designated as D1/H2) were pooled separately and concentrated by ultrafiltration. For D2, fractions 125–139 (designated as D2/H) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration.Figure 2Heparin chromatography of fraction D1 (panel A) and fraction D2 (panel B).

Sephacryl S-200-HR ChromatographyThe concentrated D1/H1 (4.5 mg; 2.3 nmol of PIP3/mg/min specific activity), D1/H2 (2.3 mg; 9.1 nmol of PIP3/mg/min specific activity), and D2/H (3.84 mg; 2.6 nmol of PIP3/mg/min specific activity) from step 2 were loaded individually onto a Sepharose S-200-HR column (1 × 100 cm). The equilibration and eluting buffer was buffer A, and fractions of 2 ml were collected (see Fig. 3,A–C). The collected fractions were: the D1/H1 column, fractions 76–79 (designated as D1/H1/S or PI-PLDa; 0.18 mg; 13.7 nmol of PIP3/mg/min specific activity); the D1/H2 column, fractions 71–78 (designated as D1/H2/S or PI-PLDb; (0.077 mg; 40.9 nmol PIP3/mg/min sp. act.); the D2/H column, fractions 71–77 (designated as D2/H/S or PI-PLDc; 0.24 mg; 39.8 nmol PIP3/mg/min specific activity).Figure 3Sephacryl S-200 chromatography of fraction D1/H1 (panel A), fraction D1/H2 (panel B), and fraction D2/H (panel C). The concentrated, dialyzed D1/H1, D1/H2, and D2/H samples were purified further by gel filtration columns (see “Materials and Methods”).Closed circles denote A 280 readings. Every third fraction was assayed for [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity at either 20 μm (open squares) or 0.3 μm (closed triangles).

The enzyme incubation, under the same conditions as described above for [3H]PI(3,4,5)P3, was terminated by adding 100 μl of HClO4/CHCl3 (v/v, 1:0.33) followed by 100 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and was extracted immediately with 300 μl of tri-n-octylamine/Freon (v/v, 1:1) twice to remove HClO4. The neutralized solution was transferred to a new vial, and the radioactive inositol phosphate was analyzed by HPLC on an Adsorbosphere Sax column (5 μm; 4.6 × 200 mm) equilibrated with H2O. The phosphoinositol was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.9 m NH4H2PO4 in 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected every 1 ml, and their radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation.

The respective retention times were 60, 50, 48, 43, 41, 31, and 29 min, respectively.Stoichiometric Formation of Ins(3,4,5)P3 and PAA mixture of [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 (15 μm; 20,000 cpm) and [palmitoyl-14C(U)]PI(3,4,5)P3 (117 μm; 35,000 cpm) was exposed to fraction D1/H2/S (PI-PLDb), in a final volume of 200 μl, in the presence of 0.3 μm Ca2+. Reaction was stopped at the indicated times (1, 5, 20, 40, and 60 min) by extracting the mixture with 200 μl of HClO4/CHCl3. After a brief centrifugation, the two phases were separated. The aqueous phase was treated as described above for the HPLC analysis of Ins(3,4,5)P3. The organic phase was transferred to a new vial and dried by a stream of N2. The residue was dissolved in CHCl3, spotted onto 1% oxalic acid-treated TLC plate, and developed withn-propyl alcohol and 2 m acetic acid (13: 7) overnight. After drying, spots were located by autoradiography and compared with standards. The autoradiograms were scanned by a photodyne image system. The spots corresponding to [14C]PA and [14C]PI(3,4,5)P3 were scraped off the plate, and the associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation.Periodate Oxidation of [1-3H]Ins(3,4,5)P3The HPLC-purified [1-3H]Ins(3,4,5)P3with a total radioactivity of approximately 20,000 cpm was oxidized with 0.1 m periodic acid, pH 2.0, and reduced with 1m NaBH4 as described (21Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Carter N. Chahwala S.B. Morris A.J. Whetton A.D. Downes P.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such treatments would oxidize inositol phosphates at vicinal hydroxyls. It was found that the resulting polyphosphate lost all radioactivity, indicating the adjacent 1-, 2-, and 6-hydroxyls were unsubstituted.RESULTSTo investigate the metabolic fate of D-3 phosphoinositides, [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 was synthesized and exposed to the cell lysate of rat brain. The incubation mixture was extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH to isolate the phosphoinositide metabolites. However, substantial radioactivity appeared in the aqueous phase in a time- and protein concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the3H-labeled head group was released from [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 via phospholipase hydrolysis. HPLC analysis of the aqueous fraction revealed that the liberated radioactivity was associated with free inositol and trace amounts of inositol mono- and bisphosphates (data not shown). This result showed that the inositol phosphate generated from PI(3,4,5)P3 was rapidly metabolized in the crude extract. Other rat tissues examined including the liver, the kidney, and platelets also contained such PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity.As part of our effort to verify the identity of the PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing enzyme(s), purified phospholipase preparations from different sources were examined for the activity toward [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3. These included porcine pancreas PLA2, recombinant PLC-γ1, recombinant PLC-δ1, B. cerus PI-specific PLC, recombinant PLD1, and cabbage PLD. However, none of these enzymes showed appreciable hydrolysis of [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3. With regard to enzyme inhibition, neomycin (1 mm), which binds phosphoinositides with high affinity (22Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Danin M. Eli Y. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), completely blocked the hydrolysis by rat brain extracts. Other known phospholipase inhibitors such as aristolochic acid for PLA2, ET-18-OCH3for PI-PLC, and dihydro-d-erythro-sphingosine for PLD gave no or only partial inhibition of the enzyme activity even at concentrations 20 times over the corresponding IC50values (data not shown).These data prompted us to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for [3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 hydrolysis. Subcellular fractionation indicated that more than 85% of the [3H]PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity resided in the cytosolic fraction (100,000 × g supernatant). The rest of the activity was associated with various membrane fractions including the plasma membrane and microsomes. Thus, the rat brain cytosol was subjected to chromatographic purification by DEAE ion exchange, heparin-agarose, and Sephacryl S-200-HR columns, in tandem. To explore the possibility that there might exist multiple responsible enzymes with different Ca2+ requirements, PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity was monitored at low and high Ca2+ concentrations, represented by 0.3 and 20 μm, respectively, throughout the purification. As shown in the DEAE chromatographic profile (Fig.1), a broad peak exhibiting PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity was detected at each Ca2+ level (0.3 μm, closed triangles; 20 μm, open squares).Nevertheless, the activity peaks detected at 0.3 and 20 μm Ca2+ showed different migration patterns in the elution profile. This finding suggested that there were two or more PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing enzymes with different Ca2+ dependence among these active fractions. Thus, fractions 271–289 and 295–312, designated as D1 and D2, were pooled separately. The subsequent heparin chromatography provided definite evidence that D1 and D2 each contained two PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activities (Fig.2, A and B).As shown, fraction D1 gave two well resolved activity peaks between fractions 150 and 210 (Fig. 2 A). Among these active fractions, the enzyme activity of the first peak increased with higher [Ca2+] (0.3 μm, closed triangles; 20 μm, open squares), whereas the activity of the second peak was unaffected by Ca2+change. Accordingly, fractions 145–160 and 177–192 were pooled separately and were designated as D1/H1 and D1/H2, respectively. Similarly, two PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity peaks were also noted for fraction D2 after the heparin column (Fig.2 B; 0.3 μm, closed triangles; 20 μm, open squares). In contrast, the first peak exhibited a higher activity at low Ca2+ compared with high Ca2+, whereas the second, smaller peak showed no significant difference in the Ca2+ requirement. Considering that fractions D1 and D2 were juxtaposed in the DEAE elution profile, it was possible that the second peak from fraction D2 was identical to fraction D1/H2 in light of their elution times and Ca2+dependence. Thus, only the first activity peak was collected, which was designated as D2/H. Fractions D1/H1, D1/H2, and D2/H were chromatographed further on a Sephacryl S-200-HR column (Fig.3, A–C).The resulting active fractions were designated as D1/H1/S, D1/H2/S, and D2/H/S for further discussion. This three-step procedure resulted in 354-, 1,056- and 1,027-fold purification with specific activities of 13.7, 40.9, and 39.8 nmol of PI(3,4,5)P3/mg of protein/min ([Ca2+] = 2 μm) for fractions D1/H1/S, D1/H2/S, and D2/H/S, respectively. Concerning PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity, fraction D2/H/S was highly unstable. Up to 80% of the enzyme activity was lost after storing at 0 °C for 2 days.The Ca2+ dependence of these enzyme preparations was examined. Fig. 4 indicates that the PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity of these enzymes was inhibited by EDTA, and the inhibition could be overcome by adding Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner. Both D1/H2/S and D2/H/S showed a similar Ca2+ requirement, with maximum PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activities at a sub-μm range (0.3 and 0.9 μm, respectively), whereas D1/H1/S displayed an optimal [Ca2+] at 20 μm. The difference in the Ca2+ requirement underscored a potential distinction in the roles of these enzymes in PI(3,4,5)P3 metabolism. Moreover, Mg2+ had no appreciable effect by itself on the activity of or on the Ca2+ dependence for any of these enzymes (data not shown).Figure 4Effect of Ca2+ on PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activities of fractions D1/H1/S (PI-PLDa; closed circles), D1H2/S (PI-PLDb; open circles), and D2/H/S (PI-PLDc; closed triangles). Each enzyme preparation was incubated with [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3 in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Ca2+, and the PI(3,4,5)P3-metabolizing activity was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The incubation medium contained 2 mm EGTA, and the concentrations of free Ca2+were calculated from the added Ca2+ concentrations. Each data point represents the mean of three determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In an effort to gain insight into the catalytic behaviors of these enzymes, we also synthesized [1-3H]PI(3,4)P2, [1-3H]PI(4,5)P2, [1-3H]PI(3)P, and [1-3H]PI(4)P for examinations. These phospholipids were exposed to individual enzymes, and the released water-soluble products were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC, aiming at both product identification and substrate specificity determination. Representative HPLC profiles of the [1-3H]phosphoinositol products from incubations of the respective substrates with fraction D1/H2/S are shown in Fig.5.Figure 5HPLC profiles of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates generated from [1-3H]PI(3,4,5)P3, [1-3H]PI(3,4)P2, [1-3H]PI(4,5)P2, [1-3H]PI(3)P, and [1-3H]PI(4)P metabolism by D1/H2/S (PI-PLDb) (see “Materials and Methods”).

First, D1/H2/S displayed a high degree of substrate specificity for PI(3,4,5)P3. The relative potency for the substrates examined was PI(3,4,5)P3 ≫ PI(4)P > PI(3)P ≫ PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. The utilization of the latter two, especially PI(3,4)P2, accounted for less than 5% of that of PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig.6, panel A). These HPLC results were consistent with those obtained by measuring [3H]phosphoinositol release from the respective substrates by liquid scintillation.Figure 6Substrate specificity of D1/H2/S (PI-PLDb) (panel A), D1/H1/S (PI-PLDa) (panel B), and D1/H/S (PI-PLDc) (panel C).The enzyme assay was performed by HPLC analysis of [3H]phosphoinositol formation from the respective substrates.

Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Purified reductase shows five protein bands (4Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu,L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in a high resolution sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) system, with apparent molecular masses of 70, 27, 15, 13, and 11 kDa. The reductase contains five prosthetic groups: one covalently linked FAD, three iron-sulfur clusters (2Fe-2S, 4Fe-4S, and 3Fe-4S), and cytochromeb 560. The larger two subunits (Fp & Ip) are succinate dehydrogenase and house the FAD and the three-iron sulfur clusters, respectively. The smaller three subunits (QPs1, QPs2, and QPs3) are membrane-anchoring proteins. It is still unknown which of these three membrane-anchoring subunits house cytochromeb 560 heme. Bovine heart mitochondrial succinate:Q reductase has been resolved into two reconstitutively active fractions: soluble succinate dehydrogenase (5Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 593: 24-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the membrane-anchoring fraction (QPs) (6Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified succinate dehydrogenase can catalyze electron transfer from succinate to artificial electron acceptors such as phenazine methosulfate but not to its physiological electron acceptor, Q. Addition of QPs to succinate dehydrogenase reconstitutes membrane-bound succinate:Q reductase, which catalyzes TTFA-sensitive electron transfer from succinate to Q, indicating that QPs provide membrane docking for succinate dehydrogenase and Q-binding for the reductase. The involvement of QPs in the Q-binding of succinate:Q reductase is further supported by the detection of ubisemiquinone radicals in intact or reconstituted succinate:Q reductase formed from QPs and succinate dehydrogenase but not in succinate dehydrogenase alone (7Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when succinate:Q reductase is photoaffinity-labeled with an azido-[3H]Q derivative, radioactivity is found in the QPs subunits but not in the succinate dehydrogenase subunits (4Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu,L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The radioactivity distribution is 45, 22, and 25% in QPs1, QPs2, and QPs3, respectively (4Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu,L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Q-binding domains in QPs1 and QPs3 have been identified as residues 113–140 and 29–37, respectively, by matching the sequences of azido-Q-linked peptides to their respective protein sequences. The amino acid sequences of QPs1 and QPs3 are obtained from cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the cDNAs (4Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu,L. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

The Q-binding domain in the proposed model of QPs1 is located at the connecting loop between transmembrane helices II and III toward the matrix side (4Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu,L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Q-binding domain in the proposed model of QPs3 is located at the end of transmembrane helix I toward the C side of the mitochondrial inner membrane (9Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Location of Q-binding domains of QPs1 and QPs3 on opposite sides of the membrane is in line with a two-Q-binding site hypothesis formulated from inhibitor binding studies of this enzyme complex (10Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Isolated QPs contains 27 nmol of cytochromeb 560/mg of protein. The role of this cytochrome in beef succinate:Q reductase is controversial. Because cytochromeb 560 in succinate:Q reductase is not reduced by succinate and because it is present in a substoichiometric amount with respect to FAD, its direct involvement in succinate:Q reductase catalysis has been ruled out by some investigators (6Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been proposed (11Cammack R. Matsubara H. Katsube T. Wada K. Iron-Sulfur Protein Research. Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo1986: 40-55Google Scholar) that cytochromeb 560 functions as a mediator between low potential Fl/Fl⋅ and Q/Q⋅ couples in a dual pathway model of electron flow through cardiac succinate:Q reductase. Despite its rather unclear catalytic role, the involvement of cytochromeb 560 in the binding of succinate dehydrogenase to QPs is clearly indicated by restoration of the absorption properties, redox potential, and EPR characteristics of cytochromeb 560 in QPs during formation of TTFA-sensitive succinate:ubiquinone reductase from isolated QPs and succinate dehydrogenase (6Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand for cytochrome b in succinate:Q reductase from beef heart mitochondria (b 560) andEscherichia coli (b 556) has been identified as bishistidine (12Crouse B.R. Yu C.A. Yu L. Johnson M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Peterson J. Vibat C. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 155-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both the membrane-anchoring subunits (SdhC and SdhD) in the E. coli enzyme are involved in heme ligation of cytochrome b 556(14Nakamura K. Yamaki M. Sarada M. Nakayama S. Vibat C.R. Gennis R.B.

His-84 of the SdhC and His-71 of the SdhD were identified as ligands for cytochrome b 556 (15Rose C.T. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4148-4159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, information about amino acid residues involved in the bishistidine ligand of bovine cytochrome b 560 is lacking. A better understanding of the structure-function relationship of succinate:Q reductase, especially of the amino acid residues involved in Q-binding, heme b 560 ligation, and succinate dehydrogenase docking, requires functionally active QPs subunits. There are two ways to obtain purified QPs subunits: one is by biochemical resolution of QPs into their individual subunits; the other is by gene expression to generate recombinant QPs proteins.

The Q-binding function of recombinant QPs3 is established by its ability to cause a spectral blue shift of ubiquinone. The hemeb 560 ligating property of recombinant QPs3 is established by its ability to restore the spectral properties of cytochrome b 560 upon addition of hemin chloride. The amino acid residues of QPs3 involved in Q-binding and heme ligation were identified by site-directed mutagenesis.

A 342-base pair EcoRI fragment was excised from pCR2.1/QPs3 plasmid (9Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and cloned into the EcoRI site of pSELECT-1 vector to generate pSELECT/QPs3. The single-stranded pSELECT/QPs3 was used as the template in the mutagenesis reactions. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used were as follows: H9N, 5′-GCATCTCTCAACTGGACTGGT; H9Y, 5′-GCATCTCTCTACTGGACTGGT; H9D, 5′-GCATCTCTCGACTGGACTGGT; H46N, 5′-CTCACTCTTAACAGTCACTGG; H46Y, 5′-CTCACTCTTTACAGTCACTGG; H46D, 5′-CTCACTCTTGACAGTCACTGG; H48N, 5′-CTTCACAGTAACTGGGGCATT; H48Y, 5′-CTTCACAGTTACTGGGGCATT; H48D, 5′-TTCACAGTGACTGGGGCATT; H60N, 5′-GACTATGTTAATGGAGATGCA; H60Y, 5′-GACTATGTTTATGGAGATGCA; H60D, 5′-GACTATGTTGATGGAGATGCA; H89N, 5′-TTCAACTATAATGACGTGGGC; H89Y, 5′-TTCAACTATTATGACGTGGGC; H89D- 5′-TTCAACTATGATGACGTGGGC; S33A, 5′-AATCCGTGTGCTGCGATGGAC; D36A, 5′-TGTTCTGCGATGGCCTACTCT; Y37A, 5′-TCTGCGATGGACGCCTCTCGTGCG. Each of these oligonucleotides was used in combination with an ampicillin repair oligonucleotide and annealed to the single-stranded pSELECT/QPs3. The double mutant, H46N,H60N, was constructed by annealing the H46N-mutated oligonucleotide to the single-stranded pSELECT/QPs3(H60N). A 331-base pair BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing mutated QPs3 was excised from pSELECT/QPs3m and cloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX2T vector to generate pGEX2T/QPs3m, which was then transformed into JM109 cells. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of both pSELECT/QPs3m and pGEX2T/QPs3m. Transformants expressing the GST-QPs3m protein were identified by immunological screening of colonies with antibodies against the QPs3-connecting peptide (9Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Except for H60Y and H89D, all the 18 mutational constructions produced recombinant mutant QPs3-GST fusion proteins in E. coli JM109 cells. Twelve of these yielded purified recombinant mutant QPs3. They are the S33A, D36A, Y37A, H9D, H9N, H9Y, H46N, H46Y, H48N, H48Y, H60N, and H89N substitutions. The failure to obtain QPs3 mutants H46D, H48D, H60D, and H89Y was because of their production as inclusion body precipitates in E. coli cells, which were insoluble after treatment with 6m urea and subsequent dialysis. 400 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli JM109/pGEX/QPs3 was used to inoculate 12 liters of SOC medium (2.0% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm glucose) containing 440 mm sorbitol, 2.5 mm betaine, and 60 mg/liter ampicillin. The culture was grown in a fermentor chamber at 37 °C with aeration until the A 660 nm reached 0.9 (about 3.5 h) and cooled to 23 °C, and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.6 mm. Growth was continued for 3.5 h at 23 °C before the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min. The cell paste (48 g) was suspended in 144 ml of PBS buffer (20 mmsodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, containing 150 mm NaCl) and sonicated at 30 milliwatts at 0 °C with four 20-s pulses at 3 to 4 min intervals. During sonication, protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Triton X-100 was added to the broken cell suspension to a final concentration of 1% (w/v). This mixture was stirred gently on ice for 1 h before being centrifuged at 30,000 ×g. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of glutathione-agarose gel equilibrated with PBS. The mixture was gently shaken on a Varimix (Thermolyne) at 4 °C for 1 h and packed into a column. The column was washed extensively with the equilibrating buffer and then eluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm reduced glutathione and 0.25 msucrose. Fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 0.25m sucrose for 8 h with 2 changes of buffer to remove glutathione. The dialyzed sample was concentrated with a Centriprep-30 (Amicon) to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml, mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 10%, and frozen at −80 °C until use. QPs3 protein was released from GST-QPs3 fusion protein by thrombin digestion (1 μg/500 μg of protein) and recovered by gel filtration using a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose-12 column. Recombinant QPs3 mutants were obtained in the same manner as the wild type. Succinate:Q reductase (1Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Absorption spectra and enzyme assays were performed at room temperature in a Shimadzu UV-2101PC. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by Bradford assay (21Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a kit from Bio-Rad. The heme content was determined from the pyridine hemochromogen spectra using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 34.6 for the absorbance at 557 nm minus that at 600 nm (22Paul K.G. Theorell H. Akesson A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1955; 7: 1284-1287Crossref Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or for high resolution, according to Schägger et al. (24Schägger H.

The EPR measurements were made with a Bruker ER-200D equipped with an Air Product Heli-Tran System. EPR instrument settings are given in the figure legends. The successful overexpression of functionally active subunit IV of the R. sphaeroidescytochrome bc 1 complex (18Chen Y.R. Yu C.A. Yu L. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1363: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) in E. coli, using the pGEX system, encouraged us to use this system to obtain recombinant QPs3. Production of recombinant GST-QPs3 fusion protein depends on IPTG concentration, induction growth time, and induction growth medium. The yield increases as the IPTG concentration and induction growth time are increased, reaching a maximum at 0.4 mm IPTG and 3.5 h post-induction growth (data not shown). When IPTG concentration is increased to 1 mm, no further increase in expression yield is observed. When cells are grown for more than 3.5 h, the total yield decreases and degradative products increase, as determined by Western blotting using anti-QPs3 peptide antibodies. The yield of recombinant GST-QPs3 fusion protein in E. coliis increased by using an induction growth medium containing magnesium. When LB or peptone phosphate-enriched medium was used, production of GST-QPs3 fusion protein in E. coli accounts for less than 1% total cellular protein. However, including 5 mmmagnesium in the enriched medium or using SOC medium increases the yield of GST-QPs3 fusion protein to about 15% total cellular protein (see Table I). Although the yield of fusion protein in E. coli is slightly higher with enriched medium supplemented with magnesium than with the SOC medium, the latter is preferred because severe degradation of the fusion protein is observed with the former.Table IEffect of induction growth medium on the yield of soluble recombinant GST-QPs3 by E. coli JM109/pGEX-QPs3 cellsGrowth mediaYieldTotal GST-QPs3SolubleInclusion body%SOC7.51.06.5SOC + betaine + sorbitol9.23.55.5Enriched medium0.30.3Enriched medium + Mg2+7.51.56.0Enriched medium + Mg2+ + sorbitol + betaine155.59.8The % yield of recombinant GST-QPs3 fusion protein was estimated by comparing the color intensity of the 37-kDa GST-QPs3 fusion protein with that of the total cellular protein bands in SDS-PAGE. Open table in a new tab The % yield of recombinant GST-QPs3 fusion protein was estimated by comparing the color intensity of the 37-kDa GST-QPs3 fusion protein with that of the total cellular protein bands in SDS-PAGE. Although the expression level for GST-QPs3 fusion protein in E. coli is high using SOC medium at 37 °C, about 90% expressed protein is in the inclusion body precipitate. Purification of fusion protein from inclusion bodies is not practical, at least in our hands, because the recovery of soluble, active GST-QPs3 from dialyzed, urea-solubilized inclusion body is very low (less than 1%). Because it has been reported that including betaine and sorbitol in the induction growth medium and lowering the induction growth temperature greatly increases the soluble yield of GST fusion proteins (16Yu L. Deng K.-P. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25634-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Lee G.Y. Zhu J.Z. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Blackwell J.R. Horgan R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), these induction conditions were adopted. About 40% of the expressed GST-QPs3 fusion protein in E. coli is in the soluble form when IPTG induction growth is in SOC medium, containing 0.44 msorbitol and 2.5 mm betaine at 23–25 °C for 3.5 h. About 4 mg of purified fusion protein is obtained from a liter of cell culture. When the purified fusion protein is subjected to SDS-PAGE, a protein band with apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa is obtained. This protein band is confirmed to be GST-QPs3 fusion protein by Western blotting with antibodies against QPs3 and GST-QPs3. Purified recombinant QPs3 disperses in 0.01% dodecylmaltoside with an apparent molecular mass of more than 1 million. This is expected because QPs is a very hydrophobic protein containing three transmembrane helices. Upon SDS-PAGE, purified recombinant QPs3 shows only one band, corresponding to the fifth subunit in succinate:Q reductase (Fig.1, panel A, lane 5). Because QPs3 has been identified as one of the Q-binding proteins in succinate:Q reductase (4Lee G.Y. He D.-Y., Yu,L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it is important to know whether or not recombinant QPs3 binds Q. The Q-binding function of recombinant QPs3 is indicated by its ability to cause the blue spectral shift of Q. This method has been used to establish the Q-binding function of recombinant QPc-9.5 kDa (a small molecular mass Q-binding protein in ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase) (16Yu L. Deng K.-P. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25634-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When Q0C10 is added to recombinant QPs3, a blue spectral shift of Q is observed (Fig. 2, the curve with solid circles). This spectral blue shift of Q is not observed with Pronase-treated recombinant QPs3 or with recombinant GST (Fig. 2, the curve with open circles). Titration of recombinant QPs3 with Q0C10 shows saturation at around 1.1 mol of Q/mol of protein (see Fig. 2, the curve with solid circles), suggesting that the binding is specific and that the recombinant QPs3 is in the functionally active form for Q-binding. Previous photoaffinity labeling studies indicate that the Q-binding domain in QPs3 (residues 29–37) is at the end of transmembrane helix 1 toward the C side of the mitochondrial membrane (9Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Once the Q-binding property of recombinant QPs3 was established, site-directed mutagenesis coupled with Q-binding spectral analysis was used to identify the amino acid residues in the putative Q-binding domain responsible for Q-binding. Serine 33 and tyrosine 37 were selected for mutagenesis because they can form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group of the benzoquinone ring of Q similar to those found in the photosynthetic bacterial reaction center (26Deisenhoffer J. Michel H. Science. 1989; 245: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Aspartic acid 36 was selected because it is a conserved residue in this region of QPs3 proteins from bovine mitochondria, Ascaris suum (adult) and yeast (9Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Replacing Ser-33 or Tyr-37 with alanine results in recombinant mutant QPs3 (S33A or Y37A) unable to bind Q, as no spectral blue shift of Q0C10 is observed upon its addition (see Fig. 2, the curve with open triangles or with solid diamonds), indicating that these two amino acid residues are involved in Q-binding. Replacing Asp-36 with alanine results in recombinant mutant QPs3 (D36A) having the same Q-binding activity as the recombinant wild-type protein; added Q0C10 shows a spectral blue shift (see Fig. 2, the curve with open squares), indicating that Asp-36 is not involved in Q-binding. Isolated QPs contains three protein subunits (QPs1, QPs2, and QPs3) with a hemeb 560 content of 27 nmol/mg of protein (6Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand for this cytochrome has been identified as bishistidine (12Crouse B.R. Yu C.A. Yu L. Johnson M.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, unknown is which QPs subunit is involved in hemeb 560 ligation, and whether the bishistidine ligands are provided by a single subunit or by two different subunits, as reported for cytochrome b 556 of E. coli succinate:Q reductase (14Nakamura K. Yamaki M. Sarada M. Nakayama S. Vibat C.R. Gennis R.B. Nakayashiki T. Inokuchi H. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 521-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Rose C.T. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4148-4159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because recombinant QPs3 contains little cytochrome b 560 heme, the involvement of QPs3 in heme ligation was investigated by testing the ability of recombinant QPs3 to reconstitute in vitro with hemin chloride to form cytochrome b 560. Reconstitution was first attempted with the fusion protein because it is soluble in aqueous solution. When hemin chloride in Me2SO was added to GST-QPs3, the maximum absorption peak (Soret band) of the oxidized form of heme progressively shifts from 398 to 411 nm, with increasing absorption intensity during the incubation. It takes 1 h to complete the spectral red shift and to reach maximum absorption. When sample is reduced with dithionite, it shows symmetrical α-absorption at 560 nm, a broad β-absorption between 526 and 528 nm, and Soret absorption at 424 nm (see Fig. 3 A). These spectral characteristics are identical to those of cytochromeb 560 in an isolated, reconstitutively active QPs preparation (6Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that b 560 is restored in GST-QPs3 fusion protein by heme addition. Because no cytochrome b 560 spectral properties are observed with heme-treated GST (see Fig. 3 B), the cytochromeb 560 restored in GST-QPs3 is in the QPs3 moiety of the fusion protein. Reconstituted cytochrome b 560 in GST-QPs3 shows an EPR peak at g = 2.92 (see Fig. 5). This signal differs with the EPR characteristics of heme-treated GST (g = 3.50 and g = 3.86) and of free heme (a broad peak with g = 3.80) (17Lee G.Y. Zhu J.Z. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It resembles the one in the isolated QPs (g = 2.92 andg = 3.07), which do not respond to interaction with succinate dehydrogenase to form succinate:Q reductase (6Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EPR signal of cytochrome b 560 in intact succinate:Q reductase is at g = 3.46. When succinate dehydrogenase is removed from the reductase, the EPR signals of cytochromeb 560 in the resulting QPs preparation are atg = 3.07 and 2.92. The g = 3.07 signal converts to g = 3.46, whereas the g = 2.92 signal remains unchanged upon reconstitution with succinate dehydrogenase to form succinate:Q reductase. The inability of theb 560 with g = 2.92 to convert tog = 3.46 upon reconstitution with succinate dehydrogenase suggests that this cytochrome b 560has been somewhat modified during the isolation of QPs. The observation that absorption and EPR spectral properties of reconstituted cytochrome b 560 in GST-QPs3 fusion protein remain unchanged upon thrombin digestion together with the fact that heme-treated GST does not have the absorption or EPR spectral properties of cytochrome b 560 indicates that the ligands of reconstituted b 560 heme are from QPs3. Moreover, the spectral properties of cytochromeb 560 are associated with the recombinant QPs3-containing fractions when thrombin-treated, heme-reconstituted fusion protein is subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Superose 12, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to separate GST from QPs3. The QPs3-containing fraction has a heme b 560 to protein ratio of 0.75. This stoichiometry may result from part of the recombinant protein not being in the right orientation for ligation, from part of reconstituted heme b 560 being released during gel filtration, or from dimerization of recombinant protein. Perhaps part of the observed b 560spectral properties result from heme-ligated with two molecules of QPs3. Because recombinant QPs1 has also been reported to restore cytochromeb 560 spectral properties upon addition of hemin chloride (17Lee G.Y. Zhu J.Z. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), it is of interest to see whether or not restoration of cytochrome b 560 by recombinant QPs3 is affected by the presence of recombinant QPs1. When hemin chloride was added to a 1:1 mixture of recombinant QPs1 and QPs3, the amount of cytochromeb 560 restoration equals the sum of cytochromeb 560 restored by the individual recombinant proteins, suggesting that each of these proteins can provide bishistidine ligands for cytochrome b 560 in bovine heart mitochondrial succinate:Q reductase. This differs from the report that cytochrome b 556 in E. coli succinate:Q reductase is ligated to two histidine residues located, respectively, at SdhC and SdhD (14Nakamura K. Yamaki M. Sarada M. Nakayama S. Vibat C.R. Gennis R.B. Nakayashiki T. Inokuchi H. Kojima S. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 521-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). QPs3 contains histidine residues at positions 9, 46, 48, 60, and 89. To locate the heme-ligating residues, we altered each of these residues to asparagine, tyrosine, or aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis followed by spectral (absorption and EPR) characterizations of heme-reconstituted recombinant QPs3 mutants. Fig. 4 shows absorption spectra of heme-reconstituted recombinant QPs3 mutants. The absorption spectra of heme-reconstituted wild-type QPs3 and GST are included for comparison. The addition of hemin chloride to the H9D, H9N, H9Y, H48N, H48Y, or H89N mutant yields absorption spectra similar to those of reconstituted wild type, indicating that H9, H48, and H89 of QPs3 are not involved in heme b 560 ligation. The Soret absorption peaks of heme-reconstituted mutants H46Y (Fig. 4 F) and H60N (Fig.4I) are very different, with a 14-nm red shift of the peak maximum and a drastic decrease in absorbance. Thus His-46 and His-60 of QPs3 are involved in heme b 560 ligation. The involvement of His-46 is further supported by the diminishing of the α-absorption peak in the heme-reconstituted H46N mutant QPs3 (see Fig.4 E). As expected, when a double mutant, H46N,H60N was reconstituted with hemin chloride, no cytochromeb 560 spectral characteristics were obtained (see Fig. 4 K). Fig. 5 compares the EPR characteristics of heme-reconstituted wild-type and mutants QPs3. The heme-reconstituted H9D, H9N, H9Y, H48N, and H89N mutants of QPs3 have EPR spectra similar to reconstituted wild type, indicating that histidines at positions 9, 48, and 89 of QPs3 are not involved in hemeb 560 ligation. Mutants H46N, H46Y, H60N, and H46N,H60N did not produce a g = 2.92 signal upon treatment with hemin chloride, indicating that cytochromeb 560 is not formed in these mutants and consistent with the lack of cytochrome b 560absorption characteristics when these mutants are treated with hemin chloride. Therefore, histidines 46 and 60 provide ligands for reconstituted cytochrome b 560 in recombinant QPs3. Sequence alignments of the smallest membrane-anchoring subunit of succinate:Q reductases (9Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reveal that His-46 of mitochondrial QPs3 corresponds to histidine 71 of the E. coli SdhD subunit, which has been identified as one of the bishistidine ligands for cytochrome (15Rose C.T. Cecchini G. Nakamura K. Kita K. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4148-4159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of this histidine residue in cytochrome b 560 heme-ligating is also supported by the observation that yeast succinate:Q reductase and E. coli fumarate-Q reductase contain no cytochromeb 560, and the residues corresponding to His-46 of beef QPs3 in the yeast Sdh4 and FrdD subunits are tyrosine and valine, respectively. His-60 of mitochondrial QPs3 is tissue-specific (9Shenoy S.K. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because His-60 of mitochondrial QPs3 is not conserved in the Sdh4 subunit of cytochrome b556-containing bacterial succinate:Q reductases, the heme-ligating function of this histidine residue merits discussion. Because according to the proposed structure of QPs3, His-46 is located in the transmembrane helix, it would be difficult for His-60, in the same molecule, to serve as the second ligand for cytochrome b 560. Probably cytochromeb 560 heme in recombinant QPs3, as shown in this investigation, has two histidine ligands, His-60 and His-46, from two different molecules of QPs3. The heme-ligating property of His-60 is observed only in isolated QPs3. In intact beef succinate:Q reductase His-60 of QPs3 may be shielded by other protein subunits and not involved in cytochrome b 560 heme ligation. The second histidine ligand for cytochrome b 560 in intact reductase is from QPs1. When QPs3 is detached from the reductase, the His-60 in QPs3 is unshielded and may replace the histidine ligand from QPs1. The fact that the EPR signal of reconstituted cytochrome b 560 in recombinant QPs3 (g = 2.92) resembles the one in isolated QPs (g = 2.92 and g = 3.07), which does not respond to interaction with succinate dehydrogenase to form succinate:Q reductase (6Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supports the idea that the cytochromeb 560 heme in this reconstituted system is somewhat different. It is unclear whether or not QPs2 plays a role in the proper ligation of b 560 heme. We failed to generate cytochrome b 560 in a mixture of recombinant QPs1 and QPs3, which has an EPR signal at g= 3.07 that converts to g = 3.46 upon reconstituting with succinate dehydrogenase to form succinate:Q reductase. However, this failure can be explained by polymerization of the recombinant proteins or by the lack of QPs2. Further investigations on QPs2 and on the three-dimensional structure of succinate:Q reductase should yield information concerning the structure of this cytochrome band its role in this enzyme complex. We thank Dr. Roger Koeppe for his critical review of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2001342631,"The high affinity receptor for human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) consists of a cytokine-specific α-subunit (hGMRα) and a common signal-transducing β-subunit (hβc) that is shared with the interleukin-3 and -5 receptors. We have previously identified a constitutively active extracellular point mutant of hβc, I374N, that can confer factor independence on murine FDC-P1 cells but not BAF-B03 or CTLL-2 cells (Jenkins, B. J., D'Andrea, R. J., and Gonda, T. J. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 4276–4287). This restricted activity suggested the involvement of cell type-specific signaling molecules in the activation of this mutant. We report here that one such molecule is the mouse GMRα (mGMRα) subunit, since introduction of mGMRα, but not hGMRα, into BAF-B03 or CTLL-2 cells expressing the I374N mutant conferred factor independence. Experiments utilizing mouse/human chimeric GMRα subunits indicated that the species specificity lies in the extracellular domain of GMRα. Importantly, the requirement for mGMRα correlated with the ability of I374N (but not wild-type hβc) to constitutively associate with mGMRα. Expression of I374N in human factor-dependent UT7 cells also led to factor-independent proliferation, with concomitant up-regulation of hGMRα surface expression.

Utilizing Northern dot blot analysis and a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction protocol for IL-1R1 and IL-1R2, dexamethasone and, in particular, the budesonide epimer R were shown to effectively and rapidly induce transcription from the IL-IR2 gene when compared with IL-1R1 or β-actin RNA message levels in the same sample. Southern blot analysis of newly generated IL-1R2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products using end-labeled IL-1R2 intron probes suggested that GC enhancement of IL-1R2 expression was regulated primarily at the level of de novotranscription. GC-induced IL-1R2 gene transcription displayed features characteristic of a classical immediate early gene response, including a signal transduction function, a relatively low basal abundance, a rapid, transient induction, cycloheximide superinduction, actinomycin D suppression, and a rapid decay of IL-1R2 RNA message. Parallel time course kinetic analysis of IL-1R2 RNA message levels with Western immunoblotting revealed tight coupling of de novo IL-IR2 gene transcription with translation of the IL-1R2 RNA message; a newly synthesized (∼46-kDa) IL-1R2 protein was detected in the HEK growth medium as early as 1 h after budesonide epimer R treatment. These data indicate that different GC compounds can variably up-regulate the IL-1R2 response in HEKs through transcription-mediated mechanisms and, for the first time, suggest that a gene encoding a soluble cytokine receptor can respond like an immediate early gene.

Among the cytokines that mediate the cellular immune and inflammatory response, the interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling system plays a central role in diverse cell types (1Barnes P.J. Adcock I.

IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 proteins, which are both members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, each share virtual identity in their extracellular IL-1 ligand binding domain and transmembrane anchor; however, the IL-1R1 has a 213-amino acid cytoplasmic domain essential for signal transduction, whereas the IL-1R2 has a 29-amino acid cytoplasmic terminus incapable of signal transfer (2Dinarello C.A.

Signal transduction through the IL-1R1 can be relayed via cytosolic IL-1R-associated kinase cascades, leading to IκB phosphorylation and degradation, followed by NF-κB action on target NF-κB-regulated gene promoters (7Stylianou E.

At least two distinct ligand-mediated mechanisms can modulate autocrine, juxtacrine, or paracrine IL-1 stimulation: (a) the cellular production of the ∼20-kDa IL-1 receptor antagonist, which competes with the binding of secreted IL-1 to IL-1R1 at the cell surface (15Hammerberg C. Arend W.P. Fisher G.J. Chan L.S. Berger A.E. Haskill J.S. Voorhees J.J. Cooper K.D. J. Clin.

HEK cells respond to a wide variety of cytokines and lipid mediators (12Chedid M. Rubin J.S. Csaky K.G. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol.

Northern dot blot analysis, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and multiplex RT-PCR using human-specific IL-1R1, IL-1R2, and β-actin primer sets radiolabeled to high specific activity (>109 dpm/μg) indicated that after only 1 h of HEK cell stimulation, DEX and, in particular, BUDeR elicited a strong induction of the non-signal-transducing IL-IR2 RNA message but not of the IL-1R1 transcript. Southern blotting and RT-PCR unprocessed transcript assay (19Gilbert R.S. Reddy S.T. Kujubu D.A. Xie W. Luner S. Herschman H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Reddy S.T. Gilbert R.S. Xie W. Luner S. Herschman H.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) indicated that IL-1R2 RNA increases were primarily the result of de novo IL-1R2 gene transcription. Temporal analysis of IL-1R2 RNA message abundance with newly synthesized IL-1R2 protein indicated that the induction of the IL-1R2 gene expression pathway was a relatively rapid event, fulfilling each of the criteria for the classical cellular IEG response (21Morgan J.I. Curran T. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 66-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A ∼46-kDa IL-1R2 protein was detected by Western immunoblot analysis in HEK whole cell extracts (WCXTs) and in 200-fold concentrated HEK extracellular growth medium as early as 1 h, and increasing to 12+ h after BUDeR treatment. These results suggest that rapidly induced IL1-R2 gene transcription, tight coupling to IL-1R2 message translation, and secretion of the IL1-R2 protein can contribute to the anti-inflammatory potential of GC compounds in HEKs by scavenging and antagonizing extracellular cytokine IL-1 activity. Enhanced local up-regulation of the IL-1R2 signaling pathway by nonhalogenated 16α,17α-substituted GCs such as BUDeR may make these compounds particularly useful anti-inflammatory agents in epidermal keratinocytes that play key structural and physiological roles in primary immune defense and the inflammatory response in vivo. DEX (9α-fluoro16α-methyl-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-1,4-pregnadiene-3,20-dione; Sigma D-1756), BUDeR (16α,17α-butylidenebis(oxy)-11,21-di-hydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione), and BUDr (an equimolar racemic mixture of budesonide S and R; Fig. 1) were solubilized as 5 μg/μl solutions in 99.9% dimethyl sulfoxide (ACS reagent grade; Sigma D8779). Actinomycin D (Sigma A9415 dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) and cycloheximide (Sigma C0934 dissolved in ACS grade ethanol) were used at 1 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. 20 ml of keratinocyte growth medium (KGM; Clonetics) were made (100 nm with respect to each GC) to treat HEK cells in T-75 (Corning 25110-75; 75 cm2) tissue culture flasks with these compounds. The ligands DEX, BUDeR, and BUDr were solubilized into the KGM by 5 min of vigorous vortexing. The KGM in which the cells were incubated (37 °C in 5% CO2) was decanted and replaced with ligand-containing KGM and then warmed to 37 °C over a time course of 0–24 h. All other reagents, enzymes, and media were of the highest grades commercially available and were used without further purification. HEKs respond productively to a wide variety of cytokines, lipid mediators, and GCs. Cryopreserved normal HEK cells (obtained from pooled donors (Clonetics CC-2504; HEK-Neo pooled) and received as frozen primary cultures) were grown to 80% confluence (∼2–3 × 106 HEK cells/T-75 flask) in 20 ml of KGM supplemented with a serum containing 7.5 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.1 μg/ml human epidermal growth factor, 5 mg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml gentamycin/amphotericin, and 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone in T-75 flasks at 37 °C in 5% CO2according to the manufacturer's specifications (Clonetics). HEK cells responded well to ligands between P2 and P4, after which there was a graded decline in both the growth rate and responsiveness to ligand induction. The HEK cell cultures used here, which were obtained from pooled neonatal or adult donors, revealed little difference in their individual responses to either DEX, BUDr, or BUDeR stimulation, as measured by the induction of the IL-1R2 RNA message (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). For maximal ligand induction, cells were deprived for 24 h to 0.5% of normal serum levels before the addition of GC test compounds. 100 nm (final concentration) DEX, BUDeR, or BUDr were added to HEKs, and cells were harvested at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. For each treatment condition, HEKs were cultured in duplicate T-75 flasks for the parallel isolation of either total RNA for Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis or WCXTs for Western immunoblot detection.Figure 5BUDeR induces unprocessed IL-1R2 DNA transcripts and processed IL-1R2 RNA message in HEK cells. HEK cells were induced with BUDeR for 0, 1, 3, and 6 h; total RNA was then isolated and subjected to RT-PCR using primers for both IL-1R2 and β-actin (Table I). Primary PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis, Southern blotted, and hybridized to labeled oligonucleotides derived from the β-actin coding region, intron 7 of the IL-1R2 gene, or exon 7 of the IL-1R2 gene. Membranes were phosphorimaged, and exposure times were adjusted for comparison of each probe. Lanes A–E contain total RT-PCR products from HEK cells treated for 3 h with BUDeR and contain 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 0% of the total HEK RNA. These samples were subjected to electrophoresis, Southern transferred, and hybridized with a labeled IL-1R2 exon 7 probe. The linearity of this assay using the standard curve generated by samples A–E is shown in the bottom panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Time course of induction of human IL-1R2 genes with DEX and BUDeR as monitored by Northern dot blot analysis (A) and by quantitative RT-PCR using end radiolabeled primers (B). Using either technique, IL-1R2 was found to be maximally induced at 3 h. In these experiments, BUDeR was a consistently stronger inducer of IL-1R2 gene transcription than DEX (C). Actinomycin D (ACTD) strongly suppressed DEX- or BUDeR-mediated induction of the IL-1R2 transcript. Cycloheximide (CHX) consistently superinduced IL-1R2 but not IL-1R1 RNA message. Exposure time for IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 or β-actin dot blots was 26 and 8 h, respectively; exposure time for IL-1R1, IL-1R2, and β-actin RT-PCR signals was 1 h.

After each incubation period with GC test compounds, the KGM was decanted and replaced with 20 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma P-7626), 0.05 μg/μl aprotinin (Sigma A-6279), and 0.025 μg/μl leupeptin (Sigma L-2884). HEKs were scraped into a suspension of phosphate-buffered saline containing these enzyme inhibitors and pelleted at 4 °C by centrifugation at 1400 ×G av for 10 min. HEK cellular pellets were gently resuspended in 200 μl of a hypotonic buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pK a = 7.55 at 20 °C), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% (v/v) aprotinin (which was made 0.5% (v/v) with SDS (Sigma L-4509) just before use). HEK WCXTs were thoroughly resuspended using a 200 μl Pipetman with a cut-off tip followed by repeated pipetting on wet ice for 5 min. HEK WCXT protein concentrations were determined using a dotMETRIC protein microassay (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; dot sensitivity, 0.3 ng of protein) using bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin radioimmunoassay grade; Sigma A-7888) as a standard. After each GC induction time point, the KGM was completely replaced with 7.5 ml of TRIzol reagent (Refs. 22Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-536PubMed Google Scholar and 23Lukiw W.J.

Samples were then incubated for 5 min, with gentle shaking at 25 °C to dissociate nucleoprotein complexes. After the addition of 1.5 ml of reagent grade chloroform, suspensions were transferred to sterile, diethylpyrocarbonate (Sigma D5758)-treated 15-ml conical tubes, vigorously shaken for 5 min, incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged at 5000 × G av for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous phase, containing total extracted RNA, was transferred into sterile RNase-free 15-ml conical tubes, and 4 ml of 100% (v/v) ACS reagent grade iyl alcohol were added. RNA was precipitated overnight at −80 °C and then centrifuged at 9000 × G av for 10 min at 0 °C. Supernatants were vacuum aspirated, and visible RNA pellets were washed twice with 10 ml of 80% ACS reagent grade ethanol (v/v) and pelleted by centrifugation at 9000 × G av for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were aspirated again, and the total RNA pellet was dried under a vacuum for ∼10 min over a bed of anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite; W. A. Hammond). The partially dessicated RNA pellet was then resuspended in RNase-free water to ∼1 μg/μl by incubating for 15 min at 60 °C in an Eppendorf 5436 thermomixer. Total RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically atA 260, and samples hadA 260:A 280 ratios of ≥2.1. Northern dot blots containing up to 10 μg of alkaline-denatured total HEK RNA were prepared using 9 × 12-cm Zeta-Probe GT Nylon membranes and a Bio-Dot SF Microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad 170-6543). Membranes were hybridized using ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH), and RT-PCR generated IL-1R1, IL-1R2, or β-actin cDNA probes (Table I) end-radiolabeled by using [γ-32P]dATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) or by direct incorporation using [α-32P]dCTP (∼3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham redivue). Membranes were washed twice for 30 min at 61 °C in 1 mm EDTA, 40 mmNaHPO4, pH 7.2, and 5% SDS according to the manufacturer's protocols.Table IA.

This generated a “mini” cDNA library from total RNA isolated from control and GC-treated HEK cells. After cDNA synthesis, samples were treated with RNase H for 90 min at 37 °C to remove residual template RNA. PCR used ∼10% (v/v) of the first strand (reverse transcriptase) reaction as a DNA template in the presence of 200 μm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 2 mmMgCl2, and 2 units of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin Elmer Corp.) in a final volume of 50 μl. This reaction included either separate (standard RT-PCR) or combinations of primer sets (multiplex RT-PCR) of 100 pm of each forward and reverse human-specific primer for IL-1R1, IL-1R2, or β-actin (Stratagene catalog number 302010; Table I). Either unlabeled (for “cold” multiplex RT-PCR) or [γ-32P]dATP (>5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham redivue AA0018) 5′-end-labeled primers (for “hot” multiplex RT-PCR) were used in these reactions. [γ-32P]dATP isotopes were typically utilized >4 days before their quality control reference date. Quantitative IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 RT-PCR amplification (Fig. 2) was performed for 31 cycles after 5 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 60 °C, 1 min of primer extension at 72 °C, and 7 min of final extension at 72 °C after the 31st cycle using a GeneAmp 9700 PCR System (Perkin Elmer Corp.). Typically, 15 μl of each cold multiplex PCR reaction were analyzed on a 1× TBE (89 mm Tris-borate and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) 1.5% agarose gel in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethanol-recrystallized ethidium bromide (Life Technologies, Inc.; 5585 UA). PCR products of the hot multiplex PCR were separated on 5% or 10% (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 30:1) Mini Protean II ready gels (Bio-Rad 161-1101 and 161-1109) in 0.5× TBE buffer. Gels were dried onto Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Bio-Rad gel dryer model 583) for 90 min at 80 °C and quantitated via signal transfer onto PhosphorImager storage screens. Southern blotting and RT-PCR unprocessed transcript assay were performed as described previously (19Gilbert R.S. Reddy S.T. Kujubu D.A. Xie W. Luner S. Herschman H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Reddy S.T. Gilbert R.S. Xie W. Luner S. Herschman H.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Up to 5 μg of 0, 1, 3, and 6 h BUDeR-induced total HEK RNA was fed directly into a One-Step RT-PCR Amplification System (Life Technologies, Inc., Superscript 10928-026) using either IL-1R2- or β-actin-specific primers. 35 μl of this integrated RT-PCR reaction were resolved by electrophoresis through 1× TBE, 1.5% agarose gels, followed by Southern transfer onto Zeta-Probe GT Nylon membranes (Bio-Rad). Antisense oligonucleotides derived from human IL-1R2 exon 7, IL-1R2 intron 7 and intron 8, or the β-actin coding sequence (Table I) were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]dATP (>5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham redivue AA0018) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega M4101), hybridized at 55 °C to 60 °C using ExpressHyb hybridization solution, and were washed according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). 30 μg of control or GC-treated HEK WCXTs or HEK KGM concentrated 200-fold using Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA) were analyzed under reducing conditions on 10% acrylamide Tris-glycine SDS gels (Bio-Rad Ready-Gels 161-0907); proteins were transferred onto Hybond-P (Amersham RPN2020F) polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes using a mini-Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad 170-3930). Membranes were blocked and probed with an anti-human IL-1R2 rat monoclonal primary antibody (Cdw121b) that exhibited no cross-reactivity with human IL-1R1 (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Bound primary antibodies were detected with an anti-rat IgG peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham NA932) and developed with an ECL Plus Western blotting analysis system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham RPN2132). For cold multiplex-PCR, agarose gels were stained in 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and images were either photographed using Polaroid instant photography or digitized using the Bio-Rad Gel Doc 1000 UV Gel Documentation System. For hot multiplex-PCR, dried polyacrylamide gels were exposed to phosphorimager storage screens, and signals were analyzed via a raster scanning laser on a GS-250 molecular imager (Bio-Rad). To quantitate Western analysis signals Coomassie Blue-stained gels were placed on a UV/white light conversion screen (Bio-Rad 1707538) and photometrically digitized using the GS-250 molecular imager. Relative intensities of the IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 RNA signals were quantitated against the β-actin RNA signal in the same sample using phosphorimager analysis and the data acquisition packages provided with each instrument. Allp values were derived from protected t tests or least square means from a two-way factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). PCR primers were designed using Hitachi Oligo DNA sequence analysis software (Version 5.0). Human IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 gene promoter 5′ untranslated region and IL-1R2 mRNA sequence data were obtained through GenBank™ accession numbers L09701, U14177, U14178 and X59770, respectively. RNA sequence analysis was performed using both Kodak/IBI/Pustell (a modified Version 2.04) and Omiga 1.1.3 (Oxford Molecular) RNA subsequence analysis packages. Utilizing human-specific IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 cold or hot primer sets (Table I) and purified IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 cDNA templates, it was determined that at 31 cycles of PCR amplification, the masses of the IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 input cDNAs were linear functions of both the IL-1R1 and the IL-1R2 primary PCR products (Fig.2). Similarly, quantitative β-actin PCR analysis using human-specific β-actin primers at a 60 °C annealing temperature has been described previously (23Lukiw W.J. Rogaev E.I. Bazan N.G. Alz. Res. 1996; 2: 221-228Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the forward and reverse primer sets specific for human IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 were compatible in the same PCR reaction conditions at a common 60 °C annealing temperature, pilot experiments were performed using mixed IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 primer sets (Table I) after 3 h of either DEX or BUDeR treatment of HEK cells. Results of a cold multiplex PCR experiment using only these two primer sets are shown in Fig.3 A. The gel reveals that only two bands in the GC-treated HEKs were generated at 340 and 574 bp, corresponding to the expected size of the"

Studies in vitro suggest that the proximal region of the NOS-2 promoter is obligatory for gene activation by proinflammatory cytokines. However, following cerebral ischemia in a NOS-2 gene-deficient mouse in which this region and exons 1–4 have been deleted, we find temporal and spatial expression, identical to wild-type, from a previously unidentified promoter region. The resulting protein is predicted to lack the first 113 amino acids and is NOS-2-incompetent. Fortuitously, this gene-deficient mouse presents a unique opportunity to determine more about the mechanisms of NOS-2 gene regulation in vivo.

Cloning and sequencing of cDNAs for the three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 1The abbreviations used are:NOS, nitric oxide synthase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RT, reverse transcription; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; NO, nitric oxide; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule.1The abbreviations used are:NOS, nitric oxide synthase; bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RT, reverse transcription; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; NO, nitric oxide; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule. has revealed products of distinct genes that share 50–60% homology at the nucleotide and amino acid levels (1Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Two of these products, NOS-1 and NOS-3, are constitutively expressed enzymes that are calcium-calmodulin-dependent and produce small amounts of nitric oxide (NO) in response to transient elevations in intracellular calcium (2Christopherson K.S. Bredt D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2424-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 3Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The third isoform, NOS-2, is not normally expressed but can be transcriptionally activated in a variety of cell types in response to proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial endotoxins (4Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5MacMicking J.D. Xie Q. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). Unlike the constitutive isoforms, NOS-2 has calmodulin bound tightly at all times, maintaining the enzyme in a tonically active state and making it capable of producing a large, continuous flux of NO. The relatively large amount of NO that can be synthesized by NOS-2 over a sustained period has been implicated in diverse functions associated with inflammation and injury (6Nathan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Expression of NOS-2 in the central nervous system has been associated with viral, parasitic, and bacterial infections; in multiple sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases; and in trauma and ischemia (7Loihl A.K. Murphy S. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 118: 253-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the potential involvement of NOS-2 in such pathologies, a clear understanding of the mechanisms of NOS-2 gene regulation in vivo is important. The role of elements in the 5′ untranslated region of the NOS-2 gene and the mechanisms by which NOS-2 is induced and this induction is suppressed have all been well characterized in vitro. A 1749-bp fragment of the mouse NOS-2 promoter has been cloned and sequenced (8Xie Q. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), and the transcription initiation site and 22 consensus sequences for the potential binding of transcription factors have been identified. Given this diversity and multiplicity, it is not surprising that maximal induction of the gene requires the synergistic effect of combinations of stimuli. The nuclear factor κB binding site in the proximal portion of the promoter is considered obligatory for NOS-2 induction by endotoxin in vitro, whereas the more distal region of the promoter is important for the synergistic effect of IFN-γ (9Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Recently, a NOS-2 gene-deficient mouse was generated (10MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) with a targeted deletion of the proximal region of the promoter (585 bp), as well as exons 1–4 (including the translational start site). This manipulation was designed to produce a NOS-2 null allele by interfering with both transcriptional and translational expression of the gene. In the descriptions and outcomes of studies in a variety of disease models using this genetic variant, and in a range of different cell types, the loss of expression appears to hold true (6Nathan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). However, here we report that the generation of a cerebral infarct in such mice initiates transcriptional expression of the disrupted NOS-2 gene. Although there is translation of a product, this does not function as a NOS. As such, these mice provide a unique opportunity to explore further the regulation of the NOS-2 gene in vivo through the analysis of a promoter deletion introduced by genetic mutagenesis and should prove useful in the identification of previously undetected activators of this gene. NOS-2 −/− mice, generated from a mixed background of C57BL/6 × 129/SvEv (10MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), were outcrossed to C57BL/6 wild-type mice (+/+) to generate NOS-2 heterozygous (+/−) mice for breeding. A NOS-2 colony was established at the University of Iowa using heterozygote breeding pairs in order to generate littermates of all three genotypes (+/+, +/−, and −/−). Genomic screening was performed on DNA extracted from mouse tail snips. To detect the presence of the wild-type NOS-2 allele, a pair of PCR primers were designed that amplified a 328-bp region within exon 1 of the NOS-2 allele and absent in −/− mice (Fig. 1). The sequences of the NOS-2 primers are as follows: forward, 5′-TGA AGT GAC TAC GTG CTG CC-3′; reverse, 5′-AGT CCC TTC ACC AAG GTG G-3′. To identify the presence of the altered NOS-2 allele, another primer pair was constructed that amplifies a 550-bp region of the neoinsert specific to the disrupted NOS-2 allele. The sequences of theneo primers are as follows: forward, 5′-TGG AGA GGC TAT TCG GCT ATG AC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAC CAT GAT ATT CGG CAA GCA G-3′. Adult mice (19–30 g) were anesthetized with 2% halothane for induction and were maintained on 1% halothane. A midline incision was made on the ventral surface of the neck, and the right external carotid and common carotid arteries were isolated and ligated. The internal carotid artery and the pterygopalatine artery were temporarily occluded. An 8-0 nylon monofilament coated with silicone was introduced into the extracranial internal carotid artery through an incision in the common carotid arteries and carefully advanced approximately 10 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation, beyond the origin of the middle cerebral artery. After suturing the incision, anesthesia was withdrawn and the animals allowed to recover for up to 72 h. NOS-2 protein was detected in paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue using a rabbit anti-mouse NOS-2 polyclonal antibody (1:100, Transduction Laboratories) that recognizes the C-terminal region of the NOS-2 isoform. Immunohistochemistry was performed with only slight modifications of standard immunoperoxidase techniques suggested by Oncogene Science Inc. Immunoreactivity was detected using an avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase complex kit (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) along with a peroxidase substrate kit using nickel-enhanced 3,3′diaminobenzidine as substrate following the manufacturer's recommendations. All sections were additionally counterstained with toluidine blue (0.5% aqueous, acidified with 0.2% glacial acetic acid) and eosin (0.5% aqueous) and coverslipped. To assist in the determination of cell types expressing NOS-2 protein, adjacent sections were labeled with cell-specific markers; a mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (1:200, Sigma) was used to identify astrocytes, and a rat anti-mouse F4/80 polyclonal antibody (1:100, Serotec Ltd.) was used to recognize monocytes and macrophages. Total cellular RNA was isolated from approximately 100–150 mg (wet weight) of tissue with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Precipitated RNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 75% ethanol, and allowed to air dry. RNA was redissolved in RNase-free water and precipitated with 0.6 volumes of 2 m sodium acetate and 3 volumes of 100% ethanol for storage at −70 °C. Prior to reverse transcription, RNA precipitates were recovered by centrifugation, washed with 75% ethanol, redissolved in RNase-free water, and quantitated. First strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using SuperscriptTM II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.); conditions were optimized for the various oligonucleotide primers used. Specific PCR primers were designed to identify portions of the NOS-2 mRNA that persisted in the gene-deficient mice and therefore span the entire cDNA sequence. Typically, the primers were known to span at least one intron, and therefore amplification of genomic DNA would have resulted in a PCR product much larger than that generated by amplification of cDNA. Where exon/intron boundaries were unknown, amplification of genomic DNA was controlled either by treatment with DNase prior to RT, or the PCR included a control sample in which all components of the RT reaction were included except for the reverse transcriptase. Primary glial cell cultures from cortices of neonatal NOS-2 +/+ and −/− mice were obtained as described previously (11Murphy S. Conn P.M. Cell Culture. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 33-47Google Scholar). This was performed as described previously (12Chiang C.-S. Stalder A. Samimi A. Campbell I.L. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In all reactions, a probe for the transcript for ribosomal protein L32 was included to control for RNA loading. For quantification, autoradiographs were scanned (densitometry imager; Bio-Rad), and band densities were determined using imaging software (Molecular Analysis; Bio-Rad). Densities of the transcripts are expressed as a ratio to the transcript for L32. This was performed essentially as described by Kim et al. (13Kim H.-H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the lysis buffer contained 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were first incubated with a specific monoclonal antibody directed against a C-terminal peptide fragment of NOS-2 (Transduction Laboratories) and then with protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was immunostained with the same NOS-2 monoclonal antibody (1:500), using ECL luminography for detection. In wild-type (+/+) mice, immunohistochemistry performed with a specific C-terminal antibody revealed NOS-2 expression in both infiltrating cells and also in resident astrocytes after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In gene-deficient (−/−) mice, immunoreactivity was detected 24 h postocclusion in the infarcted hemisphere in infiltrating inflammatory cells (Fig.2 A). Later, at 72 h after MCAO, immunostaining was still evident, but was additionally seen in cells surrounding the infarct that morphologically resemble astrocytes (Fig. 2 B). This pattern of expression was identical, spatially and temporally, to that seen in wild-type mice following MCAO. 2A. K. Loihl, V. Asensio, I. L. Campbell, and S. Murphy, submitted for publication. As no immunolabeling was observed in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere at any time point, expression of the altered gene product appeared to be restricted to the ischemic hemisphere. No immunoreactivity was detected in tissue from normal −/− mouse brain (data not shown), suggesting that the altered NOS-2 gene was not constitutively activated. We used RT-PCR both to verify expression of the disrupted NOS-2 gene following MCAO, and also in an attempt to determine the extent of the resulting transcript. Residual transcription of the NOS-2 gene was sought using multiple pairings of NOS-2-specific PCR primers. Using primers corresponding to sequences downstream of exon 4, a 692-bp portion of the NOS-2 mRNA was detected following MCAO in both +/+ and −/− mice (Fig. 3). However, primers upstream of the exon 4/5 boundary (bases 484/485, GenBankTMaccession no. M84373) generated a 745-bp product in +/+ but not −/− mice. A product of 858 bp from the 3′ region of the NOS-2 transcript was also detected in +/+ and −/− mice. Sequencing verified the nucleotide identity with NOS-2 of three different PCR products from −/− mice, generated with primer pairs located 5′ (bases 489–1181), 3′ (bases 3121–3650), and in the middle of the cDNA (bases 2605–2820). Transcription of the disrupted NOS-2 gene was additionally verified in ischemic animals by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) using a specific 275-bp NOS-2 cRNA probe, complimentary to a region starting 800 bp downstream from the translational start site. Evidence for transcriptional activation of the NOS-2 gene was found in both −/− and +/+ mice at 6, 24, and 48 h following MCAO, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the infarct (Fig.4 A). Quantitation of the NOS-2 transcript revealed somewhat similar expression in the ischemic hemispheres of both mouse genotypes. If anything, loss of the proximal promoter region in NOS-2 −/− mice correlated with faster onset and/or more extensive expression. A period of cerebral ischemia is immediately followed by the induction of genes encoding for proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNFα. Assuming that the +/+ and −/− NOS-2 genes are induced by similar mechanisms, we tested the ability of various combinations of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as hypoxia, to induce the altered gene in mixed glial cultures. Although the known hypoxia response element in the NOS-2 promoter is deleted in the genetically altered mice, we thought that another site might exist more distally. With this in mind, we tested the responsiveness of the altered gene to hypoxic conditions and to stimuli (IFN-γ and the iron chelator desferrioxamine) shown to induce the NOS-2 gene in macrophages through a hypoxia response element (14Melillo G. Taylor L.S. Brooks A. Musso T. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12236-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The disrupted NOS-2 gene transcript was detected, using RPA, in glial cells that had been exposed to a mixture of cytokines, but not in response to other stimuli (Fig. 4 B). A protein product could also be detected in immunoprecipitates from lysates of cytokine-activated cells (Fig. 4 C). This protein was smaller than that of NOS-2 in wild-type cells (131 kDa) and displayed a molecular mass (approximately 112 kDa) similar to that predicted if the first 113 amino acids of NOS-2 were absent (116 kDa). In similar cell cultures exposed to the cytokine mixture, we determined nitrite accumulation in the medium, using the Griess reaction. Detectable NO production was only found in cells derived from wild-type animals, indicating a loss of NOS-2 function in −/− mice (data not shown). As neo has its own promoter (PGK), we predicted that it should be expressed in −/− mice, even though it was inserted into the NOS-2 construct in the reverse orientation. With the same primer pair used for genotyping mice, and using RT-PCR, we were able to amplify a product from DNase-treated RNA derived from −/− mice (Fig.5). In cells from −/− mice, a mixture of cytokines also induced expression of neo, as determined by northern hybridization using a specific probe. Only one transcript was detected, and it was of a size corresponding to neo mRNA (data not shown). The expression of cytokine and other inflammation-related genes was examined to evaluate possible variations in the inflammatory reaction in −/− mice. Multiprobe RPA analysis was performed on RNA isolated from infarcted and contralateral hemispheres in order to detect transcripts for the cellular response genes ICAM-1, A20, Mac-1, EB22, and glial fibrillary acidic protein and for the cytokines TNF-β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, IL-1α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-3. Increased expression of Mac-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein genes is indicative of activation of macrophages/microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Expression of EB22, an acute-phase response gene, was detected as early as 6 h and was increased at 24 and 48 h postocclusion. Induction of the gene for the cellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 was also apparent in NOS-2 −/− mice. Quantification revealed similar ischemic induction of ICAM-1 and Mac-1 in both genotypes at all times following permanent MCAO (Fig.6). Transcript for IL-1β, a potent inducer of the NOS-2 gene, was markedly elevated in ischemic hemispheres of wild-type and NOS-2-deficient mice, whereas expression of IL-6 and TNF-α was increased to a lesser extent (Fig.7). Minimal or no induction was seen for the other cytokine genes.Figure 7Expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes after MCAO in NOS-2 +/+ and −/− mice. RNA from both infarcted (right) and noninfarcted (left) hemispheres was probed by RPA for IL-1β (A), IL-6 (B), and TNFα (C) at the indicated times following MCAO. Densitometric analysis of autoradiograms was performed using Molecular Analysis imaging software. Mean values (as a ratio to L32) for 2–4 mice are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have found that mice with a disruption of the NOS-2 gene can undergo tissue-specific transcription, and translation of a NOS-incompetent product, despite the absence of exons 1–4 and proximal regions of the promoter considered to be essential for activation.In vitro investigation into the responsiveness of this gene to endotoxin, proinflammatory cytokines, and hypoxia have identified the promoter sequences required for induction, many of which are absent in the gene-deficient mouse. However, the 5′ flanking region of the mouse NOS-2 gene contains sequences of DNA of which the function is not yet known, and studies using reporter constructs are limited by the amount upstream that has been sequenced to date. Therefore, the regulatory mechanisms that occur in vivo might be complex and may be oversimplified by in vitro representation. Because they exhibit a truncated but active promoter, these −/− mice provide a unique opportunity to study NOS-2 gene regulation in vivo. Mice with targeted deletions in the NOS-1 (15Huang P.L.

Although gene disruption is designed to result in a null allele, this is not always the case, and the resulting mice may produce a nonfunctional gene product, a truncated product, or alternatively spliced products (19Bronson S.K. Smithies O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27155-27158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, generation of an inactive product is specifically designed, as this mimics the effects of pharmacological inhibition. Mice deficient for the NOS-1 gene showed residual NOS activity, indicating the presence of splice variants (20Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). In the NOS-2-deficient mice generated by Wei et al. (16Wei X. Charles I.G. Smith A. Ure J. Feng G. Huang F. Xu D. Muller W. Moncada S. Liew F.Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), an attempt to delete the first five exons of the gene failed, and a genomic rearrangement occurred. From this genomic alteration there resulted an aberrant transcript larger than wild-type NOS-2 mRNA, but reportedly, this was not translated into a functional NOS. The targeting strategy for another NOS-2-deficient mouse involved replacement, with the neomycin resistance gene, of exons 12 and 13, which encode the calmodulin-binding domain (17Laubach V.E. Shesely E.G. Smithies O. Sherman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10688-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Low levels of two abnormal transcripts were detected, and both contained sequences of neo. Although immunoblotting revealed no detectable NOS-2 protein, a low level of NO-producing activity was observed. In the mice used here, a gene replacement vector was designed to delete the proximal 585 bases of the promoter, as well as exons 1–4. Because the proximal portion of the promoter was previously shown in vitro to be required for NOS-2 induction in macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide, and because exon 2 contains the translational start site, homologous recombination of the targeting vector with the NOS-2 gene was predicted to interfere with both transcription and translation. Screening of NOS-2-deficient mice for mRNA, protein, and NOS activity indicated that the gene had been inactivated (10MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). However, this screening was performed on organ blots following lipopolysaccharide injection, or on isolated macrophages stimulated with various combinations of lipopolysaccharide, TNFα, IFN-α/β, and IFN-γ. As activation of the NOS-2 gene via these stimuli has been shown to be dependent upon the proximal portion of the NOS-2 promoter (8Xie Q. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), induction of the disrupted gene would not be predicted. We have shown here that glial cells from gene-deficient mice did not express the aberrant transcript under such conditions. However, both a transcript and a protein product could be detected when a cytokine mixture was used, although there was no evidence for a NOS function. When gene targeting is designed to modify or delete regulatory DNA sequences, the activity of the marker gene should be considered as it brings its own promoter and enhancer (21Rajewsky K. Gu H. Kuhn R. Betz U.A.K. Muller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Although we have shown thatneo is expressed in NOS-2 −/− mice following cerebral ischemia, and in cytokine-activated glial cells, we believe it is activation of the remaining (distal) NOS-2 promoter region that is responsible. The temporal and spatial expression of the disrupted gene product following cerebral ischemia is identical to that in the wild-type, suggesting a similar mechanism of induction. Less than 2 kilobase pairs of the 5′ flanking DNA of the murine NOS-2 gene has been sequenced. It is possible that unidentified promoter response elements could be involved in the activation of both the disrupted and the wild-type gene in response to focal ischemia. By comparison, the human NOS-2 gene has important regulatory elements extending 16 kilobase pairs upstream (22De Vera M.E. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Mudgett J.S. Simmons R.L. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the remaining transcription element consensus sequences mediate expression by some mechanism(s) previously undetected by in vitro study. The NOS-2 protein is a dimeric, bidomain enzyme with iron protoporphyrin IX, flavin adenine dinucleotide, flavin mononucleotide, and tetrahydrobiopterin as bound prosthetic groups (23Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The enzyme has an N-terminal oxygenase domain, containing binding sites forl-arginine and heme, and a C-terminal reductase domain that binds FMN, FAD, and NADPH. When NOS-2 is cleaved at the junction of the oxygenase and reductase domains, the resulting protein fragments remain catalytically active but unable to generate NO (24Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Activity of NOS-2 is dependent upon dimerization, and recent evidence has identified amino acids 66–114 of the oxygenase domain as required for dimeric interaction (25Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Exons 2–4 of the NOS-2 gene, deleted in the deficient mice, encode the first 100 amino acid residues of the NOS-2 protein. Although the native translational initiation site is located in exon 2, an ATG codon at bases 524–526 could potentially act as a translational start site in the gene-disrupted mice. If so, then the disrupted gene would be translated in the same open reading frame and, using the same termination codon as the wild-type gene, generate a truncated protein lacking the N-terminal 113 amino acid residues. We have found evidence, using an antibody against the C terminus, for the translation of a truncated protein both in ischemic NOS-2-deficient mouse brain, and in cytokine-activated glial cultures. Based on the work of Ghosh et al. (25Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the lack of NO production in glial cells activated with a cytokine mixture, we conclude that this truncated protein is NOS-incompetent because of its inability to dimerize. Although translation of this altered gene product would not result in a functional NOS, alternate functions of a truncated protein cannot be ruled out. The reductase domain of NOS is capable of catalyzing the transfer of electrons from NADPH to a variety of exogenous acceptors, including cytochrome c and dioxygen. The NOS-1 protein can reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide (26Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the reductase domain is both necessary and sufficient for this reaction (27Miller R.T. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Nishimura J.S. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15277-15284Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although NADPH oxidation by NOS-1 is not influenced by the substrate arginine, the rate of oxidation by NOS-2 increases in the presence of substrate (28Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Recent evidence, though, suggests that the NOS reductase domains are actually poor superoxide generators, as they are slow to transfer electrons to dissolved O2 (23Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). It is therefore predicted that although the truncated protein might catalyze a superoxide dismutase-insensitive reduction of cytochrome c or similar artificial electron acceptors, NADPH oxidation leading to superoxide formation is unlikely (29Mayer B. Hemmens B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 477-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The serendipitous finding that the disrupted NOS-2 gene can be expressed, despite the absence of four exons and important promoter response elements, has several implications. This NOS-2-deficient mouse can contribute important insights into the regulation of the gene and to structure-function aspects of the NOS enzymes. The residual expression of the disrupted gene challenges the idea that proximal promoter sequences are obligatory for induction. These mice provide a unique opportunity to study the molecular and physiological effects of both a truncated NOS-2 promoter and protein in intact animals following neurodegeneration, trauma, and viral infection, conditions in which the NO from NOS-2 is proposed to play a role (7Loihl A.K. Murphy S. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 118: 253-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thank John MacMicking and Carl Nathan for providing the NOS-2-deficient mice, Michael Moskowitz and Zhihong Huang for advice regarding surgery, Carrie Kincaid for performing the ribonuclease protection assays, and James Hynes and Hsin Lee Lin for maintaining the mouse colony and genotyping, respectively."

Prokaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are:RNAP, RNA polymerase; Eς28, ς28 holoenzyme.1The abbreviations used are:RNAP, RNA polymerase; Eς28, ς28 holoenzyme. is a multimeric enzyme consisting of the core subunits, α2ββ′ (E), and a ς factor (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K.F. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The ς factor is responsible for directing the recognition and binding of specific promoter DNA consensus sequences by holoenzyme (α2ββ′ς) and for facilitating transcription initiation (2Travers A.A. Burgess R.R. Nature. 1969; 222: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 3Losick R. Pero J. Cell. 1981; 25: 582-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Many different ς factors have been identified, and they fall into two major categories, those similar toEscherichia coli ς70 and those similar to ς54 (4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The ς70 family can be further subdivided into primary and alternative ς factors (5Stragier P. Parsot C. Bouvier J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Primary ς factors are essential and required for the expression of housekeeping genes in vegetative cells, whereas alternative ς factors are activated in response to environmental changes and in programming developmental pathways (4Lonetto M.

Promoters recognized by the ς70 family consist of conserved hexamers at −35 and −10 with respect to the start site of transcription (8Harley C.B. Reynolds R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2343-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Additional DNA contacts are made at some promoters by the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNAP at an AT-rich region between −38 and −59 called the UP element (9Estrem S.T. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gribskov M. Gross C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Region 1.1 inhibits ς70 from binding to the DNA in the absence of the core subunits (10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and is also required for efficient progression from the earliest RNAP·DNA complex to a transcriptionally active complex during initiation (11Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Deleting regions 1.1 and 1.2 of ς70 results in transcriptional arrest after initial binding of RNAP to the promoter (11Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Regions 2.1, 2.2, and 3.2 are important for core binding (12Lesley S.A. Burgess R.R.

Regions 1.2, 2, and 4 are found in almost all ς factors, but region 1.1 is found only in the primary ς factors (4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both regions 1.1 and 1.2 are absent in the Salmonella typhimurium alternative ς factor required for flagellum biosynthesis, ς28, hinting at potential variation in the structure of Eς28·DNA complexes or in the mechanism of transcription initiation.Initiation can be described as a series of sequential steps, which have been well characterized for both Eς70 and Eς32 from E. coli (27Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C. 2 Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar). By varying the conditions, several intermediates can be visualized using footprinting methods. RNAP (R) binds to the promoter (P) to form an initial closed complex, RPC1, which protects the DNA from approximately −60 to −5 relative to the start point of transcription. RPC1 isomerizes to a second closed complex (RPC2) that maintains the upstream contacts and extends further downstream of the transcription start site to +20. RPC2 then undergoes strand opening to form an open complex, RPO, whereas the length of the footprint is unchanged. There is evidence for more than one open complex, which is dependent on the presence or absence of Mg2+ (28Suh W.-C. Ross W. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1993; 259: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Zaychikov E. Denissova L. Meier T. Gotte M. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RPOenters the initiation stage, or RPinit, in the presence of initiating nucleotides. Short transcripts of 2–12 nucleotides in length (abortive products) are synthesized while RNAP remains at the promoter. RNAP then enters into the elongation phase of transcription upon promoter clearance and ς factor release. Several of these intermediate complexes have been visualized by performing DNase I and KMnO4 footprinting experiments over a range of temperatures, with the rationale that temperature-dependent complexes represent time-dependent events (30Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol.

Ohya Y. Iino T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 741-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ς28, encoded by thefliA gene, is expressed late in flagellum biosynthesis and is required for transcription of all class III genes includingfliC, encoding flagellin, the primary component of the flagellar filament (34Ohnishi K. Kutsukake K. Suzuki H. Iino T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 221: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and flgM, encoding the ς28 anti-ς factor (35Gillen K.L. Hughes K.T. J.

In this report, we have characterized transcription initiation by RNA polymerase carrying theS. typhimurium ς factor, ς28, on variants of the flagellin (fliC) promoter. We detected intermediate complexes formed by Eς28 during initiation that are distinct from those characterized for other holoenzymes. Initial binding to the promoter does not require the −10 element, but further extension of the RNA polymerase-DNA contacts and isomerization to the open complex demand the presence of the −10 sequence. We propose an alternative mode of promoter recognition and binding as compared with other well characterized holoenzymes.DISCUSSIONTranscription initiation has been characterized as a multistep process in studies in which intermediates on the pathway to formation of an initiated complex have been detected by manipulating the temperature of incubation and varying the level of Mg2+ for the RNAP-promoter interactions (30Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol.

There is evidence for two different closed complexes (RPC1 and RPC2), which differ in the extent of their contacts with the promoter DNA. RPC1, which extends from approximately −60 to −5, is only observed at low temperatures (0 °C) for Eς70 (30Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Eς32 (31Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Mecsas J. Cowing D.W. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that derivatives of ς70 with region 1.1 or both regions 1.1 and 1.2 removed slow the initiation process such that RPC1 can be detected at 37 °C (11Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).We have investigated the mechanism of transcription initiation by holoenzyme carrying ς28, the alternative ς factor required for flagellum biosynthesis in S. typhimurium. Our analysis was conducted using the promoter for fliC, encoding flagellin, a late gene in this pathway. The identity and stability of transcription complex intermediates that we identified during transcription initiation by Eς28 are distinctive from those previously identified for Eς70 and Eς32.Based on our results, we suggest the following pathway for the mechanism of Eς28 transcription initiation (Fig.7). Eς28 forms a short complex with pfliC at 0 °C that protects primarily the upstream region of the promoter (−65 to −19) from DNase I digestion. This suggests that the initial binding of Eς28 is mediated mainly through interactions in the vicinity of the −35 consensus sequence. Eς28 then isomerizes to make additional contacts that extend to +20. During this progression, some upstream contacts are lost as evidenced by the reappearance of bands from −65 to −54 on the DNase I footprints at 25 and 37 °C. Thus, Eς28 appears to initially bind in the −35 region and then shifts downstream to contact the −10 region, start site, and downstream sequences to +20 while relinquishing some of the original upstream contacts. This represents a notable difference in binding intermediates from those observed for Eς70 or Eς32.Figure 7Schematic of the mechanism for transcription initiation by Eς28. RNA polymerase (R) binds to the promoter DNA (P) to form a closed complex (RPC), which extends from −65 to −19. Extension of the downstream contacts to +17 and release of upstream contacts occur concomitantly with open complex formation (RPO). Regions of full protection are indicated by black bars. Partial protection is indicated by dashed lines. The thymidine residues sensitive to KMnO4 modification in the open complex are indicated (▵).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The identity of RPC versus RPOcomplexes was assessed by KMnO4 sensitivity, which probes for DNA strand separation. Typically, significant open complex formation for Eς70 or Eς32 requires temperatures above 16 °C (27Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C. 2 Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar, 30Kovacic R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13654-13661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One distinctive characteristic of Eς28·fliC complexes is that they are optimally strand-separated between –9 and +1 even at 16 °C. Thus, the extended DNase I protection observed at 16 °C is representative of RPO, rather than an extended closed complex like RPC2. Thus, one major difference between Eς28 intermediates and those found for Eς70or Eς32 from E. coli is the absence of a detectable RPC2-like complex under the conditions that we used. Eς28 appears to form a single closed complex characterized by a short DNase I footprint at 0–4 °C and then progresses to RPO. If an RPC2 complex forms, it may be too rapid or unstable to be detected with the methods employed in this study.Because Eς28 is functionally similar to the B. subtilis holoenzyme that is required for flagellin biosynthesis, EςD, we compared the transcription initiation complexes formed by these two enzymes at their respective flagellin promoters. The flagellin gene promoter (phag) from B. subtilis is very similar to pfliC, except it contains an UP element between −60 and −40 that provides additional contact sites for RNAP through the α subunit (57Fredrick K. Helmann J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4982-4987Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). EςD forms complexes that are more similar to Eς70 and Eς32 because, at 4 °C, the DNase I footprint occupies from −73 to +1 (55Chen Y.-F. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This protection then extends to +9 and +21 at 23 and 37 °C, respectively. Disappearance of the upstream contacts, which is observed for Eς28, does not occur. Thus, DNA binding primarily in the −35 and upstream regions in the earliest detectable complex, with lack of contact in the −10 region, appears to be novel for Eς28.With respect to open complex formation, however, Eς28 and EςD share the ability to generate strand-separated promoter regions at low temperatures. At 16 °C, Eς28displays the same degree of open complex formation that is observed at 37 °C, but forms only closed complexes at 4 °C. EςDbegins to show DNA distortions in the −10 region at temperatures as low as 4 °C; however, the region of strand melting propagates unidirectionally as a function of temperature, forming three distinct open complex intermediates (55Chen Y.-F. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas the reactivity of bases in the Eς28 open complex remains the same from 16 to 37 °C, with no indication of directional movement.We used challenge with the polyanionic competitor heparin as a tool to assess the relative stability of open (RPO) and initiated (RPinit) complexes. Eς28·fliCopen complexes are unstable to even low levels of heparin in the presence or absence of initiating NTPs. In contrast, many Eς70 open complexes are stable to heparin even in the absence of NTPs (11Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 48Duval-Valentin G. Ehrlich R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 49Melancon P. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4318-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 50Roe J. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 51Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Eς28 appears to form transcriptionally competent complexes that remain dissociable throughout the initiation process. We cannot rule out that Eς28 may form heparin-resistant complexes on other ς28-dependent promoters or that heparin is actively destabilizing these complexes. However, the information from these studies is useful in comparing the relative stability of holoenzymes carrying different ς factors.In the case of ς70, it has been shown that amino-terminal region 1.1 is involved in inhibition of DNA binding by ς (10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 56Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and is required for efficient open complex formation by holoenzyme. Region 1.2, which is typically present in all primary and alternative ς factors, may also be involved in open complex formation for Eς70 (11Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ς28 is a very unusual member of the ς70 family of proteins since it lacks any homology to region 1.2, leading to some speculation regarding how this difference in structure may translate into a difference in function. The flagellar biosynthesis ς factor from B. subtilis, ςD, retains homology to region 1.2. EςD forms two closed complexes and isomerizes through several open complex intermediates (55Chen Y.-F. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ς28, on the other hand, lacks both regions 1.1 and 1.2. Eς28 forms an unusually short RPC1, and we did not observe an RPC2-like intermediate. Additionally, many Eς70 open complexes are stable to heparin either in the absence or presence of NTPs, and open complexes do not form efficiently at low temperatures, whereas the opposite is true in both cases for Eς28. The composition of the amino terminus of the ς factor may affect the nature of the RNAP·DNA complexes that can be discerned during initiation. ς28 appears to facilitate transcription initiation at pfliC very efficiently by utilizing a mechanism with few intermediate complexes, but with reduced stability of the open complex. Whether this mechanism is a general phenomenon for all ς28-dependent promoters or whether it is characteristic for the flagellin gene promoter remains to be determined. Prokaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are:RNAP, RNA polymerase; Eς28, ς28 holoenzyme.1The abbreviations used are:RNAP, RNA polymerase; Eς28, ς28 holoenzyme. is a multimeric enzyme consisting of the core subunits, α2ββ′ (E), and a ς factor (1Burgess R.R. Travers A.A. Dunn J.J. Bautz E.K.F. Nature. 1969; 221: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The ς factor is responsible for directing the recognition and binding of specific promoter DNA consensus sequences by holoenzyme (α2ββ′ς) and for facilitating transcription initiation (2Travers A.A. Burgess R.R. Nature. 1969; 222: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 3Losick R. Pero J. Cell. 1981; 25: 582-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Many different ς factors have been identified, and they fall into two major categories, those similar toEscherichia coli ς70 and those similar to ς54 (4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The ς70 family can be further subdivided into primary and alternative ς factors (5Stragier P. Parsot C. Bouvier J. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Primary ς factors are essential and required for the expression of housekeeping genes in vegetative cells, whereas alternative ς factors are activated in response to environmental changes and in programming developmental pathways (4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 6Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 7Gross C.A. Lonetto M. Losick R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 129-176Google Scholar). Promoters recognized by the ς70 family consist of conserved hexamers at −35 and −10 with respect to the start site of transcription (8Harley C.B. Reynolds R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2343-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Additional DNA contacts are made at some promoters by the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNAP at an AT-rich region between −38 and −59 called the UP element (9Estrem S.T. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9761-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of members of the ς70 family reveals four highly conserved regions with subdomains that have been implicated in specific functions (Fig.1) (4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Region 1.1 inhibits ς70 from binding to the DNA in the absence of the core subunits (10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and is also required for efficient progression from the earliest RNAP·DNA complex to a transcriptionally active complex during initiation (11Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Deleting regions 1.1 and 1.2 of ς70 results in transcriptional arrest after initial binding of RNAP to the promoter (11Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Regions 2.1, 2.2, and 3.2 are important for core binding (12Lesley S.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7728-7734Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 13Zhou Y.N. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5005-5012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Joo D.M. Ng N. Calendar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and region 2.3 has been implicated in promoter melting (15Jones C.H. Moran Jr., C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1958-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Jones C.H. Tatti K.M. Moran Jr., C.P. J.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5218-5224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both holoenzyme and the ς factor interact with non-template bases in the −10 element to stabilize the open complex (19Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Huang X. Lopez de Saro F.J. Helmann J.D.

Regions 2.4 and 4.2 are responsible for contacting the –10 and –35 promoter recognition elements, respectively, and for positioning holoenzyme for initiation (10Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar,22Gardella T.H. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol.

Regions 1.2, 2, and 4 are found in almost all ς factors, but region 1.1 is found only in the primary ς factors (4Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both regions 1.1 and 1.2 are absent in the Salmonella typhimurium alternative ς factor required for flagellum biosynthesis, ς28, hinting at potential variation in the structure of Eς28·DNA complexes or in the mechanism of transcription initiation. Initiation can be described as a series of sequential steps, which have been well characterized for both Eς70 and Eς32 from E. coli (27Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C. 2 Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar). By varying the conditions, several intermediates can be visualized using footprinting methods. RNAP (R) binds to the promoter (P) to form an initial closed complex, RPC1, which protects the DNA from approximately −60 to −5 relative to the start point of transcription. RPC1 isomerizes to a second closed complex (RPC2) that maintains the upstream contacts and exten"
https://openalex.org/W1585121773,"Two chimeric proteins, consisting of the B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin with different peptides fused to the COOH-terminal ends, have been crystallized and their three-dimensional structure determined. The two extensions correspond to (a) a nonapeptide representing the COOH-terminal sequence of the small subunit of herpes simplex virus type 1 ribonucleotide reductase and (b) a 27-amino acid long peptide, corresponding to the COOH-terminal end of the catalytic subunit (POL) of DNA polymerase from the same virus. Both proteins crystallize in the P41212 space group with one pentameric molecule per asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of about 75%. The overall conformation of the B subunit pentamer in the two chimeric proteins, which consists of five identical polypeptide chains, is very similar to that in the native AB complex and conforms strictly to 5-fold symmetry. On the contrary, the peptide extensions are essentially disordered: in the case of the nonapeptide, only 5 and 6 amino acids were, respectively, positioned in two monomers, while in the other three only 2 residues are ordered. The extension is fully confined to the surface of the pentamer opposite to the face that interacts with the membrane and consequently it does not interfere with the ability of the B subunit to interact with membrane receptors. Moreover, the conformational flexibility of the two peptide extensions could be correlated to their propensity for proteolytic processing and consequent release of a biologically active molecule into cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036622222,"Hb Chico is an unusual human hemoglobin variant that has lowered oxygen affinity, but unaltered cooperativity and anion sensitivity. Previous studies showed these features to be associated with distal-side heme pocket alterations that confer increased structural rigidity on the molecule and that increase water content in the β-chain heme pocket. We report here that the extent of nanosecond geminate rebinding of oxygen to the variant and its isolated β-chains is appreciably decreased. Structural alterations in this variant decrease its oxygen recombination rates without significantly altering rates of migration out of the heme pocket. Data analysis indicates that one or more barriers that impede rebinding of oxygen from docking sites in the heme pocket are increased, with less consequence for CO rebinding. Resonance Raman spectra show no significant alterations in spectral regions sensitive to interactions between the heme iron and the proximal histidine residue, confirming that the functional differences in the variant are due to distal-side heme pocket alterations. These effects are discussed in the context of a schematic representation of heme pocket wells and barriers that could aid the design of novel hemoglobins with altered ligand affinity without loss of the normal allosteric responses that facilitate unloading of oxygen to respiring tissues."
