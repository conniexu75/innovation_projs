https://openalex.org/W1547453377,"Ecologists still search for common principles that predict well-known responses of biological diversity to different factors. Such factors include the number of available niches in space, productivity, area, species' body size and habitat fragmentation. Here we show that all these patterns can arise from simple constraints on how organisms acquire resources in space. We use spatial scaling laws to describe how species of different sizes find food in patches of varying size and resource concentration. We then derive a mathematical rule for the minimum similarity in size of species that share these resources. This packing rule yields a theory of species diversity that predicts relations between diversity and productivity more effectively than previous models. Size and diversity patterns for locally coexisting East African grazing mammals and North American savanna plants strongly support these predictions. The theory also predicts relations between diversity and area and between diversity and habitat fragmentation. Thus, spatial scaling laws provide potentially unifying first principles that may explain many important patterns of species diversity."

Face recognition is particularly impaired by reversing contrast polarity of the image, even though this preserves all edges and spatial frequencies. Here, combined influences of familiarity and priming on face processing were examined as contrast polarity was manipulated. Our fMRI results show that bilateral posterior areas in fusiform gyrus responded more strongly for faces with positive than with negative contrast polarity. An anterior, right-lateralized fusiform region is activated when a given face stimulus becomes recognizable as a well-known individual."

Grb7 is an Src homology (SH) 2-containing and pleckstrin homology domain-containing molecule, which shares significant homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans gene for Mig-10 involved in cell migration during embryogenesis. Here, we report that the SH2 domain of Grb7 can directly interact with FAK through Tyr-397, a major autophosphorylation site in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is cell adhesion-dependent, suggesting that the FAK-Grb7 complex is involved in integrin signaling. Using tetracycline-regulated expression system, we showed that overexpression of Grb7 enhanced cell migration toward fibronectin, whereas overexpression of its SH2 domain alone inhibited cell migration. In addition, we found that phosphorylation of FAK or p130cas was not affected by the expression of either Grb7 or its SH2 domain alone, suggesting that Grb7 is downstream of FAK and does not compete with Src for binding to FAK in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that the FAK-Grb7 complex plays a role in cell migration stimulated by integrin signaling through FAK.

FAK is localized to focal contacts in many adherent cells, and it rapidly becomes activated and autophosphorylated following cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins or integrin clustering by antibodies (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H.

FAK interactions with these and potentially other proteins are believed to mediate the functions of FAK in integrin-dependent signal transduction.Recent studies have suggested several roles for integrin signaling through FAK in regulation of cell survival (19Frisch S.M.

Using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a model system, we have previously shown that overexpression of FAK stimulated cell migration and mutation of Tyr-397 to Phe abolished its ability to promote cell migration (25Cary L.A. Chang J. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have identified p130cas as a downstream mediator of FAK-Src family kinases in the regulation of cell migration (26Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-397 has also been found to be necessary for FAK to promote cell spreading (27Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), survival (19Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These studies implicate a key role for FAK complexes with Src family kinases and/or other signaling molecules at Tyr-397 in integrin-mediated signal transduction.Grb7 is a member of an emerging family of signaling proteins that include Grb7, Grb10, and Grb14 (28Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Ooi J. Yajnik V.

The family members have a highly conserved structure: the NH2-terminal region has proline-rich motifs, the central region has a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and the COOH-terminal region has an SH2 domain. Consistent with their domain structures, Grb7 family proteins have been shown to interact with a variety of other proteins, including tyrosine kinase receptors and proto-oncogenes (32Stein D. Wu J.

In addition, the central domain of Grb7 family proteins contains a region of >300 amino acids that shows a high homology to a Caenorhabditis elegans gene, mig-10 (29Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar, 32Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A.W. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M.

Biol. 1997; 184: 150-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Mig-10 protein has been shown to be involved in long range migration of neuronal cells in embryonic development (41Manser J. Wood W.B. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This suggests a possible role for Grb7 in the regulation of migration of mammalian cells.In this paper, we present results showing a direct interaction of Grb7 with FAK at Tyr-397 and a potential role for FAK-Grb7 complex in cell migration stimulated by integrin signaling through FAK.RESULTSPrevious studies have shown that upon cell adhesion FAK is autophosphorylated and associated with a number of SH2 domain-containing molecules, such as Src, Grb2, and PI3K (7Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanisms of signaling pathways initiated by integrin activated-FAK, we investigated potential FAK interactions with additional SH2 domain-containing proteins. Cell lysates were prepared from either suspended or attached CHO cells and then incubated with various GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads. The bound proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FAK. As shown in Fig. 1 A, FAK from attached cells bound GST fusion protein containing the Grb7 SH2 domain (GST-Grb7.SH2) but not GST alone. In contrast, FAK from suspended cells did not bind to either GST-Grb7.SH2 or GST. Similar experiments indicated that the Grb7 SH2 domain did not bind to another tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, c-Src, from either suspended or attached cells (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrated a specific FAK interaction with the Grb7 SH2 domain in vitro in a cell adhesion-dependent manner.Tyr-397 has been identified as the major autophosphorylation site of FAK in cell adhesion, suggesting that Grb7 SH2 domain may bind to FAK at Tyr-397. Alternatively, adhesion-dependent Src binding to Tyr-397 of FAK could lead to phosphorylation of FAK at other tyrosine residues, creating binding sites for the Grb7 SH2 domain (13Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar,44Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

To distinguish these two possibilities, a synthetic phosphopeptide Tyr(P)-397 (12-mer containing phosphorylated Tyr-397 and its flanking sequences) was tested for its ability to inhibit FAK binding to GST-Grb7.SH2 in vitro. Fig.2 A shows that the phosphopeptide Tyr(P)-397 decreased FAK binding to GST-Grb7.SH2 in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, it also inhibited FAK binding to GST-Src.SH2 (Fig. 2 B). The IC50values to inhibit FAK-GST-Grb7.SH2 and FAK-GST-Src.SH2 associations were approximately 30 and 3 μm, respectively. A control peptide corresponding to the carboxyl 15 residues of FAK did not inhibit FAK binding to either GST-Grb7.SH2 or GST-Src.SH2 even at 560 μm. These results indicated that the Grb7 SH2 domain bound to phosphorylated Tyr-397 of FAK rather than other sites. Comparison of the IC50 also suggested an apparently stronger FAK interaction with GST-Grb7.SH2 than GST-Src.SH2.Figure 2Inhibition of Grb7-FAK binding by a phosphopeptide containing Tyr-397. Immobilized GST-Grb7.SH2 (A) or GST-Src.SH2 (B) was preincubated with phosphopeptide Tyr(P)-397 at different concentrations as indicated. It was then incubated with lysates from attached CHO cells in the presence of the same concentration of Tyr(P)-397. A peptide (560 μm) corresponding to the COOH-terminal 15 residues of FAK was used as a negative control. The bound FAK was detected by Western blotting as shown in Fig. 1.

Two days after transfection, cells were lysed, and GST-Grb7 complexes were precipitated with glutathione-coupled agarose beads. The bound proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting with mAb KT3 to detect the epitope-tagged FAK (Fig.3 A). FAK and the Y925F mutant, but not the Y397F mutant, associated with Grb7 in transfected 293 cells. Neither FAK nor the Y397F mutant was precipitated when co-transfected with the pDHGST vector alone, demonstrating the specificity of FAK binding with Grb7. Western blotting of the precipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, PY-20, confirmed that Grb7-associated FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3 B). Similar expression levels for FAK and the mutants were confirmed by blotting of lysates with anti-FAK (Fig. 3 C). Consistent with these transfection studies, association of endogenous FAK and Grb7 was also detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 D).Figure 3Association of Grb7 with FAK in vivo. A–C, 293 cells were cotransfected with plasmid pDHGST (−) or pDHGST-Grb7 (+) and pCDM8-FAK, pCDM8-Y397F, or pCDM8-Y925F, as indicated. Grb7 was pulled down from the lysates using glutathione-coupled agarose beads. They were then analyzed by Western blotting with KT3 (A) or PY-20 (B). Aliquots of the lysates (whole cell lysates (WCL)) were also analyzed to verify similar expression levels of FAK (C).D, lysates from NIH 3T3 cell were immunoprecipitated (IP) by anti-Grb7 or the control rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAM).

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with phosphorylation of Tyr-397 being crucial for its activities (25Cary L.A. Chang J. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, NIH 3T3 cells with inducible overexpression of Grb7 were evaluated for their migration toward FN using modified Boyden chamber assays (Fig. 4 B), as described previously (25Cary L.A. Chang J. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little migration was observed under both induced and uninduced conditions in the absence of FN. At 1 μg/ml FN, however, induction of exogenous Grb7 expression (Fig. 4 B, open columns) caused an approximately 2-fold increase in cell migration compared with the uninduced cells (filled columns). Smaller but significant increases were also observed upon induction of exogenous Grb7 expression at higher FN concentrations. Control experiments with Mock cells transfected with pTet-Splice vector alone showed similar migration rates under both induced and uninduced conditions (Fig.4 C). These results suggested that Grb7 and possibly its binding to FAK play a role in stimulation of cell migration.To test directly the possibility that Grb7 binding to Tyr-397 of FAK is crucial for FAK-stimulated cell migration, we generated NIH 3T3 cells with inducible expression of the SH2 domain of Grb7 using the tetracycline-regulated expression system. Because Grb7 binds to FAK by its SH2 domain, overexpression of the SH2 domain alone is expected to compete with endogenous Grb7 for binding to FAK, thus acting in a dominant-negative manner. Fig.5 A shows expression of the SH2 domain of Grb7 in several clones after induction by removal of tetracycline in the media, but not under uninduced conditions. Fig.5 B shows that induction of the Grb7 SH2 domain expression reduced cell migration by approximately one-half as compared with uninduced cells at several FN concentrations. These results provided further support that Grb7 association with FAK plays a crucial role in stimulation of cell migration, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the Grb7 SH2 domain inhibited cell migration by interfering with Grb7 interactions with other proteins.Figure 5Expression of the Grb7 SH2 domain inhibits cell migration. A, lysates from several NIH 3T3 clones with inducible Grb7.SH2 expression under uninduced (U) and induced (I) conditions were analyzed by Western blotting with 12CA5. The arrow marks the position of exogenous Grb7.SH2. Molecular mass positions (in kDa) are shown on the left. B, one representative clone with inducible Grb7.SH2 expression under uninduced (filled columns) or induced (open columns) conditions were subjected to cell migration assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mean cells counts from at least 12 fields and three experiments are shown.Error bars represent S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results presented so far are consistent with the idea that Grb7 is an important downstream mediator of FAK-promoted cell migration. However, it is also possible that Grb7 functions upstream of FAK to stimulate migration of NIH 3T3 cells as observed above. To investigate this possibility, we examined the effects of induced overexpression of Grb7 or its SH2 domain on tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in these clones. Grb7 or Grb7.SH2 cells under either uninduced or induced conditions were removed from the plates and replated on either poly-l-lysine (Fig. 6, lanes PLL) or FN (lanes FN). The cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK followed by Western blotting with PY-20 (Fig. 6 A). As expected, cell adhesion to FN led to increased FAK phosphorylation. However, induction of either Grb7 or Grb7.SH2 expression did not affect the increase of FAK phosphorylation in cell adhesion when compared with uninduced cells (Fig.6 A, compare lanes I with lanes U). Western blotting of immunoprecipitates with anti-FAK verified similar amounts of FAK in all samples (Fig. 6 B). These results indicated that Grb7 functioned downstream rather than upstream of FAK in promoting cell migration.Figure 6Tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in cells with inducible expression of Grb7 or Grb7.SH2. Grb7 or Grb7.SH2 cells under uninduced (U) or induced (I) conditions were detached by trypsin and replated on FN or poly-l-lysine (PLL), as indicated.

As for FAK, tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas in cell adhesion to FN was not affected by the induced expression of either Grb7 or its SH2 domain alone (Fig.7). These results suggested that regulation of cell migration by Grb7 or Grb7.SH2 was not caused by its interfering with the known function of p130cas as a mediator of FAK-promoted cell migration.Figure 7Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130casin cells with inducible expression of Grb7 or Grb7.SH2.

Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, FAK has been shown to interact with several cytoskeletal proteins as well as other signaling molecules. Analysis of FAK mutants lacking binding sites for these proteins has implicated specific cellular functions for some of these interactions (19Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 22Zhao J. Reiske H. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 25Cary L.A.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified association of FAK with another signaling molecule Grb7. Mutational analysis and peptide competition experiments have indicated a direct binding of FAK to Grb7 through its SH2 domain. Furthermore, this interaction was dependent on cell adhesion and required the major autophosphorylation site of FAK at Tyr-397.The functional significance of the FAK-Grb7 interaction is not well understood at present. However, integrin signaling through FAK has been shown to stimulate cell migration, and autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 is critical for triggering downstream events leading to cell migration. Therefore, identification of FAK binding to Grb7 at this site raised the possibility that FAK-Grb7 interaction plays a role in FAK-stimulated cell migration. Interestingly, Grb7 shares extensive sequence homology with mig-10, a C. elegans gene implicated in cell migration in embryonic development (41Manser J. Wood W.B. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, Tanaka et al. (48Tanaka S. Mori M. Akiyoshi T. Tanaka Y. Mafune K."

We previously showed that vascular endothelial cell adhesion and migration to Cyr61 and Fisp12 (mouse CTGF) are mediated through integrin αvβ3. Both Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF are present in normal blood vessel walls, and it has been demonstrated that CTGF is overexpressed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In the present study, we examined whether Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF could serve as substrates for platelet adhesion. Agonist (ADP, thrombin, or U46619)-stimulated but not resting platelets adhered to both Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF, and this process was completely inhibited by prostaglandin I2, which prevents platelet activation. The specificity of Cyr61- and Fisp12/mCTGF-mediated platelet adhesion was demonstrated by specific inhibition of this process with polyclonal anti-Cyr61 and anti-Fisp12/mCTGF antibodies, respectively. The adhesion of ADP-activated platelets to both proteins was divalent cation-dependent and was blocked by RGDS, HHLGGAKQAGDV, or echistatin, but not by RGES. Furthermore, this process was specifically inhibited by the monoclonal antibody AP-2 (anti-αIIbβ3), but not by LM609 (anti-αvβ3), indicating that the interaction is mediated through integrin αIIbβ3. In a solid phase binding assay, activated αIIbβ3, purified by RGD affinity chromatography, bound to immobilized Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF in a dose-dependent and RGD-inhibitable manner. In contrast, unactivated αIIbβ3 failed to bind to either protein. Collectively, these findings identify Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF as two novel activation-dependent adhesive ligands for the integrin αIIbβ3 on human platelets, and implicate a functional role for these proteins in hemostasis and thrombosis.

Thus, upon vascular injury, platelets adhere to the exposed subendothelial matrix, leading to platelet aggregation caused by the binding of plasma fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor (vWf)1 to the activated platelets. Integrin αIIbβ3 is the most prominent platelet adhesion receptor, which interacts with several adhesive ligands including fibrinogen, vWf, fibronectin, and vitronectin (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Du X. Ginsberg M.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Lefkovits J. Plow E.F. Topol E.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). On resting platelets, αIIbβ3 is present in an inactive conformation incapable of binding soluble adhesive proteins. The formation of platelet agonists such as thrombin at sites of vessel injury induces platelet inside-out signaling, which leads to the binding of soluble fibrinogen and vWf to αIIbβ3, resulting in platelet aggregation. In normal blood vessels, the major matrix components in the subendothelium mediating platelet adhesion are thought to be vWf, fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. Initial platelet adherence to damaged vessel walls is thought to involve both non-integrin (e.g. the GPIb-IX-V complex) and integrin adhesion receptors (e.g. α2β1, α5β1, and α6β1) in addition to αIIbβ3 (2Du X.

During the development and progression of atherosclerosis, activation of cellular components in the atherosclerotic plaques may generate as yet undefined substrates that mediate platelet adhesion to ruptured plaque lesions. In this regard, it has recently been shown that activated platelets adhere to osteopontin in atherosclerotic plaques through integrin αvβ3 (6Bennett J.S. Chan C. Vilaire G. Mousa S.A. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Another extracellular matrix-associated protein, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), was found to be overexpressed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions as compared with normal blood vessels (7Oemar B.S.

CTGF belongs to an emerging family of conserved and modular proteins with diverse biological functions (8Lau L.F. Lam S.C.-T. Exp.

Six members of this protein family, including CTGF and Cyr61, have been described to date. Both Cyr61 and Fisp12, the mouse ortholog of CTGF, were identified as products of immediate-early genes transcriptionally induced in fibroblasts in response to serum growth factors (10Lau L.F.

Both Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF have been shown to mediate adhesion and to promote migration in vascular endothelial cells (16Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell.

Although neither protein alone induces mitogenesis in vascular endothelial cells, both are able to augment growth factor-induced DNA synthesis (15Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V.

Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these activities are pro-angiogenic; indeed, both Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF were found to induce angiogenesis in vivo in corneal micropocket assays (17Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell.

While the mechanism through which Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF induce angiogenesis in vivo is not known, biochemical and functional evidence indicate that the integrin αvβ3 serves as a receptor on endothelial cells for Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF mediating cell adhesion and migration (17Babic A.M.

Based on the similarity of ligand recognition specificity between integrins αvβ3 and αIIbβ3, we postulate that Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF may serve as adhesive substrates for the platelet integrin αIIbβ3. In the present study, we show that both Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF support the adhesion of platelets in an activation-dependent manner. Furthermore, active but not inactive αIIbβ3 binds directly to purified Cyr61 or Fisp12/mCTGF in a solid-phase binding assay. Thus, these studies identify two novel activation-dependent adhesive ligands for human platelets, and implicate a functional role for these proteins in hemostasis and thrombosis.

The fibrinogen γ chain dodecapeptide H12 with the sequence HHLGGAKQAGDV was purchased from Research Genetics Inc. RGDS and RGES peptides were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories. Echistatin was purchased from Sigma, and fibrinogen was obtained from KabiVitrum, Inc. Recombinant Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF, synthesized in a baculovirus expression system using Sf9 insect cells, were purified from serum-free conditioned media by chromatography on Sepharose S as described (15Kireeva M.L.

SDS-PAGE analysis of purified Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF revealed the presence of a single Coomassie Blue-stained band of 40 and 38 kDa, respectively. On immunoblots, the purified proteins reacted specifically with their cognate antibodies (15Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.-C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp.

Briefly, outdated human platelets were isolated by differential centrifugation and solubilized in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 50 mm octyl glucoside). The octyl glucoside extract was incubated with 1 ml of GRGDSPK-coupled Sepharose 4B overnight at 4 °C. After washing with 15 ml of column buffer (same as lysis buffer except it contained 25 mmoctyl glucoside), bound αIIbβ3 was eluted with 1.7 mm H12 (2 ml) in column buffer. The H12 eluate was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution column (1.5 × 95 cm), and αIIbβ3 was eluted with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2and 25 mm octyl glucoside. Unactivated αIIbβ3 was isolated by the method of Fitzgerald et al. (26Fitzgerald L.A. Leung B. Phillips D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The flow-through fraction of the GRGDSPK-Sepharose column was applied onto a concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B column (1 × 20 cm). Unbound proteins were washed with 50 ml of column buffer, and bound αIIbβ3 was then eluted with 100 mm mannose dissolved in column buffer. Fractions containing αIIbβ3 were further purified on a Sephacryl S-300 High Resolution column as described above. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. In some experiments, to ensure that equal concentrations of activated and unactivated αIIbβ3 were used, the purified receptor preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE and densitometric scanning of the silver-stained protein bands was performed. Venous blood was drawn from healthy donors and collected into acid-citrate-dextrose. Washed platelets were prepared by differential centrifugation as described (27Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Mustard J.F.

Haemostasis. 1977; 2: 291-308Google Scholar) and finally resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.35, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 11.9 mm NaHCO3, 1 mg/ml dextrose, and 3.5 mg/ml BSA). The platelet count was adjusted to 3 × 108 platelets/ml. Microtiter wells (Immulon 2 Removawell strips, Dynex Technologies, Inc.) were coated with Cyr61, Fisp12/mCTGF, or fibrinogen (25 μg/ml, 50 μl/well) overnight at 22 °C, and then blocked with 3% BSA at 37 °C for 2 h. Washed platelets were added to the wells (100 μl/well) in the presence and absence of platelet agonists and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The wells were washed with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer and adherent platelets were detected with125I-mAb15, an anti-β3 monoclonal antibody. Binding of the labeled antibody (50 nm, 50 μl/well) proceeded for 1 h at 22 °C. After extensive washing with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer, bound radioactivity was determined by γ-counting. In inhibition studies, washed platelets were preincubated with blocking peptides or antibodies at 37 °C for 15 min prior to addition to microtiter wells. In experiments to examine the effect of divalent cation chelation, EDTA (5 mm) was added to suspensions of washed platelets and preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min. As indicated, adherent platelets were also detected by the acid phosphatase assay (28Connolly D.T. Knight M.B. Harakas N.K. Wittwer A.J. Feder J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, following the adhesion and washing procedures as described above, the substrate solution (0.1 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.1% Triton X-100; 150 μl/well) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl 2 N NaOH, and absorbance at 405 nm was measured. Microtiter wells were coated with purified proteins as described above. Integrin αIIbβ3 was added to the wells in the presence and absence of inhibitors, and binding proceeded at 37 °C for 3 h. Unbound receptor was removed and the wells were washed twice with HEPES-Tyrode's buffer. Bound receptor was detected with 125I-mAb15 (25Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16416-16421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) as described above. Recently, we reported that vascular endothelial cells adhere to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61 through interaction with integrin αvβ3 (17Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we investigated whether these proteins could also support the adhesion of blood platelets. Microtiter wells were coated with purified recombinant Fisp12/mCTGF or Cyr61, and the adhesion of isolated platelets to these proteins was detected with 125I-mAb15, an anti-β3 monoclonal antibody. It is noteworthy that this antibody binds to both activated and unactivated αIIbβ3 indifferently. As controls, fibrinogen- and BSA-coated wells were also used. Initially, we compared the adhesion of unactivated versus activated platelets to immobilized Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61. To ensure that the platelets were not activated during the washing procedures, PGI2 (100 nm), which inhibits activation by raising platelet cAMP levels, was added to the platelet suspensions. Fig.1 shows that unactivated platelets failed to adhere to either protein. However, activation of platelets with 0.1 unit/ml thrombin (panel A), 500 nm U46619 (panel B), or 10 μm ADP (panel C) caused a dramatic increase in platelet adhesion to both Fisp12/mCTGF- and Cyr61-coated wells. To confirm that the adhesion process is activation-dependent, PGI2 (100 nm) was added with the agonists to prevent platelet activation. Under these conditions, platelet adhesion to both Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61 was significantly inhibited. For comparison, platelet adhesion to fibrinogen-coated wells was assessed. While unactivated platelets were capable of adhering to immobilized fibrinogen at a low level as previously reported (29Coller B.S. Blood. 1980; 55: 169-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Savage B. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11227-11233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), platelet adhesion to Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF appeared to be absolutely dependent on cellular activation (Fig. 1). Following platelet activation with strong agonists such as thrombin and U46619, platelet adhesion to Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF was comparable to fibrinogen. However, the weaker agonist ADP caused a lesser response. Since ADP does not induce secretion of α-granule proteins from washed human platelets and does not induce platelet aggregation in the absence of exogenous fibrinogen (32Packham M.A. Bryant N.L. Guccione M.A. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Mustard J.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1989; 62: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we therefore used ADP to induce platelet adhesion in later experiments. To further substantiate the activation-dependent adhesion of platelets to these proteins, we performed an independent assay to quantitate the relative numbers of adherent platelets. This assay measured the acid phosphatase activity of adherent platelets. In Fig. 1(C and D), both 125I-mAb15 binding and acid phosphatase assays were used to assess the adhesion of ADP-stimulated platelets to fibrinogen, Fisp12/mCTGF, and Cyr61, and similar results were obtained. Since the amounts of bound125I-mAb15 were directly proportional to the numbers of integrin αIIbβ3 on adherent platelets, we used this method for quantitative studies hereafter. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows that the adhesion of ADP-activated platelets to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61 was dose-dependent and saturable. Again, in the presence of PGI2, unactivated platelets adhered poorly to both proteins even at high coating concentrations. The specificity of the adhesion process was characterized in inhibition studies using anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies raised against the central variable regions of Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61. On immunoblots, anti-Fisp12/mCTGF and anti-Cyr61 reacted specifically with Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61, respectively, and no cross-reactivity was observed (15Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.-C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, anti-Fisp12/mCTGF inhibited platelet adhesion to Fisp12/mCTGF but not to Cyr61, and likewise, anti-Cyr61 inhibited Cyr61-mediated platelet adhesion but not that mediated by Fisp12/mCTGF. In specificity controls, no inhibition was observed with normal rabbit IgG. Additionally, neither anti-Fisp12/mCTGF nor anti-Cyr61 inhibited platelet adhesion to fibrinogen-coated wells. Thus, these findings indicated that the abilities of Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61 to mediate platelet adhesion are intrinsic properties of these proteins.Figure 3Inhibition of platelet adhesion to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61 by anti-Fisp12/mCTGF or anti-Cyr61 antibodies. Microtiter wells coated with 25 μg/ml fibrinogen, Fisp12/mCTGF, or Cyr61 were preincubated with 1 mg/ml rabbit IgG, anti-Fisp12/mCTGF, or anti-Cyr61 at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with Tyrode's buffer, ADP-activated platelets were added. Platelet adhesion proceeded for 30 min at 37 °C, and adherent cells were detected with 125I-mAb15. Percentage of inhibition was calculated relative to the adhesion of platelets to control wells incubated without antibodies. Data shown are means of triplicate determinations, and error bars represent standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon platelet activation, the ligand binding affinities of integrin αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 are up-regulated (1Shattil S.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8137-8140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether these integrin receptors mediate platelet adhesion to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61, we tested the inhibitory effect of peptide antagonists and the divalent cation chelator EDTA. Fig.4 A shows that preincubation of platelets with EDTA at 37 °C completely abolished platelet adhesion to both proteins indicating that the adhesion process is divalent cation-dependent, consistent with the involvement of an integrin receptor. The major platelet integrin, αIIbβ3, is sensitive to inhibition by RGD-containing peptides and a dodecapeptide (H12) derived from the fibrinogen γ chain (33Plow E.F. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 34Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Lukas T.J. Hawiger J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 947-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, the adhesion of ADP-activated platelets to Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF was specifically inhibited by RGDS but not by RGES. Likewise, the RGD-containing snake venom peptide echistatin (36Gan Z.R. Gould R.J. Jacobs J.W. Friedman P.A. Polokoff M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19827-19832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also completely blocked platelet adhesion to both proteins. It has been shown that the dodecapeptide H12 preferentially interacts with integrin αIIbβ3 as compared with integrin αvβ3 (37Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 38Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. D'Souza S.E. Cheresh D.A. Frelinger III, A.L. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3742-3749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that H12 inhibited platelet adhesion to Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF (Fig. 4 A) suggest that this process is mediated by αIIbβ3 rather than αvβ3. Indeed, while the complex-specific monoclonal antibody AP-2 (anti-αIIbβ3) completely blocked the adhesion of ADP-activated platelets to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61, no inhibition was observed with LM609 (anti-αvβ3) or with normal mouse IgG (Fig.4 B). In control samples, the adhesion of ADP-activated platelets to fibrinogen was also completely inhibited by EDTA, RGDS, echistatin, H12, or AP-2, but not by RGES or LM609 (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that platelet adhesion to these proteins is mediated through interaction with activated integrin αIIbβ3. To address whether integrin αIIbβ3 binds directly to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61, we performed a solid-phase binding assay to detect the receptor-ligand interaction. In these experiments, activated and unactivated αIIbβ3 were purified from platelet lysates as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the binding of purified αIIbβ3 to Cyr61 or Fisp12/mCTGF immobilized onto microtiter wells was detected with 125I-mAb15. Both activated and unactivated αIIbβ3 were indistinguishable on SDS-PAGE analysis as detected by silver staining (Fig. 5 A). However, as reported previously (39Kouns W.C. Hadvary P. Haering P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18844-18851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), activated αIIbβ3, but not the unactivated receptor, was capable of binding to immobilized fibrinogen. Likewise, we observed higher binding of activated versus unactivated αIIbβ3 to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61 (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, similar background bindings of activated and unactivated αIIbβ3 to control wells coated with BSA were observed. Thus, these data are consistent with the observation that activated but not unactivated platelets adhered to Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF. To further characterize the interaction of αIIbβ3 with Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61, we performed binding isotherms with varying concentrations of RGD affinity-purified αIIbβ3. Fig.6 shows that the dose-dependent binding of activated αIIbβ3 to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61 was saturable, with half-saturation occurring at 15 nm and 25 nm αIIbβ3, respectively. Again, no significant binding of αIIbβ3 to control BSA-coated wells was observed. To demonstrate the specificity of the interaction, inhibition studies were performed. As expected, the binding of activated αIIbβ3 to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61 was specifically blocked by RGDS but not by RGES (Fig.7). Furthermore, echistatin and the H12 peptide also effectively inhibited αIIbβ3 binding to these proteins. These findings are consistent with results obtained in the platelet adhesion assay. Collectively, these functional and biochemical data demonstrate that activated integrin αIIbβ3 is the receptor mediating activation-dependent platelet adhesion to Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF.Figure 7Inhibition of αIIbβ3binding to Fisp12/mCTGF and Cyr61. Activated αIIbβ3 (30 nm), preincubated with vehicle buffer (no add), 0.1 mm RGDS, 0.1 mm RGES, 0.1 mm H12, or 0.5 μm echistatin for 15 min at 37 °C, was added to microtiter wells coated with 10 μg/ml fibrinogen, Fisp12/mCTGF, Cyr61, or BSA. Binding proceeded for 3 h at 37 °C, and bound receptor was detected with 125I-mAb15. Data shown are means of triplicate determinations, and error bars represent standard deviations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The major findings in this study are: 1) human platelets adhere to two novel angiogenic inducers, Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF, in an activation-dependent manner; and 2) platelet adhesion to Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF is mediated through the integrin αIIbβ3, which serves as a cell surface receptor for these proteins. These results establish Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF as two additional adhesive ligands for integrin αIIbβ3 on activated platelets. Since both proteins are matrix-associated molecules synthesized by endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of vessel walls (7Oemar B.S. Werner A. Garnier J.-M. Do D.-D. Godoy N. Nauck M. März W.

Regulation of Expression of Growth Factor-inducible Immediate-Early Genes Cyr61 and Pip92.Ph.D. thesis. University of Illinois, Chicago, IL1994Google Scholar), these findings suggest a physiological role for Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF in hemostasis and thrombosis. Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF are members of a family of multifunctional extracellular signaling molecules (8Lau L.F. Lam S.C.-T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 9Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Originally identified as products of growth factor-inducible immediate-early genes, these proteins were thought to mediate the biological responses of growth factors. Recent studies have demonstrated the roles of these proteins in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation (16Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 17Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L.

Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both proteins have been implicated in complex biological processes such as angiogenesis, wound healing, embryogenesis, and tumor growth (17Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Members of this protein family share four conserved structural domains, which include: 1) an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein homology domain, 2) a von Willebrand factor type C domain, 3) a thrombospondin type 1 repeat homology domain, and 4) a carboxyl-terminal domain with homology to some types of collagens and mucins. Heparin-binding sequence motifs can be found in domains 3 and 4, consistent with the observation that both Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF bind heparin (14Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.-C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The human ortholog of Fisp12, CTGF, was first identified as a mitogenic factor in the conditioned medium of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (13Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism and the receptor mediating its mitogenic activity have not yet been elucidated. We have previously shown that, on vascular endothelial cells, both Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF interact with integrin αvβ3, which mediates cell adhesion and migration (17Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kireeva M.L. Lam S.C.-T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3090-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). While integrin αvβ3 is found in a number of cell types, it is present at a very low copy number on platelets (38Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. D'Souza S.E. Cheresh D.A. Frelinger III, A.L. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3742-3749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Coller B.S. Cheresh D.A. Asch E. Seligsohn U. Blood. 1991; 77: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a closely related integrin, αIIbβ3, is the predominant adhesion receptor on blood platelets mediating platelet adhesion and aggregation. On resting platelets, integrin αIIbβ3 is present in a low affinity state incapable of binding soluble adhesive ligands. Activation of platelets by physiological agonists such as thrombin, ADP, and thromboxane A2 up-regulates the ligand binding affinity of αIIbβ3 through inside-out signaling processes. In the present study, we found that unactivated platelets failed to adhere to Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF, whereas platelets activated by a variety of agonists adhere strongly to both proteins. Furthermore, we conclude that Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF interact with the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 based on the observations that RGD-containing peptides and the dodecapeptide H12, as well as the anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody AP-2, blocked platelet adhesion to these proteins. Although integrin αvβ3 on endothelial cells serves as the receptor for Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF, the inability of the anti-αvβ3 monoclonal antibody LM609 to inhibit platelet adhesion to these proteins may reflect the relatively low abundance of this receptor as compared with integrin αIIbβ3 on the platelet surface. Solid-phase binding assays with purified integrin αIIbβ3 to immobilized Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF confirmed that these proteins are direct ligands of this integrin. Furthermore, consistent with the platelet adhesion data, we observed that activated purified αIIbβ3, but not the unactivated receptor, binds directly to these proteins. Thus, both Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF are ligands specific for the activated conformer of integrin αIIbβ3. Interestingly, neither proteins contain the RGD motif or the fibrinogen γ chain dodecapeptide sequence recognized by integrin αIIbβ3. Nevertheless, both peptides were able to inhibit the interaction of αIIbβ3with Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF, possibly due to conformation changes induced by peptide binding to αIIbβ3 (21Frelinger III, A, L. Cohen I. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Roberts J. Lam S.C.-T. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6346-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,44Parise L.V. Helgerson S.L. Steiner B. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12597-12602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins, therefore, represent the first examples of activation-dependent ligands for integrin αIIbβ3 that do not contain either the RGD or the fibrinogen γ chain dodecapeptide sequence motifs. The expression of both cyr61 and fisp12/mCTGF is developmentally regulated in a tissue-specific and temporally restricted manner during embryogenesis (15Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V.

Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, cyr61 is expressed in developing blood vessel walls. Both Cyr61 as well as human and mouse CTGF proteins can be colocalized with smooth muscle cells of arterial walls (7Oemar B.S. Werner A. Garnier J.-M. Do D.-D. Godoy N. Nauck M. März W. Rupp J. Pech M. Lüscher T.F. Circulation. 1997; 95: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 20Latinkić B.V. Regulation of Expression of Growth Factor-inducible Immediate-Early Genes Cyr61 and Pip92.Ph.D. thesis. University of Illinois, Chicago, IL1994Google Scholar). In the adult, expression of both cyr61 and fisp12/mCTGF is induced in the granulation tissue of healing cutaneous wounds, consistent with the abilities of these proteins to promote chemotaxis and proliferation of fibroblasts and to induce angiogenesis at the site of wound repair (8Lau L.F. Lam S.C.-T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 20Latinkić B.V.

Grotendorst G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). These expression patterns and activities implicate a role for Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF in the development and maintenance of blood vessels. Platelets play an essential role in hemostasis, the arrest of blood flow from injured vessels. The presence of Cyr61 and CTGF in arterial vessel walls suggests that platelet adhesion to these proteins may contribute to the stability of the hemostatic plug. The initial adhesion of unactivated platelets to injured blood vessels is thought to be due to the interaction of the GPIb-IX-V complex with vWf on the exposed subendothelium (4Du X. Ginsberg M.H. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 28: 269-301Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 5Clemetson K.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such interaction has been shown to activate the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, thus allowing αIIbβ3 to bind to other adhesive ligands including soluble fibrinogen (31Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45De Marco L. Girolami A. Russell S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our present finding that activated αIIbβ3 also binds immobilized Cyr61 and Fisp12/mCTGF suggest that these proteins may contribute to the tight adhesion of platelets to the subendothelial matrix following the initial GPIb-IX-V interaction with vWf. Furthermore, the generation of thrombin and other platelet agonists would activate circulating platelets, thus allowing their interaction with Cyr61 and CTGF in the injured vessel walls. CTGF has been shown to be overexpressed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions (7Oemar B.S. Werner A. Garnier J.-M. Do D.-D. Godoy N. Nauck M. März W. Rupp J. Pech M. Lüscher T.F. Circulation. 1997; 95: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Specifically, Northern blot analysis shows that the level of CTGF mRNA was expressed 50–100-fold higher in atherosclerotic blood vessels as compared with normal arteries. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, CTGF protein was highly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells as well as in endothelial cells at the luminal sites of the vessels and in the vasa vasorum of the plaque lesions. CTGF may have multiple roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. First, it may act in concert with other growth factors and cytokines to promote cell migration and proliferation. Second, since it is an angiogenic factor, it would likely induce neovascularization of the fibrous plaques. Third, it may also be involved in the formation of occlusive thrombi since retraction or removal of endothelial cells of atherosclerotic plaques would expose CTGF in the underlying subendothelial matrix to which activated platelets could adhere. In this regard, our findings that activated αIIbβ3 mediates platelet adhesion to CTGF may have important implications in the pathogenesis of acute arterial occlusion resulting from ruptures or fissures of atherosclerotic plaques. Thus, the potential role of CTGF and Cyr61, and perhaps other members of this protein family, in hemostasis and thrombosis as manifested by platelet adhesive functions merits further investigation."

Serine phosphorylation of Stat3 by mitogen-activated protein kinase has also been observed in cells responding to epidermal growth factor and shown to affect its tyrosine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. Serine phosphorylation of Stat3 is also induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) stimulation, which is shown to be independent of mitogen-activated protein kinase and sensitive to the Ser/Thr kinase inhibitor H7. In this study, we investigated whether protein kinase C (PKC) is the kinase that is induced and responsible for Stat3 serine phosphorylation by IL-6 stimulation and which isoform of PKCs is likely to be involved. Here, we report that Stat3 was specifically associated with PKC δ in vivo in an IL-6-dependent manner in several cell types. Furthermore, Stat3 was phosphorylated by PKC δ in vivo on Ser-727, which could be inhibited either by a specific PKC δ inhibitor or by a dominant-negative mutant of PKC δ. Finally, we showed that the phosphorylation of Stat3 by PKC δ led to a negative regulation of Stat3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity.

The latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, are selectively recruited to the receptors through binding of their SH2 domain to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the receptors and subsequently phosphorylated by Jaks on specific tyrosine residues at the COOH terminus (8Heim M.H.

STATs form homo- or heterodimers, translocate into the nucleus, bind to their recognition sequences, and regulate target gene expression (1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

Seven members have been identified so far in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 14Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3347) Google Scholar). Among them, Stat3 was identified as an acute-phase response factor activated by IL-6 in mouse liver (15Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) and also was cloned by low stringency screening of mouse cDNA library with a probe derived from Stat1 (16Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that controls cell growth, differentiation, and other functions in various cell types (17Kishimoto T. Blood. 1989; 74: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other IL-6 family members, such as IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor, which share the common gp130 receptor subunit, also stimulate Stat3 activation (6Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F.

Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). In response to IL-6, Stat3 is transiently associated with gp130, phosphorylated by the receptor-associated Jaks on Tyr-705, and translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to IL-6 response elements and regulates many acute-phase protein genes (6Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5961-5964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, Stat3 represents an important regulator of IL-6 target gene expression. Furthermore, growth factors, such as EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), can also activate Stat3 (13Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar,16Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosine, Stat3 is also phosphorylated on serine. Recently, Stat3 was shown to be phosphorylated on Ser-727 by extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 (ERK2), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, in response to EGF, and this serine phosphorylation negatively affected its tyrosine phosphorylation (20Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 21Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). IL-6 also induces serine phosphorylation of Stat3. However, the involved Ser/Thr kinase has not been identified, but it has been shown to be independent of MAP kinases and sensitive to a Ser/Thr kinase inhibitor, H7 (18Lütticken C. Coffer P. Yuan J.

A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Protein kinase C (PKC) is a heterogenous family of phospholipid-dependent kinases. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases can stimulate PKC activation, which leads to long term responses of cells, such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (24Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar, 25Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). PKC activity can be inhibited by the inhibitor of Ser/Thr kinases, H7 (26Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar). At least 11 isoforms of PKCs have been identified and classified into three major categories based on differential Ca2+ and lipid requirements. The conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ) require both Ca2+ and either diacylglycerol or phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), as cofactors. The novel PKCs (ε, δ, η, and θ) require diacylglycerol or PMA, but not Ca2+, whereas the atypical PKC isoforms (ι, λ, and ζ) are insensitive to both (reviewed in Ref. 27Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). PKC undergoes autophosphorylation on Ser/Thr upon activation. Initially, PKC δ was the only isoform identified to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo in response to several stimuli, and the kinase activity was differentially affected by its tyrosine phosphorylation, depending on the cell type (28Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Li W. Mischak H., Yu, J.C. Wang L.M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been showed that all PKC isoforms, including α, β, γ, ε, δ, and ζ, are tyrosine-phosphorylated and catalytically activated upon treatment of cells with H2O2 (31Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In this study, we attempt to investigate whether PKC is involved in the Stat3 serine phosphorylation stimulated by IL-6. Here, we report that PKC δ specifically associates with Stat3 in several cell types in an IL-6-inducible manner. Stat3 is phosphorylated by PKC δ in vitro as well as in vivo on Ser-727, and the phosphorylation of Stat3 by PKC δ leads to an inhibition of Stat3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the possible role of PKC on phosphorylation and regulation of STAT proteins. We detected that only PKC δ interacts with Stat3 in an IL-6-dependent manner in several cell types, whereas other PKC isoforms either associate with Stat3 constitutively, such as PKC β and ε in HepG2 cells, or do not associate with Stat3, such as in the A431 cells. Stat1 has also been reported to be activated by IL-6 stimulation (6Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the interaction of PKC δ and Stat1 in HepG2, PC12, and A431 cells stimulated by IL-6, interferon-γ, or EGF. No association was detected in these cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the PKC δ specifically interacts with Stat3. In addition to cytokines of IL-6 family, EGF also stimulates the association of PKC δ and Stat3 in A431 cells. Because EGF also stimulates the Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in A431 cells and IL-6, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor do so in HepG2 cells, it is likely that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 is important for the association. The correlation of the time course between the association and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3 supports this hypothesis. On the other hand, serine phosphorylation may not be required for this association because we have observed that PKC δ can associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 proteins that are not serine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1 C, a–c). Moreover, in contrast to IL-6, which stimulated Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation and the association with PKC δ in PC12 cells, nerve growth factor and EGF stimulated strong serine phosphorylation of Stat3 without triggering the tyrosine phosphorylation, and no association of Stat3 with PKC δ was detected (data not shown). Furthermore, the association induced by IL-6 was inhibited by staurosporine, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but not by H7 (data not shown). This result also suggests that Stat3 association with PKC δ is independent of PKC δ activation because H7 inhibits PKC δ activity. Indeed, PKC δ is strongly activated by PMA, but no association was observed in PMA-treated HepG2 and A431 cells (data not shown). These data together suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3, but not the serine phosphorylation of Stat3 or the activation of PKC δ, is likely to be important for Stat3 association with PKC δ.Although an H7-sensitive Ser/Thr kinase was suggested to be involved in Stat3 serine phosphorylation stimulated by IL-6 (22Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 23Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the kinase was not identified. In this study, we have shown that the PKC δ activity was stimulated by IL-6 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the Stat3 serine phosphorylation was also stimulated by IL-6, which was inhibited by a specific inhibitor of PKC δ, rottlerin, but not by an inhibitor of PKC α, β, and γ, Go6976 (Fig. 7). These results suggest that PKC δ is the kinase inducible by IL-6 and phosphorylates Stat3 on serine in HepG2 cells. However, the other PKC isoforms, such as the atypical PKC isoforms, which are not inhibited by Go6976, and the calmodulin-kinase III, which is also inhibited by rottlerin, may also be involved in serine phosphorylation of Stat3 in IL-6 stimulated cells. To exclude these possibilities, we further showed that the Stat3 Ser-727 phosphorylation induced by IL-6 was enhanced by transfection of the wild-type PKC δ but inhibited by the dominant-negative mutant of PKC δ (Fig. 7 C). These data demonstrated that PKC δ is the major kinase that phosphorylates Stat3 on Ser-727 by IL-6 stimulation. On the other hand, we also observed that the Stat3 was completely serine-phosphorylated within 15 min of EGF stimulation in A431 cells (indicated by the slow migrating band in Fig. 2 B, lane 2), whereas only about 50% of Stat3 was serine-phosphorylated with IL-6 stimulation in both A431 (Fig. 2 B) and HepG2 (Fig.1 C, a–c, lane 2) cells. This indicates that ERKs stimulated by EGF phosphorylate Stat3 more strongly than PKC δ stimulated by IL-6. However, the serine phosphorylation patterns of Stat3 by ERK2 and PKC δ analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping were shown to be similar (Fig. 6 B and Ref. 33Li W., Yu, J.C. Shin D.Y. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8311-8318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These data indicate that Ser-727 is the major phosphorylation site, which could be important for regulating its activity. It is unknown, however, whether the intensity of the serine phosphorylation of Stat3 by different kinases plays a role in fine tuning Stat3 activity.Although the role of the Stat3 serine phosphorylation and the involved kinases in regulation of Stat3 activity remains unclear, negative effects on Stat3 activity have been suggested in several reports. For instance, Chung et al. (22Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation on Ser-727 of Stat3 negatively modulated its tyrosine phosphorylation. We also found that activation of ERK2 by its upstream kinase, MEK1, abrogated Stat3 transcriptional activity stimulated by EGF through inhibition of its tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity (34Jain N. Tong Z. Fong S.L. Lim C.P. Cao X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These data were in agreement with the report showing that activation of MAP kinases by MEK1 or by PMA inhibits Stat3 activity stimulated by IL-6 (41Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our results here clearly showed that PKC δ inhibits Stat3 DNA binding and its transcriptional activities (Fig. 8). The results are also consistent with a previous report that PKC δ inhibited Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding stimulated by tyrosine kinase Bmx (42Saharinen P. Ekman N. Sarvas K. Parker P. Alitalo K. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of the repression by PKC δ and MAP kinase is unknown and could be a complicated issue. A few possibilities may be considered. First, the repression may be due to a direct phosphorylation by ERK2 or PKC δ on Ser-727 that blocks the subsequent phosphorylation on Tyr-705. In PC12 cells, we observed that pretreatment of the cells with nerve growth factor, which causes Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat3, decreases its tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by IL-6.2 Alternatively, the repression may not be due to a direct phosphorylation of Stat3 on Ser-727; instead, it may affect the upstream component of STATs, such as Jak activity, as reported by Sengupta et al. (41Sengupta T.K. Talbot E.S. Scherle P.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the case of PKC δ, we observed that it interacts with Stat3 only in the cytoplasmic fraction in the IL-6-induced cells, and the associated Stat3 in cytoplasm was tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, it raises the possibility that PKC δ negatively regulates Stat3 activity by blocking its nuclear translocation. Further investigations are required to resolve the mechanism of repression.We and others previously reported that Stat3 was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and physically associated with v-Src in Src-transformed rat embryo fibroblasts (32Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 43Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carster-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). An association of PKC δ and Src was also reported in the v-Src-transformed cells (44Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13275-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar), as well as in the PMA-treated human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (45Malathy S. Krett N.L. Peters C.A. Maizels E.T. Murad F.M. Kawakatsu H. Rosen S.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1649-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether Stat3 interacts with PKC δ through Src. To address this question, we examined the association of Stat3 and Src in HepG2 cells stimulated by IL-6 or EGF. In contrast to the association of Stat3 and PKC δ, the association of Stat3 and Src was not induced by IL-6. However, EGF, which did not stimulate Stat3/PKC δ association in HepG2 cells, strongly stimulated Stat3/Src association (data not shown). These results suggest that the association of PKC δ and Stat3 is unlikely to be mediated by Src. In addition to the association with Src, Stat3 has also been reported to play a critical role in Src-dependent transformation, suggesting that Stat3 is an important mediator in Src signaling and in control of cell growth and transformation (46Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. Caldenhoven E. de Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 47Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKC δ has also been reported to interact with Src, but it depletes the Src-dependent transformation (44Zang Q. Lu Z. Curto M. Barile N. Shalloway D. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 13275-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 45Malathy S. Krett N.L. Peters C.A. Maizels E.T. Murad F.M. Kawakatsu H. Rosen S.T. Hunzicker-Dunn M.

It will be interesting to investigate the possible links of PKC δ in the regulation of the Stat3 activity and the Src-dependent cell transformation.In summary, our study shows that PKC δ specifically associates with and phosphorylates Stat3 on Ser-727 in the IL-6-stimulated cells, suggesting that PKC δ is the kinase that phosphorylates Stat3 in response to IL-6 stimulation. We also demonstrate a role of PKC δ in the negative regulation of Stat3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. However, whether this negative effect is PKC δ-specific or involves the other PKC isoforms remains unknown and is currently under investigation. Cytokines and growth factors bind to receptors on the cell surface and activate signal transduction pathways that lead to cell proliferation and differentiation. JAK-STAT1 is a key pathway identified in recent years that mediates cellular responses to a variety of cytokines (reviewed in Refs. 1Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

Unlike the growth factor receptors, cytokine receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Ligand binding to receptors activates the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase family, such as Jaks, which phosphorylates the target tyrosine residues on the receptor (4Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N.

We show here that the primary site of constitutive NHERF phosphorylation in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells is Ser289, and that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation is near 1 mol/mol. NHERF contains two PDZ domains that recognize the sequence S/T-X-L at the carboxyl terminus of target proteins, and thus we examined the possibility that kinases containing this motif might associate with and phosphorylate NHERF. Overlay experiments and co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that NHERF binds with high affinity to a splice variant of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6, GRK6A, which terminates in the motif T-R-L. NHERF does not associate with GRK6B or GRK6C, alternatively spliced variants that differ from GRK6A at their extreme carboxyl termini. GRK6A phosphorylates NHERF efficiently on Ser289 in vitro, whereas GRK6B, GRK6C, and GRK2 do not. Furthermore, the endogenous “NHERF kinase” activity in HEK-293 cell lysates is sensitive to treatments that alter the activity of GRK6A.

There is evidence that PKA facilitates NHERF-mediated inhibition of NHE3 through both phosphorylation of the exchanger (6Kurashima K., Yu, F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J.

In vitro studies have identified a cluster of serines in NHERF as the key region of regulatory phosphorylation by PKA (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but the phosphorylation of these sites in cells has not been examined. NHERF contains two PDZ (for PSD-95,Discs-large, and ZO-1 homology) domains, which are protein-protein interaction modules that mediate binding to specific carboxyl-terminal motifs on target proteins (8Sheng M. Neuron. 1996; 17: 575-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The first ligand identified for the NHERF PDZ domains was the tail of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (9Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.-W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S.

The interaction of NHERF with the β2AR is of high affinity (KD = 18 nm) (10Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NHERF recognizes the motif S/T-X-L at the carboxyl terminus of the β2AR (10Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Some proteins that have potential NHERF binding motifs are protein kinases, raising the possibility that cellular NHERF may be constitutively associated with one or more kinases. It has recently been observed that NHERF is phosphorylated under basal conditions in various cell lines (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), but the identity of the NHERF kinase responsible for this phosphorylation is unknown. In the present study, we examined the phosphorylation of cellular NHERF under basal conditions as well as following various stimulatory treatments. We also tested the idea that NHERF might associate with a protein kinase through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction, and that this interaction might explain the constitutive phosphorylation of cellular NHERF. HEK-293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in 75% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells were subcultured every week after becoming confluent using 0.25% trypsin with 1 mm EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.). HEK-293 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and grown to approximately 80% confluence. Cells were then transfected with 1–2 μg of HA-NHERF cDNA using the calcium-phosphate method, as described previously (9Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.-W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours following transfection, the medium was replaced with 6 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.4 mCi of32P (NEN Life Science Products). After 90 min, cells were incubated with the agents to be tested or their vehicles at the indicated concentrations and for the indicated times. Following treatment, cells were washed three times with 6 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 nm calyculin, 1 mm benzamide, and 100 μmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and then rocked for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 4 min. One milliliter of supernatant was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and 6 μg of 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. After rocking at 4 °C for 1 h, 60 μl of protein A plus protein G-agarose (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added and the samples rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein A-agarose was then washed three times in lysis buffer. SDS-sample buffer (100 μl) was added to the pellet and heated to 85 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After drying the gels, phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Determination of the stoichiometry of NHERF phosphorylation was performed as described previously in studies examining the stoichiometry of β1-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation (14Freedman N.J.

To verify expression and immunoprecipitation of NHERF, precipitated samples and cell lysates were run on SDS-PAGE gels, as described in the preceding section, and then blotted onto pure nitrocellulose (Novex) for 40 min at 12 V. The blots were blocked in blot buffer (2% milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl) for 20 min and then incubated with either anti-NHERF (9Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.-W. Blitzer J.T.

The blots were then washed three times for 5 min each in 10 ml of blot buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:2000. Following this, the blots were again washed three times in 10 ml of blot buffer, once with phosphate-buffered saline, and visualized via chemiluminescence with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Kodak X-Omat film. Four mutant versions of NHERF were prepared for this study: S287A, S289A, S290A, and K158A,K159A. These mutants were created by PCR amplification from the native rabbit NHERF cDNA using mutant sequence oligonucleotides; all mutations were confirmed via sequencing with an ABI377 automated sequencer. The mutants were inserted into both the HA-pBK-CMV vector (9Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Chow C.-W. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Stoffel R.H. Barak L.S. Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Grinstein S.

Hexahistidine- and S-tagged NHERF, NHERF domain 1, and NHERF domain 2 fusion proteins (“domain 1” = residues 1–151 of full-length rabbit NHERF; “domain 2” = residues 152–358) were expressed and purified as described previously (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). GRK6A, GRK6B, and β2 receptor carboxyl-terminal tails were expressed as GST fusion proteins by PCR amplification from native cDNAs and insertion of the PCR products into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); the sequences of all constructs were confirmed via sequencing with an ABI377 automated sequencer. The GST fusion proteins (5 μg/lane) were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Novex), blotted as described above and overlaid with the appropriate fusion protein in blot buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times with blot buffer, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-S-tag Ab (Novagen) in blot buffer, washed three more times with blot buffer, and visualized via chemiluminescence. To perform saturation binding curves, equal amounts of a given fusion protein were loaded into multiple lanes, and the resultant blots were cut into one-lane strips. The strips were incubated with increasing concentrations of NHERF domain 1 fusion protein, and the amount of NHERF binding for each was quantified via scanning and analysis with the program IPLab (Scientific Analytics Corp.). Full-length mouse GRK6A, GRK6B, and GRK6C cDNAs were amplified from libraries and subcloned into the pBK-CMV vector for the expression studies. Hexahistidine-tagged GRK6 fusion proteins were expressed via baculovirus in Sf9 cells and purified using Ni-NTA chromatography with extensive washing to remove imidazole. GRK2 was expressed via baculovirus in Sf9 cells and GRK2 was purified as described previously (15Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified proteins were examined for their ability to phosphorylate wild-type or mutant versions of NHERF in vitro. Kinase assays were carried out at room temperature (24 °C) in a total volume of 30 μl, with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For experiments comparing the efficiencies of different GRKs to phosphorylate NHERF, the kinases were normalized for their ability to phosphorylate the GRK substrate peptide RRREEEEESAAA (16Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Typically, kinases were added to 2 μg of substrate, unless otherwise indicated; for the kinetic analyses, the amount of substrate added was varied. Reactions were initiated via the addition of ATP to a final total concentration of 60 μm, with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) per reaction. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min before being stopped with sample buffer. For phosphorylation in vitro with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (kindly supplied by T. R. Soderling, Vollum Institute, Portland, OR), 5 mm CaCl2and 1 μm calmodulin were included in the phosphorylation reactions. Phosphorylated samples were run on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels, fixed, dried, and exposed to film. The extent of phosphorylation was quantitated by scanning of films and densitometric analysis of bands. It has been shown previously that NHERF inhibition of NHE3 in vitro can be enhanced by phosphorylation of NHERF within a cluster of three serines, Ser287, Ser289, and Ser290, located toward the carboxyl-terminal end of the NHERF protein (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In order to see if one or more of these sites is responsible for the previously observed constitutive phosphorylation of NHERF in cells (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), point mutants of NHERF were prepared with these three serines individually mutated to alanine. These mutants, as well as a triple mutant with all three serines changed to alanine, were separately transfected into HEK-293 cells and their levels of phosphorylation were assessed in 32P metabolic labeling studies. As shown in Fig. 1 A, wild-type NHERF is constitutively phosphorylated, while the triple alanine mutant is reduced in phosphorylation by approximately 75% relative to wild-type NHERF. The S287A and S290A point mutants exhibit levels of constitutive phosphorylation identical to wild-type NHERF, but the S289A point mutant is reduced in constitutive phosphorylation by approximately 75%. These results indicate that the primary site of constitutive phosphorylation in NHERF expressed in HEK-293 cells is Ser289. We next examined the stoichiometry of this constitutive phosphorylation. The stoichiometry was calculated at 0.74 ± 0.06 mol/mol (n = 3), a value close to 1 and thus consistent with NHERF being constitutively phosphorylated on one primary site. The Western blot data shown in Fig. 1 B are also consistent with this idea. It has previously been observed that Western blot staining of native tissues with anti-NHERF antibodies yields several closely spaced immunoreactive bands that can be collapsed into a single band by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (17Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), suggesting that NHERF is phosphorylated in native tissues and that this phosphorylation retards the mobility of the NHERF protein on SDS-PAGE. As seen in Fig.1 B, the triple mutant and S289A mutant forms of NHERF exhibit more rapid mobility on SDS-PAGE gels, suggesting that phosphorylation on Ser289 retards the SDS-PAGE mobility of NHERF. Since most of the NHERF in the triple mutant and S289A mutant samples is shifted to the apparently smaller size, it is likely that most of the wild-type NHERF expressed in these cells is phosphorylated on Ser289. To see if the NHERF phosphorylation on Ser289 might be due to activity of PKA or CaMKII, two kinases previously shown to inhibit NHE3 activity in vitro (4Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin.

Electrolyte Metab. 1992; 18: 35-39PubMed Google Scholar), we performed32P metabolic labeling studies on wild-type NHERF-transfected HEK-293 cells treated with a variety of activators or inhibitors of these two kinases. As shown in Fig. 1 C, none of the PKA- or CaMKII-targeted treatments had a significant effect on the extent of NHERF phosphorylation. Treatment with forskolin led to a small (∼15%) but statistically insignificant increase in NHERF phosphorylation, as observed previously (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), while treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP, the calcium ionophore ionomycin, the PKA inhibitor H89 or the CaMKII inhibitor KN-62 led to no significant changes in the phosphorylation state of NHERF. Since most of the NHERF in the HEK-293 cells was phosphorylated even in the absence of any stimulation, we considered the possibility that NHERF might be associated in these cells with a constitutively active kinase that was able to keep NHERF phosphorylated on Ser289at all times. NHERF has two PDZ domains, which could potentially allow association of NHERF with one or more kinases. The carboxyl-terminal tail motif preferred for binding by the NHERF PDZ domains is S/T-X-L (10Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We examined two kinases on the data base that terminate in such a motif: the serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase (sgk) (20Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) (21Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Firsov D. Elalouf J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C953-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). sgk terminates in D-S-F-L, a carboxyl terminus very similar to the D-S-L-L C terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor, while GRK6A, a major splice variant of GRK6, terminates in P-T-R-L. The potential interaction of NHERF and sgk was assessed in overlay studies and in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In no case did we observe binding of NHERF to either sgk or the sgk tail, nor did we observe any phosphorylation of NHERF by sgk (data not shown). These studies reveal that, while a COOH-terminal S/T-X-L motif may be necessary for high affinity binding to the first NHERF PDZ domain, it is not sufficient. There must be other structural determinants in the sgk tail region that prevent it from associating with the NHERF PDZ domains. GRK6 exists as three alternatively spliced variants (22Firsov D. Elalouf J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C953-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2R. T. Premont, S. Aparacio, H. E. Kendall, J. E. Welch and R. J. Lefkowitz, submitted for publication. as shown in Fig.2 A. Only the first of these variants (GRK6A) possesses the T-R-L carboxyl terminus that conforms to the consensus motif for NHERF binding. We prepared GST fusion proteins corresponding to the carboxyl termini of GRK6A and GRK6B, the most abundant of the GRK6 isoforms, and compared the binding of NHERF to these two samples (Fig. 2 B). Full-length NHERF binds specifically to the carboxyl terminus of GRK6A but not to the GRK6B carboxyl terminus nor to control GST. The overlay shown in Fig.2 C reveals that both of the NHERF PDZ domains bind the GRK6A carboxyl terminus, although the first PDZ domain binds much better than the second. Both PDZ domains bind about as well to the GRK6A carboxyl terminus as they do to the carboxyl terminus of the β2-adrenergic receptor. Indeed, saturation binding studies (Fig. 2 D) revealed that NHERF domain 1 binds to the GRK6A carboxyl terminus with an affinity (KD = 31 nm) similar to that previously estimated for NHERF binding to the β2AR carboxyl terminus (KD = 18 nm) (10Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed in order to examine whether or not NHERF could bind to full-length GRK6A in a cellular context; as shown in Fig. 2 E, GRK6A but neither GRK6B nor GRK6C can be co-immunoprecipitated with NHERF from HEK-293 cells. We next examined whether GRK6A can phosphorylate NHERF. As the experiment shown in Fig. 3 A illustrates, purified GRK6A efficiently phosphorylates NHERF in vitro, while purified GRK6B, GRK6C, and GRK2 phosphorylate NHERF either very poorly or not at all. When equal amounts of NHERF and the classical GRK substrate rhodopsin are presented to GRK6A, NHERF is highly preferred as a substrate (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 2). When the same experiment is performed with GRK2, rhodopsin is strongly preferred as a substrate and NHERF is not detectably phosphorylated (Fig.3 B, lanes 3 and 4). To characterize the primary site of GRK6A phosphorylation, the NHERF S287A, S289A, and S290A point mutants were expressed as hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins, purified, and examined alongside wild-type NHERF for their ability to be phosphorylated by GRK6A. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the S287A and S290A mutants were phosphorylated by GRK6A as efficiently as wild-type NHERF, while the S289A mutant was not detectably phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of NHERF domain 1 versus domain 2 was also examined, to see if the presence of the high affinity GRK6A binding site in the first NHERF PDZ domain is required for NHERF phosphorylation by GRK6A; as shown in Fig. 3 D, NHERF domain 2 was phosphorylated slightly better than full-length NHERF (domain 2 phosphorylation = 127 ± 16% of wild-type; n = 4), while domain 1 was not detectably phosphorylated. Metabolic labeling experiments were also performed to examine the cellular phosphorylation of transfected full-length NHERF versus domain 2; no significant difference in 32P incorporation per unit protein was observed in three independent experiments. These results reveal that NHERF is a substrate for phosphorylation by GRK6A, that the primary site of phosphorylation is Ser289, and that the first NHERF PDZ domain plays little or no role in mediating GRK6A phosphorylation of NHERF. The observation that removal of the first PDZ domain of NHERF does not reduce phosphorylation by GRK6A suggested that the second PDZ domain of NHERF might be the GRK6A binding site relevant for phosphorylation. To examine this possibility, a version of NHERF domain 2 was prepared with a mutation of two amino acids (K158A,K159A) in the second PDZ domain. Crystallographic studies on other PDZ domains have suggested that a positively charged residue at one of these positions is important for interaction with the terminal carboxylate groups of bound peptides (23Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), and thus mutation of these two lysines to alanines might be expected to reduce the affinity of the second NHERF PDZ domain for binding partners. The positions of lysines 158 and 159 relative to the two NHERF PDZ domains and Ser289 are indicated in the schematic diagram of NHERF presented in Fig. 3 E. As shown in Fig. 4 A, binding of 500 nm K158A,K159A NHERF domain 2 to the GRK6A carboxyl terminus was substantially reduced relative to the binding of 500 nm wild-type domain 2 (wild-type = 4.2 ± 0.9-fold higher than K158A,K159A mutant domain 2 binding;n = 4). It is not possible with the overlay assay to perform saturation binding studies to estimate the affinity of either the wild-type or mutant domain 2 for the GRK6A carboxyl terminus, since extremely high concentrations of the domain 2 fusion protein (up to 50 μm) would be required to reach saturation binding. The signal-to-noise ratio is very unfavorable under such conditions, as can be seen in the large amount of background staining in the blot overlays shown in Fig. 4 A. The phosphorylation of the K158A,K159A mutant domain 2 by GRK6A was examined next. When assayed alongside wild-type domain 2, the K158A,K159A mutant exhibited markedly reduced phosphorylation by GRK6A at low substrate concentrations, while at high substrate concentrations GRK6A-mediated phosphorylation of the K158A,K159A mutant was slightly enhanced (Fig. 4 B). These findings translate into significantly different Km and Vmax values for the mutant NHERF domain 2 relative to the wild-type (wild-type Km = 0.69 ± 0.13 μm versus 2.48 μm ± 0.49 for the mutant; wild-type Vmax = 10.6 ± 0.5 nmol/min/mg versus 14.0 ± 0.9 nmol/min/mg for the mutant). The Vmax/Kmvalue for wild-type domain 2 was 2.8-fold higher than that for the K158A,K159A mutant, indicating that the wild-type NHERF domain 2 is a better substrate than the K158A,K159A mutant for phosphorylation by GRK6A. Since the phosphorylation of NHERF by GRK6A is on the same serine as the constitutive NHERF phosphorylation observed in HEK-293 cells, we wondered if GRK6A might be the kinase responsible for the constitutive cellular NHERF phosphorylation. Most of the reagents known to alter GRK activity (e.g. heparin, anti-GRK antibodies) are not cell-permeable, and thus 32P labeling studies in whole cells cannot easily be performed in the presence of these reagents. We therefore examined the effects of these reagents in vitro on phosphorylation of NHERF by both purified GRK6A and the endogenous NHERF kinase activity in HEK-293 cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 5 A, heparin potently activated GRK6A kinase activity, both with regard to NHERF phosphorylation (second bar) and GRK6A autophosphorylation (data not shown). GRK6A phosphorylation of NHERF was inhibited by anti-GRK4/5/6 monoclonal antibody, but not by anti-GRK2/3 antibody, and was also inhibited by an excess of NHERF domain 1 fusion protein. This latter finding emphasizes that efficient phosphorylation of NHERF by GRK6A is dependent on a PDZ domain-mediated interaction. The phosphorylation of NHERF by GRK6A was also inhibited by high concentrations, but not low concentrations, of the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, consistent with previous findings for GRK2 (14Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). When the NHERF kinase activity in HEK-293 cell lysates was examined for sensitivity to the treatments shown to affect GRK6A phosphorylation of NHERF, a very similar profile of activation and inhibition was observed (Fig. 5 B). The NHERF kinase activity in the HEK-293 cell lysates was activated by heparin, unaffected by anti-GRK2/3 antibody or 10 nm staurosporine, and inhibited by anti-GRK4/5/6 antibody, NHERF domain 1, and 10 μm staurosporine. These data suggest that GRK6A is the kinase responsible for the constitutive phosphorylation of NHERF Ser289 in these cells. NHERF was originally identified as the protein co-factor required for regulation of NHE3 by PKA (4Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation by PKA has been shown to enhance NHERF inhibition of NHE3 in vitro (4Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. J. Clin Invest. 1993; 92: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the experiments described here and in two other recent studies (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Lamprecht G. Weinman E.J. Yun C.-H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29972-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) demonstrate that modulation of PKA activity has no significant effect on NHERF phosphorylation in cells. This lack of PKA-mediated NHERF phosphorylation may be related to the observation that cellular NHERF is highly phosphorylated even under basal conditions. We therefore sought to characterize the constitutive phosphorylation of NHERF and identify the responsible kinase or kinases. We conclude that almost all of the NHERF in HEK-293 cells is phosphorylated under basal conditions and that the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation is GRK6A. GRK6A phosphorylates NHERF on Ser289, the primary site of constitutive phosphorylation of NHERF in HEK-293 cells. There is evidence that PKA can also phosphorylate NHERF on Ser289, or an adjacent serine, in vitro (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ser289furthermore conforms to the ideal R-X-X-S/T-X-E/D motif for CaMKII phosphorylation (24Songyang Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), and we have found that this site is an excellent substrate for CaMKII in vitro. 3R. A. Hall and R. J. Lefkowitz, unpublished observations. However, NHERF Ser289 does not seem to be a substrate for PKA or CaMKII in HEK-293 cells, probably due to constitutive phosphorylation of this site by GRK6A. GRK6 is widely expressed; most tissues exhibit a mixture of GRK6A and GRK6B, although the former is predominant in the brain and the latter is predominant elsewhere (22Firsov D. Elalouf J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C953-C961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have examined NHERF phosphorylation in several cell lines, and found a high level of constitutive phosphorylation in all of them, 4R. S. Spurney, and R. J. Lefkowitz, unpublished observations. consistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of GRK6A. Is the phosphorylation of NHERF Ser289 by GRK6A of physiological relevance? Ser289 is located within a cluster of serines that has previously been identified as a key region involved in regulating the ability of NHERF to inhibit NHE3 activity (7Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Tate K. Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2199-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, it is plausible that phosphorylation of NHERF in this region by GRK6A will influence NHERF inhibition of NHE3. The interaction of NHERF and NHE3 is mediated by the region of NHERF encompassing the second PDZ domain and the tail (25Yun C.-H.C. Lamprecht G. Forster D.V. Sidor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25856-25863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and it is therefore reasonable that phosphorylation of the serine-rich stretch in the center of this region (including Ser289) might affect the physical interaction of NHERF with NHE3. The phosphorylation of NHERF by GRK6A depends upon the binding of the GRK6A tail to the second NHERF PDZ domain. There are three lines of evidence supporting this contention: (i) NHERF is efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by GRK6A but not GRK6B or GRK6C, splice variants that differ only in their extreme carboxyl-terminal regions, (ii) a mutation in the second NHERF PDZ domain that lowers the binding affinity for GRK6A lowers the efficiency with which NHERF is phosphorylated by GRK6A, and (iii) preincubation with a molar excess of NHERF domain 1 reduces the ability of GRK6A to phosphorylate full-length NHERF. This latter effect is presumably due to the fact that NHERF domain 1 binds to the tail of GRK6A with high affinity and prevents the kinase from binding to the second PDZ domain and phosphorylating any full-length NHERF presented to it. GRK6A binds with extremely high affinity to the first NHERF PDZ domain and with much lower affinity to the second NHERF PDZ domain. Nonetheless, our data indicate that the latter interaction is the relevant one for facilitating NHERF phosphorylation. A mutation that reduces the binding of NHERF domain 2 to the GRK6A tail by approximately 4-fold reduces the efficiency with which GRK6A phosphorylates domain 2 by approximately 3-fold. This difference in the rate of GRK6A phosphorylation of the mutant and wild-type domain 2 fusion proteins is exaggerated at low substrate concentrations, where the affinity of kinase for substrate is a central determinant of the rate of phosphorylation. At high substrate concentrations, where the affinity of kinase for substrate is less important than how rapidly the kinase can move from one substrate to another, the K158A,K159A mutant domain 2 is actually a slightly better substrate for GRK6A phosphorylation than wild-type domain 2. This is presumably due to the fact that the lowered affinity of GRK6A for domain 2 translates into a faster off-rate, allowing GRK6A to disengage from substrate more rapidly following phosphorylation. G protein-coupled receptor kinases were originally identified based on their ability to phosphorylate and desensitize G protein-coupled receptors (26Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The first non-receptor GRK substrate identified was tubulin (27Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20308-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). NHERF represents the second non-receptor GRK substrate identified, although clearly it is not a substrate for all GRKs but rather is a specific substrate for GRK6A. The requirement for GRK6A binding to NHERF via a PDZ domain-mediated interaction is consistent with the notion that GRKs need to be localized near their substrates in order to phosphorylate (26Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Peptide phosphorylation experiments have previously revealed that GRK6 prefers basic residues to the amino-terminal side of phosphorylation sites (30Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no phosphorylation sites within GRK6 substrates have been mapped. The finding made here that Ser289 in NHERF is an excellent substrate for GRK6A phosphorylation represents the first defined phosphorylation site within a GRK6 substrate, and it is of interest that this site conforms to the R-X-X-S/T motif proposed to be ideal for GRK6 phosphorylation (30Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified Ser289 as the major site of constitutive phosphorylation of NHERF expressed in HEK-293 cells. We have also shown that NHERF binds to GRK6A via a PDZ domain-mediated interaction, that GRK6A phosphorylates NHERF on Ser289, and that the constitutive NHERF kinase activity in HEK-293 cell lysates has many properties in common with GRK6A. These results point to GRK6A as the kinase in HEK-293 cells responsible for the high level of constitutive NHERF phosphorylation.

Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of surface protein anchoring to the bacterial cell wall has recently been established for protein A of Staphylococcus aureus. After synthesis in the cytoplasm, protein A is initiated into the secretory pathway by an NH2-terminal leader peptide (2Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). A COOH-terminal sorting signal is necessary and sufficient for the anchoring of protein A and functions first to retain the polypeptide within the secretory pathway (3Schneewind O.

This amide bond exchange mechanism displays a striking similarity to the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidation reaction, during which murein pentapeptide is cleaved between d-Ala-d-Ala and the liberated carboxyl of d-Ala at position four is amide-linked to the amino of the pentaglycine cross-bridge (11Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Elements involved in transpeptidation and cell wall sorting are conserved, suggesting that surface protein anchoring is a universal mechanism in Gram-positive pathogens (1Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If so, sortase, the enzymatic activity that is thought to catalyze this reaction, might also be found conserved in many different bacterial species. Methods that inhibit sortase may be used as anti-bacterial therapies for the treatment of human infections caused by Gram-positive microbes. Although surface protein anchoring has been characterized in molecular detail, little is known about the peptidoglycan substrate. Because a biochemical in vitro reaction for sortase has not yet been established, we approached this question by searching for inhibitors of cell wall sorting. During bacterial cell wall synthesis, a soluble cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursor (UDP-MurNac-l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala, where iGln is iso-glutaminyl; Park's nucleotide) is linked to undecaprenolpyrophosphate to generate lipid I (13Chatterjee A.N.

Lipid II serves as a substrate for the transglycosylation reaction, which polymerizes the glycan strands of the bacterial cell wall to yield repeating disaccharide (MurNac-GlcNac)n (18Nakagawa J.

Cell wall pentapeptides (l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala) linked to the MurNac of nascent peptidoglycan strands are cross-linked via the transpeptidation reaction, thereby generating a three-dimensional cell wall network that protects bacteria from osmotic lysis (11Tipper D.J.

Although penicillin effectively blocks the cross-linking of wall peptides (19Izaki K. Matsuhashi M. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moenomycin is an inhibitor of transglycosylation because this compound inhibits C55-isoprenoid-alcohol kinase (26Sandermann H. Biochim. Biophys.

Singer H. van Heijenoort J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 667-674PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that vancomycin and moenomycin, but not penicillin, cause a reduction in the rate of surface protein anchoring, suggesting that sortase may utilize lipid II as a substrate for the sorting reaction. Consistent with this hypothesis is our observation that staphylococcal protoplasts, in which the assembled cell wall has been removed by digestion with muralytic enzyme, catalyze the cleavage of surface proteins at their LP X TG motif similar to bacteria with an intact cell wall. A search for chemical inhibitors of the sorting reaction identified methanethiosulfonates as well as organic mercurials, indicating that sortase must be a sulfhydryl-containing enzyme. Plasmids pSeb-Spa490–524 (3Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), pSeb-Cws-BlaZ, and pSeb-CwsΔLP X TG-BlaZ (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) were transformed into S. aureus OS2 (spa:ermC, r −) (2Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and have been described previously. Staphylococci were generally grown in tryptic soy broth or agar. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. S. aureus OS2(pSeb-Spa490–524) was grown overnight in CDM (29van de Rijn I. Kessler R.E. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 444-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Jeol BioSciences) supplemented with chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), diluted 1:10 into minimal medium, and grown with shaking at 37 °C until A600 0.6. Cells were labeled with 100 μCi of35S-labeled Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 min. Labeling was quenched by the addition of an excess nonradioactive amino acid (50-μl chase (100 mg/ml casamino acids, 20 mg/ml methionine and cysteine)). At timed intervals (0, 1, 3, and 10 min) after the addition of the chase, 250-μl aliquots were removed, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of 250 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min, washed with 1 ml of acetone, and dried. Samples were suspended in 1 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and staphylococcal peptidoglycan was digested by adding 50 μl of lysostaphin (30Schindler C.A. Schuhardt V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) (100 μg, AMBI Pharmaceuticals) and incubating for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were again precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with α-Seb1 followed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. To characterize the P1 and P2 precursors, 1 ml of culture was either incubated with 5 mm sodium azide for 5 min prior to labeling or 5 mm MTSET was added 15 s after the beginning of the pulse. Overnight cultures of S. aureus OS2(pSeb-Spa490–524) grown in CDM were diluted into fresh minimal medium and incubated until A600 0.3. Cultures were then treated with penicillin (10 μg/ml), vancomycin (10 μg/ml), or moenomycin (10 μg/ml) or were left untreated. A 0.5-ml culture sample was removed for pulse labeling with 100 μCi of 35S-labeled Promix for 5 min. Labeling was quenched and proteins precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed in acetone, and dried under vacuum. The pellets were suspended in 1 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 μl of lysostaphin (100 μg/ml, AMBI Pharmaceuticals) was added, and the staphylococcal cell wall was digested by incubating for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed in acetone, dried, solubilized in 50 μl of 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% SDS, and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots of solubilized surface protein were immunoprecipitated with α-Seb followed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. Staphylococci were grown in the presence or absence of antibiotics as described above. At 30-min intervals, 0.5-ml culture samples were withdrawn and labeled with either 50 μCi of [3H]lysine or 50 μCi of [3H]leucine for 20 min (31Boothby D. Daneo-Moore L. Shockman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All labeling was quenched by the addition of 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were heated to 96 °C for 30 min, cooled to room temperature, and pipetted onto glass fiber filters. The filters were placed into a holder and washed under vacuum suction with 25 ml of 75% ethanol and 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. After incubation in 5 ml of Pronase solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mg/ml Pronase) at 30 °C for 30 min, filters were washed again with 4 ml of distilled water and 4 ml of ethanol. The amount of radioactivity retained by the filter was determined by scintillation counting (31Boothby D. Daneo-Moore L. Shockman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). S. aureus OS2(pSeb-Spa490–524) was grown overnight in CDM supplemented with chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), diluted 1:10 into minimal medium, and grown with shaking at 37 °C until A600 0.6. Cells were labeled with 100 μCi of35S-labeled Promix for 5 min. Chemicals were added to a final concentration of 5 mm 15 s after the beginning of the pulse. All labeling was quenched by adding trichloroacetic acid to 10%. Precipitated cells and proteins were collected by centrifugation, washed in acetone and the staphylococcal cell wall digested with lysostaphin as described above. The digests were again precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, immunoprecipitated with α-Seb followed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. Overnight cultures of S. aureus OS2(pSeb-Cws-BlaZ) or S. aureus OS2(pSeb-CwsΔLP X TG-BlaZ) grown in CDM were diluted 1:10 into minimal medium and grown with shaking at 37 °C until A600 0.6. One ml of culture was pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of 35S-labeled Promix for 2 min, and labeling was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of chase solution. Culture aliquots (0.5 ml) were removed for trichloroacetic acid precipitation either during the pulse or 20 min after the addition of chase. Another culture aliquot was first converted to protoplasts and then subjected to labeling. The cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min and suspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.4 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5. The cell wall was digested with lysostaphin (100 μg) for 30 min at 37 °C. The protoplasts were washed in sucrose buffer and labeled with 100 μCi of35S-labeled Promix for 2 min, and labeling was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of chase solution. For sedimentation analysis, pulse-labeled protoplasts were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min to separate soluble surface proteins from those that were bound to cell membranes. All samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed in acetone, and suspended in 50 μl of 4% SDS, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with boiling for 10 min. Aliquots of solubilized surface protein precursor and anchored products were immunoprecipitated with α-Seb and α-BlaZ and subjected to SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. We sought to identify compounds that interfered with the anchoring of surface proteins by testing known inhibitors of proteases. Our experimental design employed the reporter protein Seb-Spa490–524, which, when expressed in S. aureus OS2 cells, is synthesized as a precursor in the cytoplasm and initiated into the secretory pathway by an NH2-terminal leader peptide (P1 precursor) (3Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). After signal peptide cleavage, the P2 precursor bearing a COOH-terminal sorting signal serves as a substrate for sortase, an enzyme that cleaves between the threonine and the glycine of the LP X TG motif (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The liberated carboxyl of threonine is amide-linked to the amino of cell wall cross-bridges, thereby generating mature, anchored surface protein (M) (6Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Surface protein processing was investigated by pulse labeling polypeptides with [35S]methionine. During the pulse, all three species, P1 and P2 precursors as well as mature Seb-Spa490–524, were detected (Fig. 1). Within 1 min after the addition of the chase, most pulse-labeled surface protein was converted to the mature, anchored species. Surface protein anchoring was complete 3 min after the quenching of [35S]methionine incorporation. Sodium azide is an inhibitor of SecA, an essential component of the secretory pathway in bacteria (32Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Addition of 5 mm sodium azide to staphylococcal cultures 5 min prior to pulse-labeling significantly reduced protein export and led to the accumulation of a leader peptide bearing P1 precursor (2Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar)(Fig. 1). Methanethiosulfonates react with sulfhydryl groups (33Akabas M.H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12496-12500Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and one of these compounds, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), prevented incorporation of [35S]methionine by staphylococci. However, when added 15 s after the beginning of the pulse, MTSET interfered with the cleavage of sorting signals at the LP X TG motif, whereas the Sec-dependent export of the P1 precursor remained unaltered. This result revealed that sortase must harbor a sulfhydryl group that is necessary for enzymatic cleavage at the LP X TG-bearing sorting signals. If sortase requires sulfhydryl for enzymatic activity, the addition of other sulfhydryl reagents may also inhibit the cleavage of sorting signals at the LP X TG motif. This assumption was tested, and (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), another methanethiosulfonate, also interfered with sorting, albeit not as effectively as MTSET (Table I). Furthermore, p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, an organic mercurial known to inhibit cysteine proteases, displayed an inhibitory effect, whereas alkylating reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetate, and iodoacetamide did not (34Creighton T.E. Proteins. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl reducing agents, i.e. dithiothreitol and mercaptoethanol, did not affect the sorting reaction. Neither phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, which reacts with hydroxyl (34Creighton T.E. Proteins. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993Google Scholar), nor treatment with the divalent cation chelator EDTA interfered with cell wall sorting, indicating that sortase likely does not require divalent cations or hydroxyl for cleavage and anchoring of surface protein.Table IInhibition of the sorting reaction by methanethiosulfonates and organic mercurialCompound[P2]/[M]5 mm[2-(Trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate23.14 ± 0.061-aData represent an average of three measurements.

To examine the effect of known antibiotics on cell wall sorting, we chose three compounds, penicillin, vancomycin, and moenomycin. S. aureus OS2(pSeb-Spa490–524) was grown in minimal medium to A600 0.3, treated with 10 μg/ml penicillin, vancomycin, or moenomycin, and incubated for an additional 5 h (Fig. 2). At 30-min intervals during this experiment, aliquots were withdrawn for measurements of surface protein sorting and cell wall synthesis. The effect of antibiotics on the rate of bacterial cell wall synthesis was determined as the ratio of [3H]lysine/[3H]leucine label incorporated into acid-precipitable, Pronase-resistant peptidoglycan (31Boothby D. Daneo-Moore L. Shockman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Lysine is a component of peptidoglycan, whereas leucine is not. Hence, the ratio of incorporation of these two amino acids is a measure of cell wall synthesis. Surface protein anchoring was measured by pulse labeling and quantified as the ratio between the concentration of P2 precursor [P2] and mature, anchored Seb-Spa490–524 [M]. The addition of vancomycin, penicillin, or moenomycin reduced the growth rate of staphylococci as compared with a mock treated control. Whereas the rate of cell wall sorting precursor cleavage remained constant during the growth of mock-treated staphylococci, the addition of vancomycin led to a steady accumulation of P2 precursor, indicating that this compound caused a reduction of the sorting reaction. A similar, albeit weaker, effect was observed when moenomycin was added to staphylococcal cultures. In contrast, penicillin G did not alter the rate of cell wall sorting. As expected, all three antibiotics diminished the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis (TableII). Together these data revealed that vancomycin and moenomycin cause a reduction in the rate of cell wall sorting, whereas penicillin has no effect on surface protein anchoring.Table IIAntibiotic inhibition of cell wall synthesis and the effect on cell wall sortingCompound[P2]/[M]2-aData represent an average of three measurements.

The data are presented as percent inhibition. Previous work revealed that protoplasts, generated by muralytic digestion of staphylococci or penicillin selection of streptococcal L forms, secrete surface protein into the surrounding medium (35van de Rijn I. Fischetti V.A. Infect. Immun. 1981; 32: 86-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Movitz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This observation can be explained in two ways. Either the COOH-terminal sorting signals cannot retain surface proteins in the envelope of protoplasts, or the presence of an intact, assembled cell wall is not required to cleave sorting signals at their LP X TG motif. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured surface protein anchoring in intact bacteria and staphylococcal protoplasts (Fig.3). Wild-type staphylococci cleaved the Seb-Cws-BlaZ precursor to generate the mature, anchored NH2-terminal Seb and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic BlaZ fragments (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). When tested in staphylococcal protoplasts generated by lysostaphin digestion of the cell wall, precursor cleavage occurred similar to that in whole cells, indicating that the presence of a mature, assembled cell wall is not required for cleavage of sorting signals. We observed unique sorting products in protoplasts that migrated more slowly than mature, anchored Seb (see arrow in Fig. 3). As these species were immunoprecipitated with α-Seb but not with α-BlaZ (data not shown), they likely represent products of the sorting reaction. The COOH-terminal anchor structure of the protoplast species must be distinct from that generated by lysostaphin digestion of anchored Seb (three glycyl attached to the carboxyl of threonine), because the proteins migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE than lysostaphin-released Seb. To examine whether all cleaved Seb fragments were released into the extracellular medium, pulse-labeled protoplasts were sedimented by centrifugation and separated from the extracellular medium in the supernatant. All Seb-Cws-BlaZ precursor and COOH-terminal BlaZ cleavage fragments sedimented with the protoplasts. In contrast, NH2-terminal Seb fragments that migrated at the same speed as Seb released by lysostaphin digestion from the cell wall of intact staphylococci were soluble in the culture medium. Some, but not all, of the more slowly migrating Seb species sedimented upon centrifugation, suggesting that these products of the sorting reaction may be attached to protoplast membranes. No precursor cleavage was observed for Seb-CwsΔLP X TG-BlaZ either in whole cells or staphylococcal protoplasts. To characterize the peptidoglycan substrate of the cell wall sorting reaction, we performed two experiments. If cell wall sorting requires the pentaglycine cross-bridges of mature, assembled cell wall as a substrate, we would expect that the treatment of bacterial cultures with antibiotics should not affect the anchoring of surface proteins. However, both moenomycin and vancomycin treatment of staphylococci slowed the sorting reaction. Moenomycin is an inhibitor of transglycosylation, whereas vancomycin binds tod-Ala-d-Ala within lipid II. Both moenomycin and vancomycin are known to prevent incorporation of lipid II precursors into peptidoglycan (26Sandermann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 444: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 37Walsh C.T. Science. 1993; 261: 308-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cell wall sorting was increased with prolonged incubation of staphylococci in the presence of antibiotic, suggesting that moenomycin and vancomycin do not interfere directly with the sorting reaction. Rather, these compounds alter the physiological concentration of peptidoglycan precursor molecules that may serve as a substrate for the sorting reaction (22Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3169-3179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If so, penicillin G, which inhibits the cross-linking of polymerized peptidoglycan strands without altering the concentration of lipid II (22Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3169-3179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), should not affect the sorting reaction. This predicted result was indeed observed. Thus, we suggest that the observed inhibition of surface protein anchoring by moenomycin and vancomycin may be the result of the reduced availability of lipid II for the sorting reaction. The question of antibiotic inhibition of anchoring protein A to the cell wall has been addressed previously. Although the mechanism of cell wall sorting was unknown at the time, Movitz (38Movitz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) examined the effect of vancomycin on the incorporation of protein A into cell wall polymer and observed no effect. In contrast to our measurements of the rate of cell wall sorting precursor cleavage, these observations relied on the binding of cell wall-associated protein A to immunoglobulin as a measure of the amount of surface protein anchoring. We think it is likely that the discrepancy between Movitz' results and our data may be related to the nature of the assays employed to measure cell wall anchoring of protein A. If sortase, the enzyme that catalyzes cleavage of surface proteins at the LP X TG motif and linkage to peptidoglycan cross-bridges, does not require mature, assembled cell wall, cleavage of precursors should proceed in staphylococcal protoplasts. This prediction was confirmed here. Furthermore, we also observed cleaved surface protein with unique mobility on SDS-PAGE. Some of these species appeared to sediment with the protoplast membranes, an observation that is consistent with the linkage of surface protein to lipid-linked peptidoglycan precursor (27Sandermann H. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5123-5131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this time, we cannot provide biochemical proof for the existence of lipid-linked sorting intermediates because such molecules have not yet been purified and characterized. Sortase functions as a transpeptidase, and simple hydrolysis of the sorting signal by cleavage between the threonine and the glycine of the LP X TG motif has never been observed (1Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transpeptidation can be accomplished via an active site hydroxyl or sulfhydryl of sortase, which may thereby capture surface proteins as acyl enzyme intermediates (39Rasmussen J.R. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To distinguish between the possibilities of an active site hydroxyl or sulfhydryl, we searched for inhibitors of the sorting reaction and report that cleavage at the LP X TG motif of surface proteins is sensitive to methanethiosulfonates and p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid. Thus, it appears that sortase utilizes a sulfhydryl group to form an acyl intermediate with cleaved polypeptide chains. This hypothesis is supported by two observations. First, several slower reacting sulfhydryl alkylating reagents do not interfere with sorting, consistent with the notion that the active site sulfhydryl of sortase is generally occupied as an acyl enzyme. Second, recent isolation of the structural gene for sortase revealed the presence of a single cysteine (sulfhydryl group) that is conserved in homologous enzymes identified by data base searches in the genomes of other Gram-positive bacteria. 2Mazmanian, S.

Pancholi and Fischetti (40Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2119-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) described a membrane anchor cleavage enzyme activity of M protein when Streptococcus pyogenes was pretreated with muralytic enzyme. The chemical nature of this M protein cleavage and release into the extra-cellular milieu of protoplasts is not known. Although membrane anchor cleavage enzyme can be inhibited by organic mercurials such as p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid, this activity is sensitive to the addition of divalent cations (40Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2119-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, membrane anchor cleavage enzyme must be distinct from sortase, as this enzyme cannot be inhibited by either ZnCl2 or CaCl2. We thank Drs. Ron Kaback and David Sigman (UCLA) for discussions and suggesting the use of methanethiosulfonates. We are indebted to Dr. Norris Allen (Lilly) for the gift of moenomycin. We thank Drs.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the exact nature of this interaction is not clear, proposed models entail formation of a multimolecular complex involving heparan sulfates, a heparin-binding growth factor, and the corresponding growth factor receptor with the involvement (direct or indirect) of heparan sulfates in high affinity receptor dimerization and alteration in growth factor-receptor conformation allowing for a better “fit” (3Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R.

In the case of bFGF, a prototypical heparin-binding growth factor, HS-bFGF interaction is thought to lead to dimerization of bFGF that facilitates growth factor binding to FGF receptor 1 that is in turn followed by receptor dimerization and activation of intracellular signaling cascade. Therefore any alteration of HS chain composition on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix by means of altered synthesis, degradation, or modification of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains can, conceivably, affect heparin-binding growth factor signaling. The majority of heparan sulfates on the cell surface is associated with one of two classes of core proteins, syndecans and glypicans. The syndecan family is composed of four closely related proteins (syndecans-1, -2, -3, and -4) coded by four different genes. Syndecans-1 and -4 show expression in a variety of cell types including epithelial, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle cells, although expression in quiescent tissues is fairly low (6Bernfield M.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Syndecan-2 (fibroglycan) is expressed at high levels in cultured lung and skin fibroblasts, although immunocytochemically it is barely detectable in most adult tissues (6Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Syndecan-3 (N-syndecan) demonstrates a much more limited pattern of expression, being largely restricted to peripheral nerves and central nervous system tissues, although high levels of expression are present in neonatal heart (8Carey D.J. Evans D.M. Stahl R.C. Asundi V.K. Conner K.J. Garbes P. Cizmeci-Smith G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Syndecans are capable of carrying both HS and chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains although most of syndecan-associated biological effects, including regulation of blood coagulation, cell adhesion, and signal transduction are largely thought to be due to the presence of HS chains capable of binding growth factors, cell adhesion receptors, and other biologically active molecules (5Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 9Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). At the same time, relatively little attention has been paid to the function of core proteins themselves. All syndecans are membrane-spanning proteins possessing highly conserved C-terminal and transmembrane domains. The cytoplasmic domain contains four universally conserved tyrosines, a conserved serine and a C-terminal EFYA sequence of amino acids comprising a PDZ-binding region. Several observations suggested that syndecan expression may be related to cell proliferation. Thus, mesenchymal cell growth during tooth organogenesis is also associated with transient induction of syndecan-1 gene expression (10Vainio S. Jalkanen M. Vaahtokari A. Sahlberg C. Mali M. Bernfield M. Thesleff I. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In adult tissues, expression of syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 is increased in arterial smooth muscle cells after balloon catheter injury (11Nikkari S.T. Jarvelainen H.T. Wight T.N. Ferguson M. Clowes A.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1348-1356PubMed Google Scholar), in healing skin wounds (12Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivitra M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J.

Res. 1997; 81: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The effects of changes in syndecan expression on cell behavior are not well understood. Overexpression of syndecan-1 in 3T3 cells led to inhibition of bFGF-induced growth (15Mali M. Elenius K. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24215-24222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in 293T cells it augmented serum-dependent growth (16Numa F. Hirabayashi K. Tsunaga N. Kato H., K, O.R. Shao H. Stechmann-Lebakken C. Varani J. Rapraeger A. Dixit V.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4676-4680PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, syndecan-1 overexpression increased intercellular adhesion in lymphoid (17Lebakken C.S. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1209-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and Raji cells (18Filla M.S. Dam P. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 310-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) while decreasing the ability of B-lymphocytes to invade collagen gels (19Liebersbach B.F. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20013-20019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glypican core protein family consists of five murine and human members and a Drosophila homologue, dally (5Rosenberg R.D. Shworak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Unlike syndecans, glypicans are fully extracellular proteins attached to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Only one family member, glypican-1, has been identified in endothelial cells. Another unique feature of glypicans is that they carry essentially only HS chains (20Aviezer D. Levy E. Safran M. Svahn C. Buddecke E. Schmidt A. David G. Vlodavsky I. Yayon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 114-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas little is known about their biological function, glypicans appear able to stimulate FGF receptor 1 occupancy by bFGF and promote biological activity of FGF and TGF-β family members (21Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although the effect of syndecan expression on cell function is thought to be largely mediated via extracellular HS chains, a number of observations point to a key role of cytoplasmic domains in syndecan function. Recent studies have shown that syndecan cytoplasmic domain can interact with a number of proteins including PKC-α (22Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), syntenin (23Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and CASK/lin-2A (24Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to assess the relative contributions of extracellular HS chains versus syndecan core protein expression in endothelial cells. Immortalized ECV304 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in M199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with heat-inactivated 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Full-length coding region cDNAs for rat syndecan-4 (26Kojima T. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kind gift of N. Shworak, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston) and rat glypican-1 (27Litwack E.D. Stipp C.S. Kumbasar A. Lander A.D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3713-3724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kind gift of A. Lander, University of California, Davis) expression constructs were prepared in a retroviral vector MSCV2.2 (28Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 136-138PubMed Google Scholar) (courtesy of Dr. R. Hawley, University of Toronto) by cloning a Bam HI/Hpa I fragment of rat syndecan-4 into cDNA into Bgl II/Hpa I site of MSCV2.2 vector and Bam HI/Eco RI fragment of rat glypican-1 into Bgl II/Eco RI sites of the same vector. Syndecan/glypican chimeras were created via PCR mutagenesis, cloned into the pCDNA3 vector, sequenced, and shuttled into the MSCV2.2 vector. Syndecan-4-GPI (S4-GPI) construct was created by deleting C-terminal end of rat syndecan-4 sequence starting with Gln247 and replacing it with the C-terminal sequence of rat glypican-1 starting with Ser510. Glypican-syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain (G1-S4c) construct was created by replacing C-terminal sequence of rat glypican-1 starting with Ser510with amino acids 247–321 of the rat syndecan-4 sequence. The created chimera thus contains both transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of syndecan-4. Syndecan-4 construct with mutated GAG attachment sites (S4ΔGAG) was created by point mutations of Ser44 → Ala, Ser65 → Ala, and Ser67 → Ala. Full-length rat syndecan-1 cDNA and syndecan-4 cDNAs were cloned into the pGRE (29Bein K. Husain M. Ware J.A. Mucenski M.L. Rosenberg R.D. Simons M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) expression vector. Transduction of the MSCV2.2 vector alone as well as transfection of NeoR was used to generate control ECV cell populations. For retroviral transductions, the virus was produced by calcium phosphate transient transfection (30Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar) of 10 μg of each construct on amphotropic Phoenix packaging cells (ATCC). Viral supernatants were collected after 36, 48, and 72 h, sterile-filtered through 0.2-μm filter, and then transferred to ECV304 cells at 32 °C in the presence of 25 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. Typical viral titers in the supernatant were approximately 68·105 infectious particles/ml. Virus exposure was repeated 4 times for each construct; following the last exposure the cells were cultured in 10% FBS/M199 supplemented with 400 μg/ml active G418 (Sigma) for 2 weeks. Stable transfections were carried out with supercoiled, Qiagen column-purified plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. At 16–220 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded again. For isolation of stable transfectants, the cells were plated in duplicate 100-mm culture dishes. After 10–14 days of growth in G418 containing medium (1.2 mg/ml), single colonies were picked and grown in 24-well plates before further growth in tissue culture flasks. Appropriate construct expression was documented using RT-PCR and Western analysis (see below). No induction of GRE promoter was used for functional studies. For growth assays, 100,000 cells were plated in 6-well cell culture plates and allowed to attach overnight. At that time, the cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the medium was changed to M199 supplemented with 0.25% FBS. Twenty four hours later, 25 ng/ml bFGF (Chiron Corp.) were added to the cell culture medium. Cell counts were then obtained at 24-h intervals starting with the time of exposure to bFGF by trypsinizing the well and counting cell suspension on a Coulter counter (Coulter Corp.). Migration assays were carried out using modified Boyden chambers (Neuroprobe, Inc). ECV304 cells and derived clones were grown in 10% FBS/M199 supplemented with 25 ng/ml DiI ((3) 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanide perchlorate (DiIC18), Molecular Probes) living cell fluorescent stain overnight. Following that, the cells were trypsinized, washed with M199, diluted in M199 supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and seeded in wells at 60,000 cells per well. The cell containing compartments were separated from the lower wells by 25 × 80-mm polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Poretics Corp.). The lower chambers were filled with 0.5% FBS/M199 supplemented with 50 ng/ml bFGF, and the entire apparatus was incubated in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4.5 h. After that time non-migrating cells were removed by washing the upper wells with PBS; the upper surfaces of the filters were scraped with a plastic blade, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 1 min and placed on a glass slide. The migrated cells were imaged using a digital SesSysTM camera attached to a Nikon fluorescent microscope. For each slide, 10 non-overlapping high power fields were selected for analysis. Following image acquisition using PMIS image processing software (Photometrics, Ltd.) the number of cells was automatically determined using Optimas 6.0 software (Bioscan, Inc.) Growth factor-depleted MatrigelTM (Beckton Dickinson) plates were prepared by adding 0.5 ml of thawed MatrigelTM to a well of a refrigerated 24-well tissue culture plate. The gel was allowed to solidify for 1 h at 37 °C and overlaid with 1 ml of 0.5% FBS/M199 containing 30,000 cells. The cell culture was carried out at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2. The analysis of cell growth was carried out by obtaining low (× 10) and high (× 40) power images of the wells with a digital SesSysTM camera focused on the surface of the gel using an inverted Nikon fluorescent microscope. The cell-covered area was then determined using Optimas 6.0 software. To document increased expression of appropriate core proteins in newly generated cell lines, Western blotting was used to determine the expression of syndecan-4 and syndecan-1 core proteins, respectively. In the case of syndecan-4 expression studies, cultured cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized for 10 min at 37 °C (0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA) to remove extracellular domains of syndecans. The cell suspension was again washed three times with PBS, lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mmNaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4), resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 16.5% Tris glycine gel (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was carried out using a cytoplasmic tail-specific antiserum for syndecan-4 (kind gift of Dr. N. Shworak, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston) as described previously (31Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For syndecan-1 expression studies, cultured cells were washed with PBS, lysed as described above, and digested with Flavobacterium heparatinase 1, 2, and 3 (0.25 units/μl, Sigma) and chondroitinase ABC (0.005 units/μl, Sigma). Following another round of PBS washes, cell lysates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with anti-syndecan-1 ectodomain antibody (kind gift of Dr. A. Rapraeger, University of Wisconsin). Blotting with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used to adjust syndecan-4 and syndecan-1 expression levels for protein loading. Expression levels of glypican-1 and syndecan-4-GPI constructs were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. To this end, total RNA was isolated using TRI ReagentTM (Sigma). The RNA pellet was dissolved in RNase-free water and ethanol-precipitated. For RT-PCR analysis, 0.2 μg of total RNA were used for reverse transcription with a 15 pmol of oligo(dT)20 primer, 75 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmeach dNTP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, buffer. The mixture was heated to 70 °C for 10 min and then cooled to 37 °C, and 1 μl of Super Script II reverse transcriptase (200 units/μl, Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C and then terminated by heating to 65 °C for 5 min followed by chilling to 4 °C. 1 μl of the RT reaction mixture was used for PCR amplification using specific primers. The PCR reaction was carried out in the presence of 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 400 nm 3′ and 5′ primers, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The following specific primers were used: glypican-1, 5′ CCC CGC CAG CAA GAG CCG GAG CT and 3′ GTG AGG CTC TGG GCG AGT GGC GG; syndecan-4, 5′ (with Sac I restriction site) ATA GAG CTC TTG GAA CCA TGG CGC CTG TCT GCC and 3′ (GPI) GGA ATT CCA GGT TTT ATT ATC TTT TTA TC. For standardization purpose a conserved region of human and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was chosen for amplification as a control template. The following primers were used: 5′ CGT ATT GGG CGC CGT GTC ACC AGG GC and 3′ GGC CAT GAG GTC CAC CAC CCT GTT GC. All PCR reactions were carried out using GeneAmp PCR 2400 system (Perkin-Elmer) as follows: 94 °C (1 min), 50–55 °C (30 s), 72 °C (1.5 min). The additional final extension step was performed at 72 °C for 7 min. A total of 30 cycles was done for each reaction. Following PCR amplification, reaction products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. All experiments were repeated three times. To determine the total mass of heparan sulfate chains, endothelial cell cultures are washed twice with PBS and incubated for 24 h with 2 mCi of Na235SO4 in 2 ml of a modified basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% Neutrodoma-SP. At the end of labeling, cells are washed with cold PBS and incubated with a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm iodoacetate, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% NaN3) on ice for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total proteoglycans are isolated from the supernatant by DEAE chromatography as described (32Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans were then cleaved from the total proteoglycan pool by β-elimination, and the relative content of HS and CS was determined by appropriate enzyme digests with chondroitinase ABC or Flavobacterium heparatinase 1, 2, and 3 (Sigma). Preliminary experiments on microvascular endothelial cells demonstrated that the sum of HS and CS sulfate accounted for >98% of the total proteoglycan sulfate. For determination of the number and affinity of bFGF heparan sulfate-binding sites, endothelial cells were grown to near-confluence in 24-well dishes in 10% FBS/M199. After two washes with cold PBS, 200 μl of binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% gelatin in M199 medium), 6 × 106 cpm (0.5 ng/ml) 125I-bFGF (DuPont, specific activity 2000 Ci/mmol), and increasing amounts (0–600 ng/ml) of cold bFGF were added to each well. The cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle agitation; at the end of that time, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with 1% Triton X-100 in 5 ml of water supplemented with 0.01% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature with vigorous shaking. Following this, 0.4-ml aliquots were counted in 1272 CliniGamma counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell counts determined by Coulter Counter were employed to establish the number of cells per well. Background counts were subtracted from all samples. Scatchard analysis of the specifically bound material versus the molar amount of cold competitor was carried out using Origin 5.0 software (Microcal Software, Inc.). All experiments were carried in triplicate and repeated at least twice. To investigate the role of cell-associated heparan sulfate carrying core proteins in cell function, we screened a number of immortalized cell lines for expression of syndecan-4 and glypican-1. Of these, spontaneously immortalized human cell line ECV304 cell line exhibited the lowest expression of these proteoglycans (data not shown) and was chosen for the study. ECV304 cells have a complex genotype combining markers of a human bladder carcinoma line T-24 and human endothelial cells. In particular, the endothelial markers include expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor Flt-1 2J. Li and M. Simons, unpublished observations. and von Willebrand factor. Furthermore, these cells respond to endostatin with dose-dependent inhibition of migration (33Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). ECV304 cells were transducted with retroviral constructs containing full-length cDNAs for either syndecan-4 or glypican-1. In addition, in order to differentiate potential biological effects secondary to increased mass of cell surface and/or extracellular heparan sulfates versus increased core protein expression themselves, two other chimerical constructs as well as a syndecan-4 mutant construct were created. In one, S4-GPI, syndecan-4 extracellular domain was linked to glypican-1 GPI anchor, and in the other, G1-S4c, the extracellular domain of glypican-1 was linked to the trans-membrane and cytoplasmic domains of syndecan-4 (Fig.1). Cells transfected with a vector only construct (MSCV-VC) were used as control. In a separate series of studies, stable transfections were used to generate ECV304 cells lines overexpressing full-length syndecan-4, syndecan-1, or a construct encoding a syndecan-4 mutant incapable of carrying GAG chains (S4ΔGAG) under control of an inducible GRE promoter (Fig. 1). Vector-transfected (GRE-Neo) as well as wild type ECV cells were used as control. Analysis of derived cell populations following G418 selection demonstrated appropriate expression of all constructs (Fig.2) in both retrovirally transduced and stably transfected cell lines. Quantification of protein levels using syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain-specific antibody demonstrated a 2.5–3.0-fold increase in expression of syndecan-4 in both MSCV-S4 and in MSCV-G1/S4c chimera (Fig. 2 A). A 2-fold increase in syndecan-1 protein (Fig. 2 B) and syndecan-4 (not shown) was noted in GRE stables. Appropriate expression of glypican-1 S4-GPI constructs was demonstrated by RT-PCR in the absence of suitable antibodies (Fig. 2 C). Increased expression of syndecan-4, syndecan-1, and glypican-1 constructs as well as syndecan/glypican chimeras may be expected to result in larger numbers of heparan sulfate chains on the cell surface. To test this prediction, we determined the total cell-surface mass of heparan sulfate chains in the wild type as well as four newly generated ECV cell lines. Total heparan sulfate mass was significantly increased (per μg of total cellular protein) in MSCV-S4, MSCV-G1, MSCV-S4-GPI, MSCV-G1-S4c, and GRE-S1 but not MSCV-VC or GRE-S4ΔGAG cells (TableI). The increase in the total HS cell mass (2–3-fold) correlated well with corresponding increase in core protein expression as determined by Western blotting.Table IEffect of S4, G1, and syndecan/glypican chimera construct expression on heparan sulfate cell mass and bFGF bindingStable clones[35S]HS/μg proteinHigh affinity KdLow affinity KdNumber of HS sites per cellHS-bFGF/total HS ratio×10−11×10−9×106ECV-VC0.14 ± 0.0260.68 ± 0.130.60 ± 0.112.32 ± 0.401.00ECV-S40.33 ± 0.0410.98 ± 0.120.85 ± 0.115.94 ± 0.710.92ECV-G10.23 ± 0.0150.93 ± 0.100.81 ± 0.083.60 ± 0.250.95ECV-S4-GP10.24 ± 0.0800.79 ± 0.180.69 ± 0.153.80 ± 0.850.96ECV-G1-S4c0.34 ± 0.0500.55 ± 0.090.53 ± 0.084.89 ± 0.650.87ECV-S10.36 ± 0.0500.71 ± 0.100.68 ± 0.097.01 ± 1.081.17ECV-S4ΔGAG0.12 ± 0.0130.65 ± 0.070.52 ± 0.062.14 ± 0.280.86The abbreviations used are: HS-bFGF, HS sites capable of binding bFGF; ECV-VC, vector controls (MSCV2.2 transduced) ECV cells; ECV-S4, syndecan-4-transduced ECV cells; ECV-G1, glypican-1-transduced ECV cells; ECV-S4-GPI, syndecan-4-GPI chimera-transduced ECV cells; ECV-G1-S4c, glypican-1 syndecan-4 transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain chimera-transduced ECV cells; ECV-S1, syndecan-1-transfected ECV cells; ECV-S4ΔGAG, ECV cells transduced with syndecan-4 construct lacking GAG attachment sites; [35S]HS/μg protein, amount of radiolabeled HS chains per μg of cell protein.

In order to assess whether these changes in heparan sulfate expression resulted in selective alterations of binding of heparin binding growth factors, we examined the binding of bFGF. Scatchard analysis of the wild type and newly generated ECV cell lines showed that there were no significant changes in the affinity of bFGF binding to either its low (heparan sulfates) or high (FGF receptor) affinity receptors (Table I). At the same time, there was a 3-fold increase in the number of low affinity bFGF-binding sites in the GRE-S1, a 2.0–2.5-fold increase in MSCV-S4 and MSCV-G1-S4c cells, and a somewhat smaller increase in MSCV-G1 and MSCV-S4-GPI cells (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2084489095,"Overexpression of the HER-2 (neu, erb B-2) receptor results in cellular transformation and is associated with a variety of human cancers. Multiple mechanisms, including gene amplification and transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational controls contribute to the regulation of HER-2 expression. One of the components of these regulatory mechanisms is a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the HER-2 mRNA that represses downstream translation in a variety of cell types. Here we explore the mechanism by which this uORF exerts its inhibitory effect.As judged by comparisons of protein and mRNA abundance and by polysomal distribution analyses, the uORF represses translation of the HER-2 cistron or of a heterologous reporter gene. Despite its conservation among mammalian species, the peptide sequence of the uORF is not required for this inhibitory effect. Rather, the majority of ribosomes that load on the HER-2 mRNA most likely translate the uORF and are then unable to reinitiate at the downstream AUG codon, in part due to the short intercistronic spacing. A minority of ribosomes gain access to the HER-2 initiation codon either by leaky scanning past the upstream AUG codon or by reinitiating after having translated the uORF despite the short intercistronic region. These results suggest that the HER-2 uORF controls synthesis of this oncoprotein by limiting ribosomal access to downstream initiation sites. Overexpression of the HER-2 (neu, erb B-2) receptor results in cellular transformation and is associated with a variety of human cancers. Multiple mechanisms, including gene amplification and transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational controls contribute to the regulation of HER-2 expression. One of the components of these regulatory mechanisms is a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the HER-2 mRNA that represses downstream translation in a variety of cell types. Here we explore the mechanism by which this uORF exerts its inhibitory effect. As judged by comparisons of protein and mRNA abundance and by polysomal distribution analyses, the uORF represses translation of the HER-2 cistron or of a heterologous reporter gene. Despite its conservation among mammalian species, the peptide sequence of the uORF is not required for this inhibitory effect. Rather, the majority of ribosomes that load on the HER-2 mRNA most likely translate the uORF and are then unable to reinitiate at the downstream AUG codon, in part due to the short intercistronic spacing. A minority of ribosomes gain access to the HER-2 initiation codon either by leaky scanning past the upstream AUG codon or by reinitiating after having translated the uORF despite the short intercistronic region. These results suggest that the HER-2 uORF controls synthesis of this oncoprotein by limiting ribosomal access to downstream initiation sites. upstream open reading frame β-galactosidase nucleotide(s) polymerase chain reaction wild type 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactoside The HER-2 (neu, erb B-2) oncogene encodes a 185-kDa transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (1Bargmann C.I.

Simon H. Chen H. Bates B. Hung M.C. Hauser C. Nature. 1995; 378: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), most studies of HER-2 have focused on its role in cancer. Overexpression of HER2 occurs in numerous types of human cancers and has been linked to neoplastic transformation and aggressive tumor growth (6Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O.

Cells from tumors in which HER-2 is overexpressed often contain amplified copies of the HER-2 gene. However, in some cases HER-2 overexpression is due to transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms in the absence of gene amplification (12Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A.

Moreover, under certain conditions, HER-2 receptor levels vary without changes in mRNA levels, suggesting that translational controls also participate in the control of HER-2 protein synthesis (16Buhring H.J.

In eukaryotes, translational regulation of specific genes typically occurs at translational initiation and is mediated by cis-acting sequences present in the 5′ transcript leader, such as upstream AUG codons and associated upstream open reading frames (uORFs1 (18Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 1-29Google Scholar, 19Geballe A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 173-197Google Scholar)). Although uORFs are found in only 5 to 10 percent of eukaryotic mRNAs overall, approximately two-thirds of oncogenes including HER-2 and many genes involved in cellular growth and differentiation contain uORFs (20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In the well studied case of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCN4 gene, uORFs regulate protein synthesis by affecting which downstream AUG codons are utilized by reinitiating ribosomes (21Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar). Ribosomes translate the first uORF in the GCN4 mRNA under all conditions. They then reinitiate at another uORF when amino acids are plentiful or, under starvation conditions, they bypass the other uORFs and reinitiate at the GCN4 start codon. Several other uORFs have been shown to act by a mechanism that depends on the uORF-encoded peptide sequence and, in some cases, involves ribosomal stalling on the mRNA (19Geballe A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 173-197Google Scholar, 22Cao J. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell.

For the vast majority of uORFs, insufficient data are available to enable predictions about whether they affect downstream translation and, if so, about the mechanism involved. Previously, we demonstrated that two distinct translational mechanisms control HER-2 protein expression (29Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One is a cell type-dependent mechanism that causes increased HER-2 translation in transformed cells compared with primary cells. The other is a cell type-independent repression of downstream translation mediated by an upstream AUG codon. The upstream AUG codon is in an optimal Kozak context (30Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar) and initiates a six-codon uORF that terminates five nt from the HER-2 start codon (see Fig. 1 A). Mutation of the upstream AUG codon eliminates the uORF and results in an approximately 5-fold increase in downstream translation in each of five cell types examined (29Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The position and coding content of the uORF are highly conserved among mammalian species (29Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Ishii S. Imamoto F. Yamanashi Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these features may be important for the regulatory effects of the uORF. In the current report, we present an analysis of the translational mechanism by which the HER-2 uORF affects downstream translation. Our results demonstrate that the HER-2 uORF inhibitory function does not depend on the peptide sequence of the uORF, the identity of the downstream cistron, or the precise 5′ end of the mRNA. Instead, the very short intercistronic spacing between the uORF and the downstream cistron appears to be required for its inhibitory effect. Despite the optimal context of the upstream AUG codon and the short intercistronic spacing, both leaky scanning and ribosomal reinitiation after translation of the uORF contribute to HER-2 protein synthesis. These observations suggest that mammalian uORFs, like those in yeast, may control access of ribosomes to alternative downstream initiation sites. Control plasmids pEQ176 (36Schleiss M.R. Degnin C.R. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6782-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expressing full-length β-galactosidase (β-gal), and pEQ430 (23Degnin C.R. Schleiss M.R. Cao J. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5514-5521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expressing a truncated, inactive β-gal, have been described previously. The highly conserved 93 nt from the 3′ end of the HER-2 mRNA were PCR-amplified from human fibroblast DNA using primers #48 (CAAGAAGCTTGCGCCCGGCCCCCACC) and #49 (GGAAGGTACCATGGTGCTCACTGCGGC), digested with Hin dIII and Asp 718, and inserted into the Hin dIII/Asp 718 sites of pEQ176 to generate pEQ516. pEQ471 is identical to pEQ516, except that the HER-2 uORF AUG codon was mutated to AAG. To construct the HER-2 expression plasmids, the HER-2 ORF was isolated from SV40/erb B2 (6Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) (provided by S. Aaronson, National Institutes of Health) by digesting with Bsu 36I, blunting with DNA polymerase (Klenow), then digesting with Hin dIII and inserting the HER-2-coding region into the Hin dIII/Hin dII sites of pBS+ (Stratagene). The HER-2 ORF, isolated from this plasmid by digestion with Xba I, blunting with DNA polymerase (Klenow), and cutting with Hin dIII, was ligated into the Hin dIII/Pvu II sites of pEQ176. The resulting plasmid, pEQ580, contains 22 nt of the HER-2 leader immediately upstream from the HER-2 AUG codon but does not contain the upstream AUG codon. The HER-2 transcript leader from pEQ516, isolated by Hin dIII/partial Nco I digestion, was inserted into the Hin dIII/Nco I sites of pEQ580 to generate pEQ582. Plasmid pEQ581 is identical to pEQ582 except that the uORF AUG codon has been mutated to AAG. Plasmid pEQ591, a frameshift mutant of the HER-2 uORF, was constructed by PCR-amplifying the HER-2 transcript leader from pEQ516 using oligos #48 (see above) and #102 (GGAAGGTACCATGGTGCTCACTCGGCTCCGGCCACCATGG). The resulting fragment was digested with Hin dIII and Asp 718 and ligated into the Hin dIII/Asp 718 sites of pEQ176. To create uORF missense mutants pEQ721, pEQ722, and pEQ723, the products of PCR amplification of pEQ516 with oligos #48 and #150 (GGAAGGTACCATGGTGCTCANNNNNNNNNNNNNNCCATGGCT) were cloned into pEQ176 as Hin dIII/Asp 718 fragments. The transcript leaders from pEQ516 and pEQ471 were PCR-amplified with oligos #48 and #61 (GGAAGGTACCATGGTCTTAAGCTCACTGCGG) to introduce an Afl II site just downstream from the uORF. The resulting fragments were cloned as Hin dIII/Asp 718 fragments into pEQ176, yielding pEQ526, the wt construct, and pEQ485, the corresponding AAG mutant. A 50-nt intercistronic spacer consisting of cytomegalovirus UL4 transcript leader sequences, derived by cutting pEQ239 (36Schleiss M.R. Degnin C.R. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6782-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with Spe I, blunting with DNA polymerase (Klenow), and digesting with Asp 718, was inserted into pEQ526 and pEQ485 that had been digested with Afl II, blunted with DNA polymerase (Klenow), and cut with Asp 718, yielding pEQ717 and pEQ718, respectively. pEQ719 and pEQ720 were generated by inserting a UL4 Rsa I-Asp 718 fragment from pEQ239 into pEQ526 and pEQ485 that had been digested with Spe I, blunted, and digested with Asp 718. A fragment generated by PCR amplification of the UL4 transcript leader with primers gp48.3 (36Schleiss M.R. Degnin C.R. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6782-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and #105 (CGGCCTTAAGTGAAGAGTCTATAAAG) and digestion with Afl 2/Asp 718 was inserted into pEQ526 and pEQ485 to generate pEQ608 and pEQ607, respectively. A blunted Bgl II/Sal I fragment derived from pM128 (provided by A. Hinnebusch, National Institutes of Health) containing the 3′-most 152 nt of the S. cerevisiae GCN4 transcript leader (37Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was cloned into pEQ526 that had been cut with Afl II and blunted. Plasmid pEQ741 contains this sequence in the same orientation as found in the GCN4 mRNA. The same fragment was cloned into pEQ485 to yield the corresponding AAG mutant pEQ743. The transcript leader and the 5′ end of the HER-2 coding region isolated as Hin dIII, blunted-Apa LI fragments from pEQ578 and pEQ577 were inserted into pEQ176 that had been digested with Xho I, blunted, then digested with Hin dIII to generate pEQ673 containing the wt HER-2 leader and the corresponding AAG mutant pEQ674. pEQ573 was constructed by PCR amplification of pEQ516 with oligos #48 (see above) and #83 (GGAAGGTACCATGGTGCTCCCTGCGGC) to eliminate the uORF stop codon. The resulting fragment was digested with Hin dIII and Asp 718 and cloned into the corresponding sites in pEQ176. The product of PCR amplification with oligos #48 and #99 (GGAAGGTACCATGGTGCTCACTGCGGCTCCGGCCCCATGGTGGCGGCTGGACCC), having a super optimal upstream AUG codon, was cloned into pEQ176 as a Hin dIII/Asp 718 fragment to produce pEQ559. Plasmid pEQ592, the corresponding AAG construct, was produced in the same manner using oligos #48 and #103 (GGAAGGTACCATGGTGCTCACTGCGGCTCCGGCCCCTTGGTGGCGGCTGGACCC). pEQ739, in which the uORF contains a super optimal AUG codon and a mutated stop codon, was produced in the same way by PCR amplification with oligos #48 and #83 using pEQ559 as a template. pEQ751, containing the full-length transcript leader with the HER-2 uORF fused to lacZ, was constructed by PCR amplification with oligos #106 (GGCCAAGCTTATTCCCCTCCATT GGGACCGGAG) and #163 (GGAAGGTACCAAGGATGCTCCCTGCGGC) using pEQ637 as a template. The insert was digested with Hin dIII and Asp 718 and cloned into the same sites in pEQ176. pEQ752, the corresponding uORF AAG mutant was made by the same strategy using pEQ655 as the template. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Biomedical). 2 μg each of a test β-gal expression plasmid and the pEQ430 control were transfected into COS-7 cells in triplicate 60-mm dishes using calcium phosphate (29Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection β-gal activity was measured by a fluorimetric substrate cleavage assay (38Biegalke B.J. Geballe A.P. Virology. 1990; 177: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), then whole cell RNA was harvested by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate method (39Siebert P.D. Chenchik A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2019-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization with a β-gal probe. Polysomes from COS-7 cells transfected with HER-2 expression plasmids were separated on 15–50% sucrose gradients, and the RNA content of each fraction was analyzed by Northern hybridization as described (36Schleiss M.R. Degnin C.R. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6782-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline then lysed with 2% SDS at 65 °C. The resulting cell lysates were denatured at 95–100 °C for 5 min and then electrophoresed through 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (TROPIX, Inc.) by electroblotting. Immunoblot analysis was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the Western-Light Plus chemiluminescent detection system (TROPIX, Inc.) with rabbit polyclonal serum directed against the 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of HER-2. Whole cell RNA was harvested from parallel dishes as described above and analyzed by Northern blot analyses using a HER-2 extracellular domain fragment probe (29Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that the HER-2 uORF inhibits translation of a downstream reporter gene (29Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine whether it also inhibits expression of the authentic HER-2 protein, we constructed plasmids having the HER-2 ORF downstream from transcript leader sequences having or lacking the uORF (Fig. 1 A). After transfection of these plasmids into COS-7 cells, HER-2 protein levels and mRNA accumulation were measured by immunoblot and Northern blot analyses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The wild-type transcript leader containing the uORF repressed HER-2 protein expression compared with the leader containing a mutation in the upstream AUG codon or to the control containing only a very short leader (Fig. 1 B, compare WT with AAG and SL lanes). mRNA levels were similar among all constructs, indicating that differences in protein expression did not result from variation in transcript accumulation. The low level of expression of HER-2 protein and RNA in mock-transfected cells suggested that most of the protein and RNA detected in the other samples represented products of the transgenes rather than the endogenous gene. Nonetheless, we confirmed these results using FLAG-tagged HER-2 expression plasmids with which we could unambiguously detect transgene expression (data not shown). The transcript leader sequences in pEQ582 contained 93 nt, including the uORF, from the 3′ end of natural HER-2 transcript leader. Although all reported HER-2 sequences share an identical 96 nt at the 3′ end of the transcript leader, some reports have suggested that the 5′ end of the leader may contain alternative sequences (2Coussens L. Yang-Feng T.L. Liao Y.C. Chen E. Gray A. McGrath J. Seeburg P.H. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Levinson A. Ullrich A.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2597-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In experiments using either β-gal or HER-2 expression plasmids, we found that the uORF had quantitatively similar effects on downstream translation whether it was contained in the full-length 178-nt leader (29Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or only within the conserved 93-nt 3′ region (data not shown). We also analyzed the effects of the uORF on HER-2 translation by examining the polysomal association of mRNAs having and lacking the uORF (Fig. 2). Polysomes in cells transfected with pEQ582 (AUG) and pEQ581 (AAG) were fractionated on sucrose gradients, and transgene mRNAs in each fraction were detected by Northern blot hybridization using a probe specific for the transgene 3′-untranslated region that is not contained in endogenous HER-2 transcripts. Elimination of the uORF resulted in a shift of the HER2 mRNA to larger polysomes, corresponding to more efficient translation. The mean position of wild-type mRNAs was fraction 3, corresponding to disomes, whereas that for the AAG construct was fraction 5, corresponding to approximately 6- and 7-mers. Similarities of the UV absorption profiles (not shown) and of the distribution of actin mRNA (Fig. 2) between the two samples indicated that the shift to larger polysomes, resulting from elimination of the HER-2 uORF, was not an artifact of variation between the two gradients. These results demonstrate that uORF represses HER-2 expression by reducing the ribosomal loading on the mRNA and thus verify that the uORF inhibits HER-2 expression at the translational level. We next investigated the mechanism by which the HER-2 uORF exerts its repressive effect. Inhibition by uORFs in several other eukaryotic genes is dependent upon the peptide-coding sequence of the uORF (19Geballe A.P. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 173-197Google Scholar, 26Reynolds K. Zimmer A.M. Zimmer A. J.

Because the HER-2 uORF sequence is conserved among mammalian species (29Child S.J. Miller M.K. Geballe A.P. Int. J. Biochem.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether it is required for inhibition of downstream translation. β-Gal expression constructs in which the uORF was modified by shifting the reading frame to generate a different amino acid sequence while preserving most of the nucleotide sequence (pEQ591) or by random mutagenesis with a degenerate oligonucleotide (pEQ721, -722, -723) were transfected into COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). β-Gal activity and mRNA accumulation were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Like the wt uORF, each of these mutant uORFs inhibited translation of the downstream β-gal gene, demonstrating that the HER-2 uORF functions in a peptide sequence-independent manner. Another feature of the HER-2 uORF that might account for its inhibitory effect is the proximity of its termination codon to the initiation codon of the downstream cistron. In all mammalian species in which the sequence has been reported, this intercistronic spacing is only five nt. To test the role of this spacing on the inhibitory activity of the HER-2 uORF, we lengthened the intercistronic distance in our β-gal reporter construct by inserting various fragments derived from the cytomegalovirus UL4 transcript leader. The fragments used to construct these plasmids contain two adjacent AUG codons, either of which can serve as initiation sites for β-gal synthesis. The size of the intercistronic spacer shown in Fig.4 for pEQ717, pEQ719, and pEQ608 is based on the assumption that initiation occurs at the second of these two AUG codons. If the first one is used, then the actual intercistronic spacing would be three nt shorter. These spacers do not contain other AUG codons and, in other experiments, did not affect downstream reporter gene translation (36Schleiss M.R. Degnin C.R. Geballe A.P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6782-6789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we constructed control plasmids containing the same spacer sequences but having a mutation of the AUG codon of the uORF to detect unexpected uORF-independent effects of the spacer sequences. These plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 4). Expansion of the intercistronic spacing to 10 nt (pEQ526) had little effect on downstream translation compared with the wt spacing. However, expansion to 50, 116, or 148 nt increased β-gal expression approximately 2-fold. The sequences used to expand the intercistronic spacing also inhibited expression from the controls lacking the uORF. This reduction may be due to the modest reduction in β-gal RNA accumulation after transfection of constructs having the longer insertions (Fig. 4, right panel). The inhibitory effect of the uORF, when measured as the ratio of expression from the AUG– to the corresponding AUG+ plasmid, decreased from 7-fold with the wt spacing to 1.4-fold when the spacing was 148 nt. These results suggest that repression by the HER-2 uORF is alleviated, at least in part, by increasing the intercistronic spacing. In addition to effects due to intercistronic length, the sequence of the intercistronic region may affect reinitiation frequency (41Lincoln A.J. Monczak Y. Williams S.C. Johnson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9552-9560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,42Grant C.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 606-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of intercistronic sequence on translational inhibition, we tested the effects of a second spacer sequence derived from a portion of the S. cerevisiae GCN4 transcript leader that has no upstream AUG codons or other known translational regulatory elements. Constructs containing the uORF or the upstream AUG– mutation with an intercistronic spacing of 171 nt were transfected into COS-7 cells, and β-gal expression was analyzed (Fig. 5). For unknown reasons, the GCN4 spacer greatly reduced the abundance of reporter gene transcript accumulation from pEQ741 and pEQ743 compared with plasmids lacking the GCN4 sequences. Nonetheless, this intercistronic spacer also reduced the inhibitory effect of the uORF to 1.6-fold, similar to the results using the CMV UL4 spacer sequences (Fig. 4). To evaluate the reinitiation potential of ribosomes that have translated the authentic uORF, we constructed plasmids more closely resembling the structure of the natural HER-2 mRNA. In pEQ673, the β-gal ORF initiates 92 nt downstream from the uORF termination codon. The “intercistronic” spacer"

Distinct regions in its extracytoplasmic domain interact with two classes of ligands, namely the mitogenic growth factor, insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), and proteins that bear a mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) marker as a result of post-translational modification in the Golgi (1Kornfeld S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The IGF2R is a 300-kDa type I transmembrane receptor that is comprised of a 40-residue NH2-terminal signal sequence, followed by 15 homologous repeats made up of 124–192 amino acid residues, a 23-residue transmembrane domain, and a 167-residue cytoplasmic domain (2Oshima A.

Along with the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR), the IGF2R carries out lysosomal enzyme targeting through its Man-6-P binding activity (for review see Refs. 1Kornfeld S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, and13Dahms N.M.

This same Man-6-P binding function of the IGF2R has also been shown to be necessary for the activation of transforming growth factor-β (14Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). After activation, transforming growth factor-β exerts effects on cellular proliferation by interacting with its own serine/threonine kinase receptors, usually resulting in growth inhibition (16Alevizopoulos A.

Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, IGF-II binding to the IGF2R at the cell surface is thought to result in internalization and degradation of the ligand, thereby down-regulating the level of this mitogenic factor (20Oka Y. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9090-9093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Oka Y. Rozek L.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

In addition, several observations support the hypothesis that Man-6-P/IGF2R acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Microsatellite instability has been observed at the Man-6-P/IGF2R locus in tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (22Ouyang H. Shiwaku H.O. Hagiwara H. Miura K. Abe T. Kato Y. Ohtani H. Shiiba K.

Increased secretion of cathepsin D and other Man-6-P-bearing proteins has been observed in association with cancer of both the prostate and breast (24Ross J.S. Nazeer T. Figge H. Fisher H. Rifkin M.

Rochefort H. Barenton B. Prebois C. Vignon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1327-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the Man-6-P/IGF2R locus has been correlated with poorly differentiated states in early breast carcinomas (27Chappell S.A. Walsh T. Walker R.A. Shaw J.A. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 1558-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). IGF2R has also been found at decreased levels in hepatocellular carcinomas (28Sue S.R. Chari R.S. Kong F.-M. Mills J.J.

Hepatology. 1994; 20: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which may be explained by LOH at the Man-6-P/IGF2R locus in these tumor types (30De Souza A.T. Hankins G.R. Washington M.K. Fine R.L. Orton T.C. Jirtle R.L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1725-1729PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yamada T. De Souza A.T. Finkelstein S. Jirtle R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2003-2009PubMed Google Scholar).Whereas the observation of LOH in tumor samples suggests that loss of receptor function may be involved in the progression to a transformed phenotype in these cancers, another hallmark of a tumor suppressor is the presence of loss-of-function mutations in copies of the gene remaining in the tumor cells. The screening of tumors that exhibit LOH has led to the discovery of several mutations (31Yamada T. De Souza A.T. Finkelstein S. Jirtle R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10351-10355Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 32Hankins G.R. De Souza A.T. Bentley R.C. Patel M.R. Marks J.R. Iglehart J.D. Jirtle R.L.

Genet. 1995; 11: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), which could serve to strengthen the hypothesis that the IGF2R is a tumor suppressor if these mutations somehow alter normal receptor function. Many of the identified mutations are frameshift or nonsense mutations that would prevent the translation of the complete, mature IGF2R (33De Souza A.T. Hankins G.R. Washington M.K. Orton T.C. Jirtle R.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 34De Souza A.T. Yamada T. Mills J.J. Jirtle R.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, several missense mutations, many of which are located in the extracytoplasmic domain of the receptor, have also been identified (33De Souza A.T. Hankins G.R. Washington M.K. Orton T.C. Jirtle R.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,34De Souza A.T. Yamada T. Mills J.J. Jirtle R.L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).To address the question whether the five cancer-associated missense mutations affect the function of the IGF2R, receptor constructs bearing these mutations in the extracytoplasmic domain were assayed for their ability to interact with both IGF-II and a Man-6-P-bearing protein. The Cys-1262 → Ser, Gly-1449 → Val, Gly-1464 → Glu, and Ile-1572 → Thr mutations that were observed in hepatocellular carcinoma and the breast cancer-associated Gln-1445 → His mutation were expressed as soluble receptor constructs. Ligand binding analysis revealed that four of the mutants, all but Gly-1464 → Glu, altered either Man-6-P binding, IGF-II binding, or both. These alterations in ligand binding to the IGF2R mutants suggest a mechanism for loss of receptor function that is consistent with the Man-6-P/IGF2R as a tumor suppressor.DISCUSSIONThe observation of several missense mutations occurring in the extracytoplasmic domain of the IGF2R in specific tumors raises the question of whether and how these mutations might alter the function of this protein. Sequence analysis of the positions corresponding to the C1262S, Q1445H, G1449V, G1464E, and I1572T mutations in the human, rat, mouse, and bovine receptors revealed that all but G1464E are conserved without exception, suggesting that they are important in the overall structure and function of their respective repeats. In order to determine how these five Man-6-P/IGF2R missense mutations affect the ligand binding functions of the receptor, the mutants have been tested as IGF2R cDNA constructs comprised of the signal sequence and the 15 extracytoplasmic repeats, followed by an 8-residue FLAG epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus. This 15F construct allows isolation and separation of the mutants from the endogenous receptor background found in most cell types, by virtue of its unique epitope tag.When expressed transiently in 293T cells, the 15F construct was not secreted into the culture medium but was found at high levels in cell lysates prepared by either Triton X-100 extraction or freeze/thaw procedures. This finding was unexpected, as a soluble IGF2R construct bearing a deletion of only the transmembrane domain was found to be secreted in transgenic mice (41Zaina S. Newton R.V.S. Paul M.R. Graham C.F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3886-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The incorporation of the FLAG epitope may play a role in the retention of the 15F construct, but other truncated FLAG-tagged IGF2R constructs were found to be secreted, and replacement of the FLAG tag with a c-Myc epitope did not lead to secretion of the extracytoplasmic domain (data not shown). The observation that the 15F construct could be released into a detergent-free solution by freeze/thaw indicates that it is water-soluble. Retention of the 15F construct within the cell may also indicate the presence of an independent intracellular retention signal in the extracytoplasmic domain. Such a signal has been proposed to exist by Dintzis et al. (42Dintzis S.M. Velculescu V.E. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12159-12166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who found that the IGF2R extracytoplasmic domain was required for a predominantly intracellular localization of epidermal growth factor receptor/IGF2R chimeras. Further experiments are under way to determine the significance and molecular basis of 15F retention within the transfected 293T cells.Triton X-100 cell lysates were used for the remainder of the current study, because they contained the highest levels of transfected construct. Immunoblotting of these lysates revealed that mRNAs derived from all of the mutant cDNAs were apparently capable of being translated into proteins that were homogeneous by gel electrophoresis, with molecular masses consistent with the predicted 250 kDa. Deletion of the IGF2R transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains does not appear to affect the ligand binding functions of the receptor, as WT 15F binds IGF-II and a Man-6-P-bearing ligand with affinity constants that are consistent with observed values for the intact IGF2R of 3–5 and 1–2 nm, respectively.To test whether the mutations affect ligand binding to the IGF2R, the mutant receptor constructs were analyzed for the ability to interact with IGF-II and PMP-BSA, a Man-6-P-bearing ligand. It has been shown previously that the two Man-6-P-binding sites localize to repeats 1–3 and 7–9 of the extracytoplasmic domain (5Westlund B. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23233-23239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, Arg-435 and Arg-1334 in repeats 3 and 9 of the bovine receptor are thought to be involved in coordinating interactions with the phosphate groups of Man-6-P-bearing proteins (6Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Marron-Terada P.G. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown repeats 11 and 13 to be important for high affinity IGF-II binding (8Garmroudi F. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26944-26952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schmidt B. Kiecke-Siemsen C. Waheed A. Braulke T. von Figura K. J. Biol.

With binding functions mapping to such an extensive portion of the receptor, mutations occurring in the extracytoplasmic domain could disrupt one or both of its binding activities.When assayed for their ability to bind IGF-II by affinity cross-linking or by direct binding, three of the cancer-associated mutations demonstrated a measurable reduction in ligand-receptor association. C1262S, G1449V, and I1572T all cause decreased binding of IGF-II, suggesting a disruption of the IGF-II binding domain. These mutations are located in repeats 9, 10, and 11, respectively. The hepatocellular carcinoma-associated mutant, I1572T, substituting a polar residue, Thr, for a bulky, hydrophobic residue, Ile, in the heart of the IGF-II binding domain, causes a complete knockout of IGF-II binding. This mutation had previously been shown to knockout IGF-II binding in a truncated receptor construct comprising the first half of repeat 1 fused to repeat 11 (10Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is less obvious how C1262S and G1449V, which reside outside the IGF-II binding domain, are capable of affecting IGF-II binding. Several possibilities could account for this effect. Destabilization of a single repeat may foster interdomain effects. Also, disruption of the conserved disulfide bonding pattern of the repeats may have global effects, which may account for the observed ligand binding disruption caused by the C1262S mutation. This cysteinyl residue is thought to be involved in the conserved disulfide bonding pattern of the 9th repeat (3Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disulfide bond pattern appears to be disrupted to a degree that when electrophoresed on a non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel, the mobility of the C1262S mutant is altered relative to WT (data not shown).In addition to disrupting IGF-II binding, C1262S causes a decrease in IGF-II cross-linking efficiency when compared with WT 15F. One possible interpretation of these data is that C1262S causes the displacement of a lysyl residue away from radiolabeled IGF-II in the bound state. The homobifunctional cross-linking agent employed in these studies, DSS, utilizes lysyl side chains for its cross-linking chemistry. With a spacer arm length of 11.4 Å, small alterations of the protein backbone could be responsible for decreased cross-linking efficiency. The G1449V mutation results in the substitution of a bulky, hydrophobic residue, Val, for a small, neutral residue, Gly, that would be predicted to have a high degree of conformational freedom (44Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 353-403Google Scholar). This mutation, also located in repeat 10, outside the major IGF-II- or Man-6-P-binding regions of the receptor, is capable of decreasing the binding interactions of the 15F construct. However, in contrast to the C1262S mutation, the G1449V mutation does not seem to affect the efficiency of IGF-II/IGF2R cross-linking.The C1262S and G1449V mutations also affect interactions with the Man-6-P-bearing ligand, PMP-BSA. C1262S failed to show any detectable binding to PMP-BSA in the Western ligand blot, whereas G1449V showed variable ability to bind PMP-BSA in this assay. The ligand blotting protocol involves denaturing the proteins with subsequent renaturation after non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Because of this property of the assay, not only are inherent binding interactions detected, but the ability of these mutant receptors to renature on the nitrocellulose membrane also contributes to the measured end point. It was necessary to determine if the mutant receptors were capable of binding PMP-BSA in an assay that did not involve a cycle of denaturation-renaturation. Direct binding analysis confirmed that both C1262S and G1449V have reduced PMP-BSA binding when compared with WT. These mutations did not completely eliminate PMP-BSA binding, as the ligand blot would suggest, but only reduced binding, as reminiscent of the IGF-II binding data. Thus, failure to detect PMP-BSA binding to these mutant IGF2Rs in the ligand blot suggests the possibility of a potential defect in in vitro refolding caused by these mutations.Competitive binding analysis with both IGF-II and PMP-BSA revealed that the C1262S and G1449V mutations reduce binding by decreasing the number of binding sites (Bmax) in the population of receptors, while having no apparent effect on the relative affinity toward IGF-II or PMP-BSA. In addition, affinity depletion with either IGF-II or PMP-BSA covalently attached to Sepharose beads demonstrated that nearly all the C1262S and G1449V receptor molecules are eventually capable of interacting with ligand, even though the G1449V mutant showed a decrease in the rate of depletion with both immobilized ligands. Several possible explanations may account for this surprising finding. These data could be explained if the mutations induced a conformation of the receptor that is incapable of binding ligand which is in equilibrium with a conformation that can bind. A difference in the rate of conversion between such conformations could account for G1449V causing a decrease in the rate of association with the immobilized ligands in the context of the experimental time frame. Alternatively, the observed decrease in the rate of ligand association for the G1449V mutant may be compensated by a reduced rate of dissociation, resulting in little or no effect on the equilibrium dissociation constant. Such changes in the binding characteristics of this mutant could have dramatic effects on the ability of tumor cells to bind, internalize, and degrade IGF-II through the IGF2R pathway.The existence of IGF2R dimers could also explain the discrepancy between the change in Bmax and the ability of the C1262S and G1449V mutants to interact with immobilized ligand. Previous reports have suggested that the IGF2R exists as a monomer in solution (45Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but cross-linking studies of IGF2R molecules in cell membranes imply that the receptor exists in multimeric forms (46Stein M. Braulke T. Krentler C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). While this manuscript was being prepared for publication, York et al. (47York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) reported that bivalent ligands are capable of increasing the rate of IGF-II internalization, which was attributed to their ability to cross-link IGF2R molecules, suggesting that multimeric forms of the IGF2R form in the presence of bivalent Man-6-P ligands. If the soluble IGF2R constructs exist as multimers, heterodimers formed between receptors that can bind ligand and those that cannot would interfere with separation of receptor species by affinity chromatography. Finally, it should also be noted that the presence of a bipartite Man-6-P binding domain may complicate the interpretation of the Man-6-P binding analysis. The two Man-6-P-binding sites may be functionally distinct, as recent studies have suggested (43Marron-Terada P.G. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, an alternative explanation for our data may be that the decreased PMP-BSA binding observed for C1262S and G1449V is due to a loss of function of only a single site.The Q1445H mutation may provide a tool for further investigation of the possible mechanisms for Bmax effects on the IGF-II binding domain. This mutant construct is capable of binding and cross-linking IGF-II to the same extent as WT when freshly extracted from cells. However, over time in storage at −80 °C, the IGF-II binding function is selectively lost. Thus, there seems to be some instability of repeats 11–13 comprising the IGF-II binding domain. Other analyses, such as rates of denaturation at 37 or 47 °C and the pH dependence of ligand dissociation, showed little change relative to WT (data not shown). Regardless of the cause, competitive binding analysis of the mutant Q1445H construct that showed a 50% loss of IGF-II binding was due to a decreased number of detectable binding sites and not an affinity change. Because the Q1445H mutation does not affect the PMP-BSA binding profile of the receptor construct, it is likely that the Bmax change observed for this mutation is due to a localized disruption or distortion of the IGF-II binding region. Finally, it is unclear whether the instability of the IGF-II binding domain is manifested in a functional change in the Q1445H mutant receptor in vivo. Full-length versions of the Q1445H mutant IGF2R in 293T cells have recently been expressed, and preliminary studies have revealed similar instability upon storage of plasma membrane preparations bearing the Q1445H mutant receptor. 2G. R. Devi, J. C. Byrd, A. T. De Souza, R. L. Jirtle, and R. G. MacDonald, manuscript in preparation. Experiments to measure the thermal stability and half-life of the mutant receptors in living cells are planned.It is interesting to note the location of each of the mutations examined in this study relative to the conserved cysteinyl residues within each repeat. Most of the repeats contain 8 conserved cysteinyl residues, and based on the patterns of conservation in the bovine receptor, these have been predicted to form disulfide bonds in the pattern: 1 + 2, 3 + 4, 5 + 7, and 6 + 8 (3Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD-MPR is a 46-kDa membrane protein that shares sequence homology to each repeating unit of the IGF2R (3Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1987; 50: 181-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the crystal structure of the CD-MPR revealed that the extracytoplasmic domain is made up of β-strands that comprise two β-sheets (49Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). By assuming that the repeating units in the extracytoplasmic domain of IGF2R are similar, then each of the extracytoplasmic repeats is comprised of these two β-sheet half-domains connected by a coil between the 4th and 5th cysteinyl residues. The I1572T mutation occurs near this putative linking region in the 4th β-strand. It is possible that this mutation alters the folded conformation of the repeat so that the final compact structure is not formed. Substituting a polar residue in place of the Ile at position 1572 could interfere with the van der Waals interactions between hydrophobic residues that are proposed to hold the two β-sheets together. Based on the homology to the CD-MPR, the substitution of Val for Gly at position 1449, which decreases binding to both IGF-II and PMP-BSA, may limit the conformational flexibility of the peptide backbone in a turn between the 5th and 6th β-strands. The Q1445H mutation also occurs near this turn within the 5th β-strand. Interestingly, the G1464E mutation, which shows no measurable change in its ligand binding characteristics, occurs just after the 5th conserved cysteinyl residue. The disulfide bond that occurs at this position may stabilize the overall structure of the 10th repeat containing the G1464E mutation.If the observed mutations are capable of disrupting the conformation of the repeat in which they occur, the question still remains as to how disruption of a single repeat can obliterate functions that occur in other parts of the IGF2R. It has been postulated that each of the extracytoplasmic repeats is capable of folding independently of the others based on the analogy to the CD-MPR. This hypothesis has been"
https://openalex.org/W2045780974,"Previously, we have shown that the soluble form of brain glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is inhibited by ATP through protein phosphorylation and is activated by calcineurin-mediated protein dephosphorylation (Bao, J., Cheung, W. Y., and Wu, J. Y. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 6464–6467). Here we report that the membrane-associated form of GAD (MGAD) is greatly activated by ATP, whereas adenosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate (AMP-PNP), a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, has no effect on MGAD activity. ATP activation of MGAD is abolished by conditions that disrupt the proton gradient of synaptic vesicles, e.g. the presence of vesicular proton pump inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chorophenylhydrazone or the ionophore gramicidin, indicating that the synaptic vesicle proton gradient is essential in ATP activation of MGAD. Furthermore, direct incorporation of32P from [γ-32P]ATP into MGAD has been demonstrated. In addition, MGAD (presumably GAD65, since it is recognized by specific monoclonal antibody, GAD6, as well as specific anti-GAD65) has been reported to be associated with synaptic vesicles. Based on these results, a model linking γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis by MGAD to GABA packaging into synaptic vesicles by proton gradient-mediated GABA transport is presented. Activation of MGAD by phosphorylation appears to be mediated by a vesicular protein kinase that is controlled by the vesicular proton gradient. Previously, we have shown that the soluble form of brain glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is inhibited by ATP through protein phosphorylation and is activated by calcineurin-mediated protein dephosphorylation (Bao, J., Cheung, W.

Kuriyama K. Brain Res. 1968; 8: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Alterations in the level of GABA in the central nervous system have been linked to neurological disorders, including Huntington's chorea (2Wu J.-Y. Bird E.-D. Chen M.-S. Huang W.-M. Neurochem. Res. 1979; 4: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), Parkinson's disease (3Soghomonian J.J. Laprade N. Synapse. 1997; 27: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and epilepsy (4Kash S.F. Johnson R.S. Tecott L.H. Noebels J.L. Mayfield R.D. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14060-14065Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition to its importance in regulating GABA level in the central nervous system, GAD has been implicated as an autoantigen in two human autoimmune diseases, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and Stiff-Man syndrome (5Baekkeskov S. Aanstoot H.J. Christgau S. Reetz A. Solimena M. Cascalho M. Folli F. Richter-Olesen H. DeCamilli P. Nature. 1990; 347: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar, 6Solimena M. De Camilli P. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 452-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Despite its importance, the mechanism underlying regulation of GAD remains elusive. The first comprehensive studies of regulation of GAD activity were conducted when GAD was first purified from mouse brain more than two decades ago (7Wu J.-Y. Matsuda T. Roberts E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3029-3034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that GAD activity was markedly inhibited by Zn2+ ion, in contrast to its activation effect on pyridoxal kinase, an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of GAD's co-factor, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) (8Wu J.Y. Roberts E. J. Neurochem. 1974; 23: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Hence it was proposed that Zn2+ has a pivotal role in the regulation of GABA biosynthesis (9Wu J.-Y. Roberts E. Chase T. Tower D. GABA in Nervous System Function. Raven Press, New York1976: 7-60Google Scholar). The importance of PLP in the overall regulation of GABA biosynthesis was recognized when it was found that, in rat brain, more than half of GAD is present as an apoenzyme (10Miller L.P. Martin D.L. Mazumder A. Walters J.R. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Itoh M. Uchimura H. Neurochem. Res. 1981; 6: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that, in rat brain, one form of GAD is fully saturated with PLP, whereas the other form is present largely as an apoenzyme (12Denner L.A. Wu J.Y. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This finding was later confirmed by cloning and characterization of GAD65 and GAD67, the two major forms of GAD in mammalian brain, thus showing that GAD65 is present as apoGAD in the brain to a much greater degree than that of GAD67, and hence its activity is regulated more closely by factors affecting the conversions of apoGAD to holoGAD (13Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 14Martin D.L. Martin S.B. Wu S.J. Espina N. J.

The interconversion between apo- and holoGAD appears to be a highly regulated mechanism and is not a simple dissociation and association of PLP (for review, see Ref. 15Martin D.L. Rimvall K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The activation of GAD65 by binding of PLP to apoGAD65 appears to involve a large protein conformational change leading to increased stability (16Chen C.H. Wu S.J. Martin D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to Zn2+ and PLP, recently we have reported that protein phosphorylation also plays an important role in the regulation of GAD activity. Specifically, we have shown that soluble GAD (SGAD is inhibited by protein kinase A-mediated protein phosphorylation and is activated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 2325-2332Google Scholar). We report here that MGAD is also regulated by protein phosphorylation but through a different mechanism. MGAD is activated by ATP through phosphorylation modulated by the synaptic vesicle proton gradient and is inhibited by dephosphorylation. A model linking GABA synthesis by MGAD and proton gradient-sensitive GABA transport into synaptic vesicles is also discussed. Fresh porcine brains were obtained from a local abattoir. Benzethonium hydroxide (Hyamine base, 1 msolution in methanol), PLP, 2-aminoethylisothiuronium bromide, AMP-PNP, calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP), Triton X-100, bafilomycin A1, gramicidin, and carbonyl cyanide m-chorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were purchased from Sigma. Okadaic acid was from Alexis Biochemicals Corp. (San Diego, CA). Protein kinase inhibitors (PMB, KN-62, H-8, and H-9) were purchased from Research Biochemical International (Natick, MA). Sodium orthovanadate was purchased from Aldrich. Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [1-14C]Glutamate, [γ-32P]ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products; Western-Light Plus immunodetection kit was from Tropix Inc. (Bedford, MA). Anti-GAD65 and anti-GAD67 are polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against recombinant human GAD67 and human GAD65 expressed in separate bacterial systems. 2K. M. Davis, T. Foos, C. S. Bates, E. Tucker, C. C. Hsu, J. V. Schloss,., and J. Y. Wu, submitted for publication. Anti-GAD65 used in this study had been preabsorbed with an excess of recombinant human GAD67 to remove GAD67-specific antibodies. Anti-GAD C38 is a polyclonal antibody directed against soluble GAD (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol.

GAD6, a GAD65-specific monoclonal antibody, was purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). IDDM serum, which has higher titer autoantibodies against GAD65 than GAD67 in immunoblotting, as well as immunoprecipitation tests, was kindly provided by Dr. C. Y. Kuo (University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN). GAD was assayed by a radiometric method measuring the formation of 14CO2 froml-[l14C]glutamic acid as described (20Wu J.Y. Denner L.A. Wei S.C. Lin C.T. Song G.X. Xu Y.F. Liu J.W. Lin H.S. Brain Res. 1986; 373: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Bafilomycin A1, CCCP, and gramicidin were dissolved in ethanol in stock solution. The controls contained ethanol in concentrations not exceeding 1% of the incubation volume. Five hundred microliters of GAD sample was incubated with 50 μl of anti-GAD serum in various dilutions at 4 °C for 12 h. Protein A-Sepharose (20 μl) was added to each mixture and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was then washed six times in GAD buffer, which contains 1 mm 2-aminoethylisothiuronium bromide, 0.2 mm PLP in 50 mm Tris/citrate (KP) buffer at pH 7.2. Both the supernatant and pellet were assayed for GAD activity. Partially purified MGAD was first separated on a 10% one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system (SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblotting test as described (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 2325-2332Google Scholar). Briefly, blotting was carried out at 4 °C for 18 h in a LKB 2005 transfer unit containing 25 mmTris-Cl (pH 6.8), 0.192 m glycine, 0.5% SDS, and 20% methanol, followed by overnight incubation with anti-GAD primary antibody incubation at 4 °C and 2 h of secondary antibody incubation in room temperature. Immunocomplex was visualized using Western-Light Plus. Unless otherwise specified, all procedures were carried out at 4 °C and all solutions contained standard GAD buffer. In a typical preparation, a 15% (w/v) porcine brain homogenate was made by use of a Teflon-glass homogenizer in ice-cold standard GAD buffer containing 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm theophylline. Preparation of crude synaptosomes was performed as described (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 2325-2332Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh porcine brains were homogenized in 0.32 msucrose (w/v, 15 g/100 ml), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant solution was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet thus obtained was sonicated and washed in GAD buffer solution. This was the crude synaptosomal membrane, referred to as P2M. Phosphorylation of MGAD in P2M was carried out as described previously for SGAD (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 2325-2332Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP (1 mCi/ml) and P2M (3 mg) were incubated at 22 °C for 1 h. The mixture was further incubated with Triton X-100 (final concentration, 0.5%) for an additional 1 h to allow solubilization of MGAD and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. Solubilized [32P]MGAD was first cleared with preimmune rabbit serum, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-SGAD serum. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times in GAD buffer, followed by GAD assay of the supernatant and the pellet. The samples are then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography as described (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 2325-2332Google Scholar). Purification of MGAD was conducted, as described previously (21Nathan B. Bao J. Hsu C.C. Yarom M. Deupree D.L. Lee Y.H. Tang X.W. Kuo C.Y. Burghen G.A. Wu J.Y. Brain Res. 1994; 642: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, a 25% P2M homogenate was made in standard GAD buffer solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The P2M suspension was gently rotated at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant thus obtained was the solubilized MGAD and was further purified through conventional column chromatography consisting of an anion exchange (DEAE-52), an adsorption (hydroxylapatite), and a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-200). Effect of ATP on the Kmand Vmax of synaptosomal MGAD was determined as described previously for SGAD (22Denner L.A. Wei S.C. Lin H.S. Lin C.T. Wu J.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Kmvalue was determined by using varying glutamate concentrations from 0.4 to 2 mm as described previously (22Denner L.A. Wei S.C. Lin H.S. Lin C.T. Wu J.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The Km values were obtained by a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten rate equation by use of Prism by GraphPad Software, Inc. When SGAD and MGAD were assayed under conditions favoring protein phosphorylation, e.g. in the presence of ATP or protein phosphatase inhibitors, it was found that SGAD was inhibited whereas MGAD was activated (Fig.1). In contrast to SGAD, MGAD activity was greatly enhanced by ATP, increasing by about 100% at 5 mm. Under the same conditions, SGAD activity was inhibited by 40%, similar to our earlier findings (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The presence of divalent cation chelators, 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA, decreased SGAD activity but had no effect on the activity of MGAD, suggesting a role for calcium on SGAD regulation but not in MGAD regulation. Other phosphatase inhibitors, e.g. 0.2 mm vanadate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, slightly enhanced MGAD activity and significantly inhibited SGAD activity. To determine if the energy-dependent synaptic vesicle proton gradient is involved in the activation of MGAD by ATP, we examined the effect of ATP on MGAD activity under conditions that disrupted the proton gradient. When the vesicular proton gradient was abolished by protonophore uncoupler, CCCP (100 μm), or ionophore, gramicidin (10 μm), the activation of MGAD by ATP was found to disappear as shown in Fig.2. In addition, ATP activation of MGAD is sensitive to the specific V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (23Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar), at a concentration of 6 μm but not to the P-type ATPase inhibitor, vanadate, at a concentration of 200 μm (Fig.2). Interestingly, CCCP, gramicidin, and bafilomycin A1 have no effect on SGAD activity, alone or in the presence of ATP. MGAD was found to be highly sensitive to the treatment with phosphatase. MGAD activity was reduced by 80% by a short incubation (10 min) with CIP, whereas SGAD activity was slightly increased (Fig.3). This result suggested that MGAD activity is likely to be regulated by protein phosphorylation. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP was found to have no effect on MGAD activity up to a concentration of 5 mm while ATP activated MGAD at a concentration as low as 10 μm, suggesting that ATP is likely to exert its effect on MGAD through protein phosphorylation and not by direct binding to MGAD. At 0.1 mm ATP, MGAD activity was increased to over 200% (Fig. 4). The activation of MGAD by ATP seems to plateau at 0.1 mm since a 50-fold increase of ATP concentration to 5 mm gave a comparable effect (Fig. 4). Other nucleotides such as GTP and ADP had no effect on MGAD activity even at 5 mm (Table I). These data are compatible with the notion that ATP exerts its effect through protein phosphorylation. Lack of effect of protein kinase C inhibitors, e.g. H-8 (30 μm), H-9 (30 μm), KN-62 (5 μm), and PMB (100 μm), on ATP activation of MGAD (Table I) may indicate that protein kinase C is not involved in the regulation of MGAD activity. Furthermore, ATP activation of MGAD appears not to be due to the activation of pyridoxal kinase since theophylline, a potent inhibitor of pyridoxal kinase (Ki = 8.7 μm) (24Ubbink J.B. Bissbort S. Vermaak W.J. Delport R. Enzyme. 1990; 43: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has no effect on ATP activation of MGAD (results not shown). Kinetic studies showed that ATP lowers the Km of MGAD forl-glutamate from 2.1 mm to 0.9 mmand increased the Vmax by about 50%. Thus, ATP gives about twice the stimulatory effect at low concentrations of glutamate (3-fold increase in Vmax/Km) than it does at saturating levels of glutamate.Table IActivation of ATP on synaptosomal MGAD under various conditionsTreatmentMGAD activityn%Control100 ± 6Calcium acetate, 200 μm95 ± 84GTP, 5 mm103 ± 103ADP, 5 mm98 ± 93ATP, 5 mm220 ± 2318GABA, 25 mm89 ± 96ATP, 5 mm + GABA, 25 mm192 ± 206ATP, 5 mm + calcium acetate, 200 μm205 ± 194ATP, 5 mm + PMB, 100 μm234 ± 183ATP, 5 mm + KN-62, 5 μm195 ± 163ATP, 5 mm + H-8, 30 μm + H-9, 30 μm225 ± 173Washed and lysed aliquots of crude synaptosomal pellet were treated under the following conditions.

This 32P-labeled protein was further identified as MGAD from immunoblotting tests using anti-SGAD serum (lane 5). No 32P incorporation was seen when [γ-32P]ATP was replaced by [α-32P]ATP (lane 3) or when anti-SGAD serum was replaced by preimmune serum (lanes 1 and 2).Table IIImmunoprecipitation of SGAD and solubilized MGAD using C38 and IDDM serumGAD samplesGAD activity in the immunoprecipitateControl serumC38IDDM serum%%%SGAD2 ± 0.595 ± 1.096 ± 1.5Solubilized MGAD3 ± 1.093 ± 1.598 ± 2.0Approximately 80 μg of protein of each GAD sample in 100 μl of standard GAD buffer was incubated with C38 and IDDM serum (50 μl) in a final volume of 800 μl for 24 h.

Similar results were obtained from an immunoprecipitation/SDS-PAGE test in which a protein corresponding to GAD65 was immunoprecipitated by all three different sera used, e.g. C38, IDDM, and GAD6 (Fig.7).

Numerous contradicting reports have appeared in the literature regarding the effect of ATP on GAD activity. Some reports show that ATP inhibits GAD activity (24Ubbink J.B. Bissbort S. Vermaak W.J. Delport R. Enzyme. 1990; 43: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Gottlieb D.I. Chang Y.C. Schwob J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 1974; 23: 759-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Meeley M.P. Martin D.L. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1983; 3: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas others report the activation of GAD by ATP (32Tunnicliff G. Ngo T.T. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1979; 57: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 33Sze P.Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1979; 123: 59-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These contradicting reports can now be explained by the findings reported here. MGAD is activated by ATP, and we have previously shown that SGAD is inhibited by ATP (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 2325-2332Google Scholar). Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that the effect of ATP on GAD in a particular subcellular location could result in activation or inhibition and that the net effect observed would depend on the relative amounts of soluble and membrane-bound GAD present. Activation of MGAD by ATP appears to be mediated by protein phosphorylation, presumably mediated by a membrane-associated protein kinase(s) that is sensitive to vesicular proton gradient. This notion is supported by the following observations: 1) MGAD activity is greatly reduced after treatment with phosphatase (Fig. 3); 2) direct phosphorylation of MGAD has been demonstrated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, but not [α-32P]ATP (Fig.5); 3) activation of MGAD by ATP could be obtained even with extensively washed membrane preparations, without addition of any soluble components; 4) ATP activation of MGAD is abolished when the proton gradient on the synaptic vesicle is disrupted such as in the presence of a vesicular proton pump (V-ATPase) inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, the ionophore gramicidin, or the protonophore uncoupler CCCP, etc. (Fig. 2); 5) MGAD has been shown to be an integral component of synaptic vesicles (34Nathan B. Floor E. Kuo C.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 134-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35Reetz A. Solimena M. Matteoli M. Folli F. Takei K. De Camilli P.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); 6) a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, has no effect on MGAD (Fig. 4). Based on the above observations, together with the fact that both MGAD and GABA transporter activities depend on the functional integrity of vesicular proton gradient, the following sequence of events leading from neuronal stimulation to activation of MGAD is proposed (Fig. 8); when GABA is released by exocytosis after the arrival of an action potential (step 1), synaptic vesicles are recycled by means of coated pits (step 2). Coated vesicles are then returned to the resting state of synaptic vesicles, where the proton gradient is restored by V-ATPase (step 3) and MGAD is activated by synaptic vesicle membrane-associated protein kinase (step 4). GABA synthesized by MGAD is then transported into synaptic vesicles by the GABA transporter (step 5). These refilled GABA-containing synaptic vesicles are ready to be released upon arrival of a new action potential. This novel model provides a functional link between synthesis and packaging of GABA in the GABAergic terminals. Previously, we have reported that SGAD is activated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and is inhibited by protein kinase A-mediated protein phosphorylation (17Bao J. Cheung W.Y. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6464-6467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Bao J. Nathan B. Hsu C.C. Zhang Y. Wu R. Wu J.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 2325-2332Google Scholar). Furthermore, we proposed that when GABA neurons are stimulated, the influx of Ca2+ into the terminal (step 6, Fig. 8) activates the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (also known as PrP2B), resulting in dephosphorylation and activation of SGAD (step 7, Fig. 8). The newly synthesized GABA can also be transported into the synaptic vesicles (step 8, Fig. 8) or be metabolized to generate ATP through the GABA shunt pathway (step 9, Fig. 8). Recently we have shown that the taurine synthesizing enzyme, cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase behaves similarly to MGAD, namely activation by ATP and protein phosphorylation and inhibition by dephosphorylation (37Tang X.-W. Hsu C.-C. Schloss J.V. Faiman M.D. Wu E. Yang C.-Y. Wu J.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6947-6951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tang X.-W. Hsu C.-C. Sun Y. Wu E. Yang C.-Y. Wu J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 96: 442-454Crossref Google Scholar). However, there is a major difference between cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase and MGAD in that the former is regulated by product inhibition, whereas the latter is not affected by its product, GABA, even at a concentration of 25 mm (Table I). This is also consistent with findings reported in the literature (33Sze P.Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1979; 123: 59-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The identity of the ATP-activated MGAD remains somewhat uncertain. However, the following observations suggest that MGAD is GAD65 or a closely related protein. 1) MGAD solubilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 constitutes a major portion of GAD, which is concentrated at the terminal ending, also characteristic of GAD65 (39Erlander M.G. Tillakaratne N.J.K. Feldblum S. Patel N. Tobin A.J. Neuron. 1991; 7: 91-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 40Henry S. Tappaz M. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 131: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). 2) A GAD65-specific monoclonal antibody, GAD6, or a GAD65-specific preabsorbed polyclonal antibody, anti-GAD65, as well as IDDM patient sera recognize the MGAD in immunoblots and immunoprecipitation tests (Figs. 5 and 6). To ensure that the same band is recognized by these antibodies, separate immunoblots as well as the same reprobed immunoblot were used. These antibodies recognized MGAD on the same band at the approximate molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig.6). 3) The hydrophobic form of GAD65 has been shown by Namchuk et al. (42Namchuk M. Lindsay L. Turck C. Kanaani J. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1548-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to be phosphorylated by an unidentified membrane-associated kinase. This result is consistent with our findings in that the activation of MGAD by ATP in the synaptosomal membranes does not require the presence of soluble proteins. The lysed and washed membrane fraction supplemented with ATP was sufficient to phosphorylate and to activate MGAD. These results support the notion that GAD65 is present in the TX-100-solubilized MGAD fraction and that the kinase involved in phosphorylating MGAD is a membrane-associated kinase. To identify the specific kinase involved in the regulation of MGAD, several inhibitors specific to serine and threonine kinases were employed. None of the inhibitors had any effect on ATP activation of MGAD (Table I), suggesting that, unlike SGAD or cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, MGAD is not directly regulated by some common protein kinases, e.g. protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Upon examining the DNA sequences of GAD65 in porcine and rat brains, a consensus sequence site, Arg-Xaa-(Xaa)-Ser/Thr-Xaa-Ser/Thr, for an autophosphorylationdependent serine/threonine protein kinase, which is cAMP/Ca2+-independent (19Yang S.D. Huang T.J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29855-29859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to exist within the open reading frame. Therefore, MGAD may be regulated by protein phosphorylation by a cAMP/Ca2+-independent kinase as yet to be identified. In summary, regulation of MGAD may be mediated through the vesicular proton gradient, perhaps by a mechanism involving protein phosphorylation. Conceivably, its regulation may be coupled to the V-ATPase, the GABA transporter, or another transmembrane protein on the synaptic vesicle. These possibilities along with a complete structural analysis of MGAD are currently under investigation. We thank Dr. C. Y. Kuo for providing IDDM patient serum."

Because the tubulin-microtubule system plays an important role in cell division and cell proliferation, we investigated the interaction between wild-type Fhit or mutant Fhit (H96N) and tubulin in vitro. The mutant form of Fhit (H96N) lacks Ap3A hydrolase activity but retains tumor suppressor activity. We found that both wild-type and mutated forms of Fhit bind to tubulin strongly and specifically with Kd values of 1.4 and 2.1 μm, respectively. Neither wild-type nor mutant Fhit cause nucleation or formation of microtubules, but in the presence of microtubule-associated proteins, both wild-type and mutant Fhit promote assembly to a greater extent than do microtubule-associated proteins alone, and the microtubules formed appear normal by electron microscopy.

FHIT encodes a 147-amino acid protein that has a HIT (histidine triad) sequence motif (positions 94–99) identified by the presence of a histidine triad, H X H X H X, where X is a hydrophobic residue (1Ohta M.

FhitH96N, generated by site-directed mutagenesis of FHIT, has negligible Ap3A hydrolase activity, which suggests that the central histidine of the triad is essential for hydrolase activity (5Barnes L.D.

Suppression of tumors in nude mice injected with tumor cells transfected with either FHIT or FHIT-H96N provides the strongest data that Fhit is a tumor suppressor (6Siprashvili Z. Sozzi G.

The results also indicate that the Ap3A hydrolase activity of Fhit is not necessary for its tumor suppressor activity (6Siprashvili Z. Sozzi G. Barnes L.D. McCue P. Robinson A.K. Eryomin V. Sard L. Tagliabue E. Greco A. Fusetti L. Schwartz G. Pierotti M., A. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13771-13776Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The mode of action of Fhit as a tumor suppressor and the relationship of the Ap3A hydrolase activity to tumor suppression are not yet understood. The Fhit gene and protein have been reviewed recently (7Huebner K. Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. Croce C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 7-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,8Sozzi G. Huebner K.

Microtubules are ubiquitous cytoskeletal organelles found in most eukaryotic cells; they play critical roles in mitosis and other cellular processes (9Dustin P. Microtubules. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984Crossref Google Scholar). Since microtubules participate actively in mitosis, they are the prime target of taxol, vinblastine, and other anti-tumor drugs (10Ludueña R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). These microtubules are composed of the protein tubulin, consisting of two subunits called α and β. We decided to explore the relationship between microtubules and Fhit. Most tumor suppressor proteins are DNA-directed and function at the transcriptional level (11Hesketh R. The Oncogene and Tumor Suppressor Gene Facts Book. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). APC is the only tumor suppressor protein known to interact directly with microtubules and to promote microtubule assembly. A domain of APC has sequence homology with the microtubule-associated protein Tau (12Deka J. Kuhlmann J. Muller O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutations in APC cause the dissociation of APC from the microtubule cytoskeleton (13Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3672-3675PubMed Google Scholar). Since the mechanism of Fhit as a tumor suppressor is still unknown, we examined the interaction of Fhit and tubulin in vitro. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that both Fhit and FhitH96N interact specifically with unfractionated tubulin with Kdvalues of 1.4 and 2.1 μm, respectively. Fhit and FhitH96N do not promote microtubule assembly of tubulin by themselves, but in the presence of MAP2 and Tau, both forms of Fhit induce assembly to a greater extent than do either MAP2 or Tau alone, as determined by turbidimetry, electron microscopy, and sedimentation. Thus, the relationship of Fhit with the tubulin-microtubule system may help to understand the role of Fhit in the suppression of tumorigenesis. 6-IAF was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc.

Microtubules were purified from fresh bovine brain cerebra by assembly and disassembly according to the method of Fellous et al. (15Fellous A. Francon J. Lennon A.M. Nunez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). When experiments were to be done, microtubules were resuspended in 0.1m MES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting supernatant is designated as microtubule protein; it contains tubulin and MAPs and was used for further purification. Tubulin was purified from microtubule protein by phosphocellulose chromatography (15Fellous A. Francon J. Lennon A.M. Nunez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Experiments were done in the following buffer: 0.1 m MES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA (15Fellous A.

Microtubules were purified from bovine cerebra as described above, and Tau and MAP2 were purified from microtubule protein by the procedure of Fellous et al. (15Fellous A. Francon J. Lennon A.M.

Subcloning of FHIT, expression in Escherichia coli, and purification of Fhit to homogeneity were done as described previously (16Brenner C. Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Rösler A. Liu X.-H.

Fhit contains one cysteine residue per monomer, and this cysteine residue was targeted for covalent modification with 6-IAF. Purified Fhit and FhitH96N, each at 30 μm, were incubated separately in the presence of 200 μm 6-IAF at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C using a centricon-10 unit to remove residual 6-IAF. The centrifugation was repeated 10–12 times to ensure that the filtrate lacked any unincorporated 6-IAF as detected spectroscopically. Fluorescently-labeled samples were stored at −80 °C. For fluorometric measurement of the binding of tubulin to Fhit, aliquots of 6-IAF-labeled Fhit (1 μm) were incubated with different concentrations of tubulin (0–6 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were then excited at 492 nm in the Hitachi F-2000 spectrophotometer, and emission was measured at 515 nm. The fluorescence of the fluorescently labeled Fhit was quenched with increasing concentrations of tubulin. The observed fluorescence-quenching values were fitted to a rectangular hyperbolic curve using MINSQ (Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT; version 3.2) nonlinear curve-fitting software for either a one- or two-site binding model equation as follows: For the one site model, F = Fm× L/(Kd + L), where F is the fluorescence value at any ligand concentration, Fm is the maximum fluorescence, L is the ligand concentration, and Kd is the apparent dissociation constant for the tubulin-Fhit complex. For the two-site model, F1 =Fm1 × L/(Kd1 +L), F2 = Fm2× L/(Kd2 + L), and F =F1 + F2, where F1 and F2 are the observed corrected fluorescence values at any ligand concentration (L) for high and low affinity sites, respectively.Fm1 and Fm2 are the maximum fluorescence values for high and low affinity sites, respectively. Kd1 and Kd2 are the apparent dissociation constants for high and low affinity sites, respectively, and F is the total fluorescence value at any given ligand concentration. Tubulin in assembly buffer containing 1 mm GTP was mixed with either MAP2 or Tau and incubated at 37 °C in a cuvette in a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer. Microtubule assembly was monitored by the increase in turbidity at 350 nm (17Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Shelanski M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 737-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Cold-sensitivity of assembled microtubules was determined by measuring the decrease in turbidity at 350 nm after incubating microtubule samples in ice for 30 min. Samples of microtubule protein or tubulin containing MAP2 or Tau were incubated with or without Fhit at 37 °C for 45 min. The samples were then centrifuged at room temperature for 4 min in the Beckman Airfuge at 175,000 × g. To determine the polymer concentrations before centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 9.2, and the concentration of protein was determined; from this figure, the polymer concentration was then calculated. Microtubule structures were examined on negatively stained grids using a JEOL 100 CX electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV as described previously (18Banerjee A. Roach M.C. Trcka P. Ludueña R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1794-1799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of glutaraldehyde (1%) followed by mounting on carbon-coated grids for 30 s. The grids were then washed sequentially with cytochrome c, water, and finally with uranyl acetate (1%). The grids were air-dried before examination under the microscope. Microtubules were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 225: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (21Schacterle G.R. Pollack R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 51: 654-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). To study the interaction of Fhit with tubulin in vitro, we covalently labeled Fhit and FhitH96N with 6-IAF and studied the interaction between Fhit and tubulin fluorometrically. The fluorescence at 515 nm of both labeled forms of Fhit was quenched by increasing concentrations of tubulin when samples were excited at 492 nm. Unlabeled Fhit was able to reverse about 80% of the tubulin-induced quenching of fluorescence (Fig. 1). Since Fig. 1 shows hyperbolic behavior with a limiting non-zero plateau at about 20% control, half-maximal reversal of fluorescence quenching was calculated at 60% to yield an unlabeled Fhit concentration of 0.9 μm (inset, Fig. 1). Furthermore, we also found that GTP and GDP at different concentrations (1–20 μm), unlabeled Fhit, and the tubulin-associated proteins MAP2 and Tau do not quench or change the fluorescence of labeled Fhit under the same conditions (data not shown). The fluorescence quenching of 6-IAF-labeled Fhit and FhitH96N in the presence of tubulin was analyzed using a nonlinear curve-fitting program applied to the one- and two-site models. The results were most consistent with a protein model with one class of binding site. The one-site model that best fits the data is shown in Figs.2, A and B, for Fhit and FhitH96N, respectively. Values of the apparent dissociation constant of Fhit-tubulin and FhitH96N-tubulin complexes are 1.4 ± 0.1 μm and 2.16 ± 0.04 μm, (n = 2), respectively. Because tubulin forms cylindrical microtubular structures in the presence of its associated proteins in vitro, we studied the effect of Fhit and FhitH96N on microtubule protein assembly. We found that with both forms of Fhit, microtubule assembly was enhanced significantly (Figs. 3, A and B), and the extent of microtubule assembly was a function of the concentration of Fhit (Fig. 3 A). Microtubules formed in the presence of Fhit and FhitH96N appear to have typical microtubular structures as determined by electron microscopy (Figs. 3, C and D). The microtubules formed in the presence of Fhit and FhitH96N are also cold-sensitive (data not shown), which is a property of normal microtubules formed in the absence of Fhit (22Olmsted J.B. Borisy G.G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4282-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Neither Fhit nor FhitH96N initiate microtubule assembly of pure tubulin in the absence of MAPs as detected by turbidimetry (Fig.4), electron microscopy (Fig.5 A and F), or sedimentation assay (Table I). However, in the presence of either Tau or MAP2, both Fhit and FhitH96N promote the assembly of tubulin more than do either Tau or MAP2 alone (Fig. 4). In all cases with either Fhit or FhitH96N, the assembled microtubules appear to be normal in structure as determined by electron microscopy (Figs. 5). Sedimentation analysis (Table I) shows that when Fhit and tubulin are incubated with either MAP2 or Tau, the presence of Fhit increases the polymer mass by 34% and 106%, respectively. These data are in good agreement with the data shown in Figs. 4, A and B, demonstrating that the effect of Fhit on Tau-induced assembly is greater than on MAP-2-induced assembly. In an analogous experiment using unfractionated microtubule protein, Fhit increases polymer mass by only 7%. 2A. R. Chaudhuri, I. A. Khan, V. Prasad, A. K. Robinson, R. F. Ludueña, and L. D. Barnes, unpublished observation. The pelleted samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6).

We found that both Fhit and FhitH96N bind to tubulin with similar apparent affinities (Kd values for wild-type and mutant Fhit = 1.4 and 2.2 μm, respectively). This observation suggests that the mutation at histidine 96, which is the central histidine of the histidine triad, has no significant influence on the interaction between Fhit and tubulin. This mutation causes loss of the Ap3A hydrolase activity of Fhit (5Barnes L.D. Garrison P.N. Siprashvili Z. Guranowski A. Robinson A.K. Ingram S.W. Croce C.M. Ohta M. Huebner K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11529-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) but not loss of the tumor suppressor capacity of Fhit (6Siprashvili Z. Sozzi G. Barnes L.D. McCue P. Robinson A.K. Eryomin V. Sard L. Tagliabue E. Greco A. Fusetti L. Schwartz G. Pierotti M., A. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13771-13776Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Binding of both wild-type Fhit and FhitH96N to tubulin is compatible with the tumor suppressor function of Fhit being independent of Ap3A hydrolysis. This finding also predicts that the Ap3A catalytic domain and the tubulin binding domain of Fhit are distinctly different and that they do not significantly influence each other. Since tubulin forms microtubules in the presence of GTP and associated proteins, we studied the effect of the Fhit protein on the assembly process. We found that both Fhit and FhitH96N promote assembly in a concentration-dependent manner and that the assembled microtubules had normal structures as revealed by electron microscopy. These results are consistent with our observation that mutation at histidine 96 does not influence the binding of Fhit to tubulin. Our sedimentation assay also shows clearly that Fhit-mediated assembly of tubulin increases the tubulin microtubule mass and that Fhit is physically associated with microtubules. The data obtained using different methodologies to quantitate the increment of Fhit-induced microtubule assembly vary, but the phenomenon that Fhit promotes assembly by increasing microtubule mass is highly consistent. The data obtained by electrophoretic analysis indicates that Fhit probably behaves sub-stoichiometrically in promoting assembly of tubulin. Reversal of fluorescence quenching by Fhit and the cold-sensitivity of Fhit-induced microtubules also strongly suggest that the interaction between Fhit and tubulin is specific and that the increment of light scattering and the polymer mass by Fhit is due to formation of normal microtubules. Our results suggest that Fhit has a unique binding site on tubulin and that the site probably does not overlap with any of the MAP binding sites as Fhit is copelleted along with other microtubule-associated proteins. Sequence comparisons using the FASTA3 program (23Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar) of Fhit and proteins known to interact with tubulin also support this hypothesis as the analyses failed to find any significant sequence similarities among Fhit and such proteins. In contrast, the tumor suppressor protein APC, which is known to bind to tubulin, has sequence similarity with a particular domain of Tau protein (12Deka J. Kuhlmann J. Muller O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There are distinct differences between APC and Fhit in terms of their interactions with tubulin. APC promotes the assembly of tubulin by itself (12Deka J. Kuhlmann J. Muller O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) without requiring the presence of any MAPs. In contrast, neither Fhit by itself nor FhitH96N by itself induce the assembly of tubulin, but in the presence of Tau or MAP2, both Fhit and FhitH96N promote the assembly of microtubules more than do Tau or MAP2 alone. Since the C-terminal domains of both α and β subunits are flexible and exposed even on the surface of microtubules (24Breitling F. Little M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25de la Viña S. Andreu D. Medrano F.J. Nieto J.M. Andreu J.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5352-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), these regions can be selectively removed by limited proteolysis with subtilisin (26Serrano L. de la Torre J. Maccioni R.B. Avila J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,27Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 43-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus-cleaved tubulin exhibits MAP-independent microtubule assembly due to reduction of electrostatic repulsion and forms microtubule-like sheets (26Serrano L. de la Torre J. Maccioni R.B. Avila J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 43-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fhit alone can enhance the assembly of subtilisin-cleaved tubulin.2 This observation is also consistent with the hypothesis that Fhit interacts at a unique site other than the C-terminal regions, where MAPs are thought to interact (26Serrano L. de la Torre J. Maccioni R.B. Avila J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 28Ludueña R.F. Banerjee A. Khan I.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 53-57Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because the electrostatic repulsion among the C-terminal regions of tubulin hinders microtubule assembly, Fhit can not induce microtubule assembly by itself. It needs other proteins such as MAP2 or Tau that bind at the C-terminal regions to exhibit its microtubule-inducing property. In view of the critical roles microtubules play in mitosis and other cellular processes, it is not unexpected that they would also interact with tumor suppressor gene products such as APC and Fhit. The precise nature of the physiological connection between our results and tumor suppression is, however, not clear. Both APC and Fhit enhance microtubule assembly. It is conceivable, therefore, that they may either diminish microtubule dynamic behavior or else interfere with microtubule disassembly, either of which effects could inhibit a process such as mitosis, which is a highly coordinated and complex interplay of microtubule growth, shrinkage, and dynamics. The tubulin binding domain of APC resembles part of the microtubule-associated protein Tau, a part that is not known to bind to tubulin directly but which regulates the Tau-tubulin interaction (12Deka J. Kuhlmann J. Muller O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One may speculate that this domain acts like a MAP to enhance assembly and inhibit dynamics; this could also explain why APC can induce microtubule assembly in the absence of MAPs. In contrast, Fhit can only enhance microtubule assembly in the presence of a MAP; for Fhit, the correlation between structure and function is still unclear. The fact that the H96N mutation, which markedly decreases the Ap3A hydrolase activity (5Barnes L.D. Garrison P.N. Siprashvili Z. Guranowski A. Robinson A.K. Ingram S.W. Croce C.M. Ohta M. Huebner K.

A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), alters neither the tumor suppression nor the effect on microtubule assembly indicates that the hydrolase activity is not required for either of these properties. However, the connection between the tumor suppression and the binding to tubulin remains the subject for future investigation.

In particular, the roles of PI 3-kinase and Rac in the nuclear signaling by TNF-α are as yet unclear. In the present study, we investigated the extent to which PI 3-kinase and Rac are involved in the TNF-α-induced activation of c-fos SRE and JNK. Our findings suggest that both PI 3-kinase and Rac have crucial functions within the intracellular signaling cascade triggered by TNF-α in Rat-2 fibroblasts. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), mepacrine, and wortmannin (25Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell.

Control (GsTsGCTCCTAAGTTTCTsAsT) and antisense (GsTsGCTGGTAAGGATCTsAsT) cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) oligonucleotides were purchased from BioMol.

Amino acids 478–513 are deleted in the mutant, which, consequently, lacks the binding site for the catalytic subunit. Rat-2 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL 1764). The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under a humidified 95%, 5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2. The Rat2-RacN17 stable clone expressing a dominant negative Rac1mutant, RacN17, has been described previously (28Kim B.C. Yi J.Y. Yi S.J. Shin I.C. Ha K.S. Jhun B.H. Hwang S.B. Kim J.H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 8: 90-95Google Scholar). Transient transfection was carried out by plating approximately 5×105 cells in 100-mm dishes for 24 h and then adding calcium phosphate:DNA precipitates prepared with 20 μg of DNA/dish. The quantities of plasmid used were 3 μg of reporter gene (pSRE-Luc) and 5 μg of small GTPase expression plasmids (e.g. pEXV-RacV12). To control for variations in cell number and transfection efficiency, all clones were co-transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-βGAL, a eukaryotic expression vector in which the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase (lacZ) structural gene is under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. In each transfection, the quantity of DNA used was held constant (20 μg) by adding sonicated calf thymus DNA (Sigma). After a 6-h incubation with calcium phosphate:DNA precipitates, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before incubating them in fresh DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS for an additional 36 h. Each dish of cells was then rinsed twice with PBS and lysed in 0.2 ml of lysis solution (0.2 m Tris (pH 7.6) + 0.1% Triton X-100), after which lysed cells were scraped and spun for 1 min. Supernatants were assayed for protein concentration as well as luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase activity was assayed using 10 μl of extract according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega Luciferase Assay System; Promega, Madison, WI) and counted for 10 s in a Beckman liquid scintillation spectrometer using the tritium channel with the coincidence circuit disconnected. Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate with two independently isolated sets of cells, and the results were averaged. β-Galactosidase assays were carried out on 50-μl aliquots of extract (diluted with 100 μl of H2O) using 150 μl of 2× reaction buffer (3 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside, 2 mmMgCl2, 61 mm Na2HPO4, 39 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol). Once a faint yellow color appeared, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 350 μl of 1 mNa2CO3. Optical density at 410 nm was then measured in a spectrophotometer and used to normalize luciferase activity to transfection efficiency. Protein concentrations were determined routinely using the Bradford procedure with Bio-Rad dye reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard. PI 3-kinase activity was measured by in vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI), using essentially the same method as described previously (29Kang I. Choi S.-L. Kim S.S. Ha J. Oh S.M. Kim S.S. Exp. Mol. Med. 1998; 30: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Subconfluent Rat-2 cells were serum-starved in serum-free DMEM for 16 h and then stimulated with TNF-α. Each dish of cells was then washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1.5 μg/ml benzamidine) with 34 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After lysis, the soluble fractions were harvested by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 15 min) at 4 °C. The harvested fractions (containing 1 mg of protein) were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine agarose beads to immunoprecipitate PI 3-kinase. The immunoprecipitates were successively washed three times in washing buffer-1 (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 100 μmsodium vanadate), three times in washing buffer-2 (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm LiCl2 and 100 μm sodium vanadate), and finally two times in washing buffer-3 (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μmsodium vanadate). To these immunoprecipitates were added 20 μl of reaction buffer (10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 + 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol (200 μg/μl) sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EGTA). After adding 10 μl of ATP solution (10 μm) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, the immunoprecipitates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with constant shaking. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 mHCl and 200 μl of CHCl3-methanol (1:1). The samples were then centrifuged, and the lower organic phases were harvested and applied to silica gel TLC plates (Merck Co.) coated with 1% potassium oxalate. The TLC plates were developed in CHCl3-CH3OH-H2O-NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized autoradiographically. To assay JNK activity mediated by TNF-α or C2-ceramide, subconfluent Rat-2 cells were serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and then stimulated with TNF-α or C2-ceramide for 30 min. Each dish of cells was then washed with cold PBS, lysed by incubation for 5 min at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, scraped into Eppendorf tubes, and triturated by 10 passes through a 21.1-gauge needle on ice. The supernatant (cell lysate) was harvested by microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentrations were equalized by normalizing them to the protein levels (assayed by Bradford procedure with Bio-Rad dye reagent) measured before the JNK assay. JNK activity was determined using a JNK assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). Briefly, an amino-terminal c-Jun (amino acid residues 1–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was used to pull down JNK from cell lysates. The kinase reaction (50 μl) was then carried out using the c-Jun fusion protein as a substrate in the presence of cold ATP. Phosphorylation of the c-Jun fusion protein at Ser-63 was measured by Western blot using an anti-phospho-c-Jun rabbit polyclonal antibody that detects only catalytically activated c-Jun phosphorylated at Ser-63. Protein samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gels, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 2 h at 100 V using a Novex wet transfer unit. Membranes were then blocked overnight in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20) with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, after which they were incubated for 2 h with primary antibody (anti-phospho-c-Jun) in PBS-T and then for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence kits (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands on XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) corresponding to phospho-c-Jun were measured by densitometry. As an initial approach to understanding the role of PI 3-kinase in the signal transduction pathway between TNF-α and the nucleus, we assessed the capacity of TNF-α to stimulate c-fos SRE, which is a primary nuclear target for various extracellular signals (9Kim B.C. Kim J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Kim J.H. Kwack H.J. Choi S.E. Kim B.C. Kim Y.S. Kang I.J. Kumar C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Chou M.M. Blenis J.

Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, Rat-2 cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmid pSRE-Luc (3 μg) containing c-fos SRE oligonucleotides inserted upstream of the c-fos minimal promoter fused to luciferase coding sequences (9Kim B.C. Kim J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TNF-α-induced SRE activation was monitored by measuring luciferase activities normalized to co-transfected β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig.1, TNF-α stimulated c-fos SRE-dependent reporter gene activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A maximal 5.7-fold increase in the luciferase activity occurred at a TNF-α concentration of 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1, left panel) 1 h after its addition (Fig. 1, right panel). No TNF-α-induced luciferase activity was seen in cells transiently transfected with pO-Luc (vector without SRE; data not shown). To assess the role of PI 3-kinase, we examined the effects of PI 3-kinase antagonists, LY294002 (Fig.2 A) and wortmannin (Fig.2 B) on TNF-α-induced c-fos SRE activation. Both compounds dose-dependently inhibited TNF-α-evoked SRE luciferase activity at levels that selectively inhibit PI 3-kinase activity (31Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 32Ferby I.M. Waga I. Hoshino M. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11684-11688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As examples, 25 μm LY294002 reduced TNF-α-evoked SRE luciferase activity by ∼40%, while 100 nm wortmannin reduced the activity by ∼50%. C2-Ceramide-induced SRE activation was similarly attenuated by PI 3-kinase inhibition (Fig. 2, A and B). Further, co-transfection with pSG5-Δp85 encoding a dominant negative PI 3-kinase mutant significantly and dose-dependently diminished TNF-α-induced stimulation of SRE-luciferase activity (Fig.2 C). Of the quantities tested, co-transfection with 5 μg of pSG5-Δp85 reduced TNF-α-induced stimulation of SRE-luciferase activity by ∼75%, whereas lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced SRE activation was little affected. Taken together, these results are strongly suggestive of the participation of PI 3-kinase in TNF-α signaling to c-fos SRE. Encouraged by above results, we next directly assayed TNF-α-evoked PI 3-kinase activity by measuring the levels of the product, phosphatidylinositol phosphate, in serum-starved Rat-2 cells exposed to TNF-α for 10 min (Fig. 3). Consistent with the above results, addition of TNF-α stimulated PI 3-kinase activity significantly. Interestingly, we observed a similar stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity by TNF-α in Rat2-RacN17 cells (28Kim B.C. Yi J.Y. Yi S.J. Shin I.C. Ha K.S. Jhun B.H. Hwang S.B. Kim J.H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 8: 90-95Google Scholar) stably expressing RacN17, a dominant negative Rac1 mutant, which means that in TNF-α signaling Rac must act downstream of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3). PI 3-kinase activity induces repertoire of Rac-mediated responses (2Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 4Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the potential role of Rac in the TNF-α signaling to c-fos SRE, we tested the effect of transfection with the expression vector encoding RacN17. As shown in Fig.4 A, TNF-α-induced SRE activation was dramatically inhibited by co-transfection with 5 μg of pEXV-RacN17 (∼65% reduction in luciferase activity), suggesting that Rac activity is crucial for TNF-α-induced signaling to c-fos SRE. On the other hand, SRE activation induced by 10 μm LPA was unaffected by pEXV-RacN17 transfection. The role of Rac was further investigated by comparing the SRE-luciferase activities in Rat-2 and Rat2-RacN17 cells. Fig.4 B shows TNF-α-induced SRE activation was inhibited by 50% in serum-starved Rat2-RacN17 cells. In contrast, levels of LPA-induced SRE activation were similar in Rat-2 and Rat2-RacN17 cells (Fig. 4 B), while epidermal growth factor-evoked activation of SRE was reduced somewhat in Rat2-RacN17 cells. We, therefore, conclude that TNF-α signaling to c-fos SRE is mediated, at least in part, by a Rac-dependent cascade. The effect of LY294002 on TNF-α-induced JNK activation was assessed to determine the extent to which it is dependent on PI 3-kinase and Rac activities. Serum-starved Rat-2 cells were pretreated with LY294002 (+) or control buffer (−) for 30 min before adding TNF-α (10 ng/ml), C2-ceramide (5 μm), or arachidonic acid (AA; 100 μm), a principal product of Rac-activated phospholipase A2 (33Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). TNF-α and C2-ceramide each induced a ∼5-fold increase of JNK activity as compared with control buffer, an effect that was dramatically inhibited by LY294002 (Fig.5 A). On the other hand, LY294002 had no inhibitory effect on AA-induced JNK activation, which suggests that PI 3-kinase is specifically required for activation of JNK by TNF-α or C2-ceramide and implies a common, essential role for PI 3-kinase in TNF-α-evoked activation of both JNK and c-fos SRE. To determine the function of Rac in TNF-α signaling to JNK, levels of JNK activation were compared between control cells and cells stably expressing RacN17. As shown in Fig. 5 B, TNF-α- and C2-ceramide-induced JNK activation was dramatically reduced in Rat2-RacN17 cells, indicating the importance of Rac activity in those cases. On the other hand, JNK activation induced by 100 μm AA was unaffected by RacN17 expression. The signaling hierarchy between PI 3-kinase and Rac was investigated further by assessing the LY294002 sensitivity of SRE activation by RacV12, a constitutively activated form of Rac1. LY294002 had no inhibitory effect on SRE activation by RacV12 or RhoV14 (Fig.6), whereas RasV12-induced SRE activation was significantly and dose-dependently inhibited by LY294002. This is consistent with previous reports showing that PI 3-kinase acts as a downstream mediator of H-Ras within the signaling cascades leading to actin remodeling and transformation (2Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 3Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield P. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and is further evidence that Rac is situated downstream of PI 3-kinase in the nuclear signaling cascade leading to activation of c-fos SRE or JNK. In a separate experiment, we observed that LY294002 had no inhibitory effect on RacV12-induced JNK activation in Rat-2 cells (data not shown). We previously reported that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) plays an essential role in mediating Rac signaling to c-fos SRE and thus acts as an important downstream mediator of Rac (34Kim B.C. Kim J.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Considering the linkage between TNF-α and Rac signaling, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that cPLA2 may be involved in TNF-α signaling to SRE. To test this possibility, we assessed the extent to which mepacrine, a potent PLA2 inhibitor, inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of SRE. Fig. 7 A shows that pretreatment with 1 μm mepacrine inhibited TNF-α-induced SRE activation by approximately 50% without affecting LPA-induced activation, suggesting PLA2 is specifically required for TNF-α signaling to c-fos SRE. To further analyze the role of PLA2 in TNF-α signaling, especially that of cPLA2, we examined the effect of transfecting cells with antisense cPLA2 oligonucleotide on TNF-α-induced SRE activation. Co-transfection with the antisense oligonucleotide but not the control oligonucleotide significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced SRE activation (Fig. 7 B). For example, cotransfection with 0.5 μm cPLA2antisense oligomer reduced SRE activation by ∼45%, which suggests that a Rac-cPLA2-linked cascade is involved in TNF-α signaling to c-fos SRE. In contrast, LPA-induced SRE activation was unaffected by transfection of the antisense oligonucleotide, suggesting that the involvement of cPLA2is specific to TNF-α-induced signaling to c-fos SRE. In the present study, we provide evidence supporting novel roles for PI 3-kinase and Rac in the nuclear signaling cascade triggered by TNF-α in Rat-2 fibroblasts. TNF-α was previously reported to rapidly induce protooncogene c-fos in the adipogenic TA1 cell line, although the exact target promoter sequences by which TNF-α stimulates c-fos transcription remain unknown (35Haliday E.M. Ramesha C.S. Ringold G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicate that SRE is at least one of the nuclear target sequences by which TNF-α stimulates c-fos expression. Consistent with this conclusion, c-fos SRE is also reported to be a nuclear target of ceramide, a putative second messenger for certain stresses (e.g. ultraviolet and x-rays) and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α (9Kim B.C. Kim J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, our results suggest a role for cPLA2 that is in good agreement with the earlier report of Haliday et al. (35Haliday E.M. Ramesha C.S. Ringold G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) showing that AA and its lipoxygenase-generated metabolite are downstream elements in the TNF-α signaling pathway to c-fos. The function of AA as a downstream mediator of TNF-α signaling was also demonstrated in stromal cells, where AA mediates TNF-α-induced activation of JNK (36Rizzo M.T. Carlo-Stella C. Blood. 1996; 88: 3792-3800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of PI 3-kinase in TNF-α-induced signaling to c-fos SRE was confirmed by the significant inhibitory effects of LT294003 and wortmannin, specific PI 3-kinase antagonists, and of transient transfection with pSG5-Δp85 encoding a dominant negative PI 3-kinase mutant. Consistent with this conclusion, JNK activation by TNF-α was dramatically inhibited by LY294002, implying PI 3-kinase functions broadly as a downstream TNF-α mediator in the signaling pathways leading to SRE and JNK activation. That TNF-α stimulates PI 3-kinase activity in vitro lends additional support to this idea. We do not yet know the TNF-α target molecule(s) that mediates PI 3-kinase activation; nonetheless, since the mode of action of C2-ceramide is quite similar to that of TNF-α, especially with respect to inhibition by LY294002, we postulate that enhanced production of ceramide might be involved. On the other hand, although further characterization is needed for confirmation, our evidence suggests the role of TRAF2 in the TNF-α signaling to SRE or JNK is minimal. For example, a dominant negative mutant of TRAF2 does not inhibit activation of either JNK or SRE in cells exposed to TNF α (data not shown). This finding is in contrast to previous reports (22Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar,24Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shyamala V. Williams L.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) in which TRAF2 was shown to be essential for TNF-α-induced JNK activation in lymphocytes, suggesting the function of TRAF2 differs in Rat-2 fibroblasts and lymphocytes. In any event, our present findings make us confident that PI 3-kinase is essential for mediating the nuclear signaling cascades triggered by TNF-α or ceramide, which is consistent with increasing evidence indicating that PI 3-kinase is activated by environmental stresses and growth factors (37Kimura K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We also found evidence for the role of Rac in TNF-α signaling to the nucleus, which is consistent with earlier findings demonstrating an essential role of Rac in the nuclear signaling by C2-ceramide, cytokines and environmental stresses (6Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 7Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A.

Thus, the present study shows that TNF-α stimulates c-fos SRE and JNK via a signaling cascade involving PI 3-kinase and Rac. Although precise determination of the mechanisms of action of PI 3-kinase and Rac will require further study, we postulate a hierarchical relationship among these proteins (TNF-α → PI 3-kinase → Rac), whereby Rac serves as a PI 3-kinase downstream molecule in a TNF-α-triggered nuclear signaling pathway. Future studies elucidating the linkage between PI 3-kinase and Rac will likely be pivotal to a complete understanding of TNF-α-evoked intracellular signaling. We thank Dr. D.-M. Jue and Dr. A. Hall for providing recombinant human TNF-α and expression plasmids (pEXV, pEXV-RacV12, and pEXV-RhoV14), respectively. We also thank Dr. J. Downward for providing us pSG5-Δp85 plasmid."

We recently demonstrated a close correlation between phosphorylation of Ser5 in L-plastin (LPL), a leukocyte-specific 67-kDa actin bundling protein, and activation of αMβ2-mediated adhesion in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) (Jones, S. L., Wang, J., Turck, C. W., and Brown, E. J. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 9331–9336). However, the kinase that phosphorylates LPL Ser5 has not been identified. We found that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), but not a variety of other serine kinases, can specifically phosphorylate LPL and LPL-derived peptides on Ser5 in vitro. The cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin both induce LPL phosphorylation in cells. Two PKA inhibitors, H89 and KT5720, inhibited immune complex (IC)-stimulated LPL phosphorylation as well as IC-induced activation of αMβ2-mediated adhesion in PMN. The dose response of H89 inhibition of PMN adhesion correlated with its inhibition of LPL phosphorylation in response to IC. IC stimulation also transiently increased intracellular cAMP concentration in PMN. Thus, PKA functions in an integrin activation pathway initiated by IC binding to Fcγ receptors in addition to its better known role as a negative regulator of cell activation by G protein-coupled receptors. In contrast, LPL Ser5 phosphorylation and PMN adhesion induced by formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine or phorbol myristate acetate were not affected by PKA inhibitors, suggesting that a different kinase(s) is responsible for LPL phosphorylation in response to these agonists. Phosphoinositidyl 3-kinase also is required for FcγR but not formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine- or phorbol myristate acetate-induced LPL phosphorylation and activation of αMβ2. Two phosphoinositidyl 3-kinase inhibitors blocked FcγR-induced cAMP accumulation, demonstrating that this kinase acts upstream of PKA. These data demonstrate a necessary role for PKA in IC-induced integrin activation and LPL phosphorylation.

While circulating in blood or lymph, leukocytes maintain their integrins in a low adhesive state. In contrast, when leukocytes migrate out of the vasculature, their integrins have higher avidity, allowing them to participate in the processes of extravasation and migration through extracellular matrix. This regulation of integrin adhesion is essential for appropriate leukocyte function, since integrin activation is required for leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation and for lymphocyte recirculation through lymph nodes, but inappropriate activation leads to significant injury of normal tissues (1Larson R.S.

Many molecules specifically found at inflammatory sites or in lymph nodes can induce the transition of integrins from low to high avidity, and exposure to these molecules provides the stimulus both for transendothelial migration and for migration through the extracellular matrix to sites of infection and inflammation (3Brown E.J.

Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) all can have a role in leukocyte integrin activation. In addition, there is evidence for involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in regulation of integrin avidity (9Kucik D.F. Dustin M.L. Miller J.M. Brown E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 97: 2139-2144Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Lub M. van Kooyk Y. van Vliet S. Figdor C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that cell-permeant peptides from the leukocyte-specific actin bundling protein L-plastin (LPL) will activate myeloid β2 integrins (15Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These studies showed that LPL phosphorylation is closely associated with integrin activation and led to the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a necessary step for integrin activation by many proinflammatory agents. This hypothesis has focused attention on the unknown enzyme(s) that phosphorylate LPL.A well studied mechanism for leukocyte integrin activation is exposure to immune complexes (IC). IC binding to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) IgG Fc receptors (FcγR), especially FcγRIIA, induces integrin activation via a PI 3-kinase and PKC-dependent pathway, which is closely associated with LPL phosphorylation (12Jones S.L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). IC-induced activation of the leukocyte-specific integrin αMβ2 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18) is required both for sustained adhesion to IC in vitro (12Jones S.L. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10556-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Graham I.L. Lefkowith J.B. Anderson D.C. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and for a normal IC-induced inflammatory response in vivo (17Tang T. Rosenkranz A. Assmann K.J.M. Goodman M.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. Carroll M.C. Cotran R.S. Mayadas T.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, IC-induced αMβ2 activation is probably a critical event in antibody-dependent host defense against infectious diseases as well as in idiopathic inflammatory diseases due to autoantibodies. In the current study, we have used this model for integrin activation to examine the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is an essential step in integrin activation. We show that the cAMP-dependent Ser/Thr kinase PKA phosphorylates LPL in vitro on Ser5, the site of in vivo phosphorylation, and that IC-induced LPL phosphorylation requires PKA. Inhibition of PKA blocks sustained PMN adhesion to IC because αMβ2 activation is prevented. These data not only support the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a step in leukocyte integrin activation but also show a surprising and unexpected role in leukocyte activation for cAMP and PKA, generally considered to be potent endogenous inhibitors of activation. Finally, PKA is not required for LPL phosphorylation or integrin activation in response to formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Thus, there are at least two distinct signaling pathways and kinases that lead to integrin activation through LPL Ser5 phosphorylation.DISCUSSIONPrevious work using cell-permeant peptides from the amino terminus of LPL showed that these peptides were capable of inducing rapid integrin activation in PMN (15Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Integrin activation by these peptides required Ser5 and was prevented by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Surprisingly, integrin activation by a cell-permeant peptide in which Ser5 was phosphorylated was independent of PI 3-kinase, leading to the hypothesis that the well described role for PI 3-kinase in integrin activation (10Shimizu Y. Hunt S.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) results from its involvement in a pathway resulting in phosphorylation of Ser5 of LPL. These studies focused attention on the phosphorylation of LPL Ser5 as a potentially critical regulatory step in activation of PMN integrins. In the present work, we present data indicating that PKA can phosphorylate LPL and does so when PMN FcγRIIA is ligated. First, PKA phosphorylates both LPL and an LPL amino-terminal peptide in vitro. PKA phosphorylation occurs on Ser5, as determined by failure of phosphorylation of the S5A mutant peptide and by recognition of PKA-phosphorylated LPL by a phospho-Ser5-specific antibody. Second, agents that increase intracytoplasmic [cAMP], which activates PKA, induce LPL phosphorylation. Finally, two pharmacologic PKA inhibitors block IC-induced LPL phosphorylation in PMN. While the data in whole cells demonstrate only that PKA activation can lead to LPL phosphorylation, together with the demonstration of direct phosphorylation in vitro, these data support the hypothesis that PKA can directly phosphorylate LPL in cells. It is likely that other kinase(s) can phosphorylate LPL as well, since fMLP and PMA-induced phosphorylation are not antagonized by the same PKA inhibitors that block IC-induced phosphorylation. While these kinases are not known, PKC is not a likely candidate, since neither recombinant LPL nor the LPL amino-terminal peptide was phosphorylated by the PKC catalytic domain in vitro. The existence of distinct kinases that can phosphorylate LPL is consistent with previous data suggesting two distinct signaling pathways for both LPL phosphorylation and integrin activation (12Jones S.L. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10556-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,15Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a requisite step in PMN integrin activation suggests that interference with its phosphorylation should block activation-dependent integrin-mediated adhesion. Since PKA inhibitors blocked LPL phosphorylation by IC, we tested the effects of these inhibitors on αMβ2 integrin activation by examining sustained adhesion to IC. These inhibitors blocked IC-induced, αMβ2-dependent sustained adhesion of both human and murine PMN. The specificity of the effect was demonstrated by (i) failure of inhibitors of other serine kinases to affect αMβ2 activation; (ii) failure of the PKA inhibitors to affect the transient FcγR-mediated adhesion to IC that occurs in αMβ2-deficient PMN; and (iii) failure of the PKA inhibitors to block αMβ2-mediated adhesion induced by fMLP and PMA, which cause PKA-independent LPL phosphorylation. Thus, these data are further evidence for a close association between LPL phosphorylation and PMN integrin activation and support the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation (which occurs normally in αMβ2-deficient cells (25Jones S.L. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14623-14630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) is a required step in activation of αMβ2-mediated adhesion.A role for cAMP in phagocyte activation is quite unexpected. In general, increases in [cAMP] have been found to inhibit fMLP-stimulated PMN activation, as measured by adhesion or respiratory burst activation (30Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Biol.

However, FcγR-mediated accumulation of cAMP and of PKA at phagosomes has been noted previously (44Pryzwansky K.B. Steiner A.L. Spitznagel J.K. Kapoor C.L. Science. 1981; 211: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although this cAMP has been variously interpreted as part of the activation process (44Pryzwansky K.B. Steiner A.L. Spitznagel J.K. Kapoor C.L. Science. 1981; 211: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and a component of the regulation of phagocytosis (45Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A resolution of the apparent conflict between the well described negative regulatory role for cAMP in fMLP stimulation and its activating role in FcγR-mediated signaling may lie in the compartmentalization of cAMP in response to FcγR ligation. Localized increases in cAMP may be prevented from propagating through the cytoplasm by the colocalization of phosphodiesterase (45Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and it is of note that in the present study increases in cytosolic [cAMP] on adhesion to IC could only be detected in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Pharmacologic increases in cAMP or increases that occur because of ligation of receptors (28Cronstein B.N. Haines K.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) at a distance from the adhesion site may activate quite different processes than cAMP confined to the region of FcγR ligation, because of access to different downstream signaling pathways. In this regard, it is potentially interesting that LPL is phosphorylated by 8-bromo-cAMP addition in PMN only at very high concentrations, consistent with the possibility of divergent effects of this mediator on the different pathways leading to LPL phosphorylation. Nonetheless, LPL phosphorylation by high concentration 8-Br-cAMP in the absence of αMβ2 activation suggests that LPL phosphorylation is not sufficient for integrin activation.Finally, our data suggest that PI 3-kinase is involved in an FcγR-initiated pathway to PKA activation, since wortmannin and LY294002 both block PKA-mediated LPL phosphorylation in PMN and FcγR-induced increase in [cAMP]. Activation of PI 3-kinase by PMN FcγR ligation is well described (46Vossebeld P.J. Homburg C.H. Schweizer R.C. Ibarrola I. Kessler J. Koenderman L. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Biochem.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that PI 3-kinase inhibitors block FcγR-induced cAMP accumulation, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the role for PI 3-kinase is upstream of PKA activation in IC-induced integrin activation. While this could theoretically be either through regulation of adenylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase activity, the PI 3-kinase inhibitors blocked cAMP accumulation when phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited by isobutylmethylxanthine, strongly implicating PI 3-kinase in activation of adenylate cyclase. While the signaling pathway responsible for this regulation is unknown, there is evidence that the state of assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, which can be regulated by PI 3-kinase, affects adenylate cyclase activity in S49 cells (49Watson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6569-6575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in yeast (50Freeman N.L. Lila T. Mintzer K.A. Chen Z. Pahk A.J. Ren R. Drubin D.G. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 51Lila T. Drubin D.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is intriguing as well that an adenylate cyclase regulatory protein in Dictyostelium contains a pleckstrin homology domain (52Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), since these domains often bind inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the product of PI 3-kinase activity. Whatever the precise mechanism, these studies have identified adenylate cyclase as a physiologically significant downstream target of PI 3-kinase after its activation by FcγR ligation.In summary, this work has two significant implications for understanding the biochemical pathways that lead to PMN integrin activation. First, these studies identify a PKA-dependent activation pathway initiated by IC. Although PKA has generally been thought to negatively regulate PMN activation, most of these studies have been done primarily with fMLP-induced activation, and the current data are completely compatible with the previously observed divergence between IC- and fMLP-induced PMN activation (12Jones S.L. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10556-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IC-initiated PKA activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase via its regulation of adenylate cyclase, a novel pathway for regulation of cytoplasmic [cAMP].Second, these data support the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a requisite step in PMN integrin activation. PKA inhibitors block IC-induced integrin activation but not fMLP- or PMA-induced activation, which is in perfect accord with their effects on LPL phosphorylation. Since PKA was identified as a candidate for involvement in integrin activation because of its ability to phosphorylate LPL in vitro, these data strongly support the involvement of LPL phosphorylation in integrin activation. While additional methods of approach will be required to define the mechanism by which LPL phosphorylation affects integrin function, it is highly likely that this is a significant regulatory step in the regulation of leukocyte integrin avidity. Leukocyte integrins are able to modulate avidity for their ligands. While circulating in blood or lymph, leukocytes maintain their integrins in a low adhesive state. In contrast, when leukocytes migrate out of the vasculature, their integrins have higher avidity, allowing them to participate in the processes of extravasation and migration through extracellular matrix. This regulation of integrin adhesion is essential for appropriate leukocyte function, since integrin activation is required for leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation and for lymphocyte recirculation through lymph nodes, but inappropriate activation leads to significant injury of normal tissues (1Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Many molecules specifically found at inflammatory sites or in lymph nodes can induce the transition of integrins from low to high avidity, and exposure to these molecules provides the stimulus both for transendothelial migration and for migration through the extracellular matrix to sites of infection and inflammation (3Brown E.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These studies showed that LPL phosphorylation is closely associated with integrin activation and led to the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a necessary step for integrin activation by many proinflammatory agents. This hypothesis has focused attention on the unknown enzyme(s) that phosphorylate LPL. A well studied mechanism for leukocyte integrin activation is exposure to immune complexes (IC). IC binding to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) IgG Fc receptors (FcγR), especially FcγRIIA, induces integrin activation via a PI 3-kinase and PKC-dependent pathway, which is closely associated with LPL phosphorylation (12Jones S.L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). IC-induced activation of the leukocyte-specific integrin αMβ2 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18) is required both for sustained adhesion to IC in vitro (12Jones S.L. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and for a normal IC-induced inflammatory response in vivo (17Tang T. Rosenkranz A. Assmann K.J.M. Goodman M.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.-C. Carroll M.C. Cotran R.S. Mayadas T.N. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, IC-induced αMβ2 activation is probably a critical event in antibody-dependent host defense against infectious diseases as well as in idiopathic inflammatory diseases due to autoantibodies. In the current study, we have used this model for integrin activation to examine the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is an essential step in integrin activation. We show that the cAMP-dependent Ser/Thr kinase PKA phosphorylates LPL in vitro on Ser5, the site of in vivo phosphorylation, and that IC-induced LPL phosphorylation requires PKA. Inhibition of PKA blocks sustained PMN adhesion to IC because αMβ2 activation is prevented. These data not only support the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a step in leukocyte integrin activation but also show a surprising and unexpected role in leukocyte activation for cAMP and PKA, generally considered to be potent endogenous inhibitors of activation. Finally, PKA is not required for LPL phosphorylation or integrin activation in response to formylmethionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Thus, there are at least two distinct signaling pathways and kinases that lead to integrin activation through LPL Ser5 phosphorylation. DISCUSSIONPrevious work using cell-permeant peptides from the amino terminus of LPL showed that these peptides were capable of inducing rapid integrin activation in PMN (15Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Integrin activation by these peptides required Ser5 and was prevented by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Surprisingly, integrin activation by a cell-permeant peptide in which Ser5 was phosphorylated was independent of PI 3-kinase, leading to the hypothesis that the well described role for PI 3-kinase in integrin activation (10Shimizu Y. Hunt S.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) results from its involvement in a pathway resulting in phosphorylation of Ser5 of LPL. These studies focused attention on the phosphorylation of LPL Ser5 as a potentially critical regulatory step in activation of PMN integrins. In the present work, we present data indicating that PKA can phosphorylate LPL and does so when PMN FcγRIIA is ligated. First, PKA phosphorylates both LPL and an LPL amino-terminal peptide in vitro. PKA phosphorylation occurs on Ser5, as determined by failure of phosphorylation of the S5A mutant peptide and by recognition of PKA-phosphorylated LPL by a phospho-Ser5-specific antibody. Second, agents that increase intracytoplasmic [cAMP], which activates PKA, induce LPL phosphorylation. Finally, two pharmacologic PKA inhibitors block IC-induced LPL phosphorylation in PMN. While the data in whole cells demonstrate only that PKA activation can lead to LPL phosphorylation, together with the demonstration of direct phosphorylation in vitro, these data support the hypothesis that PKA can directly phosphorylate LPL in cells. It is likely that other kinase(s) can phosphorylate LPL as well, since fMLP and PMA-induced phosphorylation are not antagonized by the same PKA inhibitors that block IC-induced phosphorylation. While these kinases are not known, PKC is not a likely candidate, since neither recombinant LPL nor the LPL amino-terminal peptide was phosphorylated by the PKC catalytic domain in vitro. The existence of distinct kinases that can phosphorylate LPL is consistent with previous data suggesting two distinct signaling pathways for both LPL phosphorylation and integrin activation (12Jones S.L. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10556-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,15Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a requisite step in PMN integrin activation suggests that interference with its phosphorylation should block activation-dependent integrin-mediated adhesion. Since PKA inhibitors blocked LPL phosphorylation by IC, we tested the effects of these inhibitors on αMβ2 integrin activation by examining sustained adhesion to IC. These inhibitors blocked IC-induced, αMβ2-dependent sustained adhesion of both human and murine PMN. The specificity of the effect was demonstrated by (i) failure of inhibitors of other serine kinases to affect αMβ2 activation; (ii) failure of the PKA inhibitors to affect the transient FcγR-mediated adhesion to IC that occurs in αMβ2-deficient PMN; and (iii) failure of the PKA inhibitors to block αMβ2-mediated adhesion induced by fMLP and PMA, which cause PKA-independent LPL phosphorylation. Thus, these data are further evidence for a close association between LPL phosphorylation and PMN integrin activation and support the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation (which occurs normally in αMβ2-deficient cells (25Jones S.L. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14623-14630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)) is a required step in activation of αMβ2-mediated adhesion.A role for cAMP in phagocyte activation is quite unexpected. In general, increases in [cAMP] have been found to inhibit fMLP-stimulated PMN activation, as measured by adhesion or respiratory burst activation (30Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24141-24144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 36Bengis-Garber C. Gruener N.

However, FcγR-mediated accumulation of cAMP and of PKA at phagosomes has been noted previously (44Pryzwansky K.B. Steiner A.L. Spitznagel J.K. Kapoor C.L. Science. 1981; 211: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although this cAMP has been variously interpreted as part of the activation process (44Pryzwansky K.B. Steiner A.L. Spitznagel J.K. Kapoor C.L. Science. 1981; 211: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and a component of the regulation of phagocytosis (45Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A resolution of the apparent conflict between the well described negative regulatory role for cAMP in fMLP stimulation and its activating role in FcγR-mediated signaling may lie in the compartmentalization of cAMP in response to FcγR ligation. Localized increases in cAMP may be prevented from propagating through the cytoplasm by the colocalization of phosphodiesterase (45Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Merricks E.P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and it is of note that in the present study increases in cytosolic [cAMP] on adhesion to IC could only be detected in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Pharmacologic increases in cAMP or increases that occur because of ligation of receptors (28Cronstein B.N. Haines K.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) at a distance from the adhesion site may activate quite different processes than cAMP confined to the region of FcγR ligation, because of access to different downstream signaling pathways. In this regard, it is potentially interesting that LPL is phosphorylated by 8-bromo-cAMP addition in PMN only at very high concentrations, consistent with the possibility of divergent effects of this mediator on the different pathways leading to LPL phosphorylation. Nonetheless, LPL phosphorylation by high concentration 8-Br-cAMP in the absence of αMβ2 activation suggests that LPL phosphorylation is not sufficient for integrin activation.Finally, our data suggest that PI 3-kinase is involved in an FcγR-initiated pathway to PKA activation, since wortmannin and LY294002 both block PKA-mediated LPL phosphorylation in PMN and FcγR-induced increase in [cAMP]. Activation of PI 3-kinase by PMN FcγR ligation is well described (46Vossebeld P.J. Homburg C.H. Schweizer R.C. Ibarrola I. Kessler J. Koenderman L. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Biochem.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that PI 3-kinase inhibitors block FcγR-induced cAMP accumulation, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the role for PI 3-kinase is upstream of PKA activation in IC-induced integrin activation. While this could theoretically be either through regulation of adenylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase activity, the PI 3-kinase inhibitors blocked cAMP accumulation when phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited by isobutylmethylxanthine, strongly implicating PI 3-kinase in activation of adenylate cyclase. While the signaling pathway responsible for this regulation is unknown, there is evidence that the state of assembly of the actin cytoskeleton, which can be regulated by PI 3-kinase, affects adenylate cyclase activity in S49 cells (49Watson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6569-6575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in yeast (50Freeman N.L. Lila T. Mintzer K.A. Chen Z. Pahk A.J. Ren R. Drubin D.G. Field J. Mol. Cell.

It is intriguing as well that an adenylate cyclase regulatory protein in Dictyostelium contains a pleckstrin homology domain (52Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), since these domains often bind inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, the product of PI 3-kinase activity. Whatever the precise mechanism, these studies have identified adenylate cyclase as a physiologically significant downstream target of PI 3-kinase after its activation by FcγR ligation.In summary, this work has two significant implications for understanding the biochemical pathways that lead to PMN integrin activation. First, these studies identify a PKA-dependent activation pathway initiated by IC. Although PKA has generally been thought to negatively regulate PMN activation, most of these studies have been done primarily with fMLP-induced activation, and the current data are completely compatible with the previously observed divergence between IC- and fMLP-induced PMN activation (12Jones S.L. Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10556-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IC-initiated PKA activation is dependent on PI 3-kinase via its regulation of adenylate cyclase, a novel pathway for regulation of cytoplasmic [cAMP].Second, these data support the hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a requisite step in PMN integrin activation. PKA inhibitors block IC-induced integrin activation but not fMLP- or PMA-induced activation, which is in perfect accord with their effects on LPL phosphorylation. Since PKA was identified as a candidate for involvement in integrin activation because of its ability to phosphorylate LPL in vitro, these data strongly support the involvement of LPL phosphorylation in integrin activation. While additional methods of approach will be required to define the mechanism by which LPL phosphorylation affects integrin function, it is highly likely that this is a significant regulatory step in the regulation of leukocyte integrin avidity. Previous work using cell-permeant peptides from the amino terminus of LPL showed that these peptides were capable of inducing rapid integrin activation in PMN (15Jones S.L. Wang J. Turck C.W. Brown E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Integrin activation by these peptides required Ser5 and was prevented by PI 3-kinase inhibitors. Surprisingly, integrin activation by a cell-permeant peptide in which Ser5 was phosphorylated was independent of PI 3-kinase, leading to the hypothesis that the well described role for PI 3-kinase in integrin activation (10Shimizu Y. Hunt S.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) results from its involvement in a pathway resulting in phosphorylation of Ser5 of LPL.

The hypothesis that LPL phosphorylation is a requisite step in PMN integrin activation suggests that interference with its phosphorylation should block activation-dependent integrin-mediated adhesion. Since PKA inhibitors blocked LPL phosphorylation by IC, we tested the effects of these inhibitors on αMβ2 integrin activation by examining sustained adhesion to IC.

However, cleavage always occurred carboxyl to the most COOH-terminal basic residue.Vmax/Km was insensitive to P2 and P3 residues except that Pro at P2 blocked cleavage entirely. These results suggest that yapsin 2 is a monobasic amino acid-specific protease that requires a basic residue at P1 and excludes basic residues from P1′. The pH dependence of Vmax/Km for a substrate containing a pro-α factor cleavage site was bell-shaped, with a maximum near pH 4.0. However, Vmax/Km for a substrate mimicking the α-secretase site in human β amyloid precursor protein was optimal near pH 6.0, consistent with cleavage of β amyloid precursor protein by yapsin 2 when expressed in yeast. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPS2 (formerly MKC7) gene product is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked aspartyl protease that functions as a yeast secretase. Here, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked form of yapsin 2 (Mkc7p) was purified to homogeneity from the membrane fraction of an overexpressing yeast strain. Purified yapsin 2 migrated diffusely in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (molecular mass ∼ 200 kDa), suggesting extensive, heterogeneous glycosylation.

Genes encoding two homologous membrane-associated aspartyl proteases have been isolated as multicopy suppressors of kex2 null mutant phenotypes. The MKC7 gene, now termed YPS2, 1Saccharomyces Genome Data base. was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the cold sensitivity of kex2 mutants (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). YAP3, now termed YPS1,1 was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the kex2 defect in pro-α factor processing (6Egel-Mitani M. Flygenring H.P. Hansen M.T. Yeast. 1990; 6: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).YPS1 was also identified as a multicopy suppressor of mutations that blocked processing in yeast of anglerfish prosomatostatin at a single Arg-type cleavage site (7Bourbonnais Y. Ash J. Daigle M. Thomas D.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). YPS1 and YPS2 encode aspartyl proteases, yapsin 1 and yapsin 2, that are structurally and functionally similar to each other and are associated with the membrane through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)2 anchors (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Ash J. Dominguez M. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol.

Interestingly, disruptions of the KEX2, YPS1, and YPS2 genes resulted in synergistic effects on cell growth at low and high temperatures, suggesting partial overlap in the specificity and/or physiological function of these three enzymes (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Yapsin 1 has been shown to cleave at clusters of basic amino acid residues in vitro, indicating that the enzyme has specificity for basic amino acid residues (9Cawley N.X. Chen H.-C. Beinfeld M.C.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and a structural model suggests that the enzyme may interact with substrates residues from P6 to P6′ (11Olsen V. Guruprasad K. Cawley N.X. Chen H.-C. Blundell T.L. Loh Y.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2768-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 3Residues surrounding the cleavage site are designated Px-P3-P2-P1-P1′-P2′-P3′-PYwith the scissile bond between residues P1 and P1′ (39Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar). However, studies of the specificity of these aspartyl proteases have yet to be carried out with systematic sets of model substrates. Recently, we demonstrated that the majority of yapsin 1 and yapsin 2 activity is located at the cell surface (12Komano H. Seeger M. Gandy S. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31648-31651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and we and others have shown that these enzymes are required for cleavage of the Alzheimer's disease-related human β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) at the α-secretase cleavage site when βAPP is expressed in yeast (12Komano H.

The identification of additional genes homologous to YPS1 and YPS2 in the S. cerevisiae genome1suggests the existence of a family of GPI-anchored, cell surface aspartyl proteases that function as “secretase” or “sheddase” activities in yeast (see Ref. 16Ehlers M.R.W. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10068-10074Google Scholar for review of such activities). Just as Kex2 protease was the prototype for a family of homologous mammalian proprotein processing enzymes (4Fuller R.S. Brake A.J. Thorner J. Science. 1989; 246: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17Rouillé Y. Duguay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva Jr., A.A. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), yapsin 1 and yapsin 2 are potential prototypes of a family of eukaryotic secretase enzymes distinct from TACE and related metalloproteases (18Black R.A.

Willard D. Becherer D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Here we report the purification and characterization of yapsin 2. Experiments using a series of internally quenched fluorogenic peptide substrates (IQ substrates) show that yapsin 2 cleaves carboxyl to single basic amino acid residues (Lys or Arg). In substrates with doublets and triplets of basic residues, the enzyme cleaves carboxyl to the most COOH-terminal basic residue. These results indicate specificity for a basic residue at P1, but discrimination against basic residues at the P1′ position. This specificity explains how overexpression of this monobasic-specific enzyme can suppress the loss of the dibasic-specific enzyme, Kex2p. The pH profile of yapsin 2 activity showed a marked substrate dependence, suggesting that the enzyme may have significant activity at near neutral pH on certain substrates. Liquid synthetic complete minus uracil was as described (20Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Strain HKY26 (CRY2 yps1Δ::LEU2, yps2 Δ::HIS3, pep4 Δ::HIS3, prb1 Δ::LEU2) was as described (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). CRY2 is MATα, can1–100, ade2-1, his3–11,-15, leu2-3,-112, trp1-1, ura3-1 (21Wilcox C.A. Fuller R.S.

Chelating Sepharose 6B was charged with Cu2+ by passing a solution of 25 mmCuSO4 through the column. IQ substrates were synthesized as described (22Matayoshi E.D. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Erickson J.

Oligonucleotides were from Operon Technologies, Inc. DNA manipulations followed standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For overexpression of YPS2, a fragment containing the YPS2 structural gene (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was placed under control of the TDH3 promoter by insertion into the multicopy (2 μm) vector pG5 (26Gluschankof P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 2: 1791-1794Google Scholar). A Bgl II site was introduced upstream of the Hin dIII site and an Xho I site was introduced downstream of the Apa I site in YPS2 by the polymerase chain reaction (primer sequences were 5′ to 3′: GGAAGATCTAAGCTTTTGTCGTTATTCGC and GGAAGATCTCGAGGGCCCAGTACCGTTGGCAA). The product of this reaction was subcloned into pBS SK(−) (Stratagene) with a Bgl II linker inserted at the Sma I site in the polylinker. In the resulting plasmid, the Hin dIII-Apa I fragment was replaced with the corresponding fragment from the original YPS2 clone. The resulting plasmid was digested with Bgl II and Xho I and the YPS2 fragment ligated to pG5 which had been cut with Bgl II and Sal I, placing the YPS2 structural gene under control of the TDH3 promoter. This final expression plasmid was called pG-MKC7. Yapsin 2 proteolytic activity was assayed as described (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 100 mmsodium citrate (pH 4.0), 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 20 μm IQ substrate 2: Arg-Glu(EDANS)-Ser-Leu-Asp-Lys-Arg-Glu-Ala-Glu-Ala-Lys(DABCYL)-Arg. After enzyme addition, reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by adding 680 μl of 1 m Tris base (pH 10). Fluorescence was determined using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B fluorimeter (λex 338 nm; λem 490 nm). 1 unit of activity was defined as an increase in fluorescence per min equivalent to that of 1 pmol of Glu(EDANS). Strain HKY26 containing plasmid pG-MKC7 was grown to a density of 6 × 107 cells/ml in 3 liters of synthetic complete minus uracil. Cells were harvested and washed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g. 15 ml of packed cells were resuspended with 24 ml of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm TPCK, 0.1 mm TLCK, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride), mixed with 15 ml of glass beads (0.5 mm), and broken by vortexing 60 × 20 s at 4 °C (all subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C). Broken cells were centrifuged for 3 min at 500 × g to remove cell debris (clear lysate). The supernatant fraction was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl by recentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet (crude membrane fraction) was solubilized in 50 ml of Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was back-extracted with 30 ml of Buffer A and the two supernatant fractions were pooled (solubilized membrane fraction) and used for further purification. The solubilized membrane fraction was applied to a 40-ml (3 × 8 cm) Fast Flow Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer B1 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). The column was washed with 2 column volumes of Buffer B1 and 8 column volumes of Buffer B2 (Buffer B1 minus EDTA) and eluted with 200 ml of Buffer C (Buffer B2 plus 0.2m NaCl). 2 μl of each fraction (10 ml) were diluted 10-fold and assayed, and fractions containing activity were pooled. The pool was adjusted to a final pH of 7.5 and a final concentration of 0.3m NaCl by adding one-half volume of 50 mm HEPES (pH 9.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Cu2+-charged chelating Sepharose column (1.8 × 6 cm) equilibrated with Buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl), washed with 50 ml of buffer D and 50 ml of Buffer E (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.7% CHAPS, 0.3 m NaCl), and eluted with 50 ml of Buffer F (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.7% CHAPS, 0.3 mNaCl). 2 μl of each fraction (2.5 ml) were diluted 10-fold and assayed. Fractions containing activity were pooled (∼30 ml) and concentrated with a Centriprep-100 cartridge (Amicon, Inc.) to a final volume of ∼400 μl. The concentrated sample was split in half, and each half was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 (1 × 49 cm) gel filtration column equilibrated with Buffer E. 2 μl of each fraction (860 μl) were diluted 10-fold and assayed. Fractions containing activity (see legend to Fig. 2 B) were pooled and concentrated using a Centriprep-100 cartridge to produce the final fraction. Protein was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Yapsin 2 (8.7 μg, 120 pmol) was cleaved by overnight incubation in the dark at room temperature in 70% formic acid containing 1% CNBr, and subjected to 10–20% Tricine gradient gel electrophoresis. After electroblotting to ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems), one of two major bands was subjected to automated Edman degradation by the Protein and Carbohydrate Core Facility at the University of Michigan. 0.04 μg/ml yapsin 2 and 200 ∼ 400 pmol of IQ substrate were mixed and incubated in standard reaction buffer for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 n NaOH and subjected to automated Edman degradation by the Protein and Carbohydrate Core Facility at the University of Michigan. Vmax/Km was determined using pseudo-first order kinetics. At substrate concentrations much lower than Km, product formation follows a simple first order curve (28Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 98-106Google Scholar). Reactions (600 μl) were started by addition of yapsin 2 (final concentration, 0.02 to 1 μg/ml). 100-μl samples taken at times between 0 and 40 min were quenched with 600 μl of 1m Tris-HCl (pH 10). Raw fluorescence data were fitted to an exponential curve with floating end points using Kaleidagraph version 3.0. Substrate concentrations were between 1 and 2 μm. All progress curves had r > 0.99 (Pearson's r value). The pH dependence of Vmax/Kmwas measured in reaction buffer containing 20% sucrose, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.007% CHAPS to prevent the loss of the activity during incubation at each pH (see “Results”). Theoretical curves for bell-shaped pH Vmax/Km profiles were calculated by nonlinear regression using Kaleidagraph as previously published (29Polgar L. Szeltner Z. Boros I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9351-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Yapsin 2 was purified from an overexpressing strain lacking the YPS1 gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). The major proteolytic activity (70% of total activity) was recovered in the membrane fraction (100,000 ×g pellet) and solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Detergent extraction resulted in approximately 10-fold purification relative to the cleared lysate (data not shown). Further purification of yapsin 2 from the solubilized membrane fraction is described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” Although pepstatin A affinity column chromatography has been used to purify several aspartyl proteases, including yapsin 1 (30Azuma T. Pals S. Mohandas T.K. Courvreur J.M. Taggart R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16748-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Azaryan A.V. Wong M. Friedman T.C. Cawley N.X. Estivariz F.E. Chen H.C. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11968-11975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), less than 10% of yapsin 2 activity bound to the column and the yield of enzyme activity upon elution was extremely low. Therefore, we purified yapsin 2 using conventional column chromatography. Following anion exchange separation on Q-Sepharose, step elution from Cu2+-charged chelating Sepharose resulted in a major, diffuse band migrating at ∼200 kDa that was visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A, lane 4) and coincided with the peak of activity (data not shown). Note that although equal amounts of activity (105 units, equivalent to 6 μg of yapsin 2) were loaded in lanes 2 (detergent-solubilized membranes), 3 (Q-Sepharose pool), and 4 (chelating Sepharose 6B peak) in Fig. 1 A, the heterogeneity and diffuse migration of the yapsin 2 protein prevented the band from being obvious until elution from Q-Sepharose. The chelating Sepharose 6B peak was subjected to Sepharose S-300 gel filtration (Fig. 1 A, lane 5), and the peak of yapsin 2 activity coincided with the appearance of this diffuse band which was separated from other, lower molecular weight polypeptides that eluted later (Fig. 2, A and B). The peak fractions were pooled to avoid the lower molecular weight polypeptides and the pooled enzyme was subjected to both SDS-7.5% PAGE and SDS-15% PAGE (Fig. 1, A, lane 5, and B). The protein with ∼200 kDa molecular mass in the pooled fraction was judged to be >90% pure by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1 A, lane 5, and B). As NH2-terminal sequence of this polypeptide could not be detected, we determined the sequence of a fragment generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage. The sequence obtained corresponded to yapsin 2 residues 269–275 after Met268 (data not shown) (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the purified polypeptide migrating diffusely at ∼200 kDa was encoded by the YPS2 gene. 450 μg of yapsin 2 protein were obtained from 120 ml of Triton X-100-solubilized membranes, representing a lysate of 20 ml of packed cells from a 4-liter culture (see “Experimental Procedures”). The final specific activity was 2 × 107 units/mg, corresponding to a 22-fold purification from the Triton X-100-solubilized membranes of the overexpressing strain (Table I), and equivalent to approximately 200-fold purification from the initial cell lysate with an overall yield of 9.9% (data not shown). Consideration of the fact that yapsin 2 activity is already overexpressed approximately 150–300-fold in HKY26[pG-MKC7] (12Komano H. Seeger M. Gandy S. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol.

Yapsin 2 contains two potential catalytic aspartic amino acids found in aspartyl proteases (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In aspartyl proteases, titration of these residues is responsible for the bell-shaped pH dependence of the specificity constant (kcat/Km or Vmax/Km) exhibited by aspartyl proteases (29Polgar L. Szeltner Z. Boros I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9351-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1985: 422-426Google Scholar). Aspartyl proteases are also characterized by sensitivity to pepstatin A (32Davies D.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 189-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether purified yapsin 2 exhibited the characteristic pH dependence and pepstatin A sensitivity of aspartyl proteases. Prior to examining the pH dependence of the proteolytic activity, we assessed the effect of pH on yapsin 2 stability. Yapsin 2 lost activity rapidly at pH values >5 or <4 during incubation at 37 °C. The t12 values for loss of activity at 37 °C were 2 min at pH 6.0, 1.5 min at pH 7.0, 1.2 min at pH 8.0, and 4 min at pH 3 (data not shown). Addition of 20% sucrose and 10 mmCaCl2 prevented this loss of activity during incubation at 37 °C. Under these conditions, no loss of activity was observed at pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, or 7.0 during a 30-min incubation, although the enzyme still exhibited significant instability outside this pH range (t12 = 27 min at pH 3.5 and 15 min at pH 8.0, data not shown). The pH dependence of Vmax/Km was measured under the conditions and over a pH range in which yapsin 2 was stable (Fig.3). Yapsin 2 exhibited a bell-shaped pH response with an acidic pH optimum similar to that of other aspartyl proteases when IQ substrate 2, with the sequence SLDKREAEA, was used (Fig. 3 A). Data were fitted to an equation for a bell-shaped curve using nonlinear regression, resulting in p Kavalues of 3.8 and 4.3 for the two ionizing groups with a pH optimum at approximately 4.0. A radically different pH dependence of Vmax/Km was observed when IQ substrate 21 was used (Fig. 3 B). This substrate, with the sequence HHQKLVF, corresponds to the sequence of the α-secretase site in human βAPP (22Matayoshi E.D. Wang G.T. Krafft G.A. Erickson J.

Additionally, the pH dependence observed with this substrate may be more complicated than a simple bell-shaped curve generated by two ionizable groups, because the data diverged from the model at high pH. Cleavage of substrate 21 by purified yapsin 2 was inhibited by high concentrations of pepstatin A at pH 6.0. Therefore, efficient cleavage of the α-secretase substrate at high pH is likely to depend on yapsin 2 and not on some contaminating protease in the preparation. Furthermore, substrate 21 was actually a better substrate than substrate 2 at pH 6.0, indicating that yapsin 2 does not simply assume a partially active, nonspecific conformation at this pH. Instead, the optimal pH for cleavage by yapsin 2 was highly sensitive to substrate sequence in addition to the ionization state of the two catalytic aspartic acids, an observation also made with human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease and certain substrates (29Polgar L. Szeltner Z. Boros I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9351-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Pepstatin A inhibited yapsin 2 with a relatively high apparent Ki, 4.6 μm, that may reflect the preference of the enzyme for hydrophilic residues in substrate sequences (Fig. 4, see below). Leupeptin (Fig. 4), TLCK, TPCK, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and E64 (data not shown) did not inhibit yapsin 2 activity. Addition of EDTA, EGTA, Cu2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+ had no effect on the activity (data not shown), despite the fact that yapsin 2 bound to Cu2+-charged chelating Sepharose. The natural substrates of yapsin 2 and yapsin 1 are still unknown. However, overexpression of either YPS1 or YPS2 suppressed the sterility of a kex2 null mutant (5Komano H. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10752-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Egel-Mitani M. Flygenring H.P. Hansen M.T. Yeast. 1990; 6: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that these enzymes can cleave pro-α factor at the Kex2 cleavage sites. In addition, combined deletion of the YPS1 and YPS2 genes blocked cleavage of human βAPP at the α-secretase site, suggesting that human βAPP is a substrate of yapsin 2 (12Komano H. Seeger M. Gandy S.

A mutation altering only two nucleotides of the ETS consensus sequence present at −12 (GGAA to TTAA) has a similar effect. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that a set of specific complexes between nuclear factors and the PS1 promoter are eliminated by this point mutation, as well as by competition with an ETS consensus oligonucleotide. Competition experiments in DNase I footprinting correlated with electrophoretic mobility shift assays and showed that only one of several footprints over the PS1 promoter is eliminated by competition with an ETS consensus oligonucleotide. It extends from −14 to −6 and surrounds the ETS motif present at −12. Thus, a crucial ETS element is present at −12 and binds a protein(s) recognizing specifically the ETS consensus motif. At least one such complex is eliminated by preincubating the nuclear extract with an antibody with broad cross-reactivity with Ets-1 and Ets-2 proteins, thus confirming that an ETS transcription factor(s) recognizes the −12 motif. Several Sp1 binding motifs at positions −70, −55, and +20 surround this ETS element. Competition DNase I footprinting showed that Sp1-like nuclear factors recognize specifically these sites in both cell lines. Furthermore, a combination of 5′ and 3′ deletions indicated the presence of positive promoter elements between −96 and −35 as well as between +6 and +42. Thus, transfection and footprinting assays correlate to suggest that Sp1 transcription factor(s) bind at several sites upstream and downstream from the initiation site and activate the transcription of the PS1 promoter. Sequences downstream from the transcription initiation site also contain major control elements. 3′ deletions from +178 to +107 decreased promoter activity by 80%. However, further deletion to +42 increased promoter activity by 3–4-fold. Collectively, these data indicate that sequences upstream and downstream from the transcription start site each control over 80% of the promoter activity.

They may participate in protein sorting or trafficking, intercellular signaling, or cell death (7Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the high degree of homology between presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) and other similar proteins found widely conserved across species has contributed much of the present information on their possible function. Presenilins are homologous to SEL-12, a Caenorhabditis elegans protein that facilitates signaling by the Notch/LIN-12 transmembrane receptor and plays a crucial role in cell fate specification and during development (8Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 26: 225-232Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 9Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Presenilins and SEL-12 are transmembrane proteins with similar topology (6Li X. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). They are also functionally similar, since mutations in SEL-12 are efficiently rescued by human PS1 or PS2 (8Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E.

Increasing direct evidence indicates that presenilins also play a crucial role in mammalian embryonic development. Mice bearing a null mutation for PS1 die at birth and display central nervous system defects as well as vertebral skeletal malformations (12Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J.S. Thumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Sisodia S.S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 13Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F.

The requirement for PS1 during development implies a crucial importance for the control of PS1 gene expression. PS1 is widely expressed in a variety of tissues (14Sherrington R. Rogaev E. Liang Y.

Notably, in brain it is primarily found in neurons (15Kovacs D.M. Fausett H.J. Page K.J. Kim T.-W. Moir R.D. Meriam D.E. Hollister R.D. Hallmark O.G. Mancini R. Felsenstein K.M. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E.

Thus, regulation of PS1 level may play a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. This may also be suggested by the recent finding of two familial Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations causing premature termination of the PS1 protein due to frameshift (23Tysoe C. Whittaker J. Xuereb J. Cairns N.J. Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C. Wilcock G. Rubinsztein C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 70-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Together with the genomic organization of the human PS1 gene, a partial genomic sequence was recently reported including 700 bp of 5′-flanking sequences and the exons 1 and 2 (24Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Wu C. Levesque G. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Ikeda M. Holman K. Lin C. Lukiw W.J. De Jong P.J. Fraser P.E. Rommens J.M. St. George-Hyslop P. Genomics. 1997; 40: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To date, the promoter of the human PS1 gene has not been mapped, and the transcription factors by which it is regulated have not been identified. A recent analysis of the mouse PS1 promoter has indicated that it is expressed only in mouse neuronal cells, suggesting that the expression of the mouse PS1 gene is tissue-specific (25Mitsuda N. Roses A.D. Vitek M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23489-23497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the promoter activity of the flanking sequences and the first exon by deletion mapping and transient expression assay in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells as well as hepatoma HepG2 cells. We have identified a set of promoter elements, and we have begun to characterize the transcription factors with which they interact.DISCUSSIONThe promoter fragment extending from −118 to +178 from the initiation start site mapped in this report confers maximum promoter activity, comparable with that of SV40. Our data from primer extension and RNase protection, together with a previous report (24Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Wu C. Levesque G. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Ikeda M. Holman K. Lin C. Lukiw W.J. De Jong P.J. Fraser P.E. Rommens J.M. St. George-Hyslop P. Genomics. 1997; 40: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), indicate that we have identified the transcription start site most upstream. We cannot rule out other downstream sites (24Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Wu C. Levesque G. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Ikeda M. Holman K. Lin C. Lukiw W.J. De Jong P.J. Fraser P.E. Rommens J.M. St. George-Hyslop P. Genomics. 1997; 40: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, no mRNA with 5′-end downstream from +102 (t5) (24Rogaev E.I. Sherrington R. Wu C. Levesque G. Liang Y. Rogaeva E.A. Ikeda M. Holman K. Lin C. Lukiw W.J. De Jong P.J. Fraser P.E. Rommens J.M. St. George-Hyslop P. Genomics. 1997; 40: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) has been identified. Furthermore, 3′ deletions of sequences from +107 to +91 and +91 to +42 each increase promoter activity by 1.5–2-fold (data not shown). Thus transcription initiation downstream from +42 is unlikely. In addition, we did not detect any start site between +2 and +42 by primer extension and RNase protection (Fig. 1, B and C). Collectively, the data indicate that the +1 site identified in this study represents the major transcription start site for the human PS1 gene. The sequence over the (−118/+178) region contains 70% GC, and similarly to other GC-rich promoters (34Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 35Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar), PS1 does not contain a TATA box. Rather, it contains several GC boxes at positions −70, −40, and +20, which we have shown to bind Sp1-like proteins. Footprint competition assays have suggested that the most distal at −70 appears to constitute a stronger binding site, whereas sites at −40 and +20 are relatively weaker or bind a different Sp1-like factor. Indeed, the −70 GC box matches perfectly the consensus (G/T)GGGCGGRRY originally described (36Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tijian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 37Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tijian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), whereas the proximal box at −40 (GGGG A GGAGC) and that at +20 (CGGGCGGGGC) deviate from the consensus by one base (underlined). Notably, the most critical residues appear to be conserved within these two elements. Position 1, which deviates in the +20 element, is the least critical of the 10 residues. At the −40 site, A instead of C is present in position 5. This is likely to be a functional substitution, since A is found at this position in natural Sp1 element (37Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tijian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Thus, comparison of sequences of these three elements with the consensus is consistent with the −70 site being a stronger binding site as compared with sites at −40 and +20. This is also consistent with our footprint. We have begun to assess the function of these sites as discussed above. Single point mutations in each site and their combinations will test the function of individual sites and their interdependence or redundancy.The deletion of sequences from -22 to -6 affects promoter activity most significantly. This region contains a homology to binding motifs for ETS transcription factors (38Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 39Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and altering only the ETS consensus motif present at -12 from GGA to TT A results in a similar drastic decrease in promoter activity. This mutation also eliminates the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes detected by EMSA. The same complexes are abolished by competition with an ETS consensus oligonucleotide, and DNase I footprinting has shown that competition with the same oligonucleotide eliminates the binding of a protein to the −14 to −5 region. Collectively, these data indicate that an ETS protein(s) indeed recognizes the −12 motif and is required for the transcription of the PS1 gene. It will be interesting to determine which among ETS proteins are able to activate the PS1 gene in different cell types and in vivo. Comparison of the sequence at this site with that of different ETS sites reveals that it is most similar to that of Elk-1 binding sites2 and somewhat less similar to that of Ets-1. The oligonucleotide competitor used in Fig. 6 has been shown to bind Elk-1 and Ets-1 (33Shore P. Bisset L. Lakey J. Waltho J.P. Virden R. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5805-5811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Typically, the promoter context, including sequences flanking the consensus motif as well as protein-protein interactions with factors binding to adjacent sites, plays an essential part in determining the specificity of ETS factors for their natural target sites (38Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 39Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In SK-N-SK cells, at least one of the specific protein complexes appearing in EMSAs is affected by an antibody reacting with Ets-1/2, indicating that in SK-N-SH cells, the PS1 promoter binds an Ets-1/2 protein, probably Ets-2, which is present in larger amounts in the cell types examined. Whether Elk-1, which is present in relatively more reduced amounts, also interacts with the PS1 −12 element remains to be determined. Cotransfections of the PS1 gene with expression vectors encoding various ETS proteins should help to determine their relative ability to activate its transcription in different cell types. Recent studies in the adult brain in vivo have shown that Elk-1 is expressed throughout the brain and that it is localized exclusively to neurons (40Sgambato V. Pages C. Rogard M. Besson M.-J. Caboche J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8814-8825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the primary localization of PS1 in brain to neurons as well (20Johnston J.A. Froelich S. Lannfelt L. Cowburn R.F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Page K. Hollister R. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14020-14024Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Takami K. Terai K. Matsuo A. Walker D.G. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 1997; 74: 122-130Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Ets-1 and Ets-2 are widely expressed in different tissues and differentially regulated (41Bhat N.K. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. June C.H. Fujiwara S. Koizumi S. Fisher R.J. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 3723-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 42Maroulakou I.G. Papas T.S. Green J.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1551-1565PubMed Google Scholar). Ets-2 is present in high levels in adult brain, including in postmitotic neurons. Ets-1 is particularly abundant in the nervous system during specific developmental stages (42Maroulakou I.G. Papas T.S. Green J.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1551-1565PubMed Google Scholar). Thus in vivo, several ETS proteins could potentially be involved in the regulation of PS1 during central nervous system development or in the adult brain.The −12 motif is required to control over 90% of the expression of the PS1 gene. Notably, together with the +20 GC box, it is strictly conserved between the human and mouse sequences (25Mitsuda N. Roses A.D. Vitek M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23489-23497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sequences from −22 to +178, which confer 80% of promoter activity, coincide with the region of high homology with the mouse promoter, and the human +1 site is located only 6 nucleotides downstream from that of the mouse gene (25Mitsuda N. Roses A.D. Vitek M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23489-23497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This points out further the likely importance of this region for the function of the promoter in both species. By contrast, the two upstream GC boxes present in the human gene are not conserved in the mouse, and they do not appear to be active in the context of the entire promoter, including downstream sequences to +178.A recognition motif for p53 is present immediately downstream from the −12 Ets site. p53 has recently been shown to reduce the level of PS1 mRNA (43Roperch J-P. Alvaro V. Prier S. Tuynder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Gendron M.-C. Israeli D. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This down-regulation appears to be a primary effect of p53 expression, because it occurs within 2 h of p53 down-regulation. Considering the overlapping position of p53 and ETS sites and the requirement of ETS for PS1 transcription, it is plausible that p53 binding may simply compete ETS binding near the initiation site and inhibit transcription. This mechanism would be consistent with a primary effect. It would also constitute a new example of a TATA-less gene repressed by p53. Indeed, contrary to TATA-containing promoters, very few TATA-less promoters are inhibited by p53. Interestingly, Ets-1 and Ets-2 promoters are also repressed by p53 (44Iotsova V. Crepieux P. Montpellier C. Laudet V. Stehelin D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2331-2337PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, although p53 does not bind to DNA, it can be detected by antibodies within the protein-DNA complexes, indicating protein-protein interactions as a mechanism. If Ets-1 and Ets-2 indeed act on PS1, this would provide a secondary mechanism for the repression of PS1 by p53. p53 overexpression in normal neoplastic cells induces either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending on the cellular context (45Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 1: 1054-1072Crossref Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Notably, PS1 is also down-regulated by p21 and other cellular conditions, leading to apoptosis (43Roperch J-P. Alvaro V. Prier S. Tuynder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Gendron M.-C. Israeli D. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data have suggested that PS1 may have an antiapoptotic role. Indeed, PS mutations may predispose neurons to apoptosis (46Wolozin B. Iwasaki K. Vito P. Ganjei J.K. Lacana E.

It may also represent a key in pathways leading to cell differentiation or to cancer. Mutations within the presenilin (PS)1 genes lead to the most aggressive form of familial Alzheimer's disease and account for about 25% of early onset cases (1Lamb B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2Cruts M. Hendricks L. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Das H.K. Lal H. Front.

They may participate in protein sorting or trafficking, intercellular signaling, or cell death (7Haass C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 687-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the high degree of homology between presenilin-1 (PS1) and presenilin-2 (PS2) and other similar proteins found widely conserved across species has contributed much of the present information on their possible function. Presenilins are homologous to SEL-12, a Caenorhabditis elegans protein that facilitates signaling by the Notch/LIN-12 transmembrane receptor and plays a crucial role in cell fate specification and during development (8Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 26: 225-232Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 9Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Presenilins and SEL-12 are transmembrane proteins with similar topology (6Li X. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). They are also functionally similar, since mutations in SEL-12 are efficiently rescued by human PS1 or PS2 (8Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 26: 225-232Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 9Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), while several presenilin mutants identified as leading to disease in humans only result in partial rescue (10Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 11Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Constanze J. Grunberg J. Hass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Increasing direct evidence indicates that presenilins also play a crucial role in mammalian embryonic development. Mice bearing a null mutation for PS1 die at birth and display central nervous system defects as well as vertebral skeletal malformations (12Wong P.C. Zheng H. Chen H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J.S. Thumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Sisodia S.S. Nature. 1997; 387: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 13Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F.

The requirement for PS1 during development implies a crucial importance for the control of PS1 gene expression. PS1 is widely expressed in a variety of tissues (14Sherrington R. Rogaev E. Liang Y.

https://openalex.org/W1976411835,"Expression of the modABCD operon in Escherichia coli, which codes for a molybdate-specific transporter, is repressed by ModE in vivo in a molybdate-dependent fashion. In vitro DNase I-footprinting experiments identified three distinct regions of protection by ModE-molybdate on the modA operator/promoter DNA, GTTATATT (−15 to −8; region 1), GCCTACAT (−4 to +4; region 2), and GTTACAT (+8 to +14; region 3). Within the three regions of the protected DNA, a pentamer sequence, TA Y AT (Y = C or T), can be identified. DNA-electrophoretic mobility experiments showed that the protected regions 1 and 2 are essential for binding of ModE-molybdate to DNA, whereas the protected region 3 increases the affinity of the DNA to the repressor. The stoichiometry of this interaction was found to be two ModE-molybdate per modA operator DNA. ModE-molybdate at 5 nm completely protected the modABCD operator/promoter DNA from DNase I-catalyzed hydrolysis, whereas ModE alone failed to protect the DNA even at 100 nm. The apparent Kd for the interaction between the modA operator DNA and ModE-molybdate was 0.3 nm, and the Kd increased to 8 nm in the absence of molybdate. Among the various oxyanions tested, only tungstate replaced molybdate in the repression of modA by ModE, but the affinity of ModE-tungstate for modABCD operator DNA was 6 times lower than with ModE-molybdate. A mutant ModE(T125I) protein, which repressed modA-lac even in the absence of molybdate, protected the same region of modA operator DNA in the absence of molybdate. The apparent Kd for the interaction between modA operator DNA and ModE(T125I) was 3 nm in the presence of molybdate and 4 nmwithout molybdate. The binding of molybdate to ModE resulted in a decrease in fluorescence emission, indicating a conformational change of the protein upon molybdate binding. The fluorescence emission spectra of mutant ModE proteins, ModE(T125I) and ModE(Q216*), were unaffected by molybdate. The molybdate-independent mutant ModE proteins apparently mimic in its conformation the native ModE-molybdate complex, which binds to a DNA sequence motif of TATAT-7bp-TA Y AT.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). From structural studies, it has been determined that molybdenum exists in molybdoenzymes in the form of a pterin-containing molybdenum cofactor, with the exception of dinitrogenase, which has an iron-molybdenum cofactor (1Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Madden M.S. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1994; 14: 225-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1997; 275: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). For Escherichia coli, the production of its complement of molybdoenzymes requires the efficient uptake of molybdate via the molybdate-specific transporter encoded by the modABCD operon (5Corcuera G.L. Bastidas M. Dubourdieu M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 1869-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Maupin-Furlow J.A. Rosentel J.K. Lee J.H. Deppenmeier U. Gunsalus R.P. Shanmugam K.T. J.

Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Analysis of the proteins encoded by the modABCD operon suggests that ModA functions as a molybdate-specific periplasmic binding protein (9Rech S. Wolin C. Gunsalus R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), ModB as an integral membrane channel-forming protein, and ModC as an ATP-binding energizer protein. Mutations in genes coding for the molybdate-specific transporter in E. coli result in a loss of active molybdoenzymes, such as nitrate reductase and formate dehydrogenase (8Grunden A.M. Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, when sufficient levels of molybdate are added to the culture medium of these mutant strains, activity of the molybdoenzymes is restored, suggesting that in molybdate-supplemented media, molybdate enters the cell through alternate transport systems (10Rosentel J.K. Healy F. Maupin-Furlow J.A. Lee J.H. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4857-4864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was determined that expression of the modABCD operon is regulated by the intracellular concentration of molybdate. High levels of intracellular molybdate resulted in reduction of transcription of the modABCD operon (10Rosentel J.K. Healy F. Maupin-Furlow J.A. Lee J.H. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4857-4864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miller J.B. Scott D.J. Amy N.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rech S. Deppenmeier U. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which implies that E. coli has a molybdate-dependent repressor that regulates expression of the modABCD operon. Isolation of E. coli mutants that did not exhibit the classical repression of the modABCD operon upon molybdate-supplementation of the growth medium enabled us to identify a putative molybdate-dependent repressor (ModE) of the modABCD operon (13Grunden A.M. Ray R.M. Rosentel J.K. Healy F.G. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 735-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar genetic analysis also identified modE product as a potential repressor of the modABCD operon (7Walkenhorst H. Hemschemeier S. Eichenlaub R. Microbiol. Res. 1995; 50: 347-361Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14McNicholas P.M. Chiang R.C. Gunsalus R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 117-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified ModE protein prevented transcription of modAB′ template DNA in an in vitro coupled transcription-translation experiment (13Grunden A.M. Ray R.M. Rosentel J.K. Healy F.G. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 735-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molybdate is an essential component of this repression, and ModE-molybdate is the active form of the repressor. Molybdate-independent mutant forms of the repressor have been described (13Grunden A.M. Ray R.M. Rosentel J.K. Healy F.G. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 735-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14McNicholas P.M. Chiang R.C. Gunsalus R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 117-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these mutant forms carried point mutations within the amino acid sequence TSARNQ XX G (positions 125–133), which is conserved in ModE-homologs from several organisms and in Clostridium pasteurianum molybdopterin-binding proteins (8Grunden A.M. Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Grunden A.M. Ray R.M. Rosentel J.K. Healy F.G. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 735-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other molybdate-independent mutants were missing different lengths of the C terminus of the ModE protein (13Grunden A.M. Ray R.M. Rosentel J.K. Healy F.G. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 735-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14McNicholas P.M. Chiang R.C. Gunsalus R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 145: 117-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the kinetics of interaction of the mutant proteins with the modA operator DNA are yet to be established. Confirmation of the binding of ModE to E. coli modA operator/promoter DNA was provided by electrophoretic mobility shift and by DNase I-footprinting of this DNA in the presence of ModE (15Anderson L.

(17McNicholas P.M. Rech S.A. Gunsalus R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using the modABCD coding strand, determined that ModE protected a 28-bp1 stretch of modA DNA spanning from −18 to +10. It was proposed that two inverted repeat sequences located within the ModE-protected region serve as possible ModE binding sites. This inverted repeat sequence is similar to a consensus sequence, CGTTATATAN4–12TATATAACG, identified for molybdenum-regulated genes based on sequence similarity (18Kutsche M. Leimkuhler S. Angermuller S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2010-2017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, McNicholas et al. (17McNicholas P.M. Rech S.A. Gunsalus R.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that ModE protected the modA operator DNA even in the absence of added molybdate, which is in contrast to the in vivo observations of strict molybdate dependence. A Kd value of about 25 nm was reported for the interaction between ModE-molybdate and the operator DNA (15Anderson L. Palmer T. Price N.C. Bornemann S. Boxer D.H. Pau R.N. Eur. J.

This value of 25 nm is significantly higher than the subnanomolar Kd values reported for binding of other repressors to their cognate operator DNA (19Hurlbert B.K. Yanofsky C. J. Biol.

All DNA sequences generated in the course of this study were obtained using the Sanger dideoxy method and appropriate primers and plasmids isolated by alkaline lysis procedure and purified by cesium chloride density-gradient centrifugation (22Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52220) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences were analyzed using computer software programs GCG (24Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar) and Genepro (Riverside Scientific). ModE(T125I) and ModE(Q216*) were described previously (13Grunden A.M. Ray R.M. Rosentel J.K. Healy F.G. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 735-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the construction of plasmid pJKR12, which carries a different length of C-terminal deletion, an Ase I fragment carrying part of modE, modA, and part of modB was removed from plasmid pSE1004 (25Lee J.H. Wendt J.C. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into Ase I-digested plasmid vector pBR322. This plasmid produced a ModE C-terminal hybrid protein of 227 amino acids in which ModE was 220 amino acids long. The truncated C terminus of the protein was extended by an additional 7 amino acids from the vector sequence (IVAGKLE). This hybrid protein is designated as ModE(220hyb). For construction of other mutant ModE proteins (TableII), two primers that flank the modE gene in plasmid pAG1 (primer 1, GTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGG; primer 2, GTCAGGATGGCCTTCTGC) were used in combination with two internal primers carrying the designed mutation to amplify the modE gene in plasmid pAG1. The two polymerase chain reaction products were hydrolyzed with the designed restriction enzyme and ligated to generate the full-length modE gene. After further digestion with Eco RI and Bsa I, the mutated modE was cloned into plasmid pAG1, which was also hydrolyzed with Eco RI and Bsa I. This method replaced the modE + DNA in plasmid pAG1 with mutated modE DNA. The specific mutations in six such modE mutants used in this study are listed in Table II. The modE DNA in these plasmids was sequenced to confirm the presence of the specific mutation(s).Table IIEffect of ModE mutant proteins on the regulation of modA-lacAmino acid changeMutationβ-Galactosidase activity−Mo+MoWild typeNone650<10220hybΔ663-end<10<10N252*754AAT756 to TAA<10<10C217L649TGCGAA654 to CTCGAG660<10C230E687GTGC690 to CGAG620<10C262E783GTGC786 to CGAG710<10Δ5ILLTL9Δ13–27670620RN(128,129)PG383GTAAC387 to CCGGG580540Strain SE1811 with plasmid pAG1 (modE +) or mutant derivatives was grown in LB + glucose (0.3%) and molybdate (1 mm). β-Galactosidase activity is expressed as nmol · min−1 · mg of cell protein−1.

See under “Experimental Procedures” for other details. Plasmid pAM4, which provided the native modA operator/promoter DNA used in DNase I protection experiments, was produced by ligating a Kpn I-Bst EII fragment from plasmid pSE1009 (25Lee J.H. Wendt J.C. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (the Bst EII end was modified using DNA polymerase I-Klenow fragment; Klenow) that covered the −247 to +25 sequence of the modA operator/promoter region into the Kpn I-Hin cII sites of plasmid pUC19. Plasmid pAM6, was obtained by Bal-31 nuclease treatment of Kpn I-digested plasmid pAM4 followed by ligation. In the construction of plasmids pAM17 and pAM18, complementary oligomers that contained various portions of modA operator/promoter sequence (Table I) were synthesized, annealed, phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase, and digested with Bam HI prior to ligating into the Bam HI-Sma I sites of plasmid vector pUC19. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the DNA. Throughout this paper, the modABCD transcription start site was assigned +1 in reference to the numbering of the bases. ModE protein purified from E. coli as described previously (13Grunden A.M. Ray R.M. Rosentel J.K. Healy F.G. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 735-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used in this study. Although the native ModE protein remained in solution upon expression from the T7-expression plasmid, the mutant ModE proteins were localized in inclusion bodies. The method described below overcame this problem and allowed expression of mutant ModE into the soluble fraction and purification to homogeneity using nickel affinity chromatography. Polymerase chain reaction was utilized to amplify the wild type modE as well as mutant modE alleles from plasmid pAG1 (and its mutant derivatives) (13Grunden A.M. Ray R.M. Rosentel J.K. Healy F.G. Shanmugam K.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 735-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using two primers, 5′GGACATTCATATGCAGGCCGAAATC-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCTTAGCACAGCGTGGCGA-3′, for insertion into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen) at the Nde I/Bam HI sites. The N termini of the ModE proteins produced from these plasmids also contain six histidines, which are separated from the ModE protein by a linker containing thrombin cleavage site. The mutation in each plasmid containing the mutant modE allele was confirmed by sequencing the entire modE gene in the pET15b-derived plasmids. Each of the ModE proteins was purified as follows. Strain BL21(DE3) carrying pET15b-modE derivative was grown in 250 ml of L broth with shaking (225 rpm) at 37 °C. When the absorbance of the culture reached 0.7 (420 nm; Spectronic 710 spectrophotometer), isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The temperature of incubation was reduced to 23 °C, and the culture was incubated for an additional 3 h. The cells were harvested, washed once with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and resuspended in 25 ml of Tris buffer. Cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell operating at 20,000 psi, and the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter (Gelman Sciences) and then loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Before loading the sample, the column was washed with NiCl2 (40 mm in Tris buffer), and free Ni was removed with Tris buffer. After loading the sample, the column was washed with Tris buffer followed by the same buffer containing 50 mm imidazole to remove the proteins bound nonspecifically to the matrix. The ModE protein was eluted with 0.3 mimidazole in Tris buffer. After adding CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2.5 mm, thrombin protease (25 units; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the ModE preparation to remove the N-terminal His tag sequence. The thrombin-ModE mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. After cleavage was complete, based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, the sample was loaded on a HiTrap Heparin column (5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to separate ModE from thrombin. After washing the column with 5 volumes of Tris buffer, ModE was eluted with 0.3 m NaCl and was determined to be pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ModE protein was dialyzed overnight in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and stored on ice until use. This protein was found to be stable for several months. ModE proteins purified by this nickel affinity method, contained an extra three amino acids (Gly, Ser, and His) in the N termini and are designated *ModE to denote this alteration. Protein concentration was determined using either the BCA assay or Coomassie Blue (Bradford reagent) with bovine serum albumin as standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211616) Google Scholar, 27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujomoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18324) Google Scholar). The kinetic characteristics of the interaction between ModE and the modA operator DNA were determined using an IAsys optical evanescent wave biosensor (Affinity Sensors). The principles of this biosensor and kinetic analysis of the data were described previously (28Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 29Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Edwards P.R. Leatherbarrow R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this particular experiment, a cuvette containing biotin on the sensor surface was utilized. Biotinylated DNA was bound to the sensor surface using streptavidin (Calbiochem) as an intermediate. Two 43-base complimentary oligonucleotides covering the modA operator region between −18 and +25, were synthesized (National Biosciences, Inc.), and biotin was incorporated into the 5′-end of one of the oligonucleotides that upon annealing would be located in the 5′-end of the DNA. All cuvettes were prepared by applying the same amount of modA operator DNA for generation of the immobilized ligand. The quantity of DNA present in the cuvette was further verified by monitoring the response of the instrument to a standard amount of ModE-molybdate. The biotin cuvette in the optical sensor was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Streptavidin (100 μl; 1 mg/ml) in 10% PBST was added to the cuvette (200-μl reaction volume) and incubated for 6.5 min with mixing. After removing the unbound streptavidin, DNA was added and incubated until no further response was noted. Excess DNA was removed from the cuvette by 3 washes with PBST. ModE protein with or without molybdate (1 mm) was added to the cuvette, and the rate of increase in refractive index (response units in arc·s) was recorded. After the maximum response was attained, free ModE in the cuvette was removed by a wash with PBST, and the rate of dissociation of ModE from the ModE-DNA complex was monitored. The experiment was repeated with various ModE concentrations, as well as with various mutant forms of ModE and mutated modA operator DNA. DNase I protection experiments were performed as described previously (31Self W.T. Grunden A.M. Hasona A. Shanmugam K.T. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For these experiments, a 446-bp Fsp I-Hin dIII fragment from plasmid pAM4, which carries the modA operator/promoter DNA spanning from −247 to +25, was used after purification using a 10–30% sucrose gradient (32Sankar P. Biochemical Genetics of Hydrogen Metabolism of Escherichia coli: hydB, hydF, and FhlA Genes.Ph.D. dissertation. University of Florida, Gainesville, FL1987Google Scholar). DNA mobility shift experiments were performed as described by Fried and Crothers (33Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar), with modification (31Self W.T. Grunden A.M. Hasona A. Shanmugam K.T. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Ogden R.C. Adams D.A. Meth. in Enzymol. 1987; 152: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These experiments used a binding reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol), DNA (0.1 pmol; −18 to +25 region of the modA operator/promoter DNA or mutant modA operator derivative), and protein in a final volume of 10 μl. Sodium molybdate or other oxyanions at a final concentration of 1 or 10 mm were also included in the reaction mixtures, gels, and electrophoresis running buffer, as needed. In an effort to determine the stoichiometry of the ModE-DNA association, binding reactions containing 0.1 pmol of a 43-bp DNA (−18 to +25 region) and 25 nmol of ModE were prepared as described for the DNA mobility shift experiments. The binding reaction samples were then subjected to electrophoresis through a 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0% polyacrylamide-Tris-borate-EDTA-nondenaturing gel as described for DNA mobility shift experiments (31Self W.T. Grunden A.M. Hasona A. Shanmugam K.T. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The distance of migration of ModE-molybdate-DNA complex was compared with values obtained with protein standards. This information was used to produce a Ferguson plot (35Ferguson K.A. Metabolism. 1964; 13: 985-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), and the apparent molecular weight of the ModE-DNA complex was determined by extrapolation from the Ferguson plot. For determination of the Rf values of the protein standards, 15 μg of lactalbumin (14,200), 20 μg of carbonic anhydrase (29,000), 20 μg of chicken egg albumin (45,000), 15 μg of bovine serum albumin (monomer, 66,000; dimer, 132,000) and 6 μg of urease (dimer, 240,000; tetramer, 480,000) were subjected to electrophoresis along with the ModE-DNA complex. Emission spectra were collected using an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrofluorometer (Spectronic) at a bandpass width of 4 nm. The detector voltage was set at 610V. ModE proteins were diluted in Tris buffer (pH 8.0) with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol for measurement using a 1-cm path length. Three separate concentrations of ModE and mutant ModE proteins (1, 2.4, and 4.8 μm) were analyzed for intrinsic fluorescence with and without added molybdate. ModE has previously been shown to repress transcription of the modABCD operon only in a molybdate-dep"
https://openalex.org/W2142051983,"A biochemical characterization was performed with a partially purified RNA ligase from isolated mitochondria of Leishmania tarentolae. This ligase has a Km of 25 ± 0.75 nm and a Vmax of 1.0 × 10–4 ± 2.4 × 10−4 nmol/min when ligating a nicked double-stranded RNA substrate. Ligation was negatively affected by a gap between the donor and acceptor nucleotides. The catalytic efficiency of the circularization of a single-stranded substrate was 5-fold less than that of the ligation of a nicked substrate. These properties of the mitochondrial RNA ligase are consistent with an expected in vivo role in the process of uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing, in which the mRNA cleavage fragments are bridged by a cognate guide RNA.

For example, T4 RNA ligase repairs nicks in the anticodon domains of tRNAs in T4-infected Escherichia coli cells (1Amitsur M. Levitz R. Kaufmann G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes and Archea, a tRNA ligase is involved in tRNA splicing; this RNA ligase contributes to the maturation of tRNAs by joining tRNA half molecules generated by the removal of introns from tRNA precursors (2Greer C.L. Peebles C.L. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 32: 537-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recently, a 2′-5′ RNA ligase has been characterized in uninfected bacteria; the function of this RNA ligase remains unclear, but it may reveal an unexpected step in E. coli RNA metabolism (3Arn E.A. Abelson J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31145-31153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). An RNA ligase has also been invoked for the final step of uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing in mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoa (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). RNA editing in kinetoplastid mitochondria is a posttranscriptional maturation of pre-edited mRNA (5Alfonzo J.D. Thiemann O. Simpson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3751-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This modification process consists of insertions and, to a lesser extent, deletions of U residues in the pre-edited mRNA, usually within coding regions. The information for the specific insertions or deletions is present as complementary sequences (allowing G-U base pairs) in short guide RNA molecules (gRNAs).1 The gRNAs are encoded by both the maxicircle and minicircle components of the mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast DNA) of trypanosomatids (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Evidence to date suggests that the modified enzyme cascade model (4Blum B. Bakalara N.

A specific gRNA first forms a duplex region just downstream of the editing site. This is followed by a precise endonucleolytic cleavage at the first mismatched base (10Piller K.J. Rusche L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Sollner-Webb B. RNA. 1997; 3: 279-290PubMed Google Scholar, 11Adler B.K. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Cell.

An RNA ligase activity has been detected in isolated mitochondria of Leishmania tarentolae (12Bakalara N. Simpson A.M. Simpson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18679-18686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Trypanosoma brucei (13Sabatini R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7233-7240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Ligase activity sedimented as a major 20 S peak and a minor 10 S peak in glycerol gradients of mitochondrial extract from L. tarentolae. In T. brucei, mitochondrial ligase activity sedimented as two peaks of equal size (14Peris M. Simpson A.M. Grunstein J. Liliental J.E. Frech G.C. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two proteins of 50 and 45 kDa in both species were detected comigrating with the ligase activities. These two proteins could be adenylated by [α-32P]ATP and deadenylated by incubation with ligatable RNA substrates (13Sabatini R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7233-7240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and therefore may represent putative components of the mitochondrial RNA ligase (14Peris M. Simpson A.M.

A band on a native gel has been identified as the 20 S complex that contains the two adenylatable proteins in a mitochondrial extract from L. tarentolae (14Peris M. Simpson A.M. Grunstein J. Liliental J.E. Frech G.C. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that a partially purified mitochondrial RNA ligase from L. tarentolae can join two RNA molecules that are bridged by another RNA molecule in a model system similar to that occurring in the editing reaction. The mRNA substrates were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase transcription. A 210-nt edited cytochrome b (Cyb) mRNA (19Byrne E.M. Connell G.J. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6758-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was transcribed from a recombinant plasmid linearized with Ear I. T7 transcription was performed in 50-μl reactions containing 2 μg of template DNA, 5 mm NTPs, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 12.5 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase and 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 15 h (20Cunningham P.R. Ofengand J. BioTechniques. 1990; 9: 713-714PubMed Google Scholar). The transcripts were purified from acrylamide gels by elution at 4 °C in 0.5 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 1 mm EDTA. After ethanol precipitation, the RNAs were resuspended in water. RNAs longer than 30 nt were commercially synthesized using a DNA nucleotide attached to the column because this provided a more robust synthesis (Oligo Therapeutics Inc.). This type of synthesis produced RNAs with a 3′ terminal DNA nucleotide. Short RNAs were synthesized using only ribonucleotides (Oligo Therapeutics, Inc.). The RNAs were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, resuspended in water at a concentration of 100 μm, and stored at −80 °C. T7 - synthesized RNAs (10 μg) were dephosphorylated by incubation with 0.01 unit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mmEDTA. The reaction was stopped by phenol extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. The 5′ OH-RNA was labeled in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm spermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μm ATP, 5 pmol [α-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and the 5′ 32P-labeled RNA was purified on a 7 m urea-10% polyacrylamide gel. The 3′ mRNA fragments (2 μg) were resuspended in 20 μl of ligation mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mmMgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmATP, 20% Me2SO, 16 pmol [α-32P]pCp and 10 units of T4 RNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The ligation reaction proceeded overnight at 4 °C. The 3′-labeled RNAs were purified on 7m urea-10% polyacrylamide gels. Either 5′- or 3′-labeled RNAs were incubated at 27 °C for the appropriate times in 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 unit of RNasin, in the presence or absence of enzyme. For the bridged-ligation reactions, samples (5′ fragment, 3′ fragment, and bridge RNA) were annealed prior to enzyme addition by heating at 65 °C for 10 min followed by cooling at room temperature for 15 min. A similar annealing procedure was used to generate the tRNATrp substrate shown in Fig.9 A. For the circularization reactions, substrates were used in the reaction without prior treatment. Reactions were terminated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Reaction products were resuspended in gel loading buffer (formamide with 0.01% of xylene cyanole, 0.01% bromphenol blue and 30 mm EDTA), heated for 2 min at 80 °C, and electrophoretically separated on a 7 m urea-5% acrylamide at 500 V for 2 h. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). For analysis of the initial velocity kinetic constants, increasing concentration of either 5′-labeled substrates (circularization assays) or 3′-labeled substrates (bridged-ligation reactions) were incubated with constant concentration of enzyme as described above. The optimal reaction time to ensure steady-state conditions was determined by a reaction-progress curve (data not shown). Reactions were terminated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The velocity of conversion of substrates into ligated products was calculated for each substrate and plotted as a function of substrate concentration. These data were plotted as double-reciprocal plots, allowing graphical calculation of the first-order rate constants (Km and Vmax) for the various substrates. RNA substrates were annealed as for the bridging ligation followed by the addition of Tris-HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) to 50 mm, MgCl2 to 10 mm,and glycerol to 10%. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, samples were loaded on pre-electrophoresed 12% acrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio, 29:1) with 50 mmTris-HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 150 V using 0.01% bromphenol blue as a mobility marker. After the dye migrated 10–12 cm from the top of the gel, the gel was fixed, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). The dissociation constant for the 3′-fragment-bridge RNA complex was determined using increasing concentrations of bridge RNA in several independent experiments. The mitochondrial RNA ligase could circularize substrate RNAs that had 3′ OH and 5′ PO4 termini. The major ligation product migrated off the diagonal formed by linear marker RNAs in two-dimensional acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 B, 2). This anomalous electrophoretic migration is characteristic of circular molecules (21Pan T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Gene. 1993; 125: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Circularization of the 210-nt substrate RNA was used as an assay for the partial purification of the mitochondrial RNA ligase. The enzyme was partially purified from an S100 extract of a highly purified L. tarentolae mitochondrial fraction by chromatography through Q Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Poros HS and Poros HQ columns (PerSeptive Biosystems), and isoelectric focusing in solution (Rotophor Apparatus, Bio-Rad) (data not shown). Although the extent of purification varied with different isolations, bridging experiments with less pure ligase samples gave results identical to those of the more highly purified preparations. In the ligase fraction used for the experiments reported in this paper, the enzyme was purified 14,000-fold (based on specific activity) with a yield of 6%. This fraction contained the adenylatable 50- and 45-kDa proteins (data not shown), which previous evidence indicated represented ligase intermediates (14Peris M. Simpson A.M. Grunstein J. Liliental J.E. Frech G.C. Simpson L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The partially purified RNA ligase was free of detectable DNA ligase, 3′ exonuclease and 3′ terminal uridylyl transferase activities (data not shown). The details of the enzyme purification will be presented elsewhere. The L. tarentolae mitochondrial RNA ligase activity was assayed in the presence of several nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. The data in Fig. 2 show that ligase activity was inhibited when AMP-CPP, an ATP analog not hydrolyzable at the α-β bond, was present during the reaction. When ATP analogs not hydrolyzable at the β-γ bond (e.g. AMP-PNP) were used, ligation was either not inhibited or inhibited to a lesser extent. These results are consistent with previous results with crude mitochondrial extracts, suggesting that the L. tarentolae ligation reaction involved formation of an activated RNA intermediate. This is similar to the enzymatic mechanism of T4 RNA ligase, which involves an initial hydrolysis of ATP at the α-β bond, followed by the formation of an AMP-RNA intermediate (22Cranston J.W. Silber R. Malathi V.G. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7447-7456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Sugino A. Snoper T.J. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1732-1738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide cofactor and divalent cation requirements of the ligase reaction are shown in TableI. The L. tarentolae RNA ligase has an absolute requirement for ATP and Mg2+. Neither UTP nor CTP could substitute for ATP; GTP could substitute for ATP, but to a lesser extent. The optimum Mg2+ concentration was 5 mm; concentrations greater than 10 mmwere inhibitory (data not shown). No ligase activity was detected in the presence of 0.5–10 mm CaCl2, ZnCl2, or MnCl2. The ligase did not require monovalent cations for activity, and no stimulation was observed in the presence of KCl, NaCl, NH4Cl, or NH4OAc (data not shown). The ligase activity was inhibited 22-fold by 200 mm KCl (data not shown) and showed a narrow optimal pH range between pH 7.5 and 9.0 (data not shown).Table IL. tarentolae mt RNA ligase requirementsAssay conditionsActivityfmol/30 minComplete reaction6− Mg2+0− ATP0.6− ATP, + UTP0− ATP, + CTP0− ATP, + GTP1.3− ATP, + ADP1.5− ATP, + dATP (2 mm)0.36− ATP, + NAD+ (5 mm)0Complete, + PPi (50 mm)5.1Complete, + PPi (1 mm)0.36Assay conditions are as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity is expressed in fmol of ligated product generated per 30 min. Open table in a new tab Assay conditions are as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activity is expressed in fmol of ligated product generated per 30 min. RNA ligases can be divided into several classes, depending on the preference for given termini on the substrate RNA. To investigate the requirements of the L. tarentolae mitochondrial RNA ligase, two RNAs containing either 5′ OH and 3′ phosphate or 5′ phosphate and 3′ OH termini were used as substrates in the circularization assay. As shown in Fig.3, ligated products appeared only with the latter substrate. These results indicated that L. tarentolae mitochondrial RNA ligase is similar to T4 RNA ligase in that it requires a 5′ phosphate and a 3′ OH. The enzyme cascade model for RNA editing postulates a mitochondrial RNA ligase that can join two mRNA cleavage fragments bridged by a cognate gRNA. The substrates constructed to assay the activity of the mitochondrial RNA ligase were based on the sequence of the internal editing domain of pre-edited ND7 mRNA and the cognate gRNA, which in vivo mediates the insertion of one U at editing site 1, three Us at site 2, and one U at site 3. A nick was present at editing site 1 in these constructs to mimic the final ligation step in the editing reaction. The sequences of three constructs used in these experiments are shown in Fig. 4, together with an indication of the 5′ and 3′ mRNA cleavage fragments and the 5′ and 3′ anchor duplexes. The mitochondrial RNA ligase was found to efficiently ligate two synthetic RNAs in the presence of a bridge RNA that could base pair with both fragments (Fig. 5). In these constructs, the 5′ anchor duplex of 9 bp is identical to the wild type anchor duplex formed between the gRNA and the mRNA. The effect of varying the length of the 3′ anchor duplex between the 3′ end of the gRNA and the 5′ mRNA cleavage fragment on the efficiency of bridged ligation is shown in Fig. 5 A. A 3′ anchor of 5 bp yielded 0.2% ligation, whereas an anchor of 6 bp yielded 7.5% ligation. The maximum value of 30% ligation was achieved with a 3′ anchor of 7 bp, and increasing the length of the 3′ anchor to 19 bp did not increase the extent of ligation. A native gel analysis of the interactions in the absence of proteins between these 5′ and 3′ cleavage fragments and the bridge RNAs is shown in Fig. 5 B. The interaction of labeled 3′ fragment from construct 2 in Fig. 5 A and unlabeled bridge RNA is shown in Fig. 5 B, lane 4. Note the almost complete upward shift of the 3′ fragment from the position in lane 3. In Fig.5 B, lanes 5–10, the interactions of labeled 5′ fragments from constructs 2, 6, and 7 in Fig. 5 A with the unlabeled bridge RNAs and the respective unlabeled 3′ fragments are shown. In Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and 6, the bridge RNA, which could potentially form a 3′ anchor duplex of 4 bp, showed no detectable interaction with the 5′ fragment, whereas in lanes 7 and 8, a detectable interaction of the bridge RNA, which could form a 3′ anchor duplex of 7 bp, with the 5′ fragment was seen. A more efficient interaction of the bridge RNA with a potential 19-bp 3′ anchor duplex with the 5′ fragment is shown in Fig. 5 B, lanes 9 and 10. These results allowed the determination of dissociation constants (24Campbell T.B. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11493-11502Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Annealing of the 3′ fragment and the cognate bridging RNA in lane 4 resulted in the formation of a stable complex with Kd of 0.8–1 nm, which is in the same range (0.5–2 nm) as the dissociation constant observed for the interaction of a fragment of the pre-edited mRNA for ribosomal protein S12 and its cognate gRNA (data not shown). A comparison of the extent of ligation of bridged RNAs with different lengths of gaps separating the two fragments under excess enzyme conditions is shown in Fig. 6. The nicked substrate in lane 5 is shown as construct 6 in Fig.5 A, and the gapped substrates represent successive deletions of the 3′ nucleotides from the 5′ fragments. The decreased ligation efficiencies of the bridged substrates with gaps of 1–4 nucleotides are apparent. It is of interest that the efficiency of formation of gRNA-mRNA chimeras increases as the bridged ligation efficiency decreases. Because the 3′ terminal nucleotide of the bridge RNA is dT, the formation of chimeras must be due to nibbling of the end of the RNA. If the ligase described in this report has an involvement in the editing process in vivo, then it should show a substrate preference for double-stranded nicked RNA substrates formed by the bridging of mRNA 5′ and 3′ cleavage fragments by a cognate gRNA. Several RNA constructs were made to test the partially purified L. tarentolae mitochondrial RNA ligase for this activity. The different synthetic substrates were tested under steady-state conditions (Fig. 7), and the first-order rate constants for each substrate were calculated, as shown in TableII. These data indicate that the preferred substrate for the ligase is a double-stranded RNA with a nick. As the distance separating the 3′ end of the 5′ fragment from the 5′ end of the 3′ fragment was increased to create a gap of 1, 2, or 3 nt, a decreased efficiency of ligation was observed. With a 3-nt gap separating the two fragments, a 416-fold decrease in ligation efficiency was observed, as shown by comparing the relative Vmax/Km of the nicked and the 3-nt gapped substrates in Table II. The mitochondrial RNA ligase also favored the ligation of the nicked substrate over the circularization of longer RNAs lacking a bridge by a factor of approximately 4, as shown by comparing the relative Vmax/Km of the nicked and the Cyb-210 substrates in Table II.Table IIKinetic analysis of the L. tarentolae mitochondrial RNA ligase and the bacteriophage T4 RNA ligaseSubstrateMitochondrial RNA ligaseT4 RNA ligaseKmVmaxVmax/KmRel Vmax/KmKmVmaxVmax/KmRel Vmax/Kmnmnmol/minnmnmol/minCyb-21054.95.2 × 10−59.5 × 10−70.2315001.8 × 10−41.2 × 10−70.029EP1–30445.56.5 × 10−71.0 × 10−90.00024N/AN/AN/AN/ANicked25.21.06 × 10−44.2 × 10−61.022732.4 × 10−46.4 × 10−80.0151-nt gap1101.84 × 10−41.75 × 10−60.422-nt gap1701.73 × 10−41.0 × 10−70.0243-nt gap1211.2 × 10−61.0 × 10−80.0024Cyb-210 and EP1–30 refer to the 210- and 30-nt RNAs used in the circularization reaction.

Each Km and Vmax value given is the average of at least three independent measurements. Comparison of the ligation efficiency of the mitochondrial RNA ligase and T4 RNA ligase indicated that the mitochondrial ligase was almost 100-fold more efficient in catalyzing the ligation reactions of the substrates used under the ligation conditions described. Interestingly, we observed that the T4 RNA ligase could ligate the nicked substrate with an efficiency comparable to that of the circularization reaction (Table II). This observation is in contrast with previous reports that showed a lack of ligation by this enzyme when the ends to be ligated were fully base paired (25Kaufmann G. Klein T. Littauer U.Z. FEBS Lett. 1974; 46: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The efficiency of ligation by the mitochondrial ligase was also affected by the length of the substrate used in the circularization reaction. Whereas the 210-nt Cyb-210 substrate was efficiently ligated, the 30-nt EP1–30 substrate (Table II) was an extremely poor substrate for this enzyme, with a 4166-fold lower Vmax/Km relative to that of the nicked substrate. Because T4 RNA ligase shows a nucleotide preference for ligation (26Uhlenbeck O.C. Gumport R.I. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 15. Academic Press, New York1981: 31-58Google Scholar), it is possible that the observed difference in the efficiency of bridged ligation of several synthetic RNAs could be due to the chemical nature of the 3′ terminal nucleotide of the 5′ fragment (as opposed to the length of the gap). As shown in Fig.8, A and B, the mitochondrial RNA ligase joins bridged fragments having different 3′ terminal nucleotides with almost identical efficiencies. The mitochondrial RNA ligase is less active in ligating a nicked tRNA substrate than T4 RNA ligase The native substrate for T4 RNA ligase is a tRNA that has a nick in the anticodon loop. A comparison of the time course of the ligation of the synthetic nicked tRNATrp in Fig. 9 A by the mitochondrial RNA ligase and T4 RNA ligase is shown in Fig. 9 B. The mitochondrial ligase is much less active in ligating this substrate than the T4 ligase. Several properties of the partially purified L. tarentolae mitochondrial RNA ligase are consistent with a role for this enzyme in the terminal step of RNA editing (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The ligation of two fragments that are bridged by a complementary RNA is similar to the predicted role of the editing ligase in joining two mRNA cleavage fragments bridged by a cognate gRNA. Blum et al. (4Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 27Blum B. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 62: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) originally proposed that the 3′ oligo(U) nonencoded tail of the gRNA base pairs with the G+A rich pre-edited sequence and forms a 3′ anchor duplex that both stabilizes the initial interaction of the gRNA and the mRNA and assists in maintaining the mRNA 5′ cleavage fragment within the editing complex. The data in this paper do not directly support this hypothesis as originally proposed. In addition, we have found by native gel analysis of the ND7.4x substrate and the cognate gRNA (19Byrne E.M. Connell G.J. Simpson L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6758-6765Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that in the absence of proteins, the gRNA 3′ oligo(U) tail does not contribute to the interaction. 3R. Aphasizhev and L. Simpson, unpublished results. Furthermore, Kapushoc and Simpson (28Kapushoc S. Simpson L. RNA. 1999; 5: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) recently showed that deletion of the 3′ oligo(U) tail from a 3′ end blocked gRNA provided in cis has no effect on the directed insertion of Us at editing site 1 in a synthetic ND7-I mRNA. It is clear, however, that stabilization of the interaction of the bridging gRNA and the mRNA 5′ cleavage fragment is critical for ligation, and a similar result was previously obtained for in vitro editing in the T. brucei system (7Seiwert S.D. Heidmann S. Stuart K. Cell. 1996; 84: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In vivo, the number of consecutive base pairs 5′ of an editing site is usually quite limited; in the ND7-I situation, the mRNA sequence at editing site 1 could at most form a 3-bp 3′ duplex with the cognate gRNA. We show in this paper that a 5-bp 3′ duplex does not support a bridged ligation of a nicked double-stranded substrate RNA, whereas a 7-bp duplex allows 30% ligation. An interaction of the bridge RNA that could form a 3′ anchor duplex of 7-bp with the 5′ fragment was directly demonstrated by native gel analysis. We presume that the function of this 3′ anchor duplex in the in vitro system is to maintain the 5′ fragment in the correct configuration and proximity for ligation to the 3′ fragment. In vivo, proteins within the editing complex may serve the role of binding to the 5′ cleavage fragment, either directly, through RNA binding, or indirectly, through protein-protein interactions. In this regard, several mitochondrial proteins have been identified that bind to gRNA and mRNA (29Vanhamme L. Perez-Morga D. Marchal C. Speijer D. Lambert L. Geuskens M. Alexandre S. Ismaïli N.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6368-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Also, we cannot rule out the possibility that RNA ligase itself could be involved. Another property of the mitochondrial RNA ligase consistent with a role for joining two mRNA cleavage fragments that have undergone either U addition or U deletion at the 3′ end of the 5′ fragment is the lack of a requirement for a specific 3′ nucleotide on the 5′ fragment. U deletions in particular would frequently expose a 3′ terminal A, G, and sometimes C, which must be joined to the 3′ cleavage fragment. Furthermore, the preference for ligation of a nicked substrate is consistent with ligation generally occurring in vivo after a precise trimming of the 3′ single-stranded overhang (5Alfonzo J.D. Thiemann O. Simpson L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3751-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The less efficient ligation of bridged fragments with a gap or with a 3′ overhang may be responsible in vitro and possibly also in vivo for the appearance of a variable percentage of misedited molecules that contain the incorrect number of Us at an editing site (35Maslov D.A. Sturm N.R. Niner B.M. Gruszynski E.S. Peris M. Simpson L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Sturm N.R. Maslov D.A. Blum B. Simpson L.

The dependence of ligation efficiency on the length of the gap separating the two bridged fragments is consistent with the results of Cohen and Cech (38Cohen S.B. Cech T.R. RNA. 1998; 4: 1179-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), who quantitated by disulfide cross-linking the relative flexibility of an RNA bridged duplex consisting of three strands. They examined constructs in which a bridge RNA hybridized to two RNA molecules yielding a nick or single-stranded gaps of 1, 2, or 3 nt. The relative flexibility of the nicked duplex was 2 orders of magnitude less than that of the duplexes with gaps of 1–3 nt. The high relative rigidity of the nicked duplexes in the constructs that we have employed may be one of the major factors increasing the efficiency of ligation of the two mRNA fragments and inhibiting the formation of chimeric molecules, as we have observed. The higher flexibility of the gapped duplexes similarly may be responsible for increased formation of chimeric molecules (Fig. 6). In any case, the increased formation of chimeric molecules in the gapped substrates is entirely consistent with the kinetic data in Table II in that the decreased efficiency of bridged ligation due to the gaps would allow the ligation of the 3′ end of the gRNA to the 3′ cleavage fragment, which essentially represents a circularization ligation. In a comparison of the L. tarentolae mitochondrial RNA ligase and T4 RNA ligase, each enzyme appears to prefer its native substrate. The mitochondrial RNA ligase is approximately 100-fold more active in ligating a nicked double-stranded RNA substrate, and the T4 RNA ligase is more active in ligating a nicked tRNA substrate. In conclusion, we have shown that a partially purified mitochondrial RNA ligase activity from L. tarentolae has several properties consistent with the ligase proposed to be involved in RNA editing. Purification to homogeneity and cloning of the gene(s) coding for this enzyme should provide answers to many of the outstanding questions about this biochemical mechanism."

IgSF members coexist on many extending axons and show a transient expression pattern during early stages of development. The multidomain nature of glycoproteins of the IgSF suggest that they regulate axonal pathfinding by multiple complex interactions with other axonal and ECM molecules (1Brümmendorf T. Rathjen F.G.

The N-terminal Ig domains 1–4 of the F11 polypeptide are sufficient for interactions with NgCAM, NrCAM, TN-R, and TN-C, although binding assays with domain-specific anti-F11 monoclonal antibodies and with F11 domain deletion mutants suggest that individual domains of the four N-terminal domains might be more important for specific bindings (8Brümmendorf T.

TN-R and TN-C are two major members of the tenascin family of ECM glycoproteins. These multidomain proteins are composed of a cysteine-rich segment, epidermal growth factor-like repeats, FNIII-like domains, and a segment similar to the β- and γ-chains of fibrinogen (for a review, see Ref. 17Chiquet Ehrismann R. Hagios C. Matsumoto K. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 3-7PubMed Google Scholar). TN-R and TN-C show striking functional analogies, but within the nervous system TN-R has a more restricted localization than TN-C, has a different developmental time course, and is synthesized by oligodendrocytes and a subpopulation of neurons rather than predominantly by astroglia (18Faissner A. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TN-R and TN-C form oligomeric structures as revealed by rotatory shadowing electron microscopy (19Nörenberg U.

The responses can be either stimulatory or inhibitory, depending on the specific neuronal cell type studied, the assay design (choise situation on patterned substrates or homogeneous substrate), and they are probably mediated by separate domains. Neurite outgrowth-promoting, cell-binding, antiadhesive, and nonpermissive regions have been identified in TN-R and TN-C (15Nörenberg U. Hubert M. Brümmendorf T. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. J.

These observations could also reflect the differential expression of receptor complexes on the responding cells or of downstream effector mechanisms that control the growth cone. The short term attachment site for retinal cells within TN-R was allocated to FNIII domain 8, while the site interacting with F11 has been mapped to the FNIII domains 2 and 3. Furthermore, TN-R FNIII domain 2 has been shown to mediate homophilic interaction (15Nörenberg U. Hubert M. Brümmendorf T. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cell attachment sites within TN-C have been identified in FNIII domains 3 and 6–8 and in the fibrinogen-like globe (25Prieto A.L. Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas F11 binds to FNIII domains 5 and 6 (24Weber P. Ferber P. Fischer R. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The multidomain and oligomeric structure of ECM glycoproteins like TN-R and TN-C, together with their elastic properties (38Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), suggests that they may serve to link cell surface molecules between different cells and to the ECM network. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization reveal that F11 shows a significant overlap in its expression pattern with TN-R or TN-C, but there are also spatial and temporal differences (14Pesheva P. Gennarini G. Goridis C. Schachner M. Neuron. 1993; 10: 69-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Rathjen F.G. Wolff J.M. Chiquet Ehrismann R.

This is consistent with the possibility of interactions between these proteins as well as competition between them for ligands. Although multiple interactions between CAMs and ECM molecules have been described, the question remains which interactions are of functional importance and how these interactions are regulated during complex physiological processes like axon guidance and neural cell migration. Different mechanisms like alternative splicing, posttranslational modifications, and complex formation with other proteins have been proposed in addition to spatial and temporal regulation of protein expression (7Volkmer H. Zacharias U. Nörenberg U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the VASE exon has been shown to regulate NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth (40Liu L. Haines S. Shew R. Akeson R.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 327-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Doherty P. Moolenaar C.E. Ashton S.V. Michalides R.J. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1992; 356: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and neurite outgrowth induced by TN-C is modulated by alternative splicing of the FNIII domains (33Gotz B. Scholze A. Clement A. Joester A. Schutte K. Wigger F. Frank R. Spiess E. Ekblom P. Faissner A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 681-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 42Meiners S. Geller H.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 100-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Varying the carbohydrate groups attached to cell surface proteins is another possibility of regulating cell interactions, as it has been described for polysialylation of NCAM (43Tang J. Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,44Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 528-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The adhesion strength of CAMs can be modulated by intracellular signaling. T cell receptor engagement increases the affinity of the integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 for its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, probably by a conformational change transmitted across the plasma membrane (45Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Similarly, neurofascin-dependent cell aggregation is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain (46Tuvia S. Garver T.D. Bennett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12957-12962Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, complex formation may occlude binding sites on the ligand and/or receptor, thereby regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The multiple potential interactions of F11 already identified make it an interesting candidate to evaluate whether different ligands can interact simultaneously or compete with each other for binding to F11. Such information for F11 and other CAMs together with expression patterns would provide a basis for evaluating functions for various interactions in vivo. Here we investigate whether the ECM glycoproteins TN-R and TN-C may regulate the interactions of F11 with its ligands. Competition and sandwich binding assays have been used to establish that TN-R or TN-C compete with NrCAM or NgCAM for binding to the F11 polypeptide. Cellular assays demonstrate that TN-R and TN-C modulate neurite outgrowth of tectal cells on immobilized F11 differentially and that in the presence of TN-R neurite extension is mediated by β1 integrins instead of NrCAM as cellular receptor. NgCAM, NrCAM, TN-R, and TN-C were purified from detergent (CAMs) and urea (TNs) extracts, respectively; F11 and axonin-1 were purified from phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-treated extracts of plasma membrane preparations of adult chicken brains followed by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (4Rathjen F.G.

Isolation of monoclonal antibodies and generation of Fab fragments of polyclonal antibodies to these antigens are detailed elsewhere (2Brümmendorf T. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Rathjen F.G.

Brümmendorf T. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-β1 integrin antibody W1B10 was purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany), and JG22 was purified from the supernatant of hybridomas that were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Immunoaffinity-purified F11 and NrCAM were conjugated to red fluorescent microspheres of 0.5 μm in diameter according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bioclean, Duke Scientific Corp., Palo Alto, CA), and residual binding sites were blocked by bovine serum albumin. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with F11- or NgCAM-encoding plasmids using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (8Brümmendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 51Buchstaller A. Kunz S. Berger P. Kunz B. Ziegler U. Rader C. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1593-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After 24 h, transfected cells were transferred to poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml)-coated eight-well multitest slides (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), grown overnight, and then incubated with 30 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum containing 0.3 μl of microsphere solution. For competition binding assays, NrCAM-coated microspheres were allowed to bind to F11-expressing COS7 cells in the absence or presence of TN-R (10 μg/ml), TN-C (20 μg/ml), NgCAM (20 μg/ml), NrCAM (20 μg/ml), TN-R FNIII 2 and 3 (50 μg/ml), or TN-R FNIII 4 to A (50 μg/ml). In parallel, NgCAM-expressing COS7 cells were incubated with F11-coated microspheres in the absence or presence of soluble proteins as described above. For sandwich binding assays, F11-coated microspheres were incubated with F11-expressing COS7 cells in the absence or presence of TN-R (10 μg/ml), TN-C (20 μg/ml), NgCAM (20 μg/ml), TN-R FNIII 2 and 3 (50 μg/ml), or TN-R FNIII 4 to A (50 μg/ml). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for F11 expression by indirect immunofluorescence using polyclonal antibodies to F11 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, FRG). Images were analyzed for red fluorescence, indicating microsphere binding to the cell surface, and for green fluorescence, indicating F11 or NgCAM expression. For quantification, double fluorescence detection was performed with a confocal microscope (MRC 1024; Bio-Rad). Digital images were analyzed using the public domain NIH IMAGE program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet) as detailed previously (52Volkmer H. Leuschner R. Zacharias U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). F11- or NgCAM-expressing cells were marked, and the mean pixel intensity of fluorescing cells was determined as a measure for F11 or NgCAM expression. The red channel analysis was overlaid with the same frames, and mean pixel intensity was measured to quantify microsphere binding. Microsphere binding to about 20 cells/experiment was normalized to F11 or NgCAM expression, and background values measured over cells that did not express F11 or NgCAM were subtracted. Culture dishes (Petriperm; Bachhofer, Reutlingen, Germany) were coated with 100 μl of affinity-purified F11 (2 μg/ml), NgCAM (10 μg/ml), axonin-1 (10 μg/ml), laminin (10 μg/ml), and bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml) that was spread over 1 cm2 delineated by a silicon fitting at 4 °C overnight. Note that in previously published experiments, 10 μl of a F11 solution at a concentration of 100 μg/ml was used for coating (10Morales G. Hubert M. Brümmendorf T. Treubert U. Tárnok A. Schwarz U. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1113-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Nörenberg U. Hubert M. Brümmendorf T. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Residual binding sites were blocked by washing and incubating with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C. Single cell suspensions were obtained by dissociation of chick tecta of embryonic day 6 in a trypsin solution (1 mg/ml, 20 min at 37 °C) and subsequent trituration. After resuspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum, 15,000 cells/well were plated on immobilized F11 and grown in the absence or presence of TN-R (0.6–50 μg/ml), TN-C (1.2–20 μg/ml), NrCAM (20 μg/ml), F11 (20 μg/ml), or axonin-1 (20 μg/ml). Monoclonal antibodies to β1 integrin W1B10 and JG22 were added at the time of plating at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml each. All other monoclonal antibodies and Fab fragments of polyclonal antibodies to different proteins were used at a final concentration of 10 and 200 μg/ml, respectively. For preincubation studies, immobilized F11 was incubated with TN-R (10 μg/ml) or TN-C (20 μg/ml) after blocking for 1 h at 37 °C. Unbound TN-R and TN-C were removed by extensive washing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum prior to the addition of cells. After cultivation for 40 h, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline and stained by indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody A2B5 and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies (Dianova; Hamburg, FRG). The number of attached cells and the number of extending neurites were quantified with Genias imaging software (Image Works; Teltow, Germany (52Volkmer H. Leuschner R. Zacharias U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) and calculated as the percentage of control cultures. An interesting feature of axonal IgSF members and ECM glycoproteins is their complex binding pattern. The binding sites for NrCAM, NgCAM, TN-R, and TN-C have been mapped to a similar region of the F11 polypeptide comprising Ig domains 1–4. This makes it important to evaluate whether these proteins can bind simultaneously to F11 or compete with each other for identical or overlapping regions within the F11 polypeptide. To address this question, we established a competitive cellular binding assay and analyzed the interaction between F11 and NrCAM and between F11 and NgCAM in the presence or absence of soluble TN-R, TN-C, NgCAM, or NrCAM (Fig. 1). Binding of microspheres was quantified and related to the expression of F11 using a confocal microscope as described previously (Fig.1 G) (52Volkmer H. Leuschner R. Zacharias U. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). No direct binding of NrCAM or of NgCAM to TN-R or to TN-C, respectively, has been detected so far in different binding assays (8Brümmendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As described previously, NrCAM-coated beads bound to F11-expressing COS7 cells but not to untransfected cells within the same culture (Fig. 1 A) (10Morales G. Hubert M. Brümmendorf T. Treubert U. Tárnok A. Schwarz U. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1113-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The presence of soluble TN-R or TN-C led to a significant reduction in NrCAM bead binding to F11-transfected COS7 cells as depicted in Fig. 1, B, D, and G. This inhibitory effect of TN-R and TN-C was dose-dependent and could be specifically abolished by the addition of Fab fragments of polyclonal antibodies to TN-R or TN-C, respectively (data not shown). In contrast, soluble NgCAM (which is known to bind to F11 (8Brümmendorf T. Hubert M. Treubert U. Leuschner R. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 711-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar)) did not have a similar inhibitory effect on the binding of NrCAM beads to F11-expressing COS7 cells (Fig. 1, C and G). The addition of the recombinant TN-R fragment FNIII 2 and 3 comprising the F11 binding site within TN-R (15Nörenberg U. Hubert M. Brümmendorf T. Tárnok A. Rathjen F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) did not suppress NrCAM bead binding to F11-expressing COS7 cells (Fig.1, E and G), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of intact TN-R on NrCAM binding is probably caused by steric hindrance. The interaction between F11 and NgCAM was analyzed by quantifying the binding of F11-coated microspheres to NgCAM expressing COS7 cells (Fig.1 I). Similar to the NrCAM-F11 interaction described above, the addition of soluble TN-R and TN-C resulted in a significant reduction of F11 coated beads to bind to NgCAM expressing COS7 cells (Fig. 1 I). However, in this assay system the recombinant TN-R fragment FNIII 2–3 was able to mimic the inhibitory effect of intact TN-R, which was not observed for the TN-R fragments FNIII 4 to A, indicating further specificity. As expected, the addition of soluble F11 could compete for bead binding in the F11-NrCAM and in the F11-NgCAM binding assay (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the ECM glycoprotein TN-R or TN-C can block binding of the IgSF members NrCAM or NgCAM to F11 probably by competing for overlapping binding sites and/or by steric hindrance as illustrated in Fig. 1, H and J. TN-R and TN-C might therefore regulate functional interactions of the F11 polypeptide. Previous studies by us have shown that tectal cells extend long neurites on immobilized F11, and the cellular receptor mediating neurite extension has been identified as NrCAM (10Morales G. Hubert M.

https://openalex.org/W2020328212,"We characterize the mouse gene imap38 and its inducibility by Plasmodium chabaudi malaria among different lymphoid tissues and mouse strains of different H-2 complex and non-H-2 background.Imap38 is a single copy gene assigned to chromosome 6B. It consists of only one exon of 1900 base pairs encoding a highly basic 25.8-kDa protein. Confocal laser scanning microscopy localizes differently tagged IMAP38 proteins in nuclei of transfected cells. Reporter gene assays reveal that the 1730-base pair 5′-flanking region, containing an RSINE1 repeat immediately adjacent to initiation site +1, exhibits promoter activity in nonmurine cells, while it is largely repressed in diverse mouse cell lines, which corresponds to the situation in mouse tissues. P. chabaudi malaria induces imap38 expression almost exclusively in the spleen but not in other lymphoid organs. Parasite lysates are able to induce imap38 in the spleen, but not in spleen cells ex vivo. Activation of spleen cells by LPS and other stimuli is not sufficient to induce imap38. Inducibility of imap38 requires signals from both parasites and the intact spleen, and it is controlled by genes of that non-H-2 background, which also controls development of protective immunity against P. chabaudi malaria. We characterize the mouse gene imap38 and its inducibility by Plasmodium chabaudi malaria among different lymphoid tissues and mouse strains of different H-2 complex and non-H-2 background.Imap38 is a single copy gene assigned to chromosome 6B. It consists of only one exon of 1900 base pairs encoding a highly basic 25.8-kDa protein. Confocal laser scanning microscopy localizes differently tagged IMAP38 proteins in nuclei of transfected cells. Reporter gene assays reveal that the 1730-base pair 5′-flanking region, containing an RSINE1 repeat immediately adjacent to initiation site +1, exhibits promoter activity in nonmurine cells, while it is largely repressed in diverse mouse cell lines, which corresponds to the situation in mouse tissues.

Remarkably, however, this immunity is unable to prevent parasitemia during malaria season, but it can completely suppress disease symptoms (1Playfair J.H.L. Taverne J. Bate C.A.W. de Souza J.B. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 25-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 2Kwiatkowski D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The spleen plays a central role in immunity against blood stage malaria (3Wyler D.J. Lymphology. 1983; 16: 121-127PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yap G.S. Stevenson M.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4219-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Alves H.J. Weidanz W. Weiss L. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1996; 55: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is the major site of (i) elimination of parasite-infected erythrocytes via erythrophagocytosis, (ii) elaboration of protective immune mechanisms, and (iii) hypersensitivity reactions manifesting themselves as spleen enlargement (6Crane G.G. Parasitol. Today. 1986; 2: 4-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), not infrequently resulting in fatal spleen rupture (7Touze J.E. Garnatel E. Mortel G. Ducourau J.P. Beate D. Zimmermannn J.E. Aubry P. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1989; 83: 161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the events occurring in the spleen in context with survival and disease are not yet really understood. A convenient model to study the role of the spleen in malaria is the murine malaria Plasmodium chabaudi, which shares several common characteristics with the most dangerous human parasite P. falciparum, causing malaria tropica (8Phillips R.S. Brannan L.R. Balmer P. Neuville P. Parasite Immunol. 1997; 19: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Blood stage infections with P. chabaudi take a self-healing course in female C57BL/10 mice, which subsequently become immune against homologous rechallenge (9Wunderlich F. Helwig M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 499-500PubMed Google Scholar). Self-healing and, thus, the development of protective immunity is controlled by genes of the H-2 complex, genes of the non-H-2 background, and gender and testosterone, respectively (10Wunderlich F. Helwig M. Mossmann H. Schillinger G. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wunderlich F. Marinovski P. Benten W.P.M. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mossmann H. Parasite Immunol. 1991; 13: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The spleen dramatically increases in size during acute malaria, and it remains enlarged in immune mice. We have shown that spleen enlargement and development of protective immunity in C57BL/10 mice correlate with expression of the novel gene iap38 (12Krücken J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Markmann-Mulisch U. Wunderlich F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), recently renamed imap38. Noninfected mice express only very low levels of imap38, whereas its expression is increased by about 50-fold in the spleen of P. chabaudi immune mice. The imap38 gene remains constitutively expressed at such a high level in the spleens of immune mice even after 13 weeks, when parasites have already been eliminated for more than 8–10 weeks. Only the cDNA of imap38 has been preliminary characterized to date. This study is aimed at characterizing the imap38 gene and its inducibility in more detail. Mice of the inbred strains C57BL/10, B10.A, B10.D2, C57BL/6, BALB/c, and DBA2/J were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions in our animal facilities. P. chabaudi malaria was maintained in NMRI mice by weekly passage as described previously (11Wunderlich F. Marinovski P. Benten W.P.M. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mossmann H. Parasite Immunol. 1991; 13: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). P. chabaudi-parasitized erythrocytes (1 × 106/500 μl of PBS1) were intraperitoneally injected in mice. Parasitemia and cell number were determined as described previously (11Wunderlich F. Marinovski P. Benten W.P.M. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mossmann H. Parasite Immunol. 1991; 13: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Immune mice were those at 9 weeks after infection with P. chabaudi (13Wunderlich F. Benten W.P.M. Bettenhäuser U. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mossmann H. Parasite Immunol. 1992; 14: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA isolated from kidneys of female C57BL/10 mice was digested with restriction enzymes, separated in 0.7% agarose gels, and blotted by a downward alkaline transfer method (14Chomczynski P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out using the Ecl 136II/Eco RI-fragment (positions 2185–3240) of the cDNA as a probe as described recently (12Krücken J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Markmann-Mulisch U. Wunderlich F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from spleen, other lymphoid tissues, and cells (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Northern blots using 20 μg of glyoxylated total RNA were performed as described recently (12Krücken J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Markmann-Mulisch U. Wunderlich F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Evaluation of autoradiograms was done by densitometric scanning with Quantiscan software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Libraries for amplification of flanking sequences were constructed as described by Siebert et al. (16Siebert P.D. Chenchik A. Kellogg D.E. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1087-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). After digesting genomic DNA with Alu I, Bsh 1236I, Ecl 136II, Pvu II, Rsa I, or Sma I, adapters were ligated to the blunt ends. The first PCR contained 0.3 μm Ap-1 (5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and Walk-1a primer (5′-CTCTCCTTTCTGCATTTGGATTCTCTGTGC-3′), 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 3.75 units of Expand High Fidelity DNA-polymerase mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 μl of 1× Expand High Fidelity buffer with Mg2+. A second round of PCR was performed with the nested primers Ap-2 (5′-CTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) and Walk-1b (5′-GCAGATGCTCCTGCTGACGTTTCACAAAAT-3′) and 1 μl of a 1:100 dilution of the first reaction as template. Both PCR reactions were programmed 2 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 8 min at 68 °C, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Products were analyzed on agarose gels; bands were eluted and cloned into pMOS Blue (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Genomic DNA digested with Taq I was circularized at a final concentration of 3 μg/ml (17Silver J. McPhearson M.J. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR: A Practical Approach. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 137-146Google Scholar) with T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas, St. Leon Roth, Germany), and 3-μl aliquots were used as template for PCR under conditions as described before with primers Walk-1a and Walk-2a (5′-GTATGAGCTGGTGCAGGACACGCGGTGCGCTGACC-3′). Then 1 μl of the first reaction was reamplified with Walk-1b and Walk-2b (5′-TACTGGAAGGGCTGGAGGCGTGGTTTCTCTGTCTT-3′). The PCR product was eluted from agarose gels and directly sequenced. The transcribed region of the imap38 gene was amplified using the primers IAPGes-1 (5′-GTTTGCCCCCTAAGTAAATAAAAGGTAATAAAATA-3′) and IAPGes-2 (5′-TCGACCAGCAAGAACGACACGACCACCAGT-3′). The reaction contained 0.3 μm of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 200 ng of genomic DNA, and 3.75 units of Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix in 50 μl of 1× buffer. After 5 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 63 °C, 6 min at 72 °C were performed, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The product was cloned into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). The 129/ola mouse cosmid library (library no. 121) constructed from genomic DNA of 129/ola mice was screened using the Ecl 136II/Eco RI fragment as probe by the service facilities of the German Human Genome Project (Heidelberg). Restriction fragments of a positive clone were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Sequence reactions were performed with the Fluorescent-Labeled-Cycle-Sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using infrared fluorescence-labeled primers (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) and analyzed in a LICOR4000 DNA sequencer.

Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Repetitive elements in DNA sequences were identified using the program CENSOR (23Jurka J. Klonowski P. Dagman V. Pelton P. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The TRANSFAC data base (24Heinemeyer T. Wingender E. Reuter I. Hermjakob H. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Ignatieva E.V. Ananko E.A. Podkolodnaya O.A. Kolpakov F.A. Podkolodny N.L. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar) was searched using the program MatInspector (Genomatrix, München, Germany). Chromosomal mapping was performed according to a previously described protocol (25Lichter P. Tang C.J. Call K. Hermanson G. Evans G.A. Housman D. Ward D.C. Science. 1990; 247: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). 80 ng of the biotin-labeled cosmid DNA (MPGc121K124460Q2) were combined with 3 μg of mouse Cot1 DNA and 7 μg of salmon sperm DNA in a 12-μl hybridization mixture. Mouse metaphase chromosomes were prepared from spleen cells of a female Balb/c mouse following a standard procedure (26Sawyer J. Moore M. Hozier J. Chromosoma. 1987; 95: 350-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Following hybridization for 17 h at 37 °C and posthybridization washes, the hybridized probes were detected via FITC-conjugated avidin. Chromosomes were banded by staining with 4,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Digitized images of emitted 4,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride and FITC fluorescence were recorded separately using a CCD camera (Photometrics), carefully aligned, and electronically overlaid. Reverse ligation-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used according to a modification of protocols previously described (27Fromont-Racine M. Bertrand E. Pictet R. Grange T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1683-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 28Liu X.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Poly(A+)-RNA (10 μg) from spleens of immune female C57BL/10 mice was dephosphorylated with 3 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C for 2 h. After heat inactivation of the enzyme and precipitation of the RNA, the pyrophosphate bond in the 5′-cap was hydrolyzed by incubation with 10 units of tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Epicentre, Hess. Oldendorf, Germany) in 10 μl at 37 °C for 2 h before reprecipitation. The RNA adapter 5′-CUAAUACGACUCACUAUAGGGCUCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGU-3′ was ligated to the 5′-ends at 16 °C for 24 h in a final volume of 10 μl containing 1 mm hexaminecobalt(III) chloride, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 μg of RNA adapter, 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), and 10 units of T4 RNA ligase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions, 0.5 μl of the ligation reaction were reverse-transcribed in 25 μl of 1× RT buffer (Titan One Tube RT-PCR System, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with Mg2+, containing 2.6 μm random hexamer primers, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, and 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 15 min, at 55 °C for 60 min, and at 95 °C for 5 min. The following PCRs used the primers described above for panhandle vectorette PCR. 25 μl of 1× RT buffer with Mg2+ containing 0.4 μm Ap-1 and Walk-1a, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 3.75 units of Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix were added, and, after a 2-min denaturation at 94 °C, 35 cycles were performed for 15 s at 94 °C, 4 min 68 °C, and a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. A nested PCR was performed with 1 μl of the first reaction as template and primers Ap-2 and Walk-1b. PCR products were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cloned into pMOS Blue, plated on isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside-containing LB/Amp/Tet agar plates, and 40 white clones were picked and sequenced. The TNT T7/T3 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to transcribe and translate the plasmids iapG2 and iapΔ289 in the presence of35S-labeled cysteine and methionine (ICN, Eschwege, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and fluorographed using Amplify fluorography solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Kodak BioMax MR film with intensifier screen. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity in media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Deisendorf, Germany) was used for COS-7 (ATCC CRL-1651), L929 (ATCC CCL-1), and NIH/3T3 (ATCC CRL-1658) cells; RPMI 1640 medium was used for RAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB-71) cells; Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium was used for IC-21 (ATCC TIB-186) cells; and Ham's F-12 medium was used for CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL-61) cells. Spleen cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 containing 50 μm2-mercaptoethanol. The vector pMyc6×His was derived from pSecTag A (Invitrogen, Leeg, NL) by digestion with Sfi I and Nhe I, followed by blunting and religation to eliminate the secretion signal. The coding region and the 5′-UTR of imap38 were amplified from clone iapG2 using the upstream primer IAPGes-1 and one of the three downstream primers IAP-frameA (5′-TGACTCGAGGCCTGAGCCTCGCGCTCGCTGCCTGTG-3′), IAP-frameB (5′-TGACTCGAGAGCCTGAGCCTCGCGCTCGCTGCCTGTG-3′) or IAP-frameC (5′-TGACTCGAGAAGCCTGAGCCTCGCGCTCGCTGCCTGTG-3′). PCR products were digested with Hin dIII and Xho I, cutting in the 5′-UTR and the downstream primer, respectively, and inserted between the Hin dIII and Xho I sites in pMyc6×His. The plasmids were designated pIMAPMycA, -B, and -C. The plasmid pEGFP-IMAP was constructed by amplifying the coding region of imap38 with the primers 5′-GGAAGATCTATGCAGAAAGGAGAGACG-3′ and 5′-CTAACACGCTAGCGGTCTGTTATTCTGCTCCCC-3′. The PCR product was digested with Bgl II and Eco RI, cutting in the upstream primer and the 3′-UTR, respectively, and inserted between the Bgl II and Eco RI sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Heidelberg), generating a continuous EGFP-IMAP38 ORF. CHO-K1 cells grown on coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid and 3 μl of FUGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were cultured for 24 h, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. After thorough washings, detection of Myc-tagged proteins by immunofluorescence and Western blotting was performed according to a recently published protocol (31Benten W.P.M. Lieberherr M. Giese G. Wrehlke C. Stamm O. Sekeris C.E. Mossmann H. Wunderlich F. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, a 1:100 dilution of anti-c-Myc (A14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg) and anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugate (working dilution 1:80; Sigma) were used as primary and secondary antibodies. Coverslips were incubated with RNase A (10 μg/ml in PBS) at 37 °C for 1 h and then mounted on slides in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of glycerol and Vectashield (Serva, Heidelberg) containing 2% (w/v) 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)octane (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide. FITC and propidium iodide fluorescence were analyzed using the confocal laser scanning microscope Leica TCS NT version 1.5.451 (Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg) after excitation with the 488-nm argon laser line. Optical sections of 0.5-μm intervals were evaluated using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and Corel Draw 8. For Western blotting, the anti-c-Myc antibody (A14) was used at a working concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:25,000 in TST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) was used as a secondary antibody. Blood was obtained from mice with parasitemia higher than 40%. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and parasites were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles between −80 and 37 °C followed by treatment with an ultrasound microtip (Sonifier B12, Branson Sonic Power Company, Danbury, CT) three times for 5 s. Contol lysates had equivalent concentrations of total erythrocytes but were prepared from uninfected mice. Extracts were stored at −20 °C. Spleens were aseptically removed from B10.A mice, and single cell suspensions were prepared as described previously (13Wunderlich F. Benten W.P.M. Bettenhäuser U. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Mossmann H. Parasite Immunol. 1992; 14: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106/ml in culture medium containing 2 μg/ml concanavalin A (Sigma) and cultured for 48 h. Supernatants were centrifuged at 800 × g, passed through 0.2-μm filters (Nunc, Wiesbaden), and stored at −80 °C. Mice were treated with 500 μl of PBS containing P. chabaudi lysates, heat-inactivated Salmonella typhimurium, or LPS from Salmonella typhosa by intraperitoneal injection. Expression of imap38 in spleens was analyzed either 24 h after a single injection or on day 7 after injections on days 0 and 4. Spleen cells were cultivated for 5 h to 3 days in the presence of 1 × 10−7m A23187 (Sigma), 1.6 × 10−8m phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma), 50 μg/ml anti-CD3 (clone 145–2C11; Pharmingen, Hamburg. Germany), 0.1–4 μg/ml LPS from S. thyphosa (Sigma), 2 μg/ml concanavalin A, 100 units/ml IFN-γ, 1 × 105to 1 × 108 lysed P. chabaudi, and 10% serum from infected B10.A mice or 10% spleen cell conditioned medium. Promoter activity was tested after transient transfection using secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as reporter gene. The 1872-bp Hin dIII fragment from plasmid H/H1.87kb was inserted in the 5′ → 3′ direction into the Hin dIII site of pSEAP2Basic (CLONTECH, Heidelberg). This clone was designated as −1730/146iapSEAP. Vectors pSEAP2Basic and pSEAP2Control were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. This plasmid was digested with Xho I followed by digestion with Nhe I, Pvu II (partial digestion), or Bsp 120I. DNA ends were blunted and religated to give rise to −794/146iapSEAP, −576/146iapSEAP, and −312/146iapSEAP, respectively. The construct −1730/96iapSEAP was obtained by digesting −1730/146iapSEAP with Eco RI and religation of the vector. To delete the RSINE1 element from the imap38 promoter, the sequences flanking the SINE were amplified along with the plasmid. 50-μl reactions containing 0.3 μm of the primers ΔSINE(−) 5′-AAATACTGATACCCAGTTAATTCCCCATCC-3′ and ΔSINE(+) 5′-GGACATGGCTGTTTGCCCCCTAAGTAAAT-3′, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 10 ng of plasmid H/H1.87kb, and 3.75 units of Expand High Fidelity in 1× buffer were denatured for 5 min at 94 °C. After 30 cycles 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 5 min at 72 °C, a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min was performed. The parent plasmid was digested by the addition of 10 units of Dpn I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. The PCR product was religated, the resulting plasmid −1730/146ΔSINEBluescript was digested with Hin dIII, and the promoter fragment was inserted in pSEAP2Basic, resulting in −1730/146ΔSINEiapSEAP. Plasmids for transfections were purified by anion exchange chromatography (Qiagen), and endotoxin contaminations were removed on Detoxi-Gel columns (Pierce, St. Augustin, Germany). For assays, cells were seeded in 48-well plates and transfected using 0.1 μg of DNA and 0.3 μl of FUGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per well. Transfections were done in triplicate, and each experiment was reproduced 4–6 times. After 3 days, supernatants were removed, and SEAP activity was determined with the Phospha-Light kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix, Weiterstadt, Germany). Chemiluminescence was measured in a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) as relative light units (RLU). Relative promoter activity was calculated as follows: (RLU−1730/146iapSEAP − RLUpSEAP2Basic) × 100/(RLUpSEAP2Control − RLUpSEAP2Basic). For stimulation experiments, IC-21 and RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with −1730/146iapSEAP for 24 h. These cells were stimulated by final concentrations of 1 μg/ml LPS, 1 × 106 lysed P. chabaudi, or 10% spleen cell conditioned medium. After 48 h, culture medium was removed for determination of SEAP and nitrite. Supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 ×g and mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (1:1 mixture of 2% sulfanilamide (Sigma) in phosphoric acid and 0.2%N-(1-naphtyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma)). Nitrite concentration was calculated from the A540 by comparison with an NaNO2standard curve in culture medium. Genomic clones containing the complete sequence of the imap38 gene were obtained from C57BL/10 mice by genomic PCR and from 129/ola mice by screening of a cosmid library. In the latter, we identified the two positive clones MPGc121K12460Q2 and MPGc121B23596Q2. A Hin dIII fragment and a Hin dIII/Sca I fragment were subcloned from MPGc121K12460Q2 and termed H/H1.87kb and H/Sc2.68kb, respectively. The two latter clones span a region of 4552 bp (Fig.1 A). The genomic PCR fragments RSA, INV, and iapG2 showed 100% identity with the cosmid derived clones over their entire length of 2990 bp. The genomic sequence and the published imap38 cDNA sequence, identical with iapΔ289 in Fig. 1, could be perfectly aligned without interruption, except for an additional cytosine in position 2336 corresponding to position 606 in the original imap38 cDNA sequence (12Krücken J. Schmitt-Wrede H.-P. Markmann-Mulisch U. Wunderlich F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This additional cytosine in a very GC-rich context could also be resolved by resequencing the original imap38 cDNA with an automatic sequencer using a high resolution gel matrix. The perfect alignment indicates that the imap38 gene contains no intron. Transcriptional initiation sites were mapped using high resolution reverse ligation-mediated RACE. 40 PCR-generated clones were randomly picked and sequenced. 14 clones contained specific amplification products, each representing the 5′-end of an imap38 mRNA. Six clones began in position 1731, two in position 1790, and six in position 1823. This indicates that the imap38 gene possesses three start sites, with the distal and proximal site being 92 bp apart. Position 1731 is hereby defined as +1. The GC content of the imap38 5′-flanking region is 50.5%, which is slightly lower than the overall GC content of 51.4%. In the coding region (between positions 2154 and 2894; see below) the portion of GC base pairs is very high, reaching 63.1%. Using the program CENSOR, we identified three truncated repetitive elements in the imap38 gene: (i) a RSINE1 element with 74% similarity to its consensus sequence in positions −131 to −11 in the proximal promoter; (ii) a retroviral RLTR10A-element with 89% similarity to the consensus in positions +1579 to +1927 bp, surrounding the polyadenylation signal and site of the imap38 gene; (iii) a long interspersed element of the Lx7 family in positions +2246 to +2523 bp with 61% similarity to the consensus. Southern blotting revealed that the imap38 gene is a single copy gene (Fig. 1 B). The bands in Eco RI- and Taq I-digested DNA correspond to the size predicted from the genomic sequence, confirming that the cloned intronless DNA sequence represents the only imap38 sequence in the genome. The chromosomal localization of the imap38 gene was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization to mouse metaphase chromosomes. Microscopic evaluation of the hybridization experiments revealed strong fluorescent signals on mouse chromosome 6. In 93% (27 of 29) of the evaluated metaphase cells, the fluorescent signals were detected on both homologues of chromosome 6 in the distal portion of band B (Fig.1 C). No additional signals in other regions of the mouse genome were observed, thus indicating that the imap38 gene is localized on chromosome 6B. The longest mature imap38 transcript amounts to 1900 nucleotides and contains two long overlapping ORFs. The first long ORF starts in position 424 at the fourth AUG codon and encodes a polypeptide of 246 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25.8 kDa and a predicted pI of 10.2 (Fig.2). The other long ORF starts in position 632 at the eighth AUG-codon of the mRNA, coding for a 277-amino acid-long protein with a molecular mass of 31 kDa. The amino acid sequences of both deduced proteins did not show any significant similarity to other known proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base. Start codons of both ORFs are not surrounded by a Kozak sequence for optimal initiation of translation (32Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). To examine which one of the two long ORFs is used, we subjected two different constructs to in vitro transcription and translation (i.e. the clones iapΔ289 and iapG2). The latter contains the whole 5′-UTR starting at position +1, whereas the 5′-UTR is truncated in iapΔ289, and AUG424 is the first start codon. This deletion includes the removal of three short upstream ORFs encoding peptides of 3, 10, and 33 amino acids. In SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the in vitro translation products of iapΔ289 always yielded two bands, a strong band at 26 kDa and a faint band at 23 kDa. The intensity of the latter varied from experiment to experiment (Fig.3 A). Presumably, the 26-kDa product was produced by initiation at AUG424, whereas the 23-kDa product was derived from the second or third AUG in th"

We compared the effects of interaction with distinct autonomic targets on the molecular and biophysical differentiation of 'upstream' neuron–neuron synapses. Contact with cardiac tissue induced expression of nicotinic receptor channels (nAChRs) distinct from those induced by renal tissue in presynaptic autonomic neurons. The kinetics of cholinergic currents at interneuronal synapses are dictated by the peripheral target contacted. Analysis of the nAChR channel subtypes and subunits in individual neurons demonstrated that the profile of transmitter receptors expressed at mature neuron–neuron synapses develops from the convergent influences of input-derived (anterograde) and target-specific (retrograde) signals.
https://openalex.org/W2040966527,"In a previous study, we showed that nitric oxide donors and <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine, either alone or in combination, inhibited the activation of several mitogen-activated protein kinases by angiotensin II in rat cardiac fibroblasts (Wang, D., Yu, X., and Brecher, P. (1998) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 273, 33027–33034). In the present study, we have focused on the mechanism by which nitric oxide exerts this effect on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We contrasted the effects of nitric oxide on ERK activation by angiotensin II and epidermal growth factor (EGF), since the transactivation of the EGF receptor has been implicated as a response to angiotensin II. We found that nitric oxide inhibited ERK activation by angiotensin II but did not inhibit the relatively slight but significant transactivation of the EGF receptor by angiotensin II. The tyrphostin AG1478, known to inhibit EGF receptor phosphorylation, also inhibited the angiotensin II and EGF-induced activation of ERK, the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, and the subsequent association of Shc and Grb2. Nitric oxide did not affect either EGF receptor phosphorylation or Shc-Grb2 activation induced by either Ang II or EGF. However, the activation of the calcium-sensitive tyrosine kinase PYK2, which occurred in response to angiotensin II, but not EGF, was inhibited by nitric oxide. The data suggested that PYK2 activation may be an important inhibitory site in signaling pathways affected by nitric oxide."

This effect was shown to involve activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and was inhibited by overexpression of the βγ-sequestrant, transducin. Somatostatin-induced proliferation was abolished by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD 98059, whereas the Src inhibitor, PP1, had no effect. A marked increase was observed in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2) 10 min after sst4 receptor activation, which was blocked by pertussis toxin, decreased by PP1 and the βγ-sequestrant, but unaffected by PD 98059. In contrast, the somatostatin-induced phosphorylation of ERK obtained at 4 h, although sensitive to both pertussis toxin and transducin, was unaffected by PP1 but ablated by PD 98059. Protein kinase C inhibition also abolished this somatostatin-induced sustained phosphorylation of ERK, together with the associated increase in cell proliferation. Expression of dominant negative Ras (N17) failed to significantly reduce the proliferative effect mediated by the sst4 receptor but markedly attenuated the acute phase of the somatostatin-induced phosphorylation of ERK obtained at 10 min. In contrast, the phosphorylation induced at 4 h was unaffected. We conclude that ERK activation by Gi/o-coupled sst4receptors involves a Src and Ras-dependent acute phase, but the proliferative response is dependent upon the prolonged ERK-induced activity, mediated by protein kinase C.

The growth inhibitory effects of somatostatin are well documented as it is considered to be the physiological regulator of growth hormone release (2Lamberts S.W.J. Oosterom R. Neufeld M. Del Pozo E.

As well as reducing the circulatory levels of several other potential mitogenic hormones and growth factors (3Gerich J.E. Am. J.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), somatostatin stimulates proliferation in the absence of serum but inhibits the growth of proliferating cells.Little is known as to the identity of the receptor types mediating the proliferative or antiproliferative responses of somatostatin in tissues, and information has been restricted to studies involving partially selective receptor analogues (16Lauder H. Sellers L.A. Fan T-P.D. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Activation of either mouse recombinant sst2 or sst5 receptors, however, has been shown to inhibit serum-induced proliferation (17Buscail L. Estève J-P. Saint-Laurent N. Bertrand V. Reisine T. O'Carroll A-M. Bell G.I. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), whereas stimulation of the human recombinant sst4 receptor type induces proliferation in the absence of other mitogenic agents (18Sellers L.A. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Lauder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16423-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the recently cloned rat sst2(b) receptor splice variant has also been shown to induce a proliferative response, in marked contrast to the antiproliferative property mediated by the rat sst2(a) receptor following recombinant expression in the same host cell line (19Alderton F. Fan T-P.D. Schindler M. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1630-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The molecular determinants that mediate the proliferative outcome of somatostatin receptors have not yet been fully clarified. All five human receptor types are functionally coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (20Patel Y.C. Greenwood M.T. Warszynska A. Panetta R. Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and can mediate phospholipase C activation with subsequent calcium mobilization (21Akbar M. Okajima F. Tomura H. Majid M.A. Yamada Y. Seino S. Kondo Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Stimulation of sst1 and sst2 receptors has been shown to activate a protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity (22Buscail L. Delesque N. Estève J-P. Saint-Laurent N. Prats H. Clerc P. Robberecht P. Bell G.I. Liebow C. Schally A.V. Vaysse N. Susini C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2315-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that such an activity may counteract the growth-promoting properties of receptors containing an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain (23Pan M.G. Florio T. Stork P.J.S. Science. 1992; 256: 1215-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated proliferation by activation of human sst1receptors has also been proposed to be due to the induction of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21cip1/WAF1, shown in a recombinant system following the synergistic activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 by the growth factor in the presence of somatostatin (24Florio T. Yao H. Carey K.D. Dillon T.J. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of recombinantly expressed sst4 receptors by somatostatin gives rise to both a marked transient increase as well as a sustained period of ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation (18Sellers L.A. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Lauder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16423-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ERK phoshorylation at threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 are widely used indices of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation by the ERK kinase, MEK1. We have also provided evidence using a somatostatin analogue that induces only transient phosphorylation of ERK following sst4 receptor activation that it is the sustained component of MAP kinase activity that is critical for the induced proliferative response. Other Giprotein-coupled receptors (25van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) have recently been shown to utilize the MAP kinase cascade through a Src-dependent mechanism following release of βγ subunits. In this study therefore, we have examined the ability of the human sst4 receptor to activate intracellular signaling components that converge on the MAP kinase cascade and in particular to see if a differential requirement can be demonstrated for their involvement in mediating the acute or prolonged phases of ERK phosphorylation. In addition, the resultant effect on cell proliferation of any change detected in the somatostatin-induced ERK phosphorylation following effector inhibition was evaluated by direct cell counting using a model to determine the re-population of denuded areas in a previously confluent monolayer (16Lauder H. Sellers L.A. Fan T-P.D. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The effect of somatostatin on basal proliferation in the absence of exogenously added mitogenic agents was examined, and responses induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were used as a comparison.DISCUSSIONActivation of the MAP kinase cascade, which in most systems requires Ras and Raf, is a universal downstream response to the stimulation of most receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and has been demonstrated following activation of the G protein-coupled somatostatin sst4 receptor (18Sellers L.A. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Lauder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16423-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Bito H. Mori M. Sakanaka C. Takano T. Honda Z. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12722-12730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a well characterized model to determine the re-population of denuded areas in an otherwise confluent monolayer, we have previously demonstrated that the somatostatin-induced proliferative response of this receptor type depends on the sustained activation of ERK1 and ERK2 and independent of a robust transient phase (18Sellers L.A. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Lauder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16423-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One of the advantages of this model is that cells are synchronized in G0 or early G1of the cell cycle at the onset of the investigative period, and to substantiate that effects are on a proliferative rather than a motogenic process, the total number of cells forming the regenerating monolayer after 24 h in the presence of test agents was determined in the current study. The aim of this investigation was to attempt to identify the transduction effectors involved in mediating the sustained activation of ERK1 and ERK2 by somatostatin sst4 receptors and, hence, those responsible for inducing the proliferative response.The protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and lavendustin A, had no effect on basal cell numbers at concentrations that abolished the increased proliferation induced by bFGF. The signaling cascades activated by bFGF receptors would thus seem dependent on this type of phosphate transfer process for transduction of the proliferative function and is compatible with the well characterized mechanism through which this family of receptors mediate their mitogenic effects (29Heldin C-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). It would also appear that transmission of the growth-promoting activity of sst4 receptors is similarly dependent on a protein-tyrosine kinase activity. However, in contrast to the growth factor receptor, which contains an intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain within the COOH terminus of each subunit forming the active dimer, the site of intervention of these kinase blockers in the transduction process for sst4 receptor-mediated growth must be localized to secondary effectors. The lack of effect of genistein on the somatostatin-induced ERK phosphorylation determined at time points representative of the acute and sustained phases of MAP kinase activation suggests that either a parallel cooperative pathway utilizing a tyrosine kinase is essential for growth or, alternatively, that the kinase lies exclusively downstream from MAP kinase. Evidence for a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway mediating tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 has recently been provided for the sst4 receptor (18Sellers L.A. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. Lauder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16423-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and it may be that the genistein-sensitive effector is situated within this particular cascade (see Fig. 5). Interestingly, it has also been shown in this previous study that only after the additional phosphorylation on serine residues of this same transcription factor as a consequence of prolonged MAP kinase activation, could a proliferative response be induced by somatostatin.The growth-promoting effect of somatostatin is additionally dependent on a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway that distinguishes its proliferative mechanism from that of bFGF. Other Giprotein-coupled receptors have been shown to mediate rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins that participate in mitogenic signal transduction such as the adapter protein Shc (30Cazaubon S.M. Ramos-Morales F. Fischer S. Schweighoffer F. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24805-24809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a major substrate for Src kinase. The mechanism whereby these receptors stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation is poorly understood, although activation of the Src-family kinases by several G protein-coupled receptors has been reported (31Chen Y.H. Pouyssegur J. Courtneidge S.A. van Obberghen Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, activation of Src seems to account for the Gi-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation events that direct recruitment of the Shc and Grb2 adaptor proteins to the membrane (32Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), thus providing a route into the Ras-ERK cascade (Fig. 5).To determine whether activation of the MAP kinase cascade was a prerequisite for processing the growth effects induced by somatostatin, the selective MEK1 inhibitor, PD 98059 (33Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar), was used in the proliferation model. It is well documented that the dual-specific kinase MEK stimulates ERK by phosphorylation on threonine (Thr-183) and tyrosine (Tyr-185) residues, which following subsequent translocation into the nucleus, activates transcription factors, resulting in enhanced cell growth (34Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). In this study, the proliferative effect of somatostatin was abolished by PD 98059, confirming that the MAP kinase cascade is critical for the growth-promoting effect of somatostatin by the sst4 receptor. In contrast, bFGF-stimulated proliferation in the same host cell was only partially inhibited on co-application with PD 98059, which is consistent with the ability of this receptor type to recruit a multitude of secondary effectors and initiate a number of distinct, yet parallel signaling pathways. An involvement of MEK1 in the sst4 receptor-mediated proliferative response was further supported by the demonstration of increased phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 following somatostatin treatment. However, although both the acute and sustained phases of MAP kinase activation were abolished by pertussis toxin, a differential effect on the temporally distinct activities was observed following MEK1 inhibition. Abolition of the sustained phase with PD 98059, although having no observable effect on the transient activity, is supportive evidence for the requirement of the prolonged activation of MAP kinase in mediating cell growth. The lack of effect of the MEK1 inhibitor on the marked transient phosphorylation of ERK is possibly due to the ineffectiveness of the concentration of PD 98059 administered with somatostatin and is in keeping with other reports showing that high levels of MAP kinase activity are PD 98059-insensitive (33Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar).Several Gi-coupled receptors have been shown to mediate MAP kinase activation through the βγ-component of the G protein possibly through the activation of the Src-family of tyrosine kinases (35Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The proliferative response induced by somatostatin was inhibited following overexpression of the βγ-sequestering protein, transducin, in contrast to the lack of effect on bFGF-induced growth. However, the Src-family inhibitor, PP1 (36Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), failed to reduce the proliferative effect induced by either mitogen in this cell line. The bFGF results were somewhat unexpected since it is well known that Src is a co-transducer of mitogenic signals arising from a number of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, such as platelet-derived growth factor or epidermal growth factor receptors (37Broome M.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16798-16806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the association of Src with bFGF receptors appears to be cell-specific (38Roche S. Koegl M. Barone M.V. Roussel M.F. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in this respect, bFGF-induced proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells has been shown to be partially inhibited by the Src inhibitor PP1, as determined by the same model system employed in this current study. 2L. A. Sellers, unpublished data. PP1 in CHO K1 cells transfected with the somatostatin sst4 receptor was shown to reduce platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated growth.The inability of PP1 to inhibit somatostatin-induced proliferation suggests Src is not involved in this response mechanism, and therefore the process through which MEK is activated appears to be very different to that employed by other Gi protein-coupled receptors (35Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). However, further examination of the somatostatin-induced ERK phosphorylation showed that the transient phase was sensitive to the Src inhibitor, in contrast to the PP1-independent prolonged phosphorylation. The attenuation of the transient phosphorylation of ERK by the Src inhibitor without any resultant effect on the proliferative response again suggests that it is the sustained activation of MAP kinase that is critical for proliferation. In addition, the sensitivity of the transient and not the prolonged phase of ERK phosphorylation to Src-inhibition provides evidence that different transduction events are involved in mediating the temporally distinct MAP kinase activities. The involvement of Src in mediating the acute phase of ERK phosphorylation and the insensitivity of this component to genistein seem incompatible. However, genistein is a nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and it may be that in this system, Src activity is unaffected by the concentration of genistein used.The mechanisms by which Gi and Gq-coupled receptors typically activate MAP kinase are through Ras-dependent or protein kinase C-dependent pathways, respectively. However, a few exceptions to this rule have been recently reported for Gq-coupled receptors in that MAP kinase can be activated through a pertussis toxin-insensitive but protein kinase C-independent pathway (39Charlesworth A.

In this study, we have demonstrated that the transient phosphorylation of ERK by sst4 receptors is sensitive to both transducin and dominant negative Ras (N17) but unaffected following protein kinase C inhibition. These results are also in accord with the βγ-mediated Src stimulation utilized by other Gi-coupled receptors to activate MAP kinase through a Ras-dependent mechanism (Fig.5). In addition, these data are also consistent with the acute phase of MAP kinase activity not being involved in mediating a growth response, as expression of N17Ras had no effect on somatostatin-induced proliferation or the prolonged activation of MAP kinase.Since it appears that the sustained activation of MAP kinase, required for the somatostatin-induced proliferative effect, utilizes a distinct but convergent pathway to that mediating the transient Ras-dependent ERK phosphorylation, we examined the involvement of protein kinase C, which can activate the Ras-ERK cascade at the point of Raf (40Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 249-252Crossref Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Both the proliferation and sustained phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 induced by somatostatin were abolished following protein kinase C blockade. This suggests that protein kinase C involvement is critical for the growth response and is placed upstream to ERK activation, consistent with other reports investigating MAP kinase stimulation through Gq-coupled receptors (39Charlesworth A. Rozengurt E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated activation of Raf-1 is coupled to Ras, and bFGF-induced proliferation of CHO K1 cells used in this study was N17Ras-sensitive together with both the acute and sustained phases of ERK phosphorylation. By contrast, protein kinase C-mediated activation of Raf-1 is thought to be Ras-independent and is in keeping with the lack of effect on the prolonged MAP kinase phosphorylation and the induced proliferative response observed in this study following application of somatostatin to cells overexpressing N17Ras. Activation of Raf-1 by protein kinase C has been shown to be insensitive to dominant negative Ras (41Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), indicating that protein kinase C activates Raf by a mechanism distinct from that initiated by activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Although in this study the acute phase of ERK phosphorylation induced by bFGF was unaffected by a protein kinase C inhibitor, the sustained component was reduced, and the proliferative effect was abolished. It thus appears that it is the sustained ERK activity that is also critical for bFGF to induce cell proliferation. However, in contrast to that following sst4 receptor activation, the sustained phase of ERK phosphorylation induced by bFGF appears to involve both Ras- and protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms, and both seem to be required for the proliferative effect.The protein kinase C family has at least 11 members, 6 of which (δ, ε, γ, ι, μ, ζ) have been shown to be expressed in the CHO K1 cells used in this study.2 Both the typical and atypical protein kinase C isozymes are activated by diacylglycerol, which is produced by the metabolism of phosphatidylinositols. Although sst4 receptors have been shown to mediate inositol 1,4,5,-trisphosphate production (21Akbar M. Okajima F. Tomura H. Majid M.A. Yamada Y. Seino S. Kondo Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it has not been determined here if through βγ release, the subsequent stimulation of phospholipase C-β is mandatory for the sustained ERK phosphorylation induced by somatostatin. Activation of MAP kinase after sst4 receptor stimulation has been shown to be dependent on phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (42Sakanaka C. Ferby I. Waga I. Bito H. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Signaling targets of the lipid products of this kinase activity include the calcium-independent protein kinase C isoforms (43Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that ERK activation through protein kinase C in this study could be via a calcium-independent pathway. Involvement of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase in the prolonged activation of ERK would also be in keeping with the Gβγ dependence of both this and the proliferative events observed after somatostatin application, as a phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase responsive to βγ subunits has recently been cloned (44Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).Very little evidence is currently available as to the identity of the molecular determinants responsible for the sustained activation of MAP kinase. Recently it has been shown that in PC12 cells, Ras must be activated for the initial phase of ERK activation following stimulation of the nerve growth factor receptor (TrkA), but the sustained phase involves another small GTPase, Rap1 (45York R.D.

In this study we have demonstrated that sst4 receptors can stimulate cellular proliferation through transduction mechanisms with a critical requirement for a sustained, protein kinase C-dependent activation of MAP kinase. Stimulation of MAP kinase has been shown to regulate a diverse range of functional responses, sometimes with opposing effects. For example, although we have shown a critical requirement for ERK activity in the sst4 receptor-mediated proliferative effect, this activity also appears to be necessary for the growth inhibitory re"

Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). In humans and mice, many of the Hox genes are clustered on four different chromosomes (HoxA, -B, -C, and -D), and each cluster retains a linear arrangement of the gene that is similar to its Drosophila counterpart. Expression of each Hox gene in the cluster is strictly regulated temporally and spatially during embryogenesis, and the gene located on the more 3′ side of the cluster is expressed in the more anterior part of mouse embryo. Those clustered Hox genes play an important role in specification of position along axes in the developing embryo (1Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). In addition to clustered Hox genes, some Hox genes do not locate in those four cluster regions. Expression of the orphan Hox genes is also tightly regulated temporally and spatially during embryogenesis. The murine Ncx/Enx/Hox11L1 gene (2Dear T.N. Sanchez-Garcia I. Rabbitts T.H. Proc. Natl.

Genomics. 1994; 24: 388-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), is expressed specifically in neural crest-derived tissues such as dorsal root ganglia, cranial ganglia (V, IX, and X), sympathetic ganglia, adrenal medulla, and enteric ganglia (9Hatano M.

Neural crest cells arise from the dorsal part of neural tube and migrate along a number of defined routes to various tissues from embryonic day 9.5. These neural crest cells mainly differentiate into neuronal cells in the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and cephalic mesenchymal cells such as smooth muscle and cartilage (11Selleck M.A. Scherson T.Y. Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since the Ncx mRNA has not been detected in the cell lineage of melanocytes and mesenchymal cells (9Hatano M. Iitsuka Y. Yamamoto H. Dezawa M. Yusa S. Kohno Y. Tokuhisa T. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 195: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it is apparently specifically expressed in a neuronal subset of neural crest-derived tissues. The regulatory mechanisms of expression have remained to be identified. Deregulated expression of the HOX genes can be oncogenic in humans (5Hatano M. Roberts C.W. Minden M. Crist W.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

For example, mice deficient for the Ncx gene developed megacolon with the hyperinnervation of enteric neurons in the narrow segment of megacolon (10Shirasawa S. Yunker A.M. Roth K.A. Brown G.A.

Therefore, a detailed analysis of regulatory mechanisms of Hox gene expression is required to better understand the genetic basis of such disease in humans. To examine molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Ncx gene expression, we sequenced 5′-flanking regions of the murine and the human Ncx gene; both have a retinoic acid response element (RARE).1Furthermore, the enhancer element necessary for tissue-specific expression was identified in the 5′-flanking region by transient transfection of the murine Ncx promoter-luciferase chimeric genes into neuroblastoma cells. The element was also conserved in the human NCX gene. We also demonstrate that nuclear proteins from neural crest-derived cells such as neuroblastoma and melanoma cells (but not from fibroblast cells) bind to the enhancer element. The regulatory region of tissue-specific expression of the Ncx gene is discussed. (C57BL/6 × DBA/2) F1 female mice were purchased from Japan SLC Co. Ltd. (Hamamatsu, Japan).

L mouse fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5% fetal calf serum. All-trans-retinoic acid (RA; Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol at a 10 mm concentration. RA was added to the medium in a volume corresponding to 0.1% (10 μm) of the culture medium. Total RNAs were extracted from murine embryos and several cell lines using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNAs (15 μg) were electrophoresed through a 1.0% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The filter was hybridized overnight at 50 °C in 50% formamide hybridization buffer with 0.5% SDS, 1% blocking reagent, and the digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled murine Ncx homeodomain probe (193 base pairs (bp)) synthesized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on Ncx cDNA using primers (5′-ATCCCTACCAAAACCAAACC-3′ and 5′-TTGGTGCGTCGGTTCTGGAA-3′) (9Hatano M. Iitsuka Y. Yamamoto H. Dezawa M. Yusa S. Kohno Y. Tokuhisa T. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 195: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Following hybridization, the filter was washed twice for 5 min with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature and twice for 15 min with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The DIG-labeled probe was detected with sheep anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The antibody detection reaction was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis were performed as described elsewhere (9Hatano M. Iitsuka Y. Yamamoto H. Dezawa M. Yusa S. Kohno Y. Tokuhisa T. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 195: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs were made by reverse-transcribing total RNAs (100 ng) with oligo(dT) primers and amplified 30 times with 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% formamide, and the primers (5′-TTTGCAAAGGACAGGCTCACG-3′ and 5′-GGTGCAGCAGCAGGCGACCA-3′) complementary to the murine Ncx cDNA. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filter was hybridized overnight with the DIG-labeled murine Ncx homeodomain probe at 42 °C. The DIG-labeled probe was detected using the same method described above. A murine Ncx genomic clone was isolated from the 129/Sv genomic library, using the murine Ncx homeodomain probe. A 10.0-kilobase pair (kb)Xba I fragment of the genomic clone was inserted into pBluescript KS(−) (Stratagene). The human NCX cDNA was isolated from the cDNA library of human neuroblastoma (SMS-KCN) cells in λZAPII (Stratagene), using the murine Ncx homeodomain probe. A human NCX genomic clone was isolated from a human placenta genomic library in λEMBL3 (Stratagene) with the human NCX probe (a 241-bp Bst XI/Not I fragment in exon 1). A 6.8-kb Hin dIII fragment derived from the human genomic clone was subcloned into pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega). The 5′-RACE analysis was performed using the 5′AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH). The Ncx mRNAs in 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the whole body of mouse embryos at embryonic day 12.5 using oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Life Technologies, Inc.) were reverse-transcribed using the primer 5′-AAAACGCCGCACTTTCTCC-3′, complementary to nucleotides between +151 and +133 of the Ncx cDNA. The cDNA was mixed with 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5% formamide, the primer (5′-GGATGACTGGAAAAGGTGTTTC-3′; complementary to nucleotides between −21 and −42 of the Ncx cDNA), and the anchor primer for PCR. PCR was run for 1 min at 94 °C for denaturing, 1 min at 60 °C for annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for extension. After 35 cycles of the PCR, the products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. ∼330-bp PCR products were ligated with pGEM-T (Promega) for sequencing. This analysis was made using by the method described elsewhere (18Arai Y. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 193: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide primer (5′-AGTCCGCTCTGGGACTCGCAT-3′; complementary to nucleotides between −187 and −207 of the Ncx genomic sequence) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The labeled primer was mixed with 15 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the whole body of murine embryos at embryonic day 12.5 in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm PIPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 80% formamide) overnight at 30 °C. 15 μg of transfer RNA was used as a negative control. After ethanol precipitation, reverse transcription was performed at 37 °C for 1 h, and products were loaded onto a 6% sequencing gel. Nucleotide sequencing of the murine genomic Ncx gene was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method using the same primer. To construct the 5′-flanking region-luciferase fusion plasmid, a 7.0-kb Bss HII fragment (−7000/−73), a 3.3-kb Pvu II–Bss HII fragment (−3300/−73), a 1.5-kb Bam HI–Bss HII fragment (−1595/−73), and a 1.1-kb Bst EII–Bss HII fragment (−1153/−73) were isolated from the murine Ncx genomic clone and inserted into the pGL2 plasmid (Luc) carrying the SV40 enhancer and the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Promega) to generate the 7000NLuc, the 3300NLuc, the 1595NLuc, and the 1153NLuc gene, respectively. The 1492NLuc, the 1414NLuc, the 1373NLuc, the 1238NLuc, and the 1195NLuc gene were obtained by progressive exonuclease III deletion mutagenesis from the 1595NLuc plasmid with the Erase-a-base system (Promega). The 1492MLuc and the 1414MLuc gene were secured by deleting 10 bp (−1387/−1378) from the 1492NLuc and the 1414NLuc, using PCR, respectively. 2.0 × 106 cells (C1300, B16, L, and SH-SY5Y) were plated on a 100-mm dish 1 day before transfection. The luciferase reporter plasmid (5 μg) and the sea pansy luciferase expression vector, pRL-SV40 (0.25 μg) (TOYO INK, Tokyo, Japan), as a transfection efficiency control, were co-transfected into those cells using the DNA-calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32Google Scholar). SV40Luc, the pGL2 plasmid with the SV40 promoter and enhancer and the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Promega), was used for a positive control. The transfected cells were incubated for 8 h, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and further cultured with corresponding culture medium for 24 h. RA stimulation was given 8 h before harvesting. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined using standard methods using the pikkagene dual (TOYO INK) with luminometer (Lumat LB9507; Berthold). The firefly luciferase activity from the reporter plasmids was normalized with the sea pansy luciferase activity. Nuclear extracts from C1300, L, B16, and SH-SY5Y cells were prepared as described elsewhere (20Ochi Y. Koizumi T. Kobayashi S. Phuchareon J. Hatano M. Takada M. Tomita Y. Tokuhisa T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3485-3490PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer. After centrifugation, nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer and incubated on ice for 60 min. The amounts of protein in the supernatant were estimated by micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce). EMSA was done as described elsewhere (21Yoshida T. Fukuda T. Okabe S. Hatano M. Miki T. Hirosawa S. Miyasaka N. Isono K. Tokuhisa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the synthesized double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with DIG using the DIG Oligonucleotide 3′-End Labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Binding reactions were performed in a mixture containing 10 μg of nuclear proteins, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 15 fm labeled probe in 21 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and separated on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis in 0.25× TBE buffer at 8 V/cm. Competitive EMSA was done by adding a 10- or 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides to the mixture. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used had the following sequences: −1387/−1368, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCTTACCGGC-3′; −1387/−1368 with a point mutation (m−1386), 5′-CATGGCCCAGTCTTACCGGC-3′; m−1384, 5′-CCTTGCCCAGTCTTACCGGC-3′; m−1382, 5′-CCTGGACCAGTCTTACCGGC-3′; m−1381, 5′-CCTGGCACAGTCTTACCGGC-3′; m−1380, 5′-CCTGGCCAAGTCTTACCGGC-3′; m−1379, 5′-CCTGGCCCCGTCTTACCGGC-3′; m−1378, 5′-CCTGGCCCATTCTTACCGGC-3′; m−1377, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGGCTTACCGGC-3′; m−1376, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTATTACCGGC-3′; m−1375, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCGTACCGGC-3′; m−1374, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCTGACCGGC-3′; m−1373, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCTTCCCGGC-3′; m−1372, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCTTAACGGC-3′; m−1371, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCTTACAGGC-3′; m−1370, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCTTACCTGC-3′; m−1369, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCTTACCGTC-3′; m−1368, 5′-CCTGGCCCAGTCTTACCGGA-3′; and −1347/−1328, 5′-CCAGGGCCGGGGCGGGCTGG-3′. The Ncx gene is specifically expressed in a neuronal subset of neural crest derived tissues in murine embryos (9Hatano M. Iitsuka Y. Yamamoto H. Dezawa M. Yusa S. Kohno Y. Tokuhisa T. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 195: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Shirasawa S. Yunker A.M. Roth K.A. Brown G.A. Horning S. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To further determine the cell type-specific expression, we examined the expression in several murine cell lines, using RT-PCR. The Ncx gene was expressed in C1300 neuroblastoma cells but not in B16 melanoma cells, L fibroblast cells, and M12 B lymphoma cells (Fig. 1 A). We then investigated the NCX expression in several human neuroblastoma cell lines (NBTM, SH-SY5Y, SMS-KCN, SK-N-AS, and GANB), using Northern blot analysis; all expressed the NCX (Fig.1 B). PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells also expressed the Ncx gene. (data not shown). RA stimulation induces differentiation of some cell lines and embryonic tissues with expression of the Hox genes (22Marshall H. Morrison A. Studer M. Popperl H. Krumlauf R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Since RA induced morphological differentiation in C1300 and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines (23Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Caminiti A. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Pahlman S. Ruusala A.I. Abrahamsson L. Mattsson M.E. Esscher T. Cell Differ. 1984; 14: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), we examined the inducibility of Ncx expression in those differentiating cells after RA stimulation. As shown in Fig.2 A, the Ncx expression was up-regulated to 10-fold of the prestimulation level in C1300 cells at 2 h and then reverted to the prestimulation level within 9 h later. In the SH-SY5Y cells, the NCX expression was also up-regulated at 6 h and then down-regulated within 24 h later (Fig. 2 B). To examine the regulatory elements for cell type-specific expression and the RA responsibility of the Ncx gene, we sequenced 1597 bp of the 5′-flanking region with the translation start codon (Fig. 3) and determined the transcription initiation site of the gene by primer extension analysis and the 5′-RACE with poly(A)+ RNA from the whole body of murine embryos. Fig. 4shows that one initiation site was located 297 bp upstream from ATG (+1). Comparison of the sequence of the 5′-RACE products to the genomic sequence confirmed that no intron existed on the 5′-flanking region from the ATG translation start codon (data not shown). When we compared the 5′-flanking sequence with established consensus sequences in a transcription factor data base, this regulatory region contained a DR2-RARE, which consists of direct repeats of two motifs (AGGTCA) separated by 2 nucleotides (25Durand B. Saunders M. Leroy P. Leid M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 71: 73-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), located in the region between −1163 and −1150 and the putative binding site of Sp1 (GGGGCGGGGT; at positions −1463/−1452) and AP-1 (TGAGTCA; at positions −461/−455) (Fig. 3). However, the region lacked the conventional TATA box and the CAAT box sequence.Figure 4Primer extension analysis on the 5′ end of the murine Ncx gene. The autoradiograph shows a primer extension on Ncx mRNA isolated from murine embryos (E) along with dideoxy sequencing reactions (GATC) of the murine genomic Ncx DNA. Transfer RNA (t) was used as a negative control. The same primer was used for both extension and sequencing reactions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the NCX gene was also expressed and up-regulated with RA stimulation in human neuroblastoma cell lines (Fig. 2 B), we sequenced 2169 bp of the 5′-flanking region from the translation start codon of the human genomic NCX gene. When the sequence was compared with that from the mouse, the regions between −1397 and −1065 (Fig. 5) and between −682 and −522 (data not shown) in the murine Ncx gene were highly conserved in the human NCX gene (−1517/−1187 and −801/−638, respectively). The region between −1517 and −1187 in the human NCX gene also contained a DR2-RARE sequence (−1283/−1270). These data suggest that these conserved regions are important for regulation of the cell type-specific expression of the Ncx gene. We next analyzed a cell type-specific promoter activity in the 5′-flanking region of the murine Ncx gene by transient transfection of the promoter-reporter fusion genes into various cell lines. Various lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the Ncx gene were fused to the firefly luciferase gene. Since the endogenous Ncx was expressed in SH-SY5Y and C1300 cells but not in B16 and L cells (Fig.1), those chimeric constructs were transfected into those four cell lines to examine the cell type-specific promoter activity (Fig.6 A). A significant increase (3–8-fold) of the luciferase activity was observed in all four cell lines when the 1153NLuc gene was transfected, suggesting the presence of a minimal promoter element in the first 856 bp (−1153/−297) of this 5′-flanking region. When the 1595NLuc construct was transfected into SH-SY5Y and C1300 cells, the luciferase activity increased about 10-fold over the activity observed in the case of 1153NLuc transfection. However, this augmentation was not detected in B16 and L cells transfected with the 1595NLuc gene. Transfection of the 3300NLuc and the 7000NLuc construct demonstrated almost the same activity as that of the 1595NLuc, in all cell lines tested. These results suggested that the region between −1595 and −1153 is important for cell type-specific expression of the Ncx gene. To further characterize the regulatory region of the murine Ncx gene, a series of deletion clones from the region between −1595 and −1153, prepared using the Erase-a-base system and fused to the luciferase reporter gene, were transfected into C1300 cells (Fig. 6 B). The region between −1373 and −1153 did not enhance the promoter activity, irrespective of the presence of RARE. The promoter activity of the constructs with the region between −1414 and −1153 was more than 7-fold higher than that with the region between −1373 and −1153. These findings suggest that the region between −1414 and −1374 plays an important role in determining enhancer activity in neuroblastoma cells of the Ncx gene. The reporter gene analysis using a series of deletion clones in the 5′-flanking region indicated that a DNA element regulating the cell type-specific transcription of the Ncx gene was located in the region between −1414 and −1374. Furthermore, the DNA sequence of the region between −1397 and −1065 in the murine Ncx gene was highly conserved in the human NCX gene. These observations strongly suggested that nuclear factors derived from neuroblastoma cells bound to the region between −1397 and −1374 to regulate cell type-specific expression of the Ncx gene. To examine this possibility, we synthesized three kinds of double-stranded oligonucleotides (−1397/−1358, −1387/−1368, and −1377/−1338) that span this region and did EMSA experiments with nuclear proteins from C1300, L, B16, and SH-SY5Y cells. A specific band was detected in nuclear proteins from C1300, SH-SY5Y, and B16 but not in proteins of L cells when the −1387/−1368 oligonucleotides were used (Fig.7). This binding was inhibited with unlabeled −1387/−1368 oligonucleotides but not with the unlabeled −1347/−1328 oligonucleotides in C1300 murine neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 8), suggesting that nuclear factors bind to the DNA region between −1387 and −1368. In order to delineate the binding site within the 20-bp element, we tested a series of mutations in EMSA competition experiments. Unlabeled oligonucleotides with a mutation at −1384 or −1373 could not inhibit the binding, although oligonucleotides with a mutation at other sites could do so. Similar results were obtained using nuclear proteins from SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (data not shown). Therefore, the DNA element between −1387 and −1368 controls the cell type-specific expression of the Ncx, and nuclear factors that bind to this element are present in cell lines derived from neural crest tissues in mouse and human.Figure 8EMSA with various mutated oligonucleotides as a competitor. A, the labeled oligonucleotide (−1387/−1368) probe was incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extracts from C1300 murine neuroblastoma cell lines with various competitors. For competition, 10-fold (+) or 50-fold (++) molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide −1387/−1368 or −1347/−1328 or mutated oligonucleotides were used. −1387/−1368-specific DNA-protein complexes are indicated by arrows.

Deletion from −1387 to −1368 was introduced to the 1492NLuc and the 1414NLuc reporter plasmid (1492MLuc and 1414MLuc, respectively), and the promoter activity of those plasmids in C1300 neuroblastoma cells was measured. When the 1492MLuc or the 1414MLuc reporter plasmid was transfected, luciferase activity dramatically decreased to15–18-fold compared with the case of wild type reporter plasmids (Fig. 9). These results also confirm that the DNA element from −1387 to −1368 is required for display of the proper expression level of the Ncx gene in neural crest-derived cells. Expression of the Ncx gene is tightly regulated in neuronal lineage of neural crest-derived tissues (9Hatano M. Iitsuka Y. Yamamoto H. Dezawa M. Yusa S. Kohno Y. Tokuhisa T. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 195: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Shirasawa S. Yunker A.M. Roth K.A. Brown G.A. Horning S. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We confirmed the tissue-specific expression of Ncx in various cell lines, using a sensitive RT-PCR assay. This gene was expressed in neuronal cells derived from the neural crest such as neuroblastoma cell lines but not in fibroblast and B lymphoma cells. Although melanocytes are derived from the neural crest (11Selleck M.A. Scherson T.Y. Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the expression was never detected in B16 murine melanoma cells. Therefore, we attempted to identify the regulatory region governing the tissue-specific expression in the 5′-flanking region of the Ncx gene, and for this we transfected promoter-reporter fusion genes into those cell lines. First, we sequenced 5′-flanking regions of the murine and the human Ncx gene. Neither the TATA box nor the CAAT box consensus sequence was identified in the 5′-flanking regions of murine and human Ncx genes. The promoter regions of Hoxa-4 (26Galliot B. Dolle P. Vigneron M. Featherstone M.S. Baron A. Duboule D. Development. 1989; 107: 343-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Hoxb-4 (27Gutman A. Gilthorpe J. Rigby P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8143-8154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Hoxc-4 (28Geada A.M. Gaunt S.J. Azzawi M. Shimeld S.M. Pearce J. Sharpe P.T. Development. 1992; 116: 497-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Hoxc-6 (29Coletta P.L. Shimeld S.M. Chaudhuri C. Muller U. Clarke J.P. Sharpe P.T. Mech. Dev. 1991; 35: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and Hoxc-8 (30Awgulewitsch A. Bieberich C. Bogarad L. Shashikant C. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6428-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) also lack the TATA box. Transient transfection experiments (Fig. 6 A) suggest that the minimal promoter element of the murine Ncx gene locates in the region between −1153 and −73. The regions between −1153 and −1065 and between −682 and −522 in the Ncx gene were highly conserved in humans (data not shown), suggesting a presence of the common basic regulatory element in those regions. However, none of the known consensus sequence was found in those regions. Second, we found that the region between −1414 and −1373 of the murine Ncx gene plays an important role in determining its cell type-specific expression (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, we found that a putative nuclear factor specifically bound to the region between −1387 and −1368, as determined by EMSA (Fig. 7), and nucleotides at the position −1384 or −1373 are critical for the binding. The sequence of this region, highly conserved between murine and human, does not resemble any known consensus bindng sequence of transcription factors by data base search. This factor was detected in nuclear proteins from not only murine and human neuroblastoma cell lines but also the B16 melanoma cell line. However, it was not detected in nuclear proteins from L fibroblast cells. Therefore, the DNA region between −1387 and −1368 may be the element for determining the neural crest tissue-specific expression of Ncx. Since the promoter activity was only enhanced in neuroblastoma cells and not in the B16 melanoma cell line, additional nuclear factors specific to the neuronal lineage cells are required to control lineage-restricted expression of the Ncx gene of neural crest-derived cells. Further characterization of this factor may reveal not only the molecular mechanism of tissue-specific expression of the Ncx gene but also mechanisms related to lineage commitment of neural crest to neuronal cells. Ncx expression was augmented in C1300 or SH-SY5Y cells with RA stimulation. The 5′-flanking regions of the human and the murine Ncx gene carried the DR2-RARE. When C1300 cells were transfected with the 1298NLuc construct containing RARE and stimulated with RA to examine the inducibility, the luciferase activity with RA stimulation was up-regulated 3-fold above that without RA stimulation (data not shown), suggesting that this RARE is functional. Several Hox genes also have RARE in their noncoding region (31De Luca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). For example, the 3′-flanking sequence of the Hoxa-1 gene has the DR5-RARE, the direct repeats separated by 5 nucleotides, that regulate its expression (32Langston A.W. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The Hoxb-1 gene has two DR2-RAREs, which locate in the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions. RARE in the 3′-flanking region functions as a tissue-specific enhancer. Point mutation of RARE in the 3′ side prevented the neuronal expression of Hoxb-1 in transgenic mice (33Marshall H. Studer M. Popperl H. Aparicio S. Kuroiwa A. Brenner S. Krumlauf R. Nature. 1994; 370: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). On the other hand, RARE in the 5′-flanking region is an essential component of the repressor element to refine the Hoxb-1 expression to hind brain (34Studer M. Popperl H. Marshall H. Kuroiwa A. Krumlauf R. Science. 1994; 265: 1728-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, those two RAREs control the tissue-specific expression of the Hoxb-1 gene. Although RARE in the 5′-flanking region of the Ncx gene is functional in neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2), RARE is not essential for the cell type-specific expression of the Ncx gene in vitro (Fig. 6 B). Further in vivo studies using transgenic mice should reveal the precise function of this RARE element. RA is known to induce differentiation in some neuroblastoma cell lines. Both C1300 and SH-SY5Y underwent morphological changes upon stimulation with RA, and expression of Ncx was up-regulated in these cells after the stimulation. To examine the relation between the expression of Ncx and neuronal differentiation, differentiation was induced in neuroblastoma cell lines by various stimuli other than RA. C1300 cells are known to differentiate after serum deprivation (35Maltese W.A. Reitz B.A. Volpe J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 108: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, Ncx expression in C1300 cells was not induced after serum deprivation; rather, it was down-regulated (data not shown). SH-SY5Y cells differentiate upon nerve growth factor stimulation (36Sonnenfeld K.H. Ishii D.N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1982; 8: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). During the differentiation after nerve growth factor stimulation, the amount of the NCX message remained unchanged (data not shown). Moreover, the Ncx-deficient mice showed normal differentiation of neural crest-derived neurons such as dorsal root ganglia, trigeminus ganglia, and enteric ganglia (10Shirasawa S. Yunker A.M. Roth K.A. Brown G.A. Horning S. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Hatano M. Aoki T. Dezawa M. Yusa S. Iitsuka Y. Koseki H. Taniguchi M. Tokuhisa T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ncx is not directly related to neuronal differentiation and may not be essential for differentiation of neural crest lineage cells. Several transcriptional factors important for differentiation of neural crest have been identified, and most act as a master gene for lineage determination of neural crest cells. The Mash1 (mammalian achaete-scute homologue 1) gene, encoding basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is expressed only in precursors of all autonomic neurons, not in those of sensory neurons (37Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Wuenschell C.W. Saito T. Anderson D.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1524-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A targeted mutation in Mash1 blocks the development of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and a subset of enteric neurons (38Guillemot F. Lo L.C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), indicating that this gene product plays a critical role in autonomic neurogenesis. The Neurogenin 1 (39Ma Q. Kintner C. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) and the neurogenin 2 (also known as Math4A) (40Sommer L. Ma Q. Anderson D.J. J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), expressed in sensory but not in autonomic ganglia, are thought to be important for lineage determination of sensory cells. The Ncx gene is expressed in all of the neuronal lineage derived from neural crest (9Hatano M. Iitsuka Y. Yamamoto H. Dezawa M. Yusa S. Kohno Y. Tokuhisa T. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 195: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Data presented here demonstrate that the DNA element (between −1387 and −1368) located in the 5′-flanking region of the Ncx gene is critical for enhancer activity in neuroblastoma cells. In Ncx-deficient mice, megacolon, which occurs with an increased number of enteric neurons, resembles neuronal intestinal dysplasia, a disease in humans (10Shirasawa S. Yunker A.M. Roth K.A. Brown G.A. Horning S. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Hatano M. Aoki T. Dezawa M. Yusa S. Iitsuka Y. Koseki H. Taniguchi M. Tokuhisa T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Further characterization of a regulatory mechanism of tissue-specific expression of Ncx should reveal a genetic basis of this disease. We are grateful to Dr. T.
