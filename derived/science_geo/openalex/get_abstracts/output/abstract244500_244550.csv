https://openalex.org/W1988772316,"THE fact that nebular lines may have significant fine structure seems to have been neglected by nebular spectroscopists who have been considering the turbulent and thermal broadening of these lines. For example, Aller1 and Courtes et al.2, who have measured or interpreted the widths of the lines, do not mention this effect."

Their letter, based on ionospheric absorption data obtained at Calcutta (geomagnetic latitude 12° 15′ N), together with optical observations of solar flares and tabulated proton flux data, is very interesting in the light of extensive work recently on the penetration of solar particles to low magnetospheric L-values (L∼4–7 RE) at the equator2–7. Because the observations of Ganguly and Rao would have a profound and far-reaching impact on current ideas of the mechanisms for the access of such solar particles to the geomagnetic equator2–4,6, the ionospheric and solar evidence presented by the Calcutta group has been examined carefully. We conclude that there is little basis for their contention that solar particles can penetrate directly to low altitudes and thus influence ionospheric absorption at the equator."
