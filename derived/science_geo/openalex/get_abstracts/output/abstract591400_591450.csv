https://openalex.org/W2737421643,"A stretchy binder protects the silicon A challenge in using silicon particles for lithium batteries is that the large volume changes during charge-discharge cycling cause the particles to fracture, which builds up an insulating interface layer. Choi et al. show that traditional binder materials used to cushion the silicon particles can be improved by adding small amounts of polyrotaxanes (see the Perspective by Ryu and Park). The molecules consist of multiple rings that are strung along a linear segment and stoppered at each end. Some of the rings are anchored to the polymer binder, whereas others float freely, yielding a highly mobile but connected network that anchors the binder, and thus the silicon particles, together.

The most efficient piezoelectric materials are ceramics such as BaTiO 3 or PbZrO 3 , which are also extremely stiff. You et al. identified an organic perovskite structured piezoelectric material that is far more pliable yet has a piezoelectric response similar to that of traditional ceramics. This material may be a better option to use as a mechanical sensor for flexible devices, soft robotics, biomedical devices, and other micromechanical applications that benefit from a less stiff piezoelectric material.

Jayachandran et al. evaluated a program in which forest owners in Uganda were paid to not cut down their trees. Encouragingly, payments did reduce deforestation, and owners did not compensate by cutting down trees in neighboring forests. Furthermore, even in a scenario where cutting resumed after payments ceased, the beneficial delay in CO 2 release from cut trees, as quantified by the social cost of carbon, outweighed the monetary cost.

Sivis et al. now show that high harmonics can also be generated with a solid-state sample. They used nanofabricated structured targets of ZnO and varied the chemical composition of the sample to demonstrate that (modest) high harmonics can be generated as the light interacts with the target materials. The results present the possibility of developing solid-state ultrafast optical devices. Science , this issue p. 303"

Mason et al. found that not all volcanic eruptions have the same source for carbon in their volcanic gas. Arc volcanic activity appears to harvest carbon from old carbonate platforms, which results in a massive difference in the isotopic signature of the carbon emitted during eruption. This discovery requires revision of the global carbon cycle, decreasing the amount of organic carbon believed to be being buried. Science , this issue p. 290"

How this symmetry is achieved has been puzzling because replication initiation sites contain only one essential binding site for the initiator, the origin recognition complex (ORC). Coster and Diffley now show that both helicases are loaded by a similar mechanism. Efficient loading requires binding of two ORC complexes to two ORC binding sites in opposite orientations. Natural origins were found to be partially symmetrical, containing functionally relevant secondary ORC sites. Sites can be flexibly spaced, but introducing an intervening “roadblock” prevented loading, suggesting that individual helicases translocate toward each other on DNA to form a stable double ring.

Akbulatov et al. now demonstrate that force can also play a more subtle role. They generated strained macrocyclic rings photochemically and then studied the influence of that strain on the rates of reactions that cleaved either phosphorus-oxygen or silicon-oxygen bonds. P-O cleavage was accelerated by force orthogonal to the bond axis, whereas the Si-O cleavage was inhibited by force along the bond. Both results were consistent with the respective transition states predicted by theory. Science , this issue p. 299"

To assess associations between unconventional natural gas development (UGD) and perinatal outcomes.


Methods 
We conducted a retrospective birth cohort study among 158,894 women with a birth or fetal death from November 30, 2010-November 29, 2012 in the Barnett Shale, in North Texas. We constructed three UGD-activity metrics by calculating the inverse distance-weighted sum of active wells within three separate geographic buffers surrounding the maternal residence: ≤½, 2, or 10-miles. We excluded women if the nearest well to her residence was >20 miles. Metrics were categorized by tertiles among women with ≥1 well within the respective buffer; women with zero wells ≤10 miles (the largest buffer) served as a common referent group. We used logistic or linear regression with generalized estimating equations to assess associations between UGD-activity and preterm birth, small-for-gestational age (SGA), fetal death, or birthweight. Adjusted models of fetal death and birthweight included: maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, smoking, adequacy of prenatal care, previous poor pregnancy outcome, and infant sex. Preterm birth models included all of the above except parity; SGA models included all of the above except previous poor pregnancy outcome.


Results 
We found increased adjusted odds of preterm birth associated with UGD-activity in the highest tertiles of the ½- (odds ratio (OR) = 1.14; 95% confidence interval 1.03, 1.25), 2- (1.14; 1.07, 1.22), and 10-mile (1.15; 1.08, 1.22) metrics. Increased adjusted odds of fetal death were found in the second tertile of the 2-mile metric (1.56; 1.16, 2.11) and the highest tertile of the 10-mile metric (1.34; 1.04–1.72). We found little indication of an association with SGA or term birthweight.


Conclusions 
Our results are suggestive of an association between maternal residential proximity to UGD-activity and preterm birth and fetal death. Quantifying chemical and non-chemical stressors among residents near UGD should be prioritized."

Pavlov et al. show, however, that in the scromboid (tuna and mackerel) family of fish, this fluid homeostasis function has been co-opted to help facilitate dorsal fin rigidity and movement (see the Perspective by Triantafyllou). In bluefin tuna, a series of lymphatic vessels are integrated with muscles that allow the fish to raise and stiffen their dorsal fin. This provides extra stability during swimming.

https://openalex.org/W2736767386,"Malaria is caused by five different Plasmodium spp. in humans each of which modifies the host erythrocyte to survive and replicate. The two main causes of malaria, P. falciparum and P. vivax, differ in their ability to cause severe disease, mainly due to differences in the cytoadhesion of infected erythrocytes (IE) in the microvasculature. Cytoadhesion of P. falciparum in the brain leads to a large number of deaths each year and is a consequence of exported parasite proteins, some of which modify the erythrocyte cytoskeleton while others such as PfEMP1 project onto the erythrocyte surface where they bind to endothelial cells. Here we investigate the effects of knocking out an exported Hsp70-type chaperone termed Hsp70-x that is present in P. falciparum but not P. vivax. Although the growth of Δhsp70-x parasites was unaffected, the export of PfEMP1 cytoadherence proteins was delayed and Δhsp70-x IE had reduced adhesion. The Δhsp70-x IE were also more rigid than wild-type controls indicating changes in the way the parasites modified their host erythrocyte. To investigate the cause of this, transcriptional and translational changes in exported and chaperone proteins were monitored and some changes were observed. We propose that PfHsp70-x is not essential for survival in vitro, but may be required for the efficient export and functioning of some P. falciparum exported proteins."

We tested the in vitro antioxidant activity of 18 sweet cherry cultivars collected from 12 farms in the protected geographical indication region of Marostica (Vicenza, Italy) during two growing seasons. Multiple targeted and untargeted metabolomics approaches (NMR, LC-MS, HPLC-DAD, HPLC-UV) as well as artificial simplified phytocomplexes representing the cultivars Sandra Tardiva, Sandra and Grace Star were then used to determine whether the total antioxidant activity reflected the additive effects of each compound or resulted from synergistic interactions. We found that the composition of each cultivar depended more on genetic variability than environmental factors. Furthermore, phenolic compounds were the principal source of antioxidant activity and experiments with artificial simplified phytocomplexes indicated strong synergy between the anthocyanins and quercetins/ascorbic acid specifically in the cultivar Sandra Tardiva. Our data therefore indicate that the total antioxidant activity of sweet cherry fruits may originate from cultivar-dependent interactions among different classes of metabolite."

https://openalex.org/W2738154717,"Odorant binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs) play important roles in transporting semiochemicals through the sensillar lymph to olfactory receptors in insect antennae. In the present study, twenty OBPs and three CSPs were identified from the antennal transcriptome of Microplitis mediator. Ten OBPs (MmedOBP11-20) and two CSPs (MmedCSP2-3) were newly identified. The expression patterns of these new genes in olfactory and non-olfactory tissues were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurement. The results indicated that MmedOBP14, MmedOBP18, MmedCSP2 and MmedCSP3 were primarily expressed in antennae suggesting potential olfactory roles in M. mediator. However, other genes including MmedOBP11-13, 15-17, 19-20 appeared to be expressed at higher levels in body parts than in antennae. Focusing on the functional characterization of MmedCSP3, immunocytochemistry and fluorescent competitive binding assays were conducted indoors. It was found that MmedCSP3 was specifically located in the sensillum lymph of olfactory sensilla basiconca type 2. The recombinant MmedCSP3 could bind several types of host insects odors and plant volatiles. Interestingly, three sex pheromone components of Noctuidae insects, cis-11-hexadecenyl aldehyde (Z11-16: Ald), cis-11-hexadecanol (Z11-16: OH), and trans-11-tetradecenyl acetate (E11-14: Ac), showed high binding affinities (Ki = 17.24-18.77 μM). The MmedCSP3 may be involved in locating host insects. Our data provide a base for further investigating the physiological roles of OBPs and CSPs in M. mediator, and extend the function of MmedCSP3 in chemoreception of M. mediator."
https://openalex.org/W2736694805,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) contributes to the evolution of bacteria. All extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) harbour pathogenicity islands (PAIs), however relatively little is known about the acquisition of these PAIs. Due to these islands, ExPEC have properties to colonize and invade its hosts efficiently. Even though these PAIs are known to be acquired by HGT, only very few PAIs do carry mobilization and transfer genes required for the transmission by HGT. In this study, we apply for the first time next-generation sequencing (NGS) and in silico analyses in combination with in vitro experiments to decipher the mechanisms of PAI acquisition in ExPEC. For this, we investigated three neighbouring E. coli PAIs, namely the high-pathogenicity island (HPI), the pks and the serU island. As these PAIs contain no mobilization and transfer genes, they are immobile and dependent on transfer vehicles. By whole genome sequencing of the entire E. coli reference (ECOR) collection and by applying a phylogenetic approach we could unambiguously demonstrate that these PAIs are transmitted not only vertically, but also horizontally. Furthermore, we could prove in silico that distinct groups of PAIs were transferred ""en bloc"" in conjunction with the neighbouring chromosomal backbone. We traced this PAI transfer in vitro using an F' plasmid. Different lengths of transferred DNA were exactly detectable in the sequenced transconjugants indicating NGS as a powerful tool for determination of PAI transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2737301130,"Plants employ highly variable chemical defenses against a broad community of herbivores, which vary in their susceptibilities to specific compounds. Variation in chemical defenses within the plant has been found in many species; the ecological and evolutionary influences on this variation, however, are less well-understood. One central theory describing the allocation of defenses in the plant is the Optimal Defense Hypothesis (ODH), which predicts that defenses will be concentrated in tissues that are of high fitness value to the plant. Although the ODH has been repeatedly supported within vegetative tissues, few studies have compared vegetative and reproductive tissues, and the results have not been conclusive. We quantified variation in glucosinolate profile and tissue value between vegetative and reproductive tissues in Boechera stricta, a close relative of Arabidopsis. B. stricta manufactures glucosinolates, a set of defensive compounds that vary genetically and are straightforward to quantify. Genetic diversity in glucosinolate profile has been previously demonstrated to be important to both herbivory and fitness in B. stricta; however, the importance of glucosinolate variation among tissues has not. Here, we investigate whether allocation of glucosinolates within the plant is consistent with the ODH. We used both clipping experiments on endogenous plants and ambient herbivory in a large-scale transplant experiment at three sites to quantify fitness effects of loss of rosette leaves, cauline leaves, and flowers and fruits. We measured glucosinolate concentration in leaves and fruits in the transplant experiment, and asked whether more valuable tissues were more defended. We also investigated within-plant variation in other aspects of the glucosinolate profile. Our results indicated that damage to fruits had a significantly larger effect on overall fitness than damage to leaves, and that fruits had much higher concentrations of glucosinolates, supporting the ODH. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to explicitly compare both tissue value and chemical defense concentrations between vegetative and reproductive tissues under natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2737063334,"Telemedicine is considered to be an effective strategy to aid in the recruitment and retention of physicians in underserved areas and, in doing so, improve access to healthcare. Telemedicine’s use, however, depends on individual and contextual factors. Using a mixed methods design, we studied these factors in Senegal based on a micro, meso and macro framework. A quantitative questionnaire administered to 165 physicians working in public hospitals and 151 physicians working in district health centres was used to identify individual (micro) factors. This was augmented with qualitative descriptive data involving individual interviews with 30 physicians working in public hospitals, 36 physicians working in district health centres and 10 telemedicine project managers to identify contextual (meso and macro) factors. Physicians were selected using purposeful random sampling; managers through snowball sampling. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively using SPSS 23 and qualitative data thematically using NVivo 10. At the micro level, we found that 72.1% of the physicians working in public hospitals and 82.1% of the physicians working in district health centres were likely to use telemedicine in their professional activities. At the meso level, we identified several technical, organizational and ethical factors, while at the macro level the study revealed a number of financial, political, legal, socioeconomic and cultural factors. We conclude that better awareness of the interplay between factors can assist health authorities to develop telemedicine in ways that will attract use by physicians, thus improving physicians’ recruitment and retention in underserved areas."
https://openalex.org/W2737587663,"Anaerobic digestion (AnD) is a microbiological process that converts organic waste materials into biogas. Because of its high methane content, biogas is a combustible energy source and serves as an important environmental technology commonly used in the management of animal waste generated on large animal farms. Much work has been done on hardware design and process engineering for the generation of biogas. However, little is known about the complexity of the microbiology in this process. In particular, how microbes interact in the digester and eventually breakdown and convert organic matter into biogas is still regarded as a “black box.” We used 16S rRNA sequencing as a tool to study the microbial community in laboratory hog waste digesters under tightly controlled conditions, and systematically unraveled the distinct interaction networks of two microbial communities from mesophilic (MAnD) and thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAnD). Under thermophilic conditions, the well-known association between hydrogen-producing bacteria, e.g., Ruminococcaceae and Prevotellaceae, and hydrotrophic methanogens, Methanomicrobiaceae, was reverse engineered by their interactive topological niches. The inferred interaction network provides a sketch enabling the determination of microbial interactive relationships that conventional strategy of finding differential taxa was hard to achieve. This research is still in its infancy, but it can help to depict the dynamics of microbial ecosystems and to lay the groundwork for understanding how microorganisms cohabit in the anaerobic digester."
https://openalex.org/W2737377457,"Objectives To calculate the prevalence of all falls, non-accidental falls and syncope in an older population and characterize cardiovascular risk profiles. Design Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Setting The first two waves of data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Participants 8172 community-dwelling adults aged 50 years and older resident in the Republic of Ireland Measurements Self-reported history of all falls, non-accidental falls and syncope in the year preceding the first two waves of data collection. Demographic factors and self-reported cardiovascular conditions were used to characterize cardiovascular risk profiles. Results The prevalence of all falls in the past year was 19.2% or 192 per thousand persons and increased with age (50–64 years 17.5%; 65–74 years 19.4%; 75+ years 24.4%). Non-accidental falls had an estimated prevalence of 5.1% or 51 falls per thousand persons and accounted for 26.5% of all falls reported and also increased with age (50–64 years 4.0%; 65–74 years 5.5%; 75+ years 8.0%). The prevalence for syncope was estimated to be 4.4% or 44per thousand persons but did not show a similar age gradient. Participants with at least 5 cardiovascular conditions were more likely to report all falls (OR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.18–3.64, p<0.05) and NAF (OR = 2.89, 95%CI 1.28–6.52, p<0.05). Conclusions The prevalence of all falls and non-accidental falls increases with age but the same pattern was not consistently observed for syncope. There is an increased odds of reporting all three outcomes with increasing number of self-reported cardiovascular conditions. Further work is needed to uncover the interplay between cardiovascular disease and subsequent falls."

A total of 29 left-over lung specimens that were obtained from patients who died from severe falciparum malaria were examined. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that ARDS coexisted with pulmonary edema and systemic bleeding; the severity was dependent on the level of hemozoin deposition in the lung and internal alveolar hemorrhaging. The loss of EPCR and TM was primarily identified in ARDS patients and was related to the level of hemozoin, parasitized red blood cell (PRBC) and white blood cell accumulation in the lung. Moreover, an in vitro analysis demonstrated that interleukin-13 and -31 and hemozoin induced pneumocytic cell injury and apoptosis, as assessed by EB/AO staining, electron microscopy and the up-regulation of CARD-9 mRNA (caspase recruitment domain-9 messenger-ribonucleic acid). The dysregulation of EPCR and TM in the lung, especially in those with increased levels of hemozoin, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of malaria-associated ARDS through an apoptotic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2738860428,"Exposure to high-altitude hypoxia causes physiological and metabolic adaptive changes by disturbing homeostasis. Hypoxia-related changes in skeletal muscle affect the closely interconnected energy and regeneration processes. The balance between protein synthesis and degradation in the skeletal muscle is regulated by several molecules such as myostatin, cytokines, vitamin D, and irisin. This study investigates changes in irisin and myostatin levels in male climbers after a 2-week high-altitude expedition, and their association with 25(OH)D and indices of inflammatory processes. The study was performed in 8 men aged between 23 and 31 years, who participated in a 2-week climbing expedition in the Alps. The measurements of body composition and serum concentrations of irisin, myostatin, 25(OH)D, interleukin-6, myoglobin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, osteoprotegerin, and high-sensitivity soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (sRANKL) were performed before and after expedition. A 2-week exposure to hypobaric hypoxia caused significant decrease in body mass, body mass index (BMI), free fat mass and irisin, 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels. On the other hand, significant increase in the levels of myoglobin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and osteoprotegerin were noted. The observed correlations of irisin with 25(OH)D levels, as well as myostatin levels with inflammatory markers and the OPG/RANKL ratio indicate that these myokines may be involved in the energy-related processes and skeletal muscle regeneration in response to 2-week exposure to hypobaric hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2737238749,"Opioids are commonly used for postoperative pain control in cancer patients. In addition to pain control, an association between opioid use and long-term oncologic outcomes, such as recurrence or overall survival, has been postulated. The aim of this study was to determine whether postoperative opioid use in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is associated with long-term oncologic outcomes, including recurrence and death. Data obtained from 1009 medical records of patients who underwent curative resection at the National Cancer Center, Korea between January 2006 and December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Seven-day opioid use was divided into four quartiles to analyze probability of recurrence and death. Multivariate regression analyses of recurrence and death was conducted, including the calculation of odds ratios. A total of 871 patients were analyzed. When opioid dosage was examined by quartiles, the probability of death and recurrence increased gradually with increasing opioid use. However, in the multivariate regression analysis, the amount of opioid usage did not affect the risk of recurrence or death of lung cancer (P = 0.520 for recurrence; P = 0.659 for death). Opioid use was correlated with outcome when stratified by lung cancer stage (P = 0.004 for recurrence; P = 0.049 for death); however, the odds ratios only slightly increased (1.001 for stage IA–IIIA) for both outcomes. In non-small cell lung cancer patients, the amount of opioid usage does not affect the risk of recurrence and death of lung cancer. There was an association with stage (IA–IIIA), but the effect was negligible. A well-designed prospective study is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2736709759,"Dengue represents a serious threat to human health, with billions of people living at risk of the disease. Wolbachia pipientis is a bacterial endosymbiont common to many insect species. Wolbachia transinfections in mosquito disease vectors have great value for disease control given the bacterium's ability to spread into wild mosquito populations, and to interfere with infections of pathogens, such as dengue virus. Aedes fluviatilis is a mosquito with a widespread distribution in Latin America, but its status as a dengue vector has not been clarified. Ae. fluviatilis is also naturally infected by the wFlu Wolbachia strain, which has been demonstrated to enhance infection with the avian malarial parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum. We performed experimental infections of Ae. fluviatilis with DENV-2 and DENV-3 isolates from Brazil via injection or oral feeding to provide insight into its competence for the virus. We also examined the effect of the native Wolbachia infection on the virus using a mosquito line where the wFlu infection had been cleared by antibiotic treatment. Through RT-qPCR, we observed that Ae. fluviatilis could become infected with both viruses via either method of infection, although at a lower rate than Aedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. We then detected DENV-2 and DENV-3 in the saliva of injected mosquitoes, and observed that injection of DENV-3-infected saliva produced subsequent infections in naïve Ae. aegypti. However, across our data we observed no difference in prevalence of infection and viral load between Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes, suggesting that there is no effect of wFlu on dengue virus. Our results highlight that Ae. fluviatilis could potentially serve as a dengue vector under the right circumstances, although further testing is required to determine if this occurs in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2736503199,"Triploid plants are usually highly aborted owing to unbalanced meiotic chromosome segregation, but limited viable gametes can participate in the transition to different ploidy levels. In this study, numerous meiotic abnormalities were found with high frequency in an intersectional allotriploid poplar (Populus alba × P. berolinensis ‘Yinzhong’), including univalents, precocious chromosome migration, lagging chromosomes, chromosome bridges, micronuclei, and precocious cytokinesis, indicating high genetic imbalance in this allotriploid. Some micronuclei trigger mini-spindle formation in metaphase II and participate in cytokinesis to form polyads with microcytes. Unbalanced chromosome segregation and chromosome elimination resulted in the formation of microspores with aneuploid chromosome sets. Fusion of sister nuclei occurs in microsporocytes with precocious cytokinesis, which could form second meiotic division restitution (SDR)-type gametes. However, SDR-type gametes likely contain incomplete chromosome sets due to unbalanced segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division in triploids. Misorientation of spindles during the second meiotic division, such as fused and tripolar spindles with low frequency, could result in the formation of first meiotic division restitution (FDR)-type unreduced gametes, which most likely contain three complete chromosome sets. Although ‘Yinzhong’ yields 88.7% stainable pollen grains with wide diameter variation from 23.9 to 61.3 μm, the pollen viability is poor (2.78% ± 0.38). A cross of ‘Yinzhong’ pollen with a diploid female clone produced progeny with extensive segregation of ploidy levels, including 29 diploids, 18 triploids, 4 tetraploids, and 48 aneuploids, suggesting the formation of viable aneuploidy and unreduced pollen in ‘Yinzhong’. Individuals with different chromosome compositions are potential to analyze chromosomal function and to integrate the chromosomal dosage variation into breeding programs of Populus."

In this study, we conducted a time-series study of ambient PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and their association with ERV for asthma, COPD and pneumonia in a four-year time span. Relative risks for ERV as per log increase in the level of ambient pollutants with time lags of up to 10 days were calculated, using a generalized additive model of Poisson regression. Daily 24-h average concentrations of PM2.5 and pollutant gases were obtained from a local Gutting air quality monitoring station. Results showed that the ERVs for pneumonia and asthma were associated with the level of PM2.5. The effects of PM2.5 on the risk of ERV for asthma were found to be significant at lag days 1 and 2 with increasing risk of 4.34% [RR: 1.091; CI: 1.020-1.166 (95%)] and 3.58% [RR: 1.074; CI: 1.007-1.146 (95%)], respectively.

The first step uses a probit regression model to determine the sample selection process, and the second step develops a multiple regression model to simultaneously evaluate the crash rate and severity for slight injury/kill or serious injury (KSI), respectively. The model uses 555 observations from 262 signalized intersections in the Hong Kong metropolitan area, integrated with information on the traffic flow, geometric road design, road environment, traffic control and any crashes that occurred during two years.The results of the proposed two-step Heckman selection model illustrate the necessity of different crash rates for different crash severity levels.A comparison with the existing approaches suggests that the Heckman selection model offers an efficient and convenient alternative method for evaluating the safety performance at signalized intersections."
https://openalex.org/W2737635881,"The effects of surface texture on the lubrication performance of a compression ring-cylinder liner system are studied in this paper. By considering the surface roughness of the compression ring and cylinder liner, a mixed lubrication model is presented to investigate the tribological behaviors of a barrel-shaped compression ring-cylinder liner system with spherical dimples on the liner. In order to determine the rupture and reformulation positions of fluid film accurately, the Jacoboson-Floberg-Olsson (JFO) cavitation boundary condition is applied to the mixed lubrication model for ensuring the mass-conservative law. On this basis, the minimum oil film thickness and average friction forces in the compression ring-cylinder liner system are investigated under the engine-like conditions by changing the dimple area density, radius, and depth. The wear load, average friction forces, and power loss of the compression ring-cylinder liner system with and without dimples are also compared for different compression ring face profiles. The results show that the spherical dimples can produce a larger reduction of friction in mixed lubrication region, and reduce power loss significantly in the middle of the strokes. In addition, higher reduction percentages of average friction forces and wear are obtained for smaller crown height or larger axial width."
https://openalex.org/W2736525440,"Serotiny is an important adaptation for plants in fire-prone environments. However, different mechanisms also induce the opening of serotinous cones in the absence of fire in variably serotinous species. Xeriscence -cone opening driven by dry and hot conditions- is considered to be mediated only by the external environment, but endogenous factors could also play a significant role. Using the variably serotinous Pinus halepensis as our model species, we determined the effects of cone age and scales density in cone opening, and using in-situ and ex-situ manipulative experiments we investigated the role of water availability in the opening of serotinous cones. We hypothesized that loss of connection between the cones and the branch through the peduncles or the absence of water supply could induce a faster cone opening. Results showed that older cones lost more water and opened at lower temperatures, with no influence of scales density. Both field and chamber manipulative experiments (using paired cones of the same whorl) confirmed that water intake through the peduncles affected significantly the pace of cone opening, such that lack of water supply speeded up cone dehiscence. However, this was true for weakly serotinous provenances—more common in this species—, while highly serotinous provenances were indifferent to this effect in the field test. All our results support that cone serotiny in P. halepensis involves the allocation of water to the cones, which is highly consistent with the previously observed environmental effects. Importantly, the existence of maintenance costs of serotinous cones has strong implications on the effects of climate change in the resilience of natural populations, via modifications of the canopy seed banks and recruitment after stand-replacing fires. Moreover, evolutionary models for serotiny in P. halepensis must take into account the significant contribution of maintenance costs to the complex interaction between genotype and the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2739367335,"Our ability to use ionizing radiation as an energy source, as a therapeutic agent, and, unfortunately, as a weapon, has evolved tremendously over the past 120 years, yet our tool box to handle the consequences of accidental and unwanted radiation exposure remains very limited. We have identified a novel group of small molecule compounds with a 4-nitrophenylsulfonamide (NPS) backbone in common that dramatically decrease mortality from the hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (hARS). The group emerged from an in vitro high throughput screen (HTS) for inhibitors of radiation-induced apoptosis. The lead compound also mitigates against death after local abdominal irradiation and after local thoracic irradiation (LTI) in models of subacute radiation pneumonitis and late radiation fibrosis. Mitigation of hARS is through activation of radiation-induced CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6C+ immature myeloid cells. This is consistent with the notion that myeloerythroid-restricted progenitors protect against WBI-induced lethality and extends the possible involvement of the myeloid lineage in radiation effects. The lead compound was active if given to mice before or after WBI and had some anti-tumor action, suggesting that these compounds may find broader applications to cancer radiation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2736532820,"We have previously shown that TNFα and IL-1β differentially regulate the inflammatory phenotype of human brain endothelial cells (hCMVECs). In this regard, IL-1β treatment was considerably more potent than TNFα at increasing expression of inflammatory chemokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules. We therefore hypothesised that interaction of the hCMVECs with human monocytes would also be dependent on the activation status of the endothelium. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess whether brain endothelial cells activated by IL-1β or TNFα differed in their interaction with monocytes.Monocyte interaction was measured using the real time, label-free impedance based ECIS technology, to evaluate endothelial barrier integrity during monocyte attachment and transendothelial migration.ECIS technology revealed that there was a greater loss of barrier integrity with IL-1β activation and this loss lasted for longer. This was expected and consistent with our hypothesis. However, more striking and concerning was the observation that the method of monocyte enrichment greatly influenced the extent of endothelial barrier compromise. Importantly, we observed that positively isolated monocytes (CD14+ve) caused greater reduction in barrier resistance, than the negatively selected monocytes (untouched). Analysis of the isolated monocyte populations revealed that the CD14+ve isolation consistently yields highly pure monocytes (>92%), whereas the untouched isolation was much more variable, yielding ~70% enrichment on average. These two enrichment methods were compared as it was thought that the presence of non-classical CD16hi monocytes in the untouched enrichment may mediate greater compromise than the classical CD14hi monocytes. This however, was not the case and these observations raise a number of important considerations pertaining to the enrichment strategy, which are essential for generating reliable and consistent data.We conclude that IL-1β and TNFα differentially influence monocyte interaction with brain endothelial cells and moreover, the enrichment method also influences the monocyte response as revealed using ECIS technology."
https://openalex.org/W2738671450,"In the Middle East, Qatar in particular, the incidence of breast cancer has substantially increased in recent years, and is expected to double by 2030. This diagnosis also occurs at a later stage in the disease. Early detection along with proper treatment reduces radical mastectomy and mortality rates, yet only one-third of Arab women in Qatar participate in breast cancer screening (BCS) activities of any sort. Many women in the conservative Qatari society rely on male family members for support and protection. This study investigates the attitudes and perceptions of Arab men in regards to breast cancer screening and what they see as both incentives and barriers to women's participation in BCS activities.A qualitative methodology using purposive sampling technique was chosen in order to explore participant's attitudes, beliefs and health-related actions. Individual in-depth interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with 50 Arab men during October 2011 to May 2012. Data collection, analysis, and interpretation occurred simultaneously. NVivo 9, a qualitative data analysis software program was used to organize themes and subthemes.It was found that most men understood the importance of regular BCS in early detection of breast cancer. They felt they had an important role in encouraging the women in their lives to participate in BCS activities, but were adamant that any examination must be done by a female health care professional. Few knew details about screening guidelines in Qatar, but most had a basic knowledge of some screening activities. Most indicated an interest in learning more about BC and screening activities in order to better help and inform their female family members.Because Arab men perceive that their opinions and support are a major factor influencing female family members' participation in breast cancer screening, it is important that any program instituted to increase such screening participation be aimed at both men and women. More information is needed by both sexes as to the need for and benefits of regular screening activities, the techniques used, and the newly revised guidelines in Qatar. Such a program needs to be introduced in the near future in order to avert, at least partially, the expected doubling in breast cancer cases by 2030 in the Middle East."

https://openalex.org/W2737212070,"Although excessive alcohol-related mortality in the post-Soviet countries remains the major public health threat, determinants of this phenomenon are still poorly understood.We assess simultaneously individual- and area-level factors associated with an elevated risk of alcohol-related mortality among Lithuanian males aged 30-64.Our analysis is based on a census-linked dataset containing information on individual- and area-level characteristics and death events which occurred between March 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2013. We limit the analysis to a few causes of death which are directly linked to excessive alcohol consumption: accidental poisonings by alcohol (X45) and liver cirrhosis (K70 and K74). Multilevel Poisson regression models with random intercepts are applied to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR).The selected individual-level characteristics are important predictors of alcohol-related mortality, whereas area-level variables show much less pronounced or insignificant effects. Compared to married men, never married (MRR = 1.9, CI:1.6-2.2), divorced (MRR = 2.6, CI:2.3-2.9), and widowed (MRR = 2.4, CI: 1.8-3.1) men are disadvantaged groups. Men who have the lowest level of educational attainment have the highest mortality risk (MRR = 1.7 CI:1.4-2.1). Being unemployed is associated with a five-fold risk of alcohol-related death (MRR = 5.1, CI: 4.4-5.9), even after adjusting for all other individual variables. Lithuanian males have an advantage over Russian (MRR = 1.3, CI:1.1-1.6) and Polish (MRR = 1.8, CI: 1.5-2.2) males. After adjusting for all individual characteristics, only two out of seven area-level variables-i.e., the share of ethnic minorities in the population and the election turnout-have statistically significant direct associations. These variables contribute to a higher risk of alcohol-related mortality at the individual level.The huge and increasing socio-economic disparities in alcohol-related mortality indicate that recently implemented anti-alcohol measures in Lithuania should be reinforced by specific measures targeting the most disadvantaged population groups and geographical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2738276145,"Despite the human papillomavirus conferring a better prognosis in the primary treatment setting, the prognostic impact of viral status after treatment failure in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients is poorly understood.We retrospectively identified 33 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPC) patients with local and/or distant disease recurrence post-treatment, and looked at metastatic patterns, time to failure and survival patterns by HPV status.Median overall survival following local failure was not significantly different by HPV status (17 months for HPV+ vs. 14 months for HPV-, p = 0.23). However, following distant failures, HPV+ patients lived significantly longer than HPV- patients (median 42 months vs. 11 months, p = 0.004). HPV- patients were more likely to have locoregional failures as compared to HPV+ patients (p = 0.005), but the difference in distant failure between both groups was not significant (p = 0.09). HPV+ patients were more likely to develop metastases to sites other than the lung and bones.HPV positivity predicts a favorable prognosis with the potential for long-term survival following distant, not locoregional, failures. These results have important implications for the aggressiveness of treatment and type of surveillance imaging performed."
https://openalex.org/W2738310361,"Plant leaves exhibit differentiated patterns of photosynthesis rates under diurnal light regulation. Maize leaves show a single-peak pattern without photoinhibition at midday when the light intensity is maximized. This mechanism contributes to highly efficient photosynthesis in maize leaves. To understand the molecular basis of this process, an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomics analysis was performed to reveal the dynamic pattern of proteins related to photosynthetic reactions. Steady, single-peak and double-peak protein expression patterns were discovered in maize leaves, and antenna proteins in these leaves displayed a steady pattern. In contrast, the photosystem, carbon fixation and citrate pathways were highly controlled by diurnal light intensity. Most enzymes in the limiting steps of these pathways were major sites of regulation. Thus, maize leaves optimize photosynthesis and carbon fixation outside of light harvesting to adapt to the changes in diurnal light intensity at the protein level."
https://openalex.org/W2736329215,"Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is an opportunistic pathogen that can adhere to host cells or extracellular matrix via type 1 and type 3 fimbriae. KP1_4563 is a gene encoding a hypothetical protein in K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044. KP1_4563 is located between the type 1 and type 3 fimbrial gene clusters and is likely associated with fimbrial function given its putative conserved domains of unknown function (DUF1471). Cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) regulates virulence-related gene expression and is a crucial transcriptional regulator in many bacteria. The predicted DNA recognition motif of CRP is present in the KP1_4563 promoter region. This study aimed to investigate the function of KP1_4563 in fimbriae and its transcriptional regulation mechanism by CRP. We generated Kp-Δ4563 mutant and complementation strains. We utilized phenotype and adhesion assays to evaluate the role of KP1_4563 in fimbriae. We conducted quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), LacZ fusion, electrophoretic mobility shift, and DNase I footprinting assays to study the transcriptional regulation of KP1_4563 gene by CRP. We found that KP1_4563 negatively regulates the function of type 3 fimbriae. Compared with NTUH-K2044, the absence of KP1_4563 enhanced the ability of Kp-Δ4563 to adhere to A549 cells. CRP negatively regulates KP1_4563 by directly binding to its promoter region. KP1_4563 plays an important role in type 3 fimbrial function. This novel insight will assist in the development of strategies for preventing K. pneumoniae infection."
https://openalex.org/W2737062934,"Background and aim Irreversible electroporation (IRE) was confirmed to control several solid tumors effectively in vivo. Our preclinical study aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of IRE in the breast of rabbit. Methods Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups of 10 rabbits (control group, IRE group A, and B). Two mono-electrode needles were inserted into the breast tissue by percutaneous puncture. Electrocardiogram and vital signs were monitored before, during, and after ablation. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy were examined at 0 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days after ablation. Results All the rabbits survived the procedure with no significant adverse effects. Intra-operative ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 1 rabbit from IRE group B and was immediately relieved after ablation. Reversible subcutaneous hemorrhage was observed in 8 rabbits from IRE group A and 7 rabbits from IRE group B. No skin was burnt, however, pectoralis major muscle injuries were found in all rabbits. Histopathological and ultrastructural examination revealed the coexistence of cell necrosis and apoptosis. HE, TUNEL, and Masson staining revealed breast tissue injury and the recovery of damage by fibrous tissue and granulation tissue. Notably, the structures of mammary gland lobules and interstitial components of the breasts were well preserved. Conclusions Our study suggests that IRE destroys breast cancer while effectively preserving the skin, the structure of mammary gland lobules, and interstitial components. IRE may be a promising technique to locally control breast cancer and to maintain the esthetic of the breast."
https://openalex.org/W2737018004,"The role of mammalian high temperature requirement protease A1 (HTRA1) in somatic stem cell differentiation and mineralized matrix formation remains controversial, having been demonstrated to impart either anti- or pro-osteogenic effects, depending on the in vitro cell model used. The aim of this study was therefore to further evaluate the role of HTRA1 in regulating the differentiation potential and lineage commitment of murine mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, and to assess its influence on bone structure and regeneration in vivo. Our results demonstrated that short hairpin RNA-mediated ablation of Htra1 in the murine mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 increased the expression of several osteogenic gene markers, and significantly enhanced matrix mineralization in response to BMP-2 stimulation. These effects were concomitant with decreases in the expression of chondrogenic gene markers, and increases in adipogenic gene expression and lipid accrual. Despite the profound effects of loss-of-function of HTRA1 on this in vitro osteochondral model, these were not reproduced in vivo, where bone microarchitecture and regeneration in 16-week-old Htra1-knockout mice remained unaltered as compared to wild-type controls. By comparison, analysis of femurs from 52-week-old mice revealed that bone structure was better preserved in Htra1-knockout mice than age-matched wild-type controls. These findings therefore provide additional insights into the role played by HTRA1 in regulating mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, and offer opportunities for improving our understanding of how this multifunctional protease may act to influence bone quality."
https://openalex.org/W2738508693,"Adaptations to captivity that reduce fitness are one of many reasons, which explain the low success rate of reintroductions. One way of testing this hypothesis is to compare an important behavioural response in captive and wild members of the same species. Thanatosis, is an anti-predator strategy that reduces the risk of death from predation, which is a common behavioral response in frogs. The study subjects for this investigation were captive and wild populations of Mantella aurantiaca. Thanatosis reaction was measured using the Tonic Immobility (TI) test, a method that consists of placing a frog on its back, restraining it in this position for a short period of time and then releasing it and measuring how much time was spent feigning death. To understand the pattern of reaction time, morphometric data were also collected as body condition can affect the duration of thanatosis. The significantly different TI times found in this study, one captive population with shorter responses, were principally an effect of body condition rather than being a result of rearing environment. However, this does not mean that we can always dismiss the importance of rearing environment in terms of behavioural skills expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2738895143,"T-cell based vaccines have been considered as attractive candidates for prevention of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. In this study we compared the magnitude and phenotypic characteristics of CD8+ T-cells induced by three commonly used viral vectors, Adenovirus-5 (Ad5), Vaccinia virus (VV) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing the HCV NS3/4A protein. C57/BL6 mice were primed with DNA expressing NS3/4A and boosted with each of the viral vectors in individual groups of mice. We then tracked the vaccine-induced CD8+ T-cell responses using pentamer binding and cytokine production analysis. Overall, our data indicate that the memory cells induced by Ad5 were inferior to those induced by VV or MVA. We found that Ad5 boosting resulted in rapid expansion and significantly higher frequencies of NS3-specific T-cells compared to VV and MVA boosting. However, the functional profiles, assessed through analysis of the memory cell marker CD127 and the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in the blood, spleen, and liver; and measurements of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-2 production indicated significantly lower frequencies of long-lived memory T-cells following Ad5 boosting compared to VV and MVA. This same set of analyses suggested that the memory cells induced following boosting with MVA were superior to those induced by both Ad5 and VV. This superiority of the MVA-induced CD8+ T-cells was confirmed following surrogate challenge of mice with a recombinant mouse herpes virus expressing the HCV NS3 protein. Higher levels of NS3-specific CD8+ T-cells displaying the functional markers CD69, Ki67 and Granzyme B were found in the spleens of mice boosted with MVA compared to VV and Ad5, both alone and in combination. These data suggest that MVA may be a more successful viral vector for induction of effective CD8+ T-cell responses against hepatitis C virus."
https://openalex.org/W2737832476,"Modulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) has already been demonstrated to display antiarrhythmic effects in patients and animals with MI. In this study, we investigated whether local cardiac denervation has any beneficial effects on ventricular electrical stability and cardiac function in the chronic phase of MI.Twenty-one anesthetized dogs were randomly assigned into the sham-operated, MI and MI-ablation groups, respectively. Four weeks after local cardiac denervation, LSG stimulation was used to induce VPCs and VAs. The ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) and the incidence of inducible VPCs were measured with electrophysiological protocol. Cardiac innervation was determined with immunohistochemical staining of growth associated protein-43 (GAP43) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The global cardiac and regional ventricular function was evaluated with doppler echocardiography in this study.Four weeks after operation, the incidence of inducible VPC and VF in MI-ablation group were significantly reduced compared to the MI dogs (p<0.05). Moreover, local cardiac denervation significantly improved VFT in the infarcted border zone (p<0.05). The densities of GAP43 and TH-positive nerve fibers in the infarcted border zone in the MI-ablation group were lower than those in the MI group (p<0.05). However, the local cardiac denervation did not significantly improve cardiac function in the chronic phase of MI, determined by the left ventricle diameter (LV), left atrial diameter (LA), ejection fraction (EF).Summarily, in the chronic phase of MI, local cardiac denervation reduces the ventricular electrical instability, and attenuates spatial heterogeneity of sympathetic nerve reconstruction. Our study suggests that this methodology might decrease malignant ventricular arrhythmia in chronic MI, and has a great potential for clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2739301325,"Acoustic communication is highly influential in the expression of social behavior by anuran amphibians, transmitting information about the individual’s physical condition and motivation. We studied the phonotactic (approach movements) responses of wild and captive male golden mantella frogs to conspecific wild and captive playback calls to determine the impact of captivity on social behaviour mediated by vocalisations. Calls were recorded from one wild and two captive populations. Phonotaxis experiments were then conducted by attracting M. aurantiaca males across a PVC grid on the forest floor or enclosure floor to a speaker. For each playback, the following parameters were recorded to define the accuracy of phonotaxis: (1) number of jumps; (2) jump angles; (3) jump distances; (4) path straightness. During this experiment we observed that wild frogs had a similar behavioural (phonotaxis) response to calls independent of their source while frogs from Chester Zoo had a significantly stronger response to calls of other conspecifics held separately at Chester Zoo. The lack of appropriate phonotaxis response by captive bred frogs to the calls of wild conspecifics could have serious negative conservation implications, if the captive bred individuals were released back to the wild."
https://openalex.org/W2738118797,"To better understand the dynamics of early hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we determined how rapidly non-cirrhotic HCV-uninfected liver allografts clear HCV from the circulation of cirrhotic HCV-infected patients at the time of transplantation but before administration of immunosuppression. Specifically, we characterized serum HCV kinetics during the first 90 min of reperfusion for 19 chronically HCV-infected patients transplanted with an HCV-uninfected liver by measuring serum viral load immediately prior to reperfusion (t = 0) and then every 15 min for a total of 90 min (t = 90). Immunosuppression was withheld until all samples were taken to better model primary infection. During this period, rates of viral clearance varied more than 20-fold with a median rate constant of 0.0357 1/min, range 0.0089-0.2169; half-life (minutes) median 19.4, range 3.2-77.8. The majority of viral clearance occurred within the first 60 min. The amount of blood transfused during this 90-min period (a potential confounding variable of this human liver transplant model of primary infection) accounted for 53% and 59% of k (r = 0.53, p = 0.05) and half-life (r = 0.59, p = 0.03) variability, respectively. No other clinical variables tested (age, allograft weight, and degree of reperfusion injury as assessed by peak postoperative ALT or AST) accounted for the remaining variability (p>0.05).In a human liver transplant model of primary infection, HCV rapidly clears the bloodstream. With approximately 90% of clearance occurring in the first 90 minutes of reperfusion, studies of HCV entry inhibition could utilize rate of clearance during this early period as an outcome measure."
https://openalex.org/W2739017859,"Blood coagulation factor V (FV) is activated either by Factor X or thrombin, cleaving at three different sites viz., Site I (Arg709-Ser710), site II (Arg1018-Thr1019), and site III (Arg1545-Ser1546). Russell’s viper venom factor V activator (RVV-V) is a thrombin-like serine proteinase that activates FV with selective, single cleavage at site III. A long lasting effort is being pending in understanding the ‘selective’ binding specificity of the RVV-V towards site III. Here, we present the binding kinetic study of RVV-V with two designed peptides corresponding to the regions from site I (Gln699—Asn713) and site II (1008Lys—Pro1022), respectively, that include 15 amino acids. Our investigation for justifying the binding efficacy and kinetics of peptides includes SPR method, protein-peptide docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and principal component analysis (PCA). Surprisingly, the SPR experiment disclosed that the Peptide II showed a lower binding affinity with KD of 2.775 mM while the Peptide I showed none. Docking and simulation of both the peptides with RVV-V engaged either rooted or shallow binding for Peptide II and Peptide I respectively. The peptide binding resulted in global conformational changes in the native fold of RVV-V, whereas the similar studies for thrombin failed to make major changes in the native fold. In support, the PCA analysis for RVV-V showed the dislocation of catalytic triad upon binding both the peptides. Hence, RVV-V, a serine protease, is incompetent in cleaving these two sites. This study suggests a transition in RVV-V from the native rigid to the distorted flexible structure and paves a way to design a new peptide substrate/inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W2738038744,"Some frame components, such as SYNC (frame synchronization) and RTS/CTS (Ready to Send/Clear to Send), are not taken into consideration when the traditional setting strategies conduct the optimization of SMAC (Sensor MAC) contention window size. This paper proposes mathematical models that allow the analysis of data packets forwarding delay within one SMAC virtual cluster. Simulation results in OMNeT++ show good agreements with the proposed mathematical models, validating the models' correctness. The curve analyses of the models confirm the existence of delay-optimization-oriented contention window size that is closely related to the number of simultaneously contending nodes. Afterwards, it is shown that SYNC, RTS/CTS and EIFS (Extended InterFrame Space) have impacts on the optimal contention window size and expected delivery delay to various degrees, as well as throughput and energy efficiency. One ideal setting strategy of delay-optimization-oriented SMAC contention window size requires the combination of the network scale, SYNC, RTS/CTS and EIFS. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the proposed setting strategy makes contributions to the improvement in the existing SMAC extensions when they are integrated with each other, in terms of the end-to-end delay, throughput and energy consumption."
