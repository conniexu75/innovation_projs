We also found further support for the previously reported CACNA1C (alpha 1C subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel; combined P = 7.0 x 10(-8), rs1006737). Our results suggest that ion channelopathies may be involved in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder."

Increased expression of three of the most promising up-regulated (miR-221, miR-222, and miR-181) and down-regulated (miR-21, miR-342, and miR-489) miRNAs was validated by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The expression of miR-221 and miR-222 was also significantly (2-fold) elevated in HER2/neu-positive primary human breast cancer tissues that are known to be resistant to endocrine therapy compared with HER2/neu-negative tissue samples. Ectopic expression of miR-221/222 rendered the parental MCF-7 cells resistant to tamoxifen. The protein level of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, a known target of miR-221/222, was reduced by 50% in OHTR cells and by 28–50% in miR-221/222-overexpressing MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of p27Kip1 in the resistant OHTR cells caused enhanced cell death when exposed to tamoxifen. This is the first study demonstrating a relationship between miR-221/222 expression and HER2/neu overexpression in primary breast tumors that are generally resistant to tamoxifen therapy. This finding also provides the rationale for the application of altered expression of specific miRNAs as a predictive tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer marker.

This finding also provides the rationale for the application of altered expression of specific miRNAs as a predictive tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer marker. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, accounting for 31% of all female cancers. An estimated 178,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer was diagnosed in the United States in 2007, and 40,460 women will die of this cancer. Over two-thirds of breast cancers exhibit high concentrations of estrogen receptor, which contribute to tumor growth and progression. Blocking the steroid hormone pathway with tamoxifen and/or oophorectomy has been shown to be effective in this patient population. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group overview demonstrated a significant improvement in 15-year survival with the addition of adjuvant tamoxifen for 5 years following surgery (1Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative GroupLancet. 2005; 365: 1687-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6347) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tamoxifen can also reduce the incidence of contralateral breast cancer and has been approved as a prophylactic agent to prevent breast cancer. Despite this accomplishment in the management of women with potentially endocrine-responsive breast cancers, a significant proportion of these women will experience disease progression due to either an intrinsic or acquired resistance to tamoxifen.Nongenomic activation of epidermal growth factor receptor/HER2 signaling by tamoxifen is an important factor contributing to tamoxifen resistance. This leads to activation of both the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt signaling pathways, which favor cell proliferation and survival. These changes could be blocked by the selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitnib, suggesting that epidermal growth factor receptor/HER2 signaling is directly involved in tamoxifen resistance (2Shou J. Massarweh S. Osborne C.K. Wakeling A.E. Ali S. Weiss H. Schiff R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 926-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The preclinical data are corroborated by clinical observations that tumors expressing HER2 exhibit poor outcome when treated with tamoxifen (3Carlomagno C. Perrone F. Gallo C. De Laurentiis M. Lauria R. Morabito A. Pettinato G. Panico L. D'Antonio A. Bianco A.R. De Placido S. J. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 14: 2702-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). None of the molecular mechanisms proposed for tamoxifen resistance (for review, see Ref. 4Lewis J.S. Jordan V.C. Mutat. Res. 2005; 591: 247-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have led to the development of a gene expression profile that can consistently identify resistant tumors and benefit these patients from upfront use of alternative drugs such as aromatase inhibitors.Recent studies have highlighted the key regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) 3The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; OHTR, 4-hydroxytamoxifen-resistant; RT, reverse transcription; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; OHTR, 4-hydroxytamoxifen-resistant; RT, reverse transcription; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. in all fundamental cellular processes in animals and plants. Altered expression of miRNAs in primary human cancers has been used for tumor diagnosis, classification, staging, and prognosis (5Croce C.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). These small noncoding RNAs regulate expression of their target proteins primarily by inhibiting translation of the target mRNA and in some cases by inducing rapid decay of the message (6Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). A study with 76 neoplastic and 34 normal breast tissue samples revealed altered expression of several miRNAs that could correctly predict the nature of the tumor analyzed (7Iorio M.V. Ferracin M. Liu C.G. Veronese A. Spizzo R. Sabbioni S. Magri E. Pedriali M. Fabbri M. Campiglio M. Menard S. Palazzo J.P. Rosenberg A. Musiani P. Volinia S. Nenci I. Calin G.A. Querzoli P. Negrini M. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7065-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (3439) Google Scholar). This study did not, however, attempt to profile miRNA expression in drug resistance.Here, we used a cell culture model to determine the miRNA expression profile of a tamoxifen-resistant cell line that was subsequently validated in primary human breast cancers. We further identified a target protein of the highly overexpressed miRNAs in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer and established its regulatory role in conferring tamoxifen resistance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Tissue Procurement—Tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 cells and 4-hydroxytamoxifen-resistant (OHTR) cells were obtained from Dr. Kenneth P. Nephew (Indiana University) and maintained as described (8Fan M. Yan P.S. Hartman-Frey C. Chen L. Paik H. Oyer S.L. Salisbury J.D. Cheng A.S. Li L. Abbosh P.H. Huang T.H. Nephew K.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11954-11966Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Before all experiments, MCF-7 and OHTR cells were cultured in growth medium (minimum essential medium with 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 0.1 mmol/liter nonessential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 6 ng/ml insulin, and 10% fetal bovine serum) in the absence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen for 7 days. ZR75.1 cells were obtained from Dr. Brett Hall (Ohio State University) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary human breast samples were obtained from the Stephanie Spielman Tissue Bank collected under Protocol 2003C0036.miRNA Microarray—The miRNA microarray was performed at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center Microarray Core Facility (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for details).TaqMan Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR for miRNA Quantification—Total RNA was isolated from formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded unsectioned primary human breast cancer tissue cores with a RecoverAll™ total nucleic acid isolation kit (Ambion) and from the cell lines with TRIzol™ (Invitrogen), reverse-transcribed using a TaqMan™ microRNA reverse transcription kit, and subjected to real-time PCR using a TaqMan™ microRNA assay kit (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed using a Stratagene Mx3000 instrument in triplicate. miRNA expression was normalized to small nuclear RNA (snRNA) RNU6B as described (9Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Amst.). 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar).Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells (3000/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with 5 μm tamoxifen in complete medium after overnight serum starvation. Cell proliferation was documented using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay kit (Roche Applied Science).Apoptosis Assay—Tamoxifen-induced apoptosis was monitored by Western blotting (10Datta J. Majumder S. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Frankel W. Costa R. Cha H.C. MacDougald O.A. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and cell cycle analysis (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for details).Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was analyzed by unpaired Student's t test, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSDistinct miRNA Expression Profile Is Associated with Tamoxifen Resistance in Breast Cancer Cell Lines—As a first step to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer, we compared the miRNA profiles of the OHTR and tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines by microarray analysis. Both cell lines originated from a single estrogen-responsive MCF-7 clone (8Fan M. Yan P.S. Hartman-Frey C. Chen L. Paik H. Oyer S.L. Salisbury J.D. Cheng A.S. Li L. Abbosh P.H. Huang T.H. Nephew K.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11954-11966Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and any alteration in the miRNA expression profile is therefore expected to result from prolonged tamoxifen treatment. To analyze the microarray data, the expression of each miRNA was normalized to the average median of all the genes and compared between the two cell lines. Using Student's t test, we obtained a list of differentially expressed miRNAs (p ≤ 0.05) in the OHTR and MCF-7 cells. Unsupervised clustering of significantly deregulated miRNAs is presented in Fig. 1A. Eight miRNA genes, miR-221, miR-222, miR-181, miR-375, miR-32, miR-171, miR-213, and miR-203, were significantly overexpressed (>1.5-fold) in OHTR cells compared with MCF-7 cells. In addition, seven miRNAs, miR-342, miR-489, miR-21, miR-24, miR-27, miR-23, and miR-200, were underexpressed (<50%) in OHTR cells (Fig. 1B).On the basis of maximal alteration in the expression levels in OHTR cells, we next validated differential expression of three up-regulated miRNAs (miR-221, miR-222, and miR-181) and three down-regulated miRNAs (miR-489, miR-342, and miR-21) by real-time RT-PCR. Normalization of the miRNA expression levels to snRNA RNU6B revealed 3.5-, 13.2-, and 12.7-fold increases in the miR-181b, miR-221 and miR-222 levels, respectively, in OHTR cells compared with MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the miR-21, miR-342, and miR-489 expression levels in OHTR cells were reduced by 66, 55, and 80% respectively, compared with MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1C).miR-221 and miR-222 Are Up-regulated in HER2/neu-positive Primary Human Breast Cancer—The next obvious question was whether similar deregulation in miRNA expression observed in a cell culture model also occurs in primary breast cancer samples. To address this issue, we studied a panel of primary human breast cancer samples that were either HER2/neu-positive or HER2/neu-negative. Because increased expression and signaling via HER2/neu in breast cancer patients are associated with poor outcome of endocrine therapy (11Zhu L. Chow L.W. Loo W.T. Guan X.Y. Toi M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4639-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we used HER2/neu expression as a marker for tamoxifen resistance. Real-time RT-PCR and normalization to RNU6B expression revealed significant increases in miR-221 (p = 0.029) (Fig. 1D, left panel) and miR-222 (p = 0.0012) (right panel) expression in the HER2/neu-positive tumor samples compared with the HER2/neu-negative samples (n = 24). The data obtained from the patient samples corroborated the data obtained from the cell culture model of tamoxifen resistance.We also tested miR-221 and miR-222 expression levels in similar breast cancer cell lines with a differential expression of HER2 to support these patient data. A 2.3-fold increase in both miR-221 and miR-222 expression was seen in ZR75.1 cells (high HER2 expression) compared with MCF-7 cells (low HER2 expression) (Fig. 1E).Overexpression of miR-221 and miR-222 in MCF-7 Cells Confers Resistance to Tamoxifen—Previous studies have reported increased expression of miR-221 and miR-222 in primary glioblastoma (12Ciafre S.A. Galardi S. Mangiola A. Ferracin M. Liu C.G. Sabatino G. Negrini M. Maira G. Croce C.M. Farace M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), papillary thyroid carcinoma (13Pallante P. Visone R. Ferracin M. Ferraro A. Berlingieri M.T. Troncone G. Chiappetta G. Liu C.G. Santoro M. Negrini M. Croce C.M. Fusco A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), and pancreatic cancer (14Lee E.J. Gusev Y. Jiang J. Nuovo G.J. Lerner M.R. Frankel W.L. Morgan D.L. Postier R.G. Brackett D.J. Schmittgen T.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 120: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Because the levels of these two miRNAs were also significantly elevated in HER2/neu-positive breast tumors, we further explored their role in acquiring resistance to endocrine therapy. miR-221 and miR-222 were ectopically expressed in tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/221/222), and miR-221/222-overexpressing cells were selected using G418. We used the G418-selected pool and a clone (clone 9) derived from these cells for further studies. Increased expression of miR-221/222 in the G418-selected pool and clone 9 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). MCF-7 cells transfected with the empty vector (MCF-7/Vec) and miR-221/222-overexpressing cells were treated with 5 μm tamoxifen, and cell viability was monitored using the MTT assay. The viability of both the miR-221/222-overexpressing clone and pool in the presence of tamoxifen was significantly higher than that of the MCF-7/Vec pool (p ≤ 0.005), demonstrating that miR-221/222 can confer resistance to tamoxifen in the breast cancer cell line (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Ectopic expression of miR-221/222 in MCF-7 cells results in increased tamoxifen resistance. A, expression of miR-221 and miR-222 was analyzed using total RNA isolated from miR-221/222-transfected MCF-7 cells by real-time RT-PCR and normalized to snRNA RNU6B. -Fold increase is shown below the bars. B, the G418-selected pool of miR-221/222-expressing MCF-7 cells, G418-selected clone 9 (MCF-7/221/222), and the empty vector-transfected MCF-7 cell pool were treated with 5 μm tamoxifen for 72 h. Cell metabolic activity in the presence of the drug was measured every 24 h using the MTT assay. The metabolic activity of cells at 0 h was taken as 1. The results are the means ± S.D. of triplicate assays. C, vector- and miR-221/222-expressing MCF-7 cells were treated with 0, 15, and 20 μm tamoxifen for 16 h. The cells were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope. O/E, overexpressing. D, whole cell extracts from the vector- and miR-221/222-transfected MCF-7 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies against PARP and caspase-7 that detect respective intact and cleaved products. The blot was reprobed with anti-Ku-70 antibody to ensure equal protein loading. The signal in each band was quantified using Kodak Imaging software. Quantification of both caspase-7 and PARP (uncleaved and cleaved) was plotted after normalization to Ku-70. The results are representative of two independent experiments. E, the vector- and miR-221/222-expressing MCF-7 cells were treated with 20 μm tamoxifen (Tam) for 24 h. The cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide, and cell cycle distribution was monitored by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur. The percentage of apoptotic cells (sub-G1 peak) in vector (Vec)- and miR-221/222-expressing cells is represented in the bar diagram. Similar results were obtained from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because tamoxifen is known to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells (15Obrero M. Yu D.V. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45695-45703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we explored the potential role of miR-221/222 in inhibiting tamoxifen-mediated apoptosis. For this purpose, we treated miR-221/222-overexpressing MCF-7 cells with increasing concentrations of the drug and monitored its effect on cell morphology under a phase-contrast microscope. The MCF-7/Vec cells exhibited signs of cellular damage in the presence of 15 μm tamoxifen that were more pronounced upon treatment with 20 μm tamoxifen (Fig. 2C). In contrast, both the miR-221/222-expressing clone and pool showed minimal signs of cellular damage when treated with 15 μm tamoxifen (Fig. 2C). At 20 μm, the drug-induced cellular damage was significantly less in these cells compared with MCF-7/Vec cells (Fig. 2C). These observations can be considered biologically relevant, as the median in vivo concentration of tamoxifen attained in breast cancer patients treated with a standard 20 mg/day dose of tamoxifen was found to be 83.6 μm (16Kisanga E.R. Gjerde J. Guerrieri-Gonzaga A. Pigatto F. Pesci-Feltri A. Robertson C. Serrano D. Pelosi G. Decensi A. Lien E.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 2336-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To prove further the differential response of the vector- and miR-221/222-transfected cells to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, we monitored caspase-7 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage by Western blot analysis. Although both caspase-7 and PARP cleavage increased in MCF-7/Vec cells with increasing concentrations of tamoxifen (0–20 μm), the cleaved products were barely detectable in tamoxifen-treated MCF-7/221/222 clone 9 (Fig. 2D). The extent of PARP degradation in the miR-221/222-overexpressing pool was also reduced by 40% relative to the MCF-7/Vec cells. It is noteworthy that the level of miR-221/222 expression in the MCF-7/221/222 pool was considerably diminished compared with that in clone 9, and a dose-dependent effect of miR-221/222 on tamoxifen-induced PARP cleavage in MCF-7 cells was observed upon ectopic expression of miR-221/222 (Fig. 2D).We then quantified the extent of tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in these cell lines by flow cytometry (Fig. 2E). Although 14.3% of the MCF-7/Vec cells were apoptotic (sub-G1 peak) upon tamoxifen treatment, only 1% of clone 9 ((Fig. 2E) and 2.9% of the miR-221/222-overexpressing pool (data not shown) were apoptotic under the same condition. This series of studies demonstrated that the miR-221/222 cluster indeed plays a key role in conferring tamoxifen resistance to MCF-7 cells.p27Kip1 Protein, a Target of miR-221/222, Is the Effector Molecule That Regulates Tamoxifen Sensitivity—The cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1 is a known target of miR-221/222 (17le Sage C. Nagel R. Egan D.A. Schrier M. Mesman E. Mangiola A. Anile C. Maira G. Mercatelli N. Ciafre S.A. Farace M.G. Agami R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3699-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that sequestration of p27Kip1 in the cytoplasm by Akt-mediated phosphorylation correlates with poor prognosis of breast cancer (reviewed in Ref. 18Blain S.W. Massagué J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1076-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Based on this information, we hypothesized that the effect of miR-221/222 in augmenting tamoxifen resistance is mediated by the loss of p27Kip1 protein in breast cancer. Indeed, Western blot analysis revealed 50% reduction in the level of p27Kip1 in MCF-7 cells compared with OHTR cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the level of p27Kip1 was reduced by 50 and 28% in miR-221/222-expressing clone 9 and the G418-selected pool, respectively, compared with the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA level of p27Kip1 was also reduced in these cell lines (Fig. 3B), indicating that miR-221/222 regulates p27Kip1 at the level of RNA stability and its translation.FIGURE 3p27Kip1, a target of miR-221/222, imparts tamoxifen sensitivity to MCF-7 cells. A, whole cell extracts from MCF-7 cells, OHTR cells, and miR-221/222-transfected and vector (Vec)-transfected MCF-7 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-p27Kip1 antibody. The membrane was reprobed with anti-Ku-70 antibody, and p27Kip1 expression was normalized to Ku-70 protein. O/E, overexpressing. B, total RNAs from MCF-7 cells, OHTR cells, and miR-221/222-transfected and vector-transfected MCF-7 cells were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR with primers specific for p27Kip1 and 18 S rRNA. C, whole cell extract from the p27Kip1-transfected OHTR cell pool was subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-p27Kip1 antibody and reprobed with anti-Ku-70 antibody. D, OHTR cells transfected with empty vector and p27 expression vector were treated with 5 μm tamoxifen for 72 h. Cell metabolic activity was measured every 24 h using the MTT assay. The metabolic activity of cells at 0 h was taken as 1. The results are the means ± S.D. of triplicate assays. E, vector-overexpressing (panels A–C) and p27Kip1-overexpressing (D–F) OHTR cells were treated with 0 and 15 μm tamoxifen for 16 h. The cells were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope. The small arrows in panels G and H indicate autophagosome-like bodies. F, whole cell extracts from the vector-transfected and p27Kip1-transfected OHTR cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies against caspase-7 and PARP. The blot was reprobed with anti-Ku-70 antibody to normalize protein loading. The signal in each band was quantified using Kodak Imaging software. Quantification of uncleaved and cleaved caspase-7 and PARP is presented in the bar diagrams. The results are representative of three independent experiments. TAM, tamoxifen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next determined whether the increased expression of p27Kip1 in OHTR cells can sensitize the OHTR cells to tamoxifen. To test this possibility, we transfected a p27Kip1 expression vector into OHTR cells and selected a G418-resistant pool for further studies. The ectopic expression of p27Kip1 was monitored by Western blot analysis with anti-p27 antibody (Fig. 3C). The viability of untransfected OHTR cells and the vector- and p27Kip1-transfected cell pools in the presence of tamoxifen was analyzed by the MTT assay. A significant loss of cell viability was observed when p27Kip1 was ectopically expressed in OHTR cells (p ≤ 0.002) (Fig. 3D).To investigate further the effect of p27Kip1 in tamoxifen-induced cell death, we examined potential morphological changes in the vector-transfected and p27Kip1-overexpressing OHTR cells in the presence of tamoxifen. The cellular damage of tamoxifen-treated p27Kip1-expressing cells was obvious as observed under a microscope, whereas such damage was minimal in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3E). To authenticate this observation, we monitored caspase-7 and PARP cleavage in these cell lines. Cleaved caspase-7 was detectable only in the tamoxifen-treated p27Kip1-transfected cells but not in the vector control (Fig. 3F). Under the same treatment conditions, PARP cleavage was significantly more pronounced in the p27Kip1-expressing cells than in the vector-transfected cells at all concentrations of tamoxifen tested (Fig. 3F). These data demonstrate that the maintenance of high p27Kip1 levels may play a key role in the successful endocrine therapy of breast cancer.DISCUSSIONTamoxifen is the current standard adjuvant therapy in women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Because ∼30% of these tumors are resistant to tamoxifen, there is considerable interest in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of acquiring resistance to this important anticancer drug. Although altered expression of miRNAs in primary human cancers has been used for tumor diagnosis and prognosis, the potential involvement of miRNAs in induction of drug resistance, particularly tamoxifen resistance, has not been explored. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of miR-214 in conferring cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer by targeting PTEN (19Yang H. Kong W. He L. Zhao J.J. O'Donnell J.D. Wang J. Wenham R.M. Coppola D. Kruk P.A. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Similar studies with gemcitabine-resistant cholangiocarcinoma showed that inhibition of miR-21 and miR-200b sensitizes cholangiocytes to gemcitabine (20Meng F. Henson R. Lang M. Wehbe H. Maheshwari S. Mendell J.T. Jiang J. Schmittgen T.D. Patel T. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 2113-2129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The present study showed significantly increased expression of eight miRNAs and down-regulation of seven miRNAs in a tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell line compared with a tamoxifen-sensitive cell line. A finding of considerable clinical significance was the increased expression of miR-221 and miR-222 in HER2/neu-positive compared with HER2/neu-negative primary human breast tumors that are resistant to endocrine therapy. Earlier studies identified increased expression of miR-221 and miR-222 as a signature of primary glioblastoma (12Ciafre S.A. Galardi S. Mangiola A. Ferracin M. Liu C.G. Sabatino G. Negrini M.

https://openalex.org/W2101739174,"The role of primary visual cortex (V1) in determining the contents of perception is controversial. Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of perceptual suppression have revealed a robust drop in V1 activity when a stimulus is subjectively invisible. In contrast, monkey single-unit recordings have failed to demonstrate such perception-locked changes in V1. To investigate the basis of this discrepancy, we measured both the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response and several electrophysiological signals in two behaving monkeys. We found that all signals were in good agreement during conventional stimulus presentation, showing strong visual modulation to presentation and removal of a stimulus. During perceptual suppression, however, only the BOLD response and the low-frequency local field potential (LFP) power showed decreases, whereas the spiking and high-frequency LFP power were unaffected. These results demonstrate that the coupling between the BOLD and electrophysiological signals in V1 is context dependent, with a marked dissociation occurring during perceptual suppression."

https://openalex.org/W2000523097,"Redox control in the mitochondrion is essential for the proper functioning of this organelle. Disruption of mitochondrial redox processes contributes to a host of human disorders, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging. To better characterize redox control pathways in this organelle, we have targeted a green fluorescent protein-based redox sensor to the intermembrane space (IMS) and matrix of yeast mitochondria. This approach allows us to separately monitor the redox state of the matrix and the IMS, providing a more detailed picture of redox processes in these two compartments. To verify that the sensors respond to localized glutathione (GSH) redox changes, we have genetically manipulated the subcellular redox state using oxidized GSH (GSSG) reductase localization mutants. These studies indicate that redox control in the cytosol and matrix are maintained separately by cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of GSSG reductase. Our studies also demonstrate that the mitochondrial IMS is considerably more oxidizing than the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix and is not directly influenced by endogenous GSSG reductase activity. These redox measurements are used to predict the oxidation state of thiol-containing proteins that are imported into the IMS."
https://openalex.org/W2006815009,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are critical for synaptic plasticity that underlies learning and memory. But, they have also been described as a common source of neuronal damage during stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have suggested that cellular location of NMDARs (synaptic or extrasynaptic) is a key parameter controlling their effect on neuronal viability. The aim of the study was to understand the relation between these two pools of receptors and to determine their implication in both beneficial and/or deleterious events related to NMDAR activation. We demonstrated that selective extrasynaptic NMDAR activation, as well as NMDA bath application, does not activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, but induces mitochondrial membrane potential breakdown and triggers cell body and dendrite damages, whereas synaptic NMDAR activation is innocuous and induces a sustained ERK activation. The functional dichotomy between these two NMDAR pools is tightly controlled by glutamate uptake systems. Finally, we demonstrated that the only clinically approved NMDAR antagonist, memantine, preferentially antagonizes extrasynaptic NMDARs. Together, these results suggest that extrasynaptic NMDAR activation contributes to excitotoxicity and that a selective targeting of the extrasynaptic NMDARs represents a promising therapeutic strategy for brain injuries."

https://openalex.org/W2049656155,"During helminth infections, alternatively activated macrophages (AAMacs) are key to promoting Th2 responses and suppressing Th1-driven inflammatory pathology. Th2 cytokines IL-4 and/or IL-13 are believed to be important in the induction and activation of AAMacs. Using murine models for the helminth infections caused by Fasciola hepatica (Fh) and Schistosoma mansoni (Sm), we show that a secreted antioxidant, peroxiredoxin (Prx), induces alternative activation of macrophages. These activated, Ym1-expressing macrophages enhanced the secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 from naive CD4(+) T cells. Administration of recombinant FhPrx and SmPrx to wild-type and IL-4(-/-) and IL-13(-/-) mice induced the production of AAMacs. In addition, Prx stimulated the expression of markers of AAMacs (particularly, Ym1) in vitro, and therefore can act independently of IL-4/IL-13 signaling. The immunomodulatory property of Prx is not due to its antioxidant activity, as an inactive recombinant variant with active site Cys residues replaced by Gly could also induce AAMacs and Th2 responses. Immunization of mice with recombinant Prx or passive transfer of anti-Prx antibodies prior to infection with Fh not only blocked the induction of AAMacs but also the development of parasite-specific Th2 responses. We propose that Prx activates macrophages as an initial step in the induction of Th2 responses by helminth parasites and is thereby a novel pathogen-associated molecular pattern."

Here we demonstrate that mouse embryonic stem cells sorted for low and high resting mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨmL and ΔΨmH) are indistinguishable morphologically and by the expression of pluripotency markers, whereas markedly differing in metabolic rates. Interestingly, ΔΨmL cells are highly efficient at in vitro mesodermal differentiation yet fail to efficiently form teratomas in vivo, whereas ΔΨmH cells behave in the opposite fashion. We further demonstrate that ΔΨm reflects the degree of overall mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduces metabolic rate, augments differentiation, and inhibits tumor formation of the mouse embryonic stem cells with a high metabolic rate.

Such supposition is supported by experimental evidence that murine embryonic stem cells (mES) 4The abbreviations used are: mES, murine embryonic stem cells; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; TMRM, tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; FACS, fluorescent activated cell sorting; SCID, severe combined immune deficiency. 4The abbreviations used are: mES, murine embryonic stem cells; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; TMRM, tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; FACS, fluorescent activated cell sorting; SCID, severe combined immune deficiency. cells appear resistant to exogenous oxidative stress (1Saretzki G. Armstrong L. Leake A. Lako M. von Zglinicki T. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 962-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This resistance has been attributed to increased antioxidant protein defenses in mES cells when compared with more differentiated mouse cells (1Saretzki G. Armstrong L. Leake A. Lako M. von Zglinicki T. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 962-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that stem cells may preferentially reside in low oxygen niches (2Keith B. Simon M.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 465-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). The best studied example appears to be for hematopoietic stem cells where both theoretical and direct experimental evidence suggests that hematopoietic stem cells preferentially reside within the most hypoxic regions of the bone marrow (3Chow D.C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5431-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). It has long been known that lowering ambient oxygen concentrations can regulate mitochondrial metabolism and hence alter intracellular reactive oxygen species generation (5Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar). In this context, it is believed that residing within low oxygen environments may help reduce the long term exposure of the stem cell to oxidative damage.Consistent with a role for ambient oxygen in determining stem cell fate, a number of reports have previously demonstrated that low levels of oxygen might promote hematopoietic stem cell function (6Cipolleschi M.G. Dello Sbarba P. Olivotto M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2031-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Danet G.H. Pan Y. Luongo J.L. Bonnet D.A. Simon M.C. J. Clin.

Transfusion (Malden). 2000; 40: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the differentiation of mES cells into hematopoietic progenitors was augmented under hypoxic conditions (9Ramirez-Bergeron D.L. Runge A. Dahl K.D. Fehling H.J. Keller G. Simon M.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4623-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Such observations are not, however, limited to hematopoietic differentiation as oxygen concentration appears to also affect the differentiation of neural stem cells (10Morrison S.J. Csete M. Groves A.K. Melega W. Wold B. Anderson D.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7370-7376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Studer L. Csete M. Lee S.H. Kabbani N. Walikonis J. Wold B. McKay R. J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1669-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar).The precise molecular bases for these effects are unclear. Several studies have implicated that activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) or HIF-2α may play a significant role in the observed enhanced differentiation of stem cells under low oxygen conditions (2Keith B. Simon M.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 465-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Such observations are supported by studies demonstrating that mouse ES cells lacking aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), the requisite cofactor for HIF, are impaired in their ability to differentiate along the hemangioblast and early mesoderm lineages (9Ramirez-Bergeron D.L. Runge A. Dahl K.D. Fehling H.J. Keller G. Simon M.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4623-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, the HIF family of transcriptional activators appears to regulate a number of genes involved in stem cell function and self-renewal (2Keith B. Simon M.C.

From our assessment of the literature, we found surprisingly little information regarding the role of mitochondrial metabolism in stem cell biology. In this study, we demonstrate that a significant relationship exists between mitochondrial activity and underlying stem cell function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Murine ROSA26 ES cells (mES cells) were generously provided by Dr. Philippe Soriano (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). In most experiments, we employed mES cells that were maintained in a feeder-free, serum-free culture environment as described previously (16Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments were performed using mES cells plated onto 1% gelatin-coated plates in N2B27 medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 ng/ml BMP-4 (R&D Systems). Cells were grown to a density of 25,000 cells/cm2 and passaged every 2 days. To induce differentiation, sorted or unsorted mES cells were plated onto 1% gelatin-coated plates at an initial density of 2,000 cells/cm2. After removal of the normal LIF-containing medium, the cells were differentiated in N2B27 medium containing 5 ng/ml BMP-4 and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 5 or 20% O2. Where indicated, rapamycin (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 20 nm coincident with the withdrawal of LIF and continued until Flk-1 assessment on day 4.Immunoblotting and Isolation of Nuclear Fractions—Antibodies for immunoblotting were as follows: mTOR, raptor, phospho-p70 S6K1 (Thr-421/Ser-424), p70 S6K1, phospho-S6 (Ser-235/236), S6 (all from Cell Signaling Technology), rictor (Bethyl Laboratories), HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals), and SIRT1 (Upstate Biotechnology). Western blot analysis was performed by standard methods using enhanced chemiluminescence. Nuclear extracts were isolated with the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce Biotechnology).Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Sorting—Membrane potential was assessed using the potentiometric dye tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 25 nm for 15 min. For sorting of cells with different mitochondrial membrane potential, mES cells were sorted into two pools corresponding to the cells with the lowest (5%) and highest (5%) TMRM fluorescence (17Schieke S.M. Phillips D. McCoy Jr., J.P. Aponte A.M. Shen R.F. Balaban R.S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27643-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Cell sorting was performed on a MoFlo flow cytometer (Dako-Cytomation).Phenotypic Analysis of ES Cells—To compare stem cell morphology, differential interference contrast images were taken using a Zeiss-510 Confocal system (Carl Zeiss). For real-time PCR analysis of gene expression, RNA was isolated from cells exhibiting high or low mitochondrial membrane potential using the RNEasy kit (Qiagen). Gene expression was normalized to 18 S rRNA levels using the following set of primers: mOct4 F1, 5′-CCA ATC AGC TTG GGC TAG AG-3′; mOct4 R1, 5′-CCT GGG AAA GGT GTC CTG TA-3′; mNanog F1, 5′-CAC CCA CCC ATG CTA GTC TT-3′; MNanog R1, 5′-ACC CTC AAA CTC CTG GTC CT-3′; mBrachyury F1, 5′-TGT GGC TGC GCT TCA AGG AGC-3′; mBrachyury R1, 5′-GTA GAC GCA GCT GGG CGC CTG-3′;18SF1,5′-TTT CGG AAC TGA GGC CAT GA-3′; 18 S R1, 5′-GCA AAT GCT TTC GCT CTG GTC-3′.Expression analysis of Flk-1 or SSEA-1 was performed using the FACSCanto cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). Primary antibodies included mouse anti-SSEA-1 (Chemicon International) and rat anti-Flk-1 (eBioscience) and the corresponding isotype controls (eBioscience). The dilution of primary antibody was 1:100. Data for real-time-PCR expression level and Flk-1 differentiation represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments each performed in triplicate.Oxygen Consumption, Lactate, and ATP Measurements—Oxygen consumption was determined using the BD oxygen biosensor system (BD Biosciences) as described previously (17Schieke S.M. Phillips D. McCoy Jr., J.P. Aponte A.M. Shen R.F. Balaban R.S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27643-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in culture medium and subsequently transferred to a 96-well plate where equal numbers of cells (7 × 105) were placed in each well. Levels of oxygen consumption were measured under baseline conditions and in the presence of FCCP (1 μm; Sigma-Aldrich) or oligomycin (0.2 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Fluorescence was recorded using a GENios multimode reader (Tecan) at 2-min intervals for 2 h at an excitation of 485 nm and emission of 630 nm. For semiquantitative data analysis, the maximum slope of fluorescence units/s was used and converted into arbitrary units. Lactate and ATP were measured using the lactate reagent (Trinity Biotech) and the ATP determination kit (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Teratoma Assays and Blastocyst Injection—To assess tumorigenesis, 4-week-old male SCID-Beige mice were injected into the hind limb muscle with the indicated number of either sorted or unsorted ES cells. After 25 days, mice were sacrificed, and the teratomas were surgically removed and weighed. For injection of rapamycin (LC Laboratories), the drug was reconstituted in absolute ethanol at 10 mg/ml and diluted in 5% Tween 80 (Sigma) and 5% polyethylene glycol 400 (Hampton Research). Vehicle alone or rapamycin (4 mg/kg of body weight) was injected daily. The final volume of all intraperitoneal injections was 200 μl. For blastocyst injection experiments, 10–15 sorted mES cells were injected into 3.5-day-old mouse blastocysts. The ROSA26 mES cell line harbors the β-galactosidase reporter gene. Following harvesting of the embryos 7–10 days later, staining for β-galactosidase expression was performed by standard means.RESULTSWe have recently demonstrated that employing the mitochondrial membrane potential sensitive dye TMRM coupled with fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) allows for the purification within clonal cell lines of cell populations with intrinsically different levels of mitochondrial oxygen consumption (17Schieke S.M. Phillips D. McCoy Jr., J.P. Aponte A.M. Shen R.F. Balaban R.S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27643-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). In an attempt to adopt this strategy to populations of stem cells, we loaded mES cells with TMRM and sorted cells for either high or low fluorescence (bottom and top 5%). As seen in Fig. 1, immediately after sorting, these two different ΔΨm populations were phenotypically indistinguishable. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that both populations expressed the ES cell markers Oct4 and Nanog to a similar degree. In addition, FACS analysis revealed that the mES cell surface marker SSEA-1 was identically expressed in these two cell populations. As would be expected based on resting membrane potential, levels of endogenous mitochondrial NADH differed between the two different ΔΨm populations. The latter results suggest that differences in TMRM fluorescence represent intrinsic differences in mitochondrial properties and are not merely a reflection of differences in the uptake or extrusion of the fluorophore. To more formally test this notion, we directly measured the metabolic parameters of ΔΨmL versus ΔΨmH cells. As seen in Fig. 2A, there was an approximate 20-fold difference in resting oxygen consumption between these two populations of cells. Measured oxygen consumption in both populations was essentially eliminated in the presence of oligomycin, demonstrating that the vast majority of oxygen consumption in both cell types derived from mitochondrial metabolism (Fig. 2A). Similar to resting oxygen consumption, maximal oxidative capacity (FCCP-induced maximal respiration) was also markedly different in the two cell populations. Although these initial 20-fold or greater metabolic differences were striking, with time in culture, these differences were reduced. Twenty-four hours after sorting, there was an approximate 3-fold difference in metabolism, whereas by 48 h, both membrane potential and oxygen consumption were similar between the two sorted populations (data not shown). Next we sought to characterize the glycolytic rate in the two stem cell populations. As seen in Fig. 2B, the ΔΨmH cells showed an ∼1.5-fold higher level of lactate production, indicating a higher glycolytic flux.FIGURE 2Mitochondrial metabolism and mES cell mesodermal differentiation. A, oxygen consumption of ΔΨmL and ΔΨmH cells under resting conditions (black bar), in the presence of the mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin (shaded bar), or in the presence of the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP. The respiration rates shown are triplicate determinations (mean ± S.D.) of a single experiment and are representative of three similar experiments. B, lactate production as a marker of glycolytic rate of ΔΨmL and ΔΨmH cells determined after sorting (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). C, differentiation was induced by withdrawal of LIF. Flk-1 expression was assessed immediately after sorting (d0) and again on day 4 for either ΔΨmL (blue) or ΔΨmH (red) mES cells. D, real-time-PCR analysis for Brachyury expression on days 0 and 3 (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). E, unsorted cells were cultured under 20 or 5% oxygen conditions and induced to differentiate by LIF withdrawal. The percentage of cells expressing Flk-1 was assessed on day 4. Data are from a single experiment performed in triplicate and are representative of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, at all times, resting ATP levels per mg of protein were essentially indistinguishable (ATP: ΔΨmH/ΔΨmL = 1.02 ± 0.05; n = 3, p = not significant). Thus, like in most cells, energy production and consumption are presumably matched to maintain ATP levels within a relatively narrow range. Since the ΔΨmH cells have a considerably higher overall metabolic rate (e.g. both increased oxygen consumption and increased glycolytic rates), they undoubtedly exhibit a greater flux of ATP with both increased ATP generation as well as increased ATP consumption.Previous studies have demonstrated that the withdrawal of LIF allows for BMP-4-induced differentiation of ES cells toward the mesodermal lineage (19Johansson B.M. Wiles M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Such differentiation is usually assessed by the expression of markers such as Flk-1 and Brachyury (20Yamaguchi T.P. Dumont D.J. Conlon R.A. Breitman M.L. Rossant J. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 489-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. Herrmann B.G. Nature. 1990; 343: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). To assess whether mitochondrial metabolism might correlate with differentiation potential, we cultured ΔΨmL and ΔΨmH cells in the presence of BMP-4 and the absence of LIF. Immediately after sorting, neither population expressed Flk-1, consistent with both populations being undifferentiated ES cells. Four days later, nearly 60% of ΔΨmL cells had differentiated, whereas this occurred in less then 10% of the ΔΨmH cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, under these conditions, the level of differentiation in unsorted cells was usually between 20 and 30%. Similarly, by real-time PCR analysis, Brachyury expression was undetectable in both populations initially, but by day 3, we noted an approximate 10-fold difference between the ΔΨmL and ΔΨmH cells (Fig. 2D). Careful time course analysis revealed that the reduced differentiation observed in the ΔΨmH cells was not a result of altered timing as peak Flk-1 expression was observed on day 4 and the peak Brachyury expression was observed on day 3 in both populations.To further confirm the relationship between mitochondrial metabolism and the potential for in vitro stem cell differentiation, we sought ways of experimentally manipulating cellular oxygen consumption. Unfortunately, little is known as to what sets resting mitochondrial membrane potential. Although we tried a number of mitochondrial pharmacological inhibitors, all produced significant energetic collapse followed by substantial loss in cell viability. 5S. M. Schieke, and T. Finkel, unpublished observations. In contrast, when we simply altered mitochondrial oxygen consumption by altering ambient oxygen concentration, we noted that mES cell differentiation was sensitive to these perturbations. As noted in Fig. 2E, mES cell differentiation along the mesodermal lineage was attenuated at 20% oxygen when compared with similar induction of differentiation at 5% oxygen concentrations. These results further underline the relationship found in our sorting experiments between mitochondrial metabolism and mesodermal differentiation of mES cells.Although 5% ambient oxygen is lower than routine culture conditions, it is not generally believed to be sufficient to stimulate a hypoxic response. As expected, at this oxygen concentration, we saw little evidence for HIF-1α activation in our mES cells (Fig. 3A). Similarly, we saw no evidence of HIF-1α activation in our ΔΨmL sorted cells, suggesting that preferential activation of this pathway was unlikely playing a role in the high level of differentiation seen in this cell population (Fig. 3B). Recently, we and others have noted a connection between mTOR activity and mitochondrial metabolism (17Schieke S.M. Phillips D. McCoy Jr., J.P. Aponte A.M. Shen R.F. Balaban R.S. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27643-27652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 22Cunningham J.T. Rodgers J.T. Arlow D.H. Vazquez F. Mootha V.K. Puigserver P. Nature. 2007; 450: 736-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the differences in differentiation potential seen between mES cells maintained at 20 or 5% oxygen or between ΔΨmL and ΔΨmH cells might reflect different levels of mTOR activity. As noted in Fig. 3C, whereas absolute levels of mTOR and its associated proteins rictor and raptor did not differ depending on oxygen concentration, mTOR activity as assessed by phospho-S6 kinase (Fig. 3C, pS6K) and phosphorylated ribosomal S6 (Fig. 3C, pS6) levels were increased as oxygen tension was increased from 1.5 to 20%. This is consistent with either an inhibition of mTOR activity at low oxygen concentrations or an increase in mTOR activity as oxygen concentrations rise. A similar difference in mTOR activity was seen in the two populations of cells sorted by mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Activity levels of mTOR correlate with mES cell metabolism and differentiation. A, expression of HIF-1α in nuclear extract of mES cells induced to differentiate at the indicated concentration of ambient oxygen.

C, analysis of the activity and absolute level of expression of mTOR and its associated proteins rictor and raptor in cells cultured under varying oxygen tensions. mTOR activity was assessed by analysis of the downstream target, phosphorylated S6 kinase (pS6K), and the phosphorylation target of S6 kinase (S6K), ribosomal S6 (S6). pS6, phosphorylated ribosomal S6. D, similar mTOR protein and activity analysis for mES cells sorted by mitochondrial membrane potential.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next took advantage of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to ask whether we could manipulate mitochondrial function and correspondingly alter mES cell fate. As expected, treatment of mES cells with rapamycin inhibited mTOR activity (Fig. 4A). Moreover, rapamycin treatment resulted in a corresponding decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 4D), oxygen consumption (Fig. 4B), and lactate production (Fig. 4C), thus mimicking the metabolic phenotype of the ΔΨmL mES. Furthermore, rapamycin modestly decreased the proliferation rate in mES cells (Fig. 4E).FIGURE 4Rapamycin (RAP) alters metabolism and stimulates mES cell differentiation. A, treatment with rapamycin inhibits mTOR activity. pS6K, phospho-S6 kinase; S6K, S6 kinase; pS6, phosphorylated ribosomal S6. B, rapamycin treatment reduces mES cell oxygen consumption (shown is one of two similar experiments performed in triplicate, mean ± S.D.). C, rapamycin exposure reduces lactate production (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). D, treatment with rapamycin reduces mitochondrial membrane potential. E, proliferation curves of mES cells in the presence (gray) and absence (black) of rapamycin. Shown are the results of one representative experiment performed in triplicate (mean ± S.D.). F, representative FACS histograms demonstrating marked augmentation of mesodermal differentiation as assessed by expression of Flk-1 on day 4 following LIF withdrawal in mES cells treated with rapamycin. G, quantification of three independent experiments demonstrating increased Flk-1 expression of rapamycin treated mES cells (mean ± S.D.; p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next asked whether such treatment altered the capacity of mES cells to differentiate. As demonstrated in Fig. 4F, consistent with its effects on mitochondrial metabolism, treatment of mES cells with rapamycin augmented in vitro mesodermal differentiation. Under the conditions employed, rapamycin treatment boosted the percentage of ES cells exhibiting Flk-1 expression over 2-fold (Fig. 4G).In the absence of differentiation, mES cells remain in a pluripotent state. Such cells when injected into immunocompromised hosts are believed to form teratomas. At present, this property of ES cells is a major limitation to their clinical utility (23Deb K.D. Sarda K. J. Transl. Med. 2008; 6: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We wondered whether in contrast to our observations regarding differentiation, a reciprocal relationship existed between membrane potential and teratoma formation. As described previously, we therefore sorted mES cells based on their intrinsic mitochondrial membrane potential and then injected equal numbers of ΔΨmL and ΔΨmH cells into SCID mice recipients. As a control, we also injected the same number of mES cells from the bulk population of unsorted cells. These bulk mES cells exhibited a normal distribution of both membrane potentials and oxygen consumption. As seen in Fig. 5A, assessment of these tumors 25 days after injection demonstrated that teratoma formation was remarkably related to the previously described initial metabolic parameters. Histologic analysis of the tumors formed after injection of ΔΨmH cells revealed that these cells were capable to differentiate into tissues of all three germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm (Fig. 5, B–E). To further establish that ΔΨmH cells are pluripotent, we used these cells in a blastocyst injection. As seen in Fig. 5F, ΔΨmH cells appear to be capable of contributing to all three germ layers of the developing embryo (Fig. 5F).FIGURE 5Teratoma formation reflects intrinsic metabolic capacity. A, cells were sorted based on mitochondrial activity, and equal numbers (3 × 106) of high, low, or unsorted mES cells were injected into SCID mice. Twenty-five days later, tumors were excised, and the sizes of tumors were measured.

To test this, we injected SCID mice with equal amounts of ΔΨmL and ΔΨmH cells and then randomized these animals to treatment with daily injections of vehicle or rapamycin (Fig. 6). Although the total number of mES cells injected in these experiments was reduced when compared with the experiments described in Fig. 5, once again, the ΔΨmH cells formed significantly larger tumors than the ΔΨmL cells. Interestingly, the tumors formed by the ΔΨmH cells were also markedly inhibited by the administration of rapamycin (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Rapamycin (RAP) preferentially inhibits growth of teratomas after injection of ΔΨmH cells. SCID mice were injected with 1 × 106 ΔΨmL or ΔΨmH cells, and then injected animals were randomized for daily injections of rapamycin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle.

https://openalex.org/W2063092201,"PDZ domains represent one of the largest families of interaction domains. Chen et al. develop a scoring matrix that enables prediction of peptide–PDZ domain interactions. Unlike previous methods, the model works to some extent for PDZ domains that were not part of the training set. PDZ domains constitute one of the largest families of interaction domains and function by binding the C termini of their target proteins1,2. Using Bayesian estimation, we constructed a three-dimensional extension of a position-specific scoring matrix that predicts to which peptides a PDZ domain will bind, given the primary sequences of the PDZ domain and the peptides. The model, which was trained using interaction data from 82 PDZ domains and 93 peptides encoded in the mouse genome3, successfully predicts interactions involving other mouse PDZ domains, as well as PDZ domains from Drosophila melanogaster and, to a lesser extent, PDZ domains from Caenorhabditis elegans. The model also predicts the differential effects of point mutations in peptide ligands on their PDZ domain–binding affinities. Overall, we show that our approach captures, in a single model, the binding selectivity of the PDZ domain family."
https://openalex.org/W1986606670,"Small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) regulate diverse cellular processes through their covalent attachment to target proteins. Vertebrates express three SUMO paralogs: SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 (SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are approximately 96% identical and referred to as SUMO-2/3). SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 are conjugated, at least in part, to unique subsets of proteins and thus regulate distinct cellular pathways. However, how different proteins are selectively modified by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 is unknown. We demonstrate that BLM, the RecQ DNA helicase mutated in Bloom syndrome, is preferentially modified by SUMO-2/3 both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings indicate that non-covalent interactions between SUMO and BLM are required for modification at non-consensus sites and that preferential SUMO-2/3 modification is determined by preferential SUMO-2/3 binding. We also present evidence that sumoylation of a C-terminal fragment of HIPK2 is dependent on SUMO binding, indicating that non-covalent interactions between SUMO and target proteins provide a general mechanism for SUMO substrate selection and possible paralog-selective modification."

Released ATP and the hydrolytic product adenosine regulate chemotaxis of neutrophils by sequentially activating purinergic nucleotide and adenosine receptors, respectively. Here we show that that ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (E-NTPDase1, CD39) is a critical enzyme for hydrolysis of released ATP by neutrophils and for cell migration in response to multiple agonists (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, interleukin-8, and C5a). Upon stimulation of human neutrophils or differentiated HL-60 cells in a chemotactic gradient, E-NTPDase1 tightly associates with the leading edge of polarized cells during chemotaxis. Inhibition of E-NTPDase1 reduces the migration speed of neutrophils but not their ability to detect the orientation of the gradient field.

ATP is released in a polarized manner at the leading edge of cells and amplifies chemotactic gradient signals by autocrine/paracrine feedback through P2Y2 receptors. Adenosine formed from released ATP stimulates cell migration toward the chemoattractant by activation of A3 adenosine receptors that accumulate at the leading edge of polarized PMN (8Chen Y.

The precise mechanisms by which PMN release and hydrolyze ATP, thereby regulating the responsiveness of P2Y2 receptors and generating adenosine, have not been identified.Several families of ecto-ATPases hydrolyze extracellular nucleotides in eukaryotic cells. The largest family, the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases), consists of eight members (E-NTPDase1–8), which hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates and diphosphates to monophosphates (10Zimmermann H. Abbracchio M.P. Williams M. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York2000: 209-250Google Scholar). The ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (E-NPPs) are the second largest family; these enzymes also hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates to monophosphates and, in addition, they can convert cAMP to adenosine (11Goding J.W. Grobben B. Slegers H. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2003; 1638: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatases (ALPs) are another family of ecto-ATPases, of which four isoforms have been identified (6Zimmermann H. Novartis Found. Symp. 2006; 276: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and finally, ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73), comprising one member only, catalyzes the conversion of AMP to adenosine (12Hunsucker S.A. Mitchell B.S. Spychala J. Pharmacol Ther. 2005; 107: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that E-NTPDase1, which is also known as CD39, is expressed and catalyzes the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by PMN and that this hydrolysis plays a critical role in chemotaxis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Monoclonal anti-tissue nonspecific ALP antibody was obtained from AbCam (Cambridge, MA). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen.PMN Isolation—The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and University of California San Diego (UCSD) Human Research Programs approved all experiments undertaken in this study. PMN were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers as described previously (13Junger W.G. Hoyt D. Davis R.E. Herdon-Remelius C. Namiki S. Junger H. Loomis W. Altman A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2768-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was treated with 5% Dextran-500, dissolved in normal saline, and allowed to sediment at room temperature for 30 min. The cells in the supernatant were then separated by Percoll gradient centrifugation and washed as described previously (13Junger W.G. Hoyt D. Davis R.E. Herdon-Remelius C. Namiki S. Junger H. Loomis W. Altman A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2768-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).HPLC Analysis of Extracellular Nucleotides—Cell culture supernatants were collected and analyzed using HPLC as described previously (8Chen Y. Corriden R. Inoue I. Yip L. Hashiguchi N. Zinkernagel A. Nizet V. Insel P.A. Junger W. Science. 2006; 314: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Nucleotides were identified, and their concentrations were estimated using their retention times as compared with known standards.Malachite Green Assay—Solutions of malachite green (0.812 g/liter deionized H2O), ammonium molybdate (0.3 m in 6 n HCl), and polyvinyl alcohol (23.2 g/liter H2O) were prepared as described previously (14Hohenwallner W. Wimmer E. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1973; 45: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To produce the assay solution, 4 ml of malachite green solution was mixed with 2 ml each of the ammonium molybdate and polyvinyl alcohol solutions. The supernatants of cell suspensions were collected and mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with the malachite green assay solution. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, samples were analyzed in a plate reader at 650 nm and compared with a KH2PO4 standard curve to obtain the concentration of inorganic phosphate.Immunofluorescence Staining—PMN (2.5 × 106/ml) were plated on glass coverslips and stimulated with 100 nm N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) for 10 min. The cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (Irvine Scientific) for 10 min at room temperature, and stained with antibodies using 500 ng/ml anti-tissue nonspecific ALP, 500 ng/ml anti-E-NTPDase1, and 4 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies, as described previously (9Chen Y. Shukla A. Namiki S. Insel P.A. Junger W.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from PMN using a TRIzol extraction method (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using primer sets and the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) and the DNA Engine Opticon 2 Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The comparative method for relative quantification of gene expression (Ct method) was used, and expression levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels.In Vitro Chemotaxis Assay by Microscopy—PMN (2.5 × 106/ml) were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) coated with 50 μg/ml human fibronectin and placed into a temperature-controlled stage incubator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) at 37 °C. Cells were treated as described below and exposed to a chemotactic gradient generated by the release of 10 nm fMLP using a micropipette tip attached to a FemtoJet injector (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Cell migration was tracked by acquiring 20 sequential images in 25-s intervals.In Vitro Transwell Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis assays in a Transwell system were performed using a 96-well Multi-Screen-MIC plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with a pore size of 3.0 μm. A 100-μl suspension of 1 × 106 PMN in HBSS, with or without the indicated concentrations of the E-NTPDase1 inhibitors ARL67156 or POM1, was added to each well of the upper filter plate. Chemoattractants, either 10 nm fMLP, 10 ng/ml IL-8, or 10% zymosan-activated serum (C5a), were added to each of the lower wells (150 μl final volume). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the upper plate was removed, and cells in the lower plate were lysed by the addition of 10 μl/well of elastase assay buffer consisting of 500 mm Tris/HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Elastase reactions used to estimate cell numbers in the lower wells were started by the addition of the chromogenic elastase substrate N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide at a final assay concentration of 1 mm. After 30 min at room temperature, changes in optical density were measured at a wavelength of 405 nm.In Vivo Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis of PMN was assessed in wild-type (WT) and CD39-knock-out mice as described previously (8Chen Y. Corriden R. Inoue I. Yip L. Hashiguchi N. Zinkernagel A. Nizet V. Insel P.A. Junger W. Science. 2006; 314: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of a 1 nm solution of the mouse formyl peptide receptor ligand WKYMVM (W-peptide; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Belmont, CA) in normal saline was injected intraperitoneally. After 2 h, mice were euthanized, peritoneal cavities were lavaged with 3 ml of ice-cold HBSS containing 1% mouse serum, and leukocyte numbers were counted.RESULTSHydrolysis of Extracellular Nucleotides by PMN—Like many other cell types, human PMN release ATP in response to a number of stimuli (15Bodin P. Burnstock G. Neurochem. Res. 2001; 26: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 16Yegutkin G. Bodin P. Burnstock G. Br. J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: G1222-G1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP release in response to fMLP along with its the ATP hydrolytic product adenosine regulates polarization and migration of PMN (8Chen Y. Corriden R. Inoue I. Yip L. Hashiguchi N. Zinkernagel A. Nizet V. Insel P.A. Junger W. Science. 2006; 314: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To evaluate the hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides by PMN, we added ATP, ADP, or AMP (100 μm) to PMN (5 × 106 in 0.25 ml of HBSS) and used HPLC to assess the concentrations of each nucleotide and their hydrolytic products after different incubation periods at 37 °C. We found that PMN hydrolyzed 100 μm ATP by >80% within 10 min; AMP concentrations increased correspondingly, but concentrations of ADP remained low and changed little over time (Fig. 1A). These results imply that PMN hydrolyze extracellular ATP directly to AMP, generating negligible amounts of ADP in the process. Such catalytic properties are characteristic of E-NTPDase1 (6Zimmermann H. Novartis Found. Symp. 2006; 276: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for this enzyme in ATP hydrolysis, we found that PMN efficiently hydrolyze extracellular ADP, reducing 100 μm ADP by ∼60% within 10 min of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 1B). By contrast, PMN hydrolyzed <10% of 100 μm AMP under similar incubation conditions (Fig. 1C). Hydrolysis of AMP is thus a rate-limiting step in the generation of extracellular adenosine by PMN.Real-time RT-PCR Evaluation of Ecto-nucleotidase Expression—To determine which nucleotide-hydrolyzing enzyme(s) might mediate the hydrolysis of ATP, we used real-time RT-PCR analysis to evaluate the expression of ecto-nucleotidases in PMN and HL-60 cells, which were differentiated to a neutrophil-like phenotype (Fig. 2). Based on the enzymatic activities determined above (Fig. 1), we focused our attention on members of the E-NTPDase enzyme family, which catalyze hydrolysis of ATP and ADP but not AMP, and on enzymes that generate adenosine (6Zimmermann H. Novartis Found. Symp. 2006; 276: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We detected the expression of two E-NTPDases that hydrolyze ATP to AMP (E-NTPDase1 and E-NTPDase2) and of tissue-nonspecific ALP, which, among other activities, hydrolyzes AMP to adenosine (6Zimmermann H. Novartis Found. Symp. 2006; 276: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We also found expression of two members of the E-NPP family (E-NPP1 and E-NPP2), although only one of these enzymes, E-NPP2, was expressed at significant levels. The relative expression levels of ecto-nucleotidases in differentiated HL-60 cells were similar to those in PMN with dominant mRNA expression of both E-NTPDase1 and E-NTPDase2 (Fig. 2B). HL-60 cells did not express tissue-nonspecific ALP but showed a higher relative expression of E-NPP2. E-NTPDase4 was highly expressed in both cell types (data not shown); however, this enzyme hydrolyzes UTP and UDP but not ATP (10Zimmermann H. Abbracchio M.P. Williams M. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York2000: 209-250Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Quantification of mRNA levels of ecto-nucleotidases in PMN and HL-60 cells. Real-time PCR was used to assess mRNA expression levels (relative to 18 S RNA) of ecto-nucleotidases in PMN and differentiated HL-60 cells. E-NTPDase8 and ENPP3, ENPP4, and ENPP5 were not detected in either cell type. The data shown are mean ± S.D. for results obtained in 3 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetics of Extracellular Nucleotide Breakdown by PMN—Four of the eight known E-NTPDases (E-NTPDase1, E-NTPDase2, E-NTPDase3, and E-NTPDase8) hydrolyze ATP (6Zimmermann H. Novartis Found. Symp. 2006; 276: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Each is also capable of hydrolyzing ADP, but the relative efficiency of breakdown of ATP versus ADP varies among the isoforms. Thus, the E-NTPDases can be distinguished by their enzymatic activity in hydrolyzing ATP versus ADP. As shown above, we found that two E-NTPDases, E-NTPDase1 and E-NTPDase2, are expressed by human PMN. The relative efficiency of ATP versus ADP breakdown by E-NTPDase1 is 1.0 versus 0.5–0.9 (18Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Sevigny J. Siegel J.B. Anrather J. Beaudoin A.R. Bach F.H. Robson S.C. J. Biol.

To determine whether E-NTPDase1 or E-NTPDase2 is more important for the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by PMN, we examined the initial rates of hydrolysis of ATP and ADP (Fig. 3) and used Lineweaver-Burk plots to derive Km and Vmax values. PMN hydrolyzed ATP more effectively (Km = 20.9 μm, Vmax = 9.48 μmol of Pi/min/106 cells) than ADP (Km = 12.8 μm, Vmax = 1.78 μmol of Pi/min/106 cells). The enzymatic efficiencies for breakdown of ATP and ADP, derived by dividing Vmax by Km, yielded a ratio of 1:0.31. This result implies that E-NTPDase1 likely plays a dominant role in the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by PMN. Differentiated HL-60 cells also hydrolyzed ATP more effectively (Km = 2.46 μm, Vmax = 0.96 μmol of Pi/min/106 cells) than ADP (Km = 1.49 μm, Vmax = 0.23 μmol of Pi/min/106 cells). HL-60 cells, whereas overall not as efficient at hydrolyzing extracellular nucleotides as PMN, showed similar relative enzyme efficiencies for the breakdown of ATP and ADP (1:0.38).FIGURE 3Kinetics of nucleotide hydrolysis by PMN and HL-60 cells. Varying concentrations of ATP, ADP, and AMP were incubated with 106 PMN/ml (A) or 106 HL-60 cells/ml (B), and inorganic phosphate production was assayed as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” The initial reaction velocity of nucleotide hydrolysis was measured for each concentration. Data under “Results” for Km and Vmax were derived by Lineweaver-Burk analysis. AMP hydrolysis by PMN is shown in panel A in the inset. Data for AMP hydrolysis by HL-60 cells are not shown because such hydrolysis occurred at too low a rate to be detected. The data shown represent mean ± S.D. for 3 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PMN also hydrolyze AMP to adenosine, although at a much slower rate (Fig. 3A, inset), which did not make it possible to calculate Km and Vmax. Under identical conditions, HL-60 cells did not exhibit sufficient AMP hydrolysis to generate a detectable signal.Inhibition of E-NTPDase1 Blocks ATP Hydrolysis—To further test whether E-NTPDase1 preferentially mediates the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by PMN, we used two inhibitors of this enzyme: NaN3, which inhibits E-NTPDase1 (24Vlajkovic S.M. Thorne P.R. Housley G.D. Muñoz D.J. Kendrick I.S. Hear. Res. 1998; 117: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and ARL67156, which inhibits E-NTPDase1 and 3 (25Crack B.E. Pollard C.E. Beukers M.W. Roberts S.M. Hunt S.F. Ingall A.H. McKechnie K.C. IJzerman A.P. Leff P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Both NaN3 and ARL67156 inhibited ATP hydrolysis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Thus, the real-time RT-PCR results, the kinetics of enzyme activity, and the results with E-NTPDase inhibitors are all consistent with the conclusion that E-NTPDase1 plays an important role in the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by human PMN.FIGURE 4Inhibitors of E-NTPDase1 decrease nucleotide hydrolysis by PMN. PMN (106/ml in HBSS) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with increasing concentrations of NaN3, an inhibitor of E-NTPDase1 (A), or ARL67156, an inhibitor of E-NTPDase1 and E-NTPDase3 (B). Hydrolysis of 100 μm of the indicated nucleotides was assessed after a further 10 min using the malachite green assay. The data shown represent mean ± S.D. for 3 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibitors of E-NTPDase1 Inhibit PMN Chemotaxis—We assessed the contribution of E-NTPDase1-mediated hydrolysis of ATP to the regulation of chemotaxis of human PMN. Purified PMN migrated toward a point source of fMLP at an average speed of 4.7 ± 1.1 μm/min with an accuracy of gradient sensing, such that 94% of cells migrated toward the chemotactic source on paths that did not deviate >30° from a straight line (Fig. 5A). Inhibitors of ATP hydrolysis reduced the migration speed of PMN. ARL67156 reduced the average migration speed by 75% (1.2 ± 0.6 μm/min), but most cells (83%) maintained their migration path within 30° of a straight line toward the chemotactic source, indicating that gradient sensing is not substantially altered by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. NaN3 also inhibits E-NTPDase1 activity; it reduced the average migration speed by 66% (1.6 ± 0.6 μm/min), whereas leaving gradient sensing largely intact (85% of cells maintained a correct migration path). The reduction in cell migration speed produced by the inhibitors leads us to conclude that a function of E-NTPDase1 is to regulate the velocity of PMN during chemotaxis.FIGURE 5Inhibitors of E-NTPDase1 decrease PMN chemotaxis. A, PMN (1 × 104) were placed on fibronectin-coated coverslips in a microincubation chamber containing 1 ml of HBSS at 37 °C. Migration toward a point source of fMLP (100 nm) was monitored over 4 min using an inverted microscope, as described previously (8Chen Y. Corriden R. Inoue I. Yip L. Hashiguchi N. Zinkernagel A. Nizet V. Insel P.A. Junger W. Science. 2006; 314: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of E-NTPDase1 (ARL67156 or NaN3) were added to the cells 10 min before generation of the chemotactic gradient. The paths of individual cells migrating in the gradient field are plotted such that the y axis represents the straight-line paths from each cell origin to the point source of fMLP. Chemotactic patterns of control PMN (fMLP only) and PMN treated with ARL67156 (100 μm) or NaN3 (10 mm) are shown. The data are representative of 3 separate experiments. B, the potent E-NTPDase inhibitor sodium metatungstate (POM1) suppressed PMN chemotaxis induced by fMLP. Different concentrations of POM1 were added in the top and bottom wells of a Transwell assay system, and chemotaxis was determined as described above. C, PMN (1 × 106), in the presence or absence of ARL67156 (100 μm), were placed in the top well of a Transwell system, with the bottom wells containing fMLP (10 nm), IL-8 (10 ng/ml), or C5a (10% zymosan-activated serum). After 30 min at 37 °C, cells in the lower well were lysed, and relative migration levels were quantified by measuring elastase activity. The data shown (mean ± S.E.) were obtained in 3–4 separate experiments. Statistical differences between untreated and cells treated with ARL67156 were evaluated using the Student's t test (*, p < 0.001, **, p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sodium metatungstate (POM1) is an inhibitor of E-NTPDases that inhibitors E-NTPDase1, E-NTPDase2, and E-NTPDase3 with Ki values of 2.6, 3.3, and 28.8 μm, respectively (26Müller C.E.

We found that treatment of PMN with POM1 reduces chemotaxis at inhibitor concentrations that are consistent with E-NTPDase1 (Fig. 5B).To evaluate the role of E-NTPDase1 in PMN responses to multiple classes of chemoattractants, we assessed the effects of ARL67156 on cell migration toward fMLP, IL-8, and zymosan-activated serum (C5a) using a Transwell assay system. Treatment with ARL67156 substantially reduced the PMN migration in response to all three agonists (Fig. 5C). Thus, E-NTPDase1 modulates PMN chemotaxis in response to multiple types of chemoattractants.E-NTPDase1 Is Localized to the Leading Edge of Migrating PMN and HL-60 Cells—Given the functional role of E-NTPDase1 in regulating PMN chemotaxis, we used immunocytochemistry to determine the localization of this enzyme in human PMN. PMN were plated onto glass coverslips and stimulated with 10 nm fMLP for 2.5 min at 37 °C prior to fixation and staining with E-NTPDase1 antibodies. In 82% of polarized PMN, we observed accumulation of E-NTPDase1 at the leading edge (Fig. 6A); we found similar results in differentiated HL-60 cells (Fig. 6B). Thus, E-NTPDase1 is recruited to the leading edge during cell polarization. At the leading edge, this ecto-ATPase then hydrolyzes ATP that is most prominently released at this site during cell migration (8Chen Y. Corriden R. Inoue I. Yip L. Hashiguchi N. Zinkernagel A. Nizet V. Insel P.A. Junger W. Science. 2006; 314: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar).FIGURE 6Localization of E-NTPDase1 in migrating PMN and HL-60 cells. PMN or differentiated HL-60 cells were plated on glass coverslips, stimulated with 10 nm fMLP, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and stained using a murine antibody to E-NTPDase1 followed by a fluorescent secondary goat anti-mouse antibody. The top and middle panels show bright field and fluorescent images, respectively. The bottom panels show pixel intensity diagrams of fluorescence along the length of cells. Gray dashed lines indicate the start and endpoints of the fluorescence intensity diagrams and represent the leading edge and uropod/back end of cells, respectively (RFU, relative fluorescence units). The results shown are representative of findings from 3 separate experiments obtained in at least 50 PMN or HL-60 cells and indicate that maximal fluorescence is present at the leading edge.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)E-NTPDase1 Knock-out Mice Show Impaired PMN Migration—To study the role of E-NTPDase1 in the migration of PMN in an in vivo setting, we assessed the influx of PMN into the abdominal cavities of E-NTPDase1 knock-out mice and WT controls in response to formyl peptide receptor ligand W-peptide injected into the peritoneal cavity as described previously (8Chen Y.

https://openalex.org/W2086209070,"IsdG and IsdI are paralogous proteins that are intracellular components of a complex heme uptake system in Staphylococcus aureus. IsdG and IsdI were shown previously to reductively degrade hemin. Crystal structures of the apoproteins show that these proteins belong to a newly identified heme degradation family distinct from canonical eukaryotic and prokaryotic heme oxygenases. Here we report the crystal structures of an inactive N7A variant of IsdG in complex with Fe(3+)-protoporphyrin IX (IsdG-hemin) and of IsdI in complex with cobalt protoporphyrin IX (IsdI-CoPPIX) to 1.8 A or better resolution. These structures show that the metalloporphyrins are buried into similar deep clefts such that the propionic acids form salt bridges to two Arg residues. His(77) (IsdG) or His(76) (IsdI), a critical residue required for activity, is coordinated to the Fe(3+) or Co(3+) atoms, respectively. The bound porphyrin rings form extensive steric interactions in the binding cleft such that the rings are highly distorted from the plane. This distortion is best described as ruffled and places the beta- and delta-meso carbons proximal to the distal oxygen-binding site. In the IsdG-hemin structure, Fe(3+) is pentacoordinate, and the distal side is occluded by the side chain of Ile(55). However, in the structure of IsdI-CoPPIX, the distal side of the CoPPIX accommodates a chloride ion in a cavity formed through a conformational change in Ile(55). The chloride ion participates in a hydrogen bond to the side chain amide of Asn(6). Together the structures suggest a reaction mechanism in which a reactive peroxide intermediate proceeds with nucleophilic oxidation at the beta- or delta-meso carbon of the hemin."
https://openalex.org/W2151741551,"Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ that produces a variety of secretory factors involved in the initiation of angiogenic processes. The bioactive peptide apelin is the endogenous ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor, APJ. Here we investigated the potential role of apelin and its receptor, APJ, in the angiogenic responses of human endothelial cells and the development of a functional vascular network in a model of adipose tissue development in mice. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with apelin dose-dependently increased angiogenic responses, including endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and Matrigel(R) capillary tubelike structure formation. These endothelial effects of apelin were due to activation of APJ, because siRNA directed against APJ, which led to long-lasting down-regulation of APJ mRNA, abolished cell migration induced by apelin in contrast to control nonsilencing siRNA. Hypoxia up-regulated the expression of apelin in 3T3F442A adipocytes, and we therefore determined whether apelin could play a role in adipose tissue angiogenesis in vivo. Epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) transplantation was performed as a model of adipose tissue angiogenesis. Transplantation led to increased apelin mRNA levels 2 and 5 days after transplantation associated with tissue hypoxia, as evidenced by hydroxyprobe staining on tissue sections. Graft revascularization evolved in parallel, as the first functional vessels in EWAT grafts were observed 2 days after transplantation and a strong angiogenic response was apparent on day 14. This was confirmed by determination of graft hemoglobin levels, which are indicative of functional vascularization and were strongly increased 5 and 14 days after transplantation. The role of apelin in the graft neovascularization was then assessed by local delivery of stable complex apelin-targeting siRNA leading to dramatically reduced apelin mRNA levels and vascularization (quantified by hemogloblin content) in grafted EWAT on day 5 when compared with control siRNA. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that apelin/APJ signaling pathways play a critical role in the development of the functional vascular network in adipose tissue. In addition, we have shown that adipocyte-derived apelin can be up-regulated by hypoxia. These findings provide novel insights into the complex relationship between adipose tissue and endothelial vascular function and may lead to new therapeutic strategies to modulate angiogenesis."

IGFBP7 gene regulation and its potential role in tumor angiogenesis remain unclear. Mechanisms of IGFBP7 induction and its angiogenic capacity were examined in human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) exposed to tumor-like conditions. HBEC treated with GBM cell (U87MG)-conditioned media (-CM) exhibited fourfold upregulation of IGFBP7 mRNA and protein compared to control cells. IGFBP7 gene regulation in HBEC was methylation independent. U87MG-CM analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay contained approximately 5 pM transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, a concentration sufficient to stimulate IGFBP7 in HBEC to similar levels as U87MG-CM. Both pan-TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody (1D11) and the TGF-beta1 receptor (activin receptor-like kinase 5, ALK5) antagonist, SB431542, blocked U87MG-CM-induced IGFBP7 expression in HBEC, indicating that TGF-beta1 is an important tumor-secreted effector capable of IGFBP7 induction in endothelial cells. HBEC exposed to either U87MG-CM or IGFBP7 protein exhibited increased capillary-like tube (CLT) formation in Matrigel. Both TGF-beta1- and U87MG-CM-induced Smad-2 phosphorylation and U87MG-CM-induced CLT formation in HBEC were inhibited by the ALK5 antagonist, SB431542. These data suggest that proangiogenic IGFBP7 may be induced in brain endothelial cells by TGF-betas secreted by GBM, most likely through TGF-beta1/ALK5/Smad-2 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2148144015,"The alpha-crystallins are members of the small heat shock protein family of molecular chaperones that have evolved to minimize intracellular protein aggregation; however, they are also implicated in a number of protein deposition diseases. In this study, we employed novel mass spectrometry techniques to investigate the changes in quaternary structure associated with this switch from chaperone to adjuvant of aggregation. We replicated the oligomeric rearrangements observed for post-translationally modified alpha-crystallins, without altering the protein sequence, by refolding the alpha-crystallins in vitro. This refolding resulted in a loss of dimeric substructure concomitant with an augmentation of substrate affinity. We show that packaging of small heat shock proteins into dimeric units is used to control the level of chaperone function by regulating the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. We propose that a bias toward monomeric substructure is responsible for the aberrant chaperone behavior associated with the alpha-crystallins in protein deposition diseases."

Here we provide evidence of an important role for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in repulsive EphB2 signaling. We found that EphB2 is cleaved by MMPs both in vitro and in vivo, and that this cleavage is induced by interaction with its ligand ephrin-B2. Our findings demonstrate that MMP-2/MMP-9-specific inhibition or cleavage-resistant mutations in the ectodomain of EphB2 can prevent EphB2-mediated cell-cell repulsion in HEK293 cells, and block ephrin-B1-induced growth cone withdrawal in cultured hippocampal neurons. Transient expression of wtEphB2, but not noncleavable EphB2-4/5 mutant, restored ephrin-B1-induced growth cone collapse and withdrawal in EphB-deficient neurons. The inhibition of EphB2 cleavage also had potent regulatory effects on EphB2 activity. This study provides the first evidence that MMP-mediated cleavage of EphB2 is induced by receptor-ligand interactions at the cell surface and that this event triggers cell-repulsive responses."

In addition to elevating plasma Hcy, mutations in cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) or methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene lead to markedly elevated levels of circulating Hcy-thiolactone. The thiooester chemistry of Hcy-thiolactone underlies its ability to form isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues (N-Hcy-protein), which may impair or alter the protein's function. However, it was not known whether genetic deficiencies in Hcy metabolism affect N-Hcy-protein levels in humans. Here we show that plasma N-Hcy-protein levels are significantly elevated in CBS- and MTHFR-deficient patients. We also show that CBS-deficient patients have significantly elevated plasma levels of prothrombotic N-Hcy-fibrinogen. These results provide a possible explanation for increased atherothrombosis observed in CBS-deficient patients."

A. 1994; 91: 2512-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Canoll P.D. Petanceska S. Schlessinger J. Musacchio J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 44: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), full-length Ptprz-A has been scarcely observed at the protein level in the adult brain (3Nishiwaki T. Maeda N. Noda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 4Shintani T. Watanabe E. Maeda N. Noda M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, several lower molecular species have been detected with a specific antibody against Ptprz in wild-type mice (4Shintani T. Watanabe E. Maeda N. Noda M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The technical difficulty in removal of the chondroitin sulfate chains to separate their core proteins by SDS-PAGE may induce variability in the signal patterns of this molecule in Western blotting among researchers.In this study we examined the molecular profile of Ptprz in the adult mouse brain at both protein and mRNA levels in detail and revealed that the proteolytic fragments are abundantly accumulated. The two receptor isoforms were found to undergo ectodomain cleavage by metalloproteinases, releasing their extracellular fragments. The membrane-tethered fragment of Ptprz was further cleaved by presenilin/γ-secretase to release the intracellular fragment, which was consequently detected in the cytoplasm and nucleus. These findings suggest a novel signaling mechanism of Ptprz by the regulated proteolytic processing in the central nervous system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPharmacological Reagents—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma. GM6001, compound E, lactacystin, and recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-converting enzyme (TACE) were from Calbiochem.Animal Experiments—Adult wild-type C57BL/6 mice and Ptprz-deficient mice (4Shintani T. Watanabe E. Maeda N. Noda M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) backcrossed with the inbred C57BL/6 strain for more than 10 generations were used. Mice were administered GM6001, suspended in saline containing 1.5% carboxyl methyl cellulose, intraperitoneally (100 mg per kg body weight). For intraventricular infusion of GM6001, anesthetized mice were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus, and brain infusion cannulas (brain infusion kit 3, Alza Corp.) were inserted in the cerebral ventricle. The cannula was secured to the skull with an anchoring screw and dental cement. The stereotaxic coordinates were 0.5 mm posterior and 1.0 mm lateral to the bregma and 2.4 mm below the skull surface. An osmotic mini-pump (model 1007D, flow rate = 0.5 μl/h, Alza Corp.) filled with 2.5 mm GM6001 in 50% DMSO was implanted between the scapulae and connected to the infusion cannulas. The brains were separated as described (14Glowinski J. Iversen L.L. J. Neurochem. 1966; 13: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of Animal Care with approval by the Committee for Animal Research, National Institutes of Natural Sciences.Expression Constructs for Ptprz Isoforms—Full-length rat Ptprz-A and Ptprz-S (10Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Shintani T. Nishiwaki T. Noda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the expression vector pZeoSV2 (Invitrogen) to yield pZeo-PTPζ-A and pZeo-PTPζ-S, respectively. The expression plasmid for rat Ptprz-B (pZeo-PTPζ) was described previously (15Kawachi H. Fujikawa A. Maeda N. Noda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6593-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This construct was used as a template to generate pZeo-PTPζ-G1631I (a mutant in which glycine at 1631 is substituted with isoleucine) by using a QuikChange multi-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The expression plasmid (pZeoSV-PtprzICR) for the entire intracellular region of rat Ptprz-A/-B (amino acid residues 1665–2316; GenBank™ accession number U09357) was prepared by PCR from pZeo-PTPζ with an initiative methionine encoding primer and cloning the fragment into the NotI site of pZeoSV2.Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HEK293T cells (human embryonic kidney epithelial cells) were grown and maintained on dishes coated with rat tail collagen in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HEK293 cell lines stably expressing either human wild-type presenilin 1 (PS1 WT) or a dominant-negative PS1 variant (substitution of Asp at 385 for Ala, PS1 D385A) (16Kasuga K. Kaneko H. Nishizawa M.

These cells were transfected with Ptprz expression plasmids by calcium-phosphate precipitation as described (17Fujikawa A. Chow J.P.H. Shimizu H. Fukada M. Suzuki R. Noda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2007; 142: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).CHO-M2 (TACE-deficient CHO cell line), CHO-(M2+TACE) (CHO-M2 cells rescued by expression of TACE), and parental CHO-WT cells (18Borroto A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25933-25939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Joaquín Arribas (University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain). CHO-M2 and CHO-WT cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml of G418. CHO-(M2+TACE) cells were maintained with G418 and hygromycin (500 μg/ml of each). These CHO cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen; 1 μg of plasmid per 3.5-cm dish). Transfected cells were replated once on 3.5-cm dishes, cultured for 24 h, and then used for the experiments.Protein Extraction and Chondroitinase ABC (chABC) Treatment—Mouse tissues quickly separated on ice were homogenized with more than 10 volumes of a lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Supernatants were then collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Cultured cells were extracted with the same lysis buffer (300 μl per 3.5-cm dish) as above. The samples were stored at -85 °C before use.For chABC digestion, the protein concentration of each sample was adjusted with the lysis buffer (<4 mg/ml). Aliquots (10 μl) were then incubated with an equal volume of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, 4 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.5, with or without chABC (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan; the enzyme was added at 60 microunits/μg of protein) for 1 h at 37°C. Protein concentrations were determined with a Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Western Blot Analysis—Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (containing 4% mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and then separated on a 5–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (E-R520L, Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) for 1 h using a conventional semidry electrotransfer (1.3 mA per cm2). The membrane was incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution (4% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated overnight with anti-Ptprz-S rabbit serum (1:10,000) (3Nishiwaki T. Maeda N. Noda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in the blocking solution supplemented with 0.04% SDS to prevent nonspecific binding. Mouse monoclonal anti-RPTPβ (the epitope region is amino acid residues 2098–2307 of human Ptprz-A, 250 ng/ml, BD Biosciences) was incubated with the blots in the blocking solution. The binding of these antibodies was detected with an ECL Western blotting system (GE Healthcare).Subcellular Localization Analysis—Cells were washed 3 times with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 150 mm NaCl, fixed with 10% neutral formalin, and then blocked with the blocking buffer as above and followed by overnight incubation with anti-RPTPβ (1 μg/ml) in the blocking buffer. Bound antibodies were visualized with Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For the nucleus labeling, the cells were incubated with TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes) and then analyzed with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal scanning laser microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a Zeiss water-immersion objective (C-Apochromat 40×/1.20 W Korr).Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and then poly(A)+ RNA was purified using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Dynal) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blotting was performed as described (19Suzuki R. Shintani T. Sakuta H. Kato A. Ohkawara T. Osumi N. Noda M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 98: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with slight modifications in the electrophoresis. The poly(A)+ RNA was denatured in 1× MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, 2 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) containing 6.8% formaldehyde, 50% formamide, and 50 μg/ml of ethidium bromide at 67 °C for 10 min, chilled on ice for 5 min, and then 2.5 μl of a loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol) was added. Electrophoresis was performed on a formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel (6.8% formaldehyde and 1% agarose in 1× MOPS buffer) at 5 V/cm for 4 h with the circulation of an electrophoresis buffer (6.8% formaldehyde in 1× MOPS buffer).Templates of complementary DNA probes were as follows: CAH-FNIII probe (nucleotide residues 93–1215 for rat Ptprz-A; GenBank™ accession number U09357), PTP-D1 probe (nucleotide residues 5047–6081 for rat Ptprz-A), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe (nucleotide residues 22–553 for mouse GAPDH; GenBank™ accession number BC096440). Signals of bands on the blot were detected using a BAS-MS 2025 imaging plate (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) and visualized using a Typhoon 9400 scanner (GE Healthcare).In Vitro Digestion Analyses—Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems ABI 433A peptide synthesizer by using the standard fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl protocol and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a C-18 reverse phase column. These peptides (2 pmol each) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 h in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2.5 μm ZnCl2, and 0.005% Brij-35 with or without recombinant TACE (250 ng) in a final volume of 10 μl. After purification using pipette tips packed with a C18 resin (ZipTip, Millipore), the samples were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Reflex III, Bruker Daltonics) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Sigma).RESULTSExpression Profile of Ptprz in the Adult Mouse Brain—It is well known that three splicing variants of Ptprz are expressed in the brain from a single gene (see Fig. 1A). All three isoforms expressed in the brain are highly glycosylated with chondroitin sulfate (3Nishiwaki T. Maeda N. Noda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, the removal of the chondroitin sulfate chains beforehand is necessary to resolve their core proteins by SDS-PAGE (20Maeda N. Hamanaka H. Oohira A. Noda M. Neuroscience. 1995; 67: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).When the chABC-treated extract of the wild-type mouse brain (+/+) was analyzed with anti-Ptprz-S, which recognizes the extracellular region of all three isoforms (see Fig. 1A), six bands (bands b–g) in the range from 300 to 70 kDa were clearly detected (Fig. 1B). Because these bands are not present in Ptprz-deficient mice (-/-), all these molecular species are considered to be derived from Ptprz gene products. Among them, the 300-kDa (band b) and 250-kDa (band c) species represent the core proteins of Ptprz-S and Ptprz-B, respectively (3Nishiwaki T. Maeda N. Noda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); however, the other four species (bands d–g) have not been characterized; of note is that the band of Ptprz-A at 380 kDa is scarcely detected (the band a with an asterisk in Fig. 1E; see also Ref. 4Shintani T. Watanabe E. Maeda N. Noda M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 247: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The signal intensity of the three lower molecular species (bands e–g) was not changed by chABC treatment (Fig. 1B), indicating that they are not modified with chondroitin sulfate. In contrast, the larger bands b–d were almost missing without chABC-treatment because they could not enter the gel.To identify the receptor isoforms and their derivatives, the same blot was reprobed with anti-RPTPβ, which recognizes the intracellular region (see Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1C, the 250-kDa species (band c, Ptprz-B) was detected by anti-RPTPβ as expected along with additional bands at around 75 kDa. The enlarged view of the 75-kDa band (lower panel), demonstrated that the signal consists of two adjacent bands of 77 kDa (band h) and 73 kDa (band i). On the other hand, anti-RPTPβ did not recognize the other species (bands b, d, e–g) detected by anti-Ptprz-S.Although the uncharacterized species of Ptprz (bands d–i) appears to be processing products of the mature three isoforms of Ptprz, we addressed the possibility with the best of care that unknown novel Ptprz transcripts might be detected by Northern blotting. Probe 1 for the CAH-FNIII region, which should detect all Ptprz transcripts, demonstrated that the three transcripts of 8.5 kb (Ptprz-A), 7.5 kb (Ptprz-S), and 5.8 kb (Ptprz-B) are expressed only in the wild-type, not in the knock-out mice (Fig. 2). Probe 2 for the PTP-D1 region, which detects the transcripts for the receptor isoforms, showed the 8.5-kb (Ptprz-A) and 5.8-kb (Ptprz-B) transcripts as expected. Although full-length Ptprz-A protein (380 kDa) was hardly detected in the adult brain lysate, its mRNA was, thus, expressed in a significant amount. Importantly, other transcripts corresponding to the smaller Ptprz proteins such as the 180- or 75-kDa species were not detected.FIGURE 2Northern blot analyses of Ptprz transcripts in the adult mouse brain. Poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) from the adult mouse brain was hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for the CAH-FNIII region (probe 1). The same blot was stripped and then reprobed for the PTP-D1 region (probe 2). The amount of RNA loaded was confirmed with a probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the same blot. The figures are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ectodomain Shedding of Ptprz by Metalloproteinases—In our studies to exogenously express Ptprz-B in mammalian cells, we noticed that an immunoreactive species of 180 kDa is secreted into the culture medium. Because this size corresponded to that of the whole extracellular region of Ptprz-B (band d observed in the brain in Fig. 1B), we assumed that this is generated by the ectodomain shedding, a specialized type of limited proteolysis releasing the extracellular domain of a variety of cell surface receptors (21Arribas J. Borroto A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4627-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Anders L. Mertins P. Lammich S. Murgia M. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Haass C. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3917-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); it occurs in the vicinity of the cell surface, generally dependent upon the actions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or adamalysins (ADAMs, a disintegrin and metalloproteinases).We tested this possibility by using a protein kinase C activator, PMA, which is known to trigger ectodomain shedding in various cells. The treatment of HEK293T cells expressing Ptprz-B with PMA resulted in an increase in the 180-kDa species in the conditioned medium, which was inversely correlated with the decrease in Ptprz-B in cell extracts (Fig. 3A). This event occurred dependent on the concentration of PMA (Fig. 3B), strongly suggesting that the band of 180 kDa represents the ectodomain (ZB-ECF) of Ptprz-B. Intriguingly, in the presence of a broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM6001, the generation of the 180-kDa species was clearly inhibited under both unstimulated and stimulated conditions with PMA (Fig. 3A, right panel).FIGURE 3Metalloproteinase-mediated ectodomain cleavage of the receptor isoforms of Ptprz. A, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the expression construct of Ptprz-B or control vector (Moc). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed and incubated with or without PMA in fresh serum-free medium for 1 h. GM6001 was added 20 min before the stimulation by PMA or vehicle. The cell extracts (left panels) were analyzed by Western blotting (WB) using anti-Ptprz-S. The same membrane was then reprobed with anti-RPTPβ. Conditioned media (right panel) were analyzed with anti-Ptprz-S. B, cells were incubated with the indicated amount of PMA in fresh serum-free medium for 1 h and analyzed by Western blotting as above. C, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the Ptprz-A or Ptprz-S expression construct and treated as described in A. Before SDS-PAGE, the samples were treated with chABC. The figures are representative of three separate experiments, and the results of the densitometric analyses are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The designations of the detected bands are shown in Fig. 1, A and E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar results were observed with the Ptprz-A isoform. Unlike Ptprz-B, when Ptprz-A was expressed in HEK293T cells, the mature receptor protein was highly modified with chondroitin sulfate (data not shown). Therefore, the samples were treated with chABC before SDS-PAGE. As with Ptprz-B, the release of the entire extracellular fragment of Ptprz-A, ZA-ECF (300 kDa), into the culture medium was clearly enhanced by PMA and suppressed in the presence of GM6001 (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, when the secretory isoform (Ptprz-S) was expressed, the full-length Ptprz-S was detected exclusively in the medium, and the amount was not affected by the treatment of cells either with PMA or with GM6001 (Fig. 3C). It is recognizable here that ZA-ECF is indistinguishable from Ptprz-S in size and antigenicity.TACE-mediated Shedding of Ptprz in Cultured Cells—Because GM6001 is a broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor, additional experiments were required to define the specific proteinase(s) involved in the ectodomain shedding of Ptprz-A/-B. TACE (also known as ADAM-17) is a GM6001-sensitive, membrane-anchored, zinc-dependent metalloproteinase. TACE functions as a membrane sheddase to release the ectodomain portions of many transmembrane proteins including TNF-α and Notch (23Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). To determine whether TACE is involved in the ectodomain cleavage of Ptprz, we took advantage of CHO-M2 cells which are defective in TACE-mediated shedding (18Borroto A. Ruíz-Paz S. de la Torre T.V. Borrell-Pagès M. Merlos-Suárez A. Pandiella A. Blobel C.P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25933-25939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Parental wild-type CHO cells (CHO-WT) and CHO-M2 cells which stably express a functional TACE, CHO-(M2+TACE), were also used for comparison.Transfection of the expression construct of Ptprz-B yielded similar expression levels of Ptprz-B in these cells (Fig. 4, left panels), and similar amounts of ZB-ECF were accumulated in the conditioned media during 1 h of incubation (Fig. 4, right panels); this basal level of accumulation of ZB-ECF was also observed in CHO-M2 and similarly suppressed by GM6001, indicating that the basal amount of ectodomain shedding of Ptprz-B is independent of TACE. PMA-stimulated ectodomain cleavage was reproduced in CHO-WT and CHO-(M2+TACE) cells and was inhibited by GM6001. However, the PMA-stimulated shedding was not observed in CHO-M2 cells. Similar results were observed with Ptprz-A (data not shown). TACE is, thus, highly responsible for the PMA-inducible cleavage of Ptprz for the generation of ZB-ECF and ZA-ECF but not for the constitutive cleavage in these cell lines.FIGURE 4Involvement of TACE in PMA-stimulated ectodomain cleavage of Ptprz. CHO-WT (wild-type), CHO-M2 (TACE defective), and CHO-(M2+TACE) (M2 cells expressing functional TACE) cells were transiently transfected with the Ptprz-B expression construct. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were washed and incubated in fresh serum-free medium with or without PMA for 1 h. GM6001 was added 20 min before PMA or vehicle. The cell extracts (left panels) and conditioned media (right panels) were analyzed by Western blotting (WB) with anti-Ptprz-S. The arrows with asterisks indicate immature forms of Ptprz-B accumulated in cells. The designations are shown in Fig. 1, A and E. The figures are representative of three separate experiments, and the results of the densitometric analyses are shown in supplemental Fig. S2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the Ptprz-A and Ptprz-B isoforms have a common short sequence in the extracellular membrane-proximal region, the cleavage site was expected within this region. When a synthetic peptide corresponding to the juxtamembrane sequence was incubated with recombinant TACE in vitro, TACE indeed induced the cleavage of the substrate peptide into the two fragments. The molecular mass of them indicated that the enzymatic cleavage occurs between Gly at 1631 (P1 site) and Leu at 1632 (P1′ site) (see Fig. 5A). Previous studies with peptide substrates of TNF-α indicated that TACE has a strong preference for cleavage at Ala-Val sequences and cannot cleave a TNF-α-based peptide with the substitution of Ala with Ile at the P1 position (24Jin G. Huang X. Black R. Wolfson M. Rauch C. McGregor H. Ellestad G. Cowling R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Consistently, a mutant peptide, Zejm(G/I), in which Gly at P1 is replaced with Ile, was hardly cleaved by TACE (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the cleavage was highly enhanced by substitution with Ala at P1, Zejm (G/A), the same as TNF-α (Fig. 5D).FIGURE 5Identification of the TACE-cleavage site in Ptprz.

https://openalex.org/W1976037677,"GPIHBP1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored endothelial cell protein of the lymphocyte antigen 6 (Ly6) family, plays a key role in the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (e.g. chylomicrons). GPIHBP1 is expressed along the luminal surface of endothelial cells of heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, and GPIHBP1-expressing cells bind lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and chylomicrons avidly. GPIHBP1 contains an amino-terminal acidic domain (amino acids 24-48) that is enriched in aspartate and glutamate residues, and we previously speculated that this domain might be important in binding ligands. To explore the functional importance of the acidic domain, we tested the ability of polyaspartate or polyglutamate peptides to block the binding of ligands to pgsA-745 Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpress GPIHBP1. Both polyaspartate and polyglutamate blocked LPL and chylomicron binding to GPIHBP1. Also, a rabbit antiserum against the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 blocked LPL and chylomicron binding to GPIHBP1-expressing cells. Replacing the acidic amino acids within GPIHBP1 residues 38-48 with alanine eliminated the ability of GPIHBP1 to bind LPL and chylomicrons. Finally, mutation of the positively charged heparin-binding domains within LPL and apolipoprotein AV abolished the ability of these proteins to bind to GPIHBP1. These studies indicate that the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 is important and that electrostatic interactions play a key role in ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2039552793,"The presence of lipid domains in cellular membranes and their characteristic features are still an issue of dividing discussion. Several recent studies implicate lipid domains in plasma membranes of mammalian cells as short lived and in the submicron range. Measuring the fluorescence lifetime of appropriate lipid analogues is a proper approach to detect domains with such properties. Here, the sensitivity of the fluorescence lifetime of1-palmitoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-hexanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phospholipid (C6-NBD-phospholipid) analogues has been employed to characterize lipid domains in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and the plasma membrane of mammalian cells by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Fluorescence decay of C6-NBD-phosphatidylcholine is characterized by a short and long lifetime. For GUVs forming microscopically visible lipid domains the longer lifetime in the liquid disordered (ld) and the liquid ordered (lo) phase was clearly distinct, being approximately 7 ns and 11 ns, respectively. Lifetimes were not sensitive to variation of cholesterol concentration of domain-forming GUVs indicating that the lipid composition and physical properties of those lipid domains are well defined entities. Even the existence of submicroscopic domains can be detected by FLIM as demonstrated for GUVs of palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine/N-palmitoyl-d-sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixtures. A broad distribution of the long lifetime was found for C6-NBD-phosphatidylcholine inserted in the plasma membrane of HepG2 and HeLa cells centered around 11 ns. FLIM studies on lipid domains forming giant vesicles derived from the plasma membrane of HeLa cells may suggest that a variety of submicroscopic lipid domains exists in the plasma membrane of intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020518757,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) is an ATP-dependent drug pump. Each of its two homologous halves contains a transmembrane domain (TMD) that has six transmembrane (TM) segments and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Determining how the two halves interact may provide insight into the folding of P-gp as the drug-binding pocket and nucleotide-binding sites are predicted to be at the interface between the two halves. Here, we present evidence for NBD1-TMD2 and NBD2-TMD1 interactions. We also show that TMD-NBD interactions in immature and mature P-gp can be affected by the presence of a processing mutation. We found that the NBD-TMD mutants L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) and A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) could be cross-linked at 0 °C with oxidant (copper phenanthroline). Cross-linking was inhibited by vanadate-trapping of nucleotide. The presence of a processing mutation (G268V/L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2); L1260A/A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2)) resulted in the synthesis of the immature (150 kDa) protein as the major product and the mutants could not be cross-linked with copper phenanthroline. Expression of the processing mutants in the presence of a pharmacological chaperone (cyclosporin A), however, resulted in the expression of mature (170 kDa) protein at the cell surface that could be cross-linked. Similarly, CFTR mutants A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2) and V510C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) could be cross-linked at 0 °C with copper phenanthroline. Introduction of ΔF508 mutation in these mutants, however, resulted in the synthesis of immature CFTR that could not be cross-linked. These results suggest that establishment of NBD interactions with the opposite TMD is a key step in folding of ABC transporters. P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) is an ATP-dependent drug pump. Each of its two homologous halves contains a transmembrane domain (TMD) that has six transmembrane (TM) segments and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Determining how the two halves interact may provide insight into the folding of P-gp as the drug-binding pocket and nucleotide-binding sites are predicted to be at the interface between the two halves. Here, we present evidence for NBD1-TMD2 and NBD2-TMD1 interactions. We also show that TMD-NBD interactions in immature and mature P-gp can be affected by the presence of a processing mutation. We found that the NBD-TMD mutants L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) and A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) could be cross-linked at 0 °C with oxidant (copper phenanthroline). Cross-linking was inhibited by vanadate-trapping of nucleotide. The presence of a processing mutation (G268V/L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2); L1260A/A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2)) resulted in the synthesis of the immature (150 kDa) protein as the major product and the mutants could not be cross-linked with copper phenanthroline. Expression of the processing mutants in the presence of a pharmacological chaperone (cyclosporin A), however, resulted in the expression of mature (170 kDa) protein at the cell surface that could be cross-linked. Similarly, CFTR mutants A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2) and V510C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) could be cross-linked at 0 °C with copper phenanthroline. Introduction of ΔF508 mutation in these mutants, however, resulted in the synthesis of immature CFTR that could not be cross-linked. These results suggest that establishment of NBD interactions with the opposite TMD is a key step in folding of ABC transporters. The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp, 2The abbreviations used are: P-gp, P-glycoprotein; TM, transmembrane; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TMD1, NH2-terminal transmembrane domain containing TM segments 1–6; TMD2, COOH-terminal transmembrane domain containing TM segments 7–12; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; corr-4a, (N-[2-(5-chloro-2-methoxy-phenylamino)-2′-yl]-benzamide. ABCB1) is a 170-kDa plasma membrane protein that functions as an energy-dependent drug pump to transport hydrophobic molecules out of the cell (1Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). It likely protects us from cytotoxic compounds in our diets and environment (2Schinkel A.H. Smit J.J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J.H. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L.

The protein can block entry of cytotoxic agents from the diet because it is expressed at relatively high levels in the apical membranes of epithelial cells that line the intestine (3Thiebaut F. Tsuruo T. Hamada H. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Willingham M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7735-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). P-gp is clinically important because many drugs used in cancer and AIDS/HIV chemotherapies are substrates of P-gp (4Lee C.G. Gottesman M.M. Cardarelli C.O. Ramachandra M. Jeang K.T. Ambudkar S.V. Pastan I. Dey S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3594-3601Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The P-gp 1280 amino acids are organized as two homologous halves (43% amino acid identity) that are joined by a linker region (5Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Each half begins with a transmembrane domain (TMD) containing six transmembrane (TM) segments (6Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) followed by a hydrophilic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Interactions between the two halves of P-gp are critical for function because the ATP- and drug-binding sites are located at their interface. The two ATP molecules bind at the interface between the Walker A sites and LSGGQ sequences between the NBDs (7Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis likely occurs by an alternating mechanism (8Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The drug-binding pocket is at the interface between the TMDs (9Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 476: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The NBDs are not required for binding of drug substrates as a P-gp deletion mutant lacking both NBDs can still bind drug substrates (10Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). P-gp can simultaneously bind multiple drug substrates (11Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12Lugo M.R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14020-14029Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Substrates appear to bind through a “substrate-induced fit” mechanism (13Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because interactions between the two halves of P-gp are critical for function, understanding how the four domains interact may provide insight into the folding of P-gp. Co-expression and immunoprecipitation studies with domains of P-gp expressed as separate polypeptides showed evidence for NBD1-TMD1 and NBD2-TMD2 interactions (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The presence of NBD1-TMD1 and NBD2-TMD2 contacts suggested that the domains of P-gp are organized in a manner that would resemble the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli ABC transporter BtuCD (15Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). A recent cysteine mutagenesis and cross-linking study of P-gp however, showed that cysteines introduced in NBD1 could be cross-linked to cysteines introduced into TMD2 when the mutants were treated with thiol-reactive cross-linkers at 25 °C (16Zolnerciks J.K. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These NBD1-TMD2 interactions were predicted by the crystal structure of the bacterial ABC transporter Sav1866 (17Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Possible explanations for the different NBD-TMD contacts identified in the P-gp studies were that the use of cross-linkers and thermal motion of the protein allowed cross-linking to occur between distant cysteines or that both studies involved different structures of P-gp. The cross-linking study was performed on mature P-gp delivered to the cell surface (16Zolnerciks J.K. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas the co-immunoprecipitation study on domains of P-gp expressed as separate polypeptides utilized immature forms of the protein (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mature and immature forms of P-gp show differences in structure (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Faseb J. 1999; 13: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study we performed cross-linking studies on immature and mature forms of P-gp to test if they showed differences in NBD-TMD interactions. We also tested whether the immature and mature forms of the P-gp sister protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel, showed differences in NBD-TMD interactions. Knowledge about folding of CFTR is important because processing mutations in CFTR such as deletion of Phe-508 are the major cause of cystic fibrosis (19Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5946) Google Scholar). Construction of Mutants—The seven endogenous cysteines at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227 were replaced with alanines to create cysteine-less (Cys-less) P-gp (6Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). None of the cysteines were important for function (6Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Single cysteine residues were re-introduced at positions Leu-443(NBD1), Ser-474(NBD1), Arg-905(TMD2), or Ser-909(TMD2) in Cys-less P-gp. Double cysteine mutants L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) and S474C(NBD1)/R905C(TMD2) were also constructed as these cysteines were previously shown to cross-link when treated with maleimide-type cross-linkers (16Zolnerciks J.K. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The G268V and L1260A processing mutations were introduced into the L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) mutant. To test for cross-linking between TMD1 and NBD2 of P-gp, the mutants A266C(TMD1)/R1085C(NBD2), A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2), A266C(TMD1)/Y1087C(NBD2), A266C(TMD1)/D1088C(NBD2), F267C(TMD1)/R1085C(NBD2), F267C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2), F267C(TMD1)/Y1087C(NBD2), and F267C(TMD1)/D1088C(NBD2) were constructed because they lie close to the positions equivalent to Leu-443(NBD1) and Ser-909(TMD2), respectively, in each half of P-gp. All of the mutants contained a 10-histidine tag at the COOH-end to facilitate purification of the mutant P-gp by nickel-chelate chromatography (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or an A52-epitope tag (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14049-14057Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to distinguish the expressed proteins from any endogenous P-gp in Western blots of extracts from transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Because P-gp mutants L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) and A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) showed cross-linking in the presence of copper phenanthroline, we constructed CFTR mutants with cysteines at equivalent positions in a Cys-less version of CFTR (22Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33247-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to yield mutants E474C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) and A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2), respectively. We also constructed the V510C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) CFTR mutant because position V510C or V510A promoted maturation of Cys-less CFTR (22Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33247-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Expression of Mutants, Purification, and Measurement of ATPase Activity—The mutant P-gps or CFTRs were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells as described previously (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells expressing mutant P-gps were also grown in the presence or absence of 10 μm cyclosporin A for 24 h because it acts as a pharmacological/specific chemical chaperone to increase the yield of mature enzyme (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts of A52-tagged P-gps were subjected to immunoblot analysis using 6% (w/v) acrylamide gels and monoclonal antibody A52. Mutants of CFTR were expressed in the presence or absence of 20 μm corr-4a ((N-[2-(5-chloro-2-methoxy-phenylamino)-2′-yl]-benzamide) as this compound promotes maturation of CFTR (24Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 25Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged P-gp was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography as described previously (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A sample of the isolated histidine-tagged P-gp was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S, Sigma) that had been washed and suspended in TBS (Tris-buffered saline: 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH. 7.4 and 150 mm NaCl). The sample was sonicated and ATPase activity measured in the absence of drug substrate or in the presence of 0.5 mm verapamil. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate released was determined. Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis—The P-gp or CFTR double cysteine mutants were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. The membranes were prepared as described previously (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended in TBS. Membrane samples were then treated with oxidant (1 mm (Cu2+-(1,10-phenanthroline)3). The reactions were stopped by addition 5 mm EDTA followed by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 4% (w/v) SDS) containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or CFTR (27Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 413: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Intramolecular disulfide cross-linking between domains of P-gp or CFTR can be detected because the cross-linked product migrates with a slower mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (27Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 413: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). P-gp consists of two NBDs and two TMDs containing 6 TM segments each (Fig. 1A). A previous study of the domains expressed as separate polypeptides showed that TMD1 co-immunoprecipitated with NBD1 whereas TMD2 co-immunoprecipitated with NBD2 (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These results predicted that TMD1-NBD1 and TMD2-NBD2 interactions were important for P-gp folding (Fig. 1A). The recent crystal structure of Sav1866 showed potential interactions between NBD and the opposite TMD of the dimer (17Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). A subsequent cross-linking study with P-gp showed that cysteines introduced at positions 443 and 474 in NBD1 could be cross-linked to cysteines at positions 909 and 905, respectively, in TMD2 using maleimide-type cross-linkers with lengths of 6–16 Å (16Zolnerciks J.K. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results suggested that TMD1-NBD2 interactions could also be important in P-gp (Fig. 1B). A potential problem with the cross-linking study, however, was that the use of cross-linkers at elevated temperatures and long incubation times (15 min at 26 °C) might have allowed distant cysteines to be cross-linked due to thermal motion of the protein. Therefore, to determine if the L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) and S474C(NBD1)/R905C(TMD2) pairs of cysteines that were previously shown to cross-link when treated with maleimide-type cross-linkers at 26 °C were indeed close together in the native structure, we tested if they could be directly cross-linked through formation of a disulfide bond at low temperature. Accordingly, membranes prepared from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with P-gp mutants L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) or S474C(NBD1)/R905C(TMD2) were treated with oxidant (Cu2+-(1,10-phenanthroline)3) at 0 or 25 °C. Copper phenanthroline catalyzes the formation of a disulfide bond between adjacent cysteines (29Kobashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA and samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cross-linking between domains of P-gp can be detected on SDS-PAGE gels because the cross-linked product migrates with a lower mobility than the native protein (30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cross-linked product was not detected in mutant S474C(NBD1)/R905C(TMD2) (Fig. 2). Mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) however, yielded cross-linked product after treatment with oxidant at both 0 or 25 °C (Fig. 2). Treatment of mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) with oxidant at 0 °C caused more than half of the P-gp protein to be cross-linked and cross-linking was nearly complete when the reaction was performed at 25 °C. No cross-linked product was observed when mutants containing only L443C(NBD1) or S909C(TMD2) were treated with oxidant (data not shown). These results show that cysteines at positions 443(NBD1) and 909(TMD2) lie close enough in the native structure to be directly linked by a disulfide bond when treated at 0 °C when thermal motion of the protein is low. Cysteines at positions 474(NBD1) and 905(TMD2) may lie further apart as they showed no disulfide bond formation even when treated with oxidant at 25 °C.FIGURE 2Cross-linking analysis of P-gp NBD1/TMD2 cysteine mutants. Mutants S474C(NBD1)/R905C(TMD2) and L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) were expressed in HEK 293 cells in the absence of drug substrates. Membranes were prepared, and samples were treated with (+) or without (–) 1 mm copper phenanthroline (CuP) at 0 or 25 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent. Samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The positions of mature (170 kDa) and cross-linked (X-link) forms of P-gp are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test if cross-linking between Cys-443(NBD1) and Cys-909(TMD2) affected the activity of P-gp, we assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity is a useful assay because it has been shown that the turnover numbers for transport and drug-stimulated ATPase activity are comparable (31Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, there is good correlation between drug-resistance and ATPase assays (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 480-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) mutant was previously demonstrated to be functional as its drug transport activity was similar to the Cys-less parent (16Zolnerciks J.K. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Faseb J. 2007; 21: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Accordingly, histidine-tagged Cys-less and Cys-443(NBD1)/Cys-909(TMD2) mutants of P-gp were expressed in HEK 293 cells followed by isolation by nickel-chelate chromatography. The P-gps were mixed with lipid and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. Verapamil was used because it is one of the most potent activators of P-gp ATPase activity (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the presence of saturating levels of verapamil (0.5 mm) it was found that mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) showed ATPase activity that was similar to the Cys-less parent. To test for the effect of cross-linking on activity, isolated mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) and Cys-less P-gps were treated with or without 1 mm copper phenanthroline for 15 min at 20 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA to 5 mm. The proteins were then assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. Fig. 3 shows that cross-linking of mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) caused more than 85% decrease in activity while treatment of Cys-less P-gp with copper phenanthroline had little effect. The activity of cross-linked mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) could be restored after treatment with the thiol-reducing agent dithiothreitol (Fig. 3). These results suggest that conformational changes at the NBD1-TMD2 interface may be critical for activity. We then tested whether cross-linking of mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) was sensitive to conformational changes induced by drug substrates. For example, it was previously shown that drug substrates such as vinblastine, cyclosporin A, and rhodamine B or vanadate trapping of nucleotide could block cross-linking of mutant L339C(TMD1)/F728C(TMD2) (34Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32043-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we first tested if vinblastine, cyclosporin A, or rhodamine B would affect cross-linking of mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2). Membranes prepared from cells expressing mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) were preincubated with on drug or with saturating concentrations of vinblastine (0.1 mm), cyclosporin A (0.01 mm), rhodamine B (1 mm), or verapamil (1 mm) for 15 min at 20 °C. The samples were then cooled on ice, treated with copper phenanthroline, and then subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 4A shows that the drug substrates did not inhibit cross-linking of mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2). The results suggest that residues Cys-443(NBD1) and Cys-909(TMD2) lie outside the drug-binding sites and that binding of drug substrates do not cause any major conformational changes at this part of the NBD1/TMD2 interface. We then tested whether vanadate-trapping of nucleotide affected cross-linking of mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2). P-gp can be trapped at a transition state during ATP hydrolysis by including vanadate in the reaction mix (35Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Vanadate traps ADP at either NBD by mimicking the transition state of the γ-phosphate of ATP during hydrolysis and trapping at one NBD inhibits ATP hydrolysis at the second site (35Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Vanadate-trapping of nucleotide causes conformational changes in P-gp and this can be detected by disulfide cross-linking analysis (36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) Accordingly, membranes prepared from cells expressing mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) were preincubated with or without ATP plus vanadate for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were then cooled on ice, treated with copper phenanthroline and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 4B shows that vanadate trapping of nucleotide blocked cross-linking. These results suggest that ATP-dependent conformational changes at the NBD1-TMD2 interface may be critical for function. The observation that cysteines at positions 443(NBD1) and 909(TMD2) can form a disulfide bond when exposed to oxidant at low temperature suggests that mature P-gp has a structure that resembles Sav1866 (17Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). When domains of P-gp are expressed as separate polypeptides however, co-immunoprecipitation assays detected little evidence for interactions between the NBD1 and TMD2 quarter-molecules (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Instead, NBD1-TMD1 and NBD2-TMD2 interactions were detected. A potential problem in expressing half-molecule or quarter-molecule forms of P-gp, however, is that the proteins do not mature (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the absence of one or more domains, P-gp truncation mutants appear to be incompletely folded because they are only core-glycosylated and more sensitive to protease digestion (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mature protein contains complex carbohydrate and is relatively resistant to protease digestion. Therefore, establishment of NBD1-TMD2 interactions may not take place unless the protein undergoes maturation to fold into a native structure. To test if NBD1-TMD2 interactions differ in the mature and immature forms of P-gp, the G268V (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or L1260A (38Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2522-2528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) processing mutations were introduced into mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) to inhibit its maturation. Processing mutations are amino acid changes that appear to trap P-gp as an incompletely folded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in Ref. 39Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2005; 206: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In addition, processing mutations G268V(TMD1) and L1260A(NBD2) were selected because they are located outside the NBD1 and TMD2 domains to be cross-linked (see Fig. 1B) and appear to trap the protein in an incompletely folded conformation rather than cause gross misfolding as expression of either processing mutation in the presence of a drug substrate promotes maturation and delivery of active P-gp to the cell surface (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Faseb J. 1999; 13: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 38Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2522-2528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The G268V mutation is located in the second intracellular loop in TMD1 whereas the L1260A mutation is located at the COOH-end of NBD2. Mutant G268V(TMD1)/L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence or absence of the drug substrate cyclosporin A. Membranes were prepared, and samples were treated on ice with or without copper phenanthroline followed by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 5A (left panel) shows that in the absence of cyclosporin A, the major product was the immature 150-kDa form of P-gp and could not be cross-linked. Expression of mutant G268V(TMD1)/L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) in the presence of cyclosporin A, however, resulted in the synthesis of mature 170-kDa form of P-gp as the major product (Fig. 5A, right panel). Cross-linked product could be detected when the mature protein was treated with copper phenanthroline (Fig. 5A, right panel). Similar results were observed with mutant L1260A(TMD1)/L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) (Fig. 5B). Immature 150 kDa P-gp was the major product produced in cells incubated in the absence of cyclosporin A, whereas, the 170-kDa mature form of P-gp was the major product produced in cells expressed in the presence of cyclosporin A. Cross-linking was observed with the mature protein but not with the immature form of P-gp. Therefore, it appears that the NBD1-TMD2 interface of immature P-gp has a different structure compared with the mature protein. Cysteines at positions 443(NBD1) and 909(TMD2) are only close enough to be directly cross-linked in the mature form of the protein. We then tested if the mature and immature forms of P-gp showed structural differences at the TMD1-NBD2 interface. Because no cross-linking studies have identified cysteines that could be cross-linked at the TMD1-NBD2 interface, we constructed a series of double cysteine mutants between a cysteine in TMD1 (A266C or F267C) and another in NBD2 (R1085C, F1086C, Y1087C or D1088C) that would be equivalent to L443C(NBD1) and S909C(TMD2), respectively, in each half of P-gp. Membranes were prepared from cells expressing these double cysteine mutants and samples were treated with or without 1 mm copper phenanthroline at 0 °C followed by immunoblot analysis. Cross-linked product was observed only in mutant A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) (Fig. 6A). It was observed that the mutant yielded mature 170-kDa P-gp as the major product and about 50% of the protein was cross-linked after treatment with oxidant. Cross-linking of mutant A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) was relatively specific, as cross-linked product was not observed in mutants that contained only Cys-266(TMD1) or Cys-1086(NBD2), or in mutants A266C(TMD1)/R1085C(NBD2), A266C(TMD1)/Y1087C(NBD2), A266C(TMD1)/D1088C(NBD2), F267C(TMD1)/R1085C(NBD2), F267C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2), F267C(TMD1)/Y1087C(NBD2), F267C(TMD1)/D1088C(NBD2) (data not shown). The A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) mutant has similar properties to that of mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) in that drug substrates such as vinblastine, cyclosporin A, rhodamine B or verapamil did not protect the mutant from cross-linking but cross-linking was blocked by vanadate trapping of nucleotide (Fig. 6A). Mutant A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) however, was different from mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) in that it had very low verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity compared with the Cys-less parent (less than 10% activity). It appears that they may be some asymmetry at the NBD1-TMD2 and TMD1-NBD2 interfaces. The verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities of P-gp mutants containing only the Cys-266 or Cys-1086 mutation showed that the reduced activity was due to the presence of the F1086C change (data not shown). To test if there were structural differences between the mature and immature forms of P-gp at the TMD1-NBD2 interface, the L1260A processing mutation was introduced into mutant A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2). Mutant L1260A/A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) was expressed in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A and membranes prepared from the cells were treated with or without copper phenanthroline at 0 °C followed by immunoblot analysis. Fig. 6B shows that cross-linking was observed with mature P-gp (right panel) but not with immature P-gp (left panel). Therefore, both the NBD1-TMD2 and TMD1-NBD2 interfaces show similar structural differences in the mature and immature forms of the protein as cross-linking was observed with only mature P-gp. CFTR is a sister protein of P-gp. To test if the mature and immature forms of CFTR also show structural differences at the NBD-TMD interfaces, we first introduced cysteines at positions equivalent to those in P-gp that showed cross-linking at the NBD-TMD interfaces. CFTR mutant A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2) contains cysteines at sites equivalent to P-gp mutant A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2). Membranes prepared from cells expressing CFTR mutant A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2) were treated with or without copper phenanthroline at 0 °C and samples subjected to cross-linking analysis. Fig. 7A shows that mutant A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2) expressed the mature protein as the major product and cross-linked product was detected after treatment with oxidant. CFTR mutant E474C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) contains cysteines at positions equivalent to those in P-gp mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2). The CFTR mutant E474C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2), however, did not mature when it was expressed in plain medium (Fig. 7E, left panel). It was previously shown that mutations V510C or V510A promoted maturation of Cys-less CFTR (22Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33247-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It was possible that V510C could interact with TMD2. Accordingly, mutant V510C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) was constructed and expressed in HEK 293 cells. Membranes were then prepared, treated at 0 °C with copper phenanthroline, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 7B shows that mature protein was the major product and cross-linked product was detected after treatment with oxidant. To test if immature CFTR shows structural differences from the mature protein at the NBD-TMD interfaces, we introduced the ΔF508 processing mutation into CFTR mutants A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2) and V510C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2). The ΔF508 processing mutation was utilized because it is the most common cystic fibrosis mutation as it is found in at least one chromosome in 90% of affected individuals (40Bobadilla J.L. Macek Jr., M. Fine J.P. Farrell P.M. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 575-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Introduction of the ΔF508 mutation into mutants A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2) or V510C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) yielded immature CFTR protein that was not cross-linked when membranes expressing the mutants were treated with copper phenanthroline (Fig. 7, C and D). Unfortunately, attempts to promote maturation of mutants ΔF508/A274C(TMD1)/L1260C(NBD2) or ΔF508/V510C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) by carrying out expression in the presence of the corrector corr-4a only yielded levels of mature protein that were too low for cross-linking (data not shown). Therefore, to test if expression of a CFTR processing mutant in the presence of corrector could restore TMD-NBD interactions, we utilized the CFTR mutant E474C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) because it did not mature and the immature protein did not show cross-linking (Fig. 7E, left panel). When CFTR mutant E474C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) was expressed in the presence of corr-4a, the mature form of CFTR could be detected (Fig. 7E, right panel). Cross-linking was observed when the mature form of E474C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) was treated with copper phenanthroline (Fig. 7E, right panel). These results show that expression of mutant E474C(NBD1)/A1067C(TMD2) in the presence of corr-4a promoted folding of CFTR into a native structure to restore NBD1-TMD2 interactions. We previously proposed that processing mutations inhibit folding of P-gp by trapping the protein in a protease-sensitive, loosely folded conformation with incomplete domain-domain contacts (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In support of this model we had demonstrated that the presence of processing mutations disrupted TMD1-TMD2 (41Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and NBD1-NBD2 (42Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38395-38401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) interactions. In the present study, we report that processing mutations can also disrupt NBD1-TMD2 and NBD2-TMD1 interactions. Processing mutations near the NH2- (G268V) or COOH-end (L1260A) of the molecule disrupted cross-linking between Cys-443(NBD1) and Cys-909(TMD2). NBD1-TMD2 interactions were restored when the processing mutants were expressed in the presence of the drug substrate cyclosporin A. Similar findings were made for TMD1-NBD2 interactions. Studies on the L1260A/A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) mutant showed that only the mature form of the protein could undergo cross-linking (Fig. 6B). It appears that individual domains of ABC transporters can fold properly. This is expected because the crystal structure of NBD1 of CFTR expressed as a separate polypeptide (43Lewis H.A. Zhao X. Wang C. Sauder J.M. Rooney I. Noland B.W. Lorimer D. Kearins M.C. Conners K. Condon B. Maloney P.C. Guggino W.B. Hunt J.F. Emtage S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1346-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) was found to be similar to the NBDs in the ABC transporter BtuCD (15Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). It appears that the individual domains of eukaryotic ABC transporters undergo cotranslational folding (44Kleizen B. van Vlijmen T. de Jonge H.R. Braakman I. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and that establishment of domain-domain contacts may take place after synthesis. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that half-molecule forms of P-gp can be synthesized as separate polypeptides but they will associate after synthesis to form a functional complex (45Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of a processing mutation into a P-gp half-molecule inhibited interactions between the half-molecules (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These interactions however, are restored upon co-expression of the two halves of P-gp in the presence of a drug substrate. Establishment of native NBD-TMD contacts may contribute to interactions between the two halves of P-gp as shown in Fig. 8. The presence of a processing mutation such as L1260A traps P-gp as immature protein with incomplete NBD-TMD contacts (Fig. 8, left panel). Binding of drug substrate at the interface between the TMDs induces P-gp to complete the folding process to promote TMD1-NBD2 and NBD1-TMD2 interactions to yield a native structure (Fig. 8, right panel). Establishment of native NBD-TMD interactions after synthesis also plays a critical role in forming a functional complex because immature P-gp is inactive (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Faseb J. 1999; 13: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). NBD-TMD contacts appear to be critical for function because cross-linking of mutant L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) (Fig. 3) or introduction of the F1086C mutation at the TMD1/NBD2 interface inhibited activity. The TMD-NBD interfaces appear to be critical for cross-talk between the ATP- and drug-binding sites as vanadate trapping of nucleotide inhibited cross-linking of mutants containing cysteines at the NBD1-TMD2 (L443C(NBD1)/S909C(TMD2) and TMD1-NBD2 (A266C(TMD1)/F1086C(NBD2) interfaces (Figs. 4B and 6). The observation that NBD-TMD interactions are important for folding and activity has recently been reported for CFTR (46Serohijos A.W. Hegedus T. Aleksandrov A.A. He L. Cui L. Dokholyan N.V. Riordan J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3256-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It was found cysteines introduced into NBD1 could be cross-linked to cysteines introduced into the fourth intracellular loop of TMD2 using cross-linkers of various lengths. Cross-linking of NBD1 to TMD2 also inhibited CFTR chloride channel activity. The Phe-508 position was shown to be close to the NBD1-TMD2 interface as a cysteine introduced at position 508 could be cross-linked to cysteines introduced at positions1065, 1068, 1069, and 1074 in the fourth intracellular loop of TMD2. The mature and immature forms of CFTR were also found to be structurally different as only the mature form of CFTR showed cross-linking between NBD1 and TMD2. Further cross-linking analysis of CFTR also showed that the NBDs made multiple contacts with the cytoplasmic loops of both TMDs. Cross-linking analysis provided evidence for TMD1-NBD2, TMD1-NBD1, and TMD2-NBD2 interactions (47He, L., Aleksandrov, A. A., Serohijos, A. W., Hegedus, T., Aleksandrov, L. A., Cui, L., Dokholyan, N. V., and Riordan, J. R. (2008) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). It was found that cross-linking between NBDs and TMDs in opposite halves of CFTR rapidly inhibited channel gating whereas cross-linking between NBDs and TMDs in the same halves had a lesser impact on activity. Mapping of NBD1-TMD2 contacts by cross-linking analysis was also recently reported for the yeast Yor1p ABC transporter that has similar domains to CFTR (48Pagant, S., Brovman, E. Y., Halliday, J. J., and Miller, E. A. (2008) J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). It was found that the structure of Yor1p also resembled the structure of Sav1866 as the cysteines introduced into the second intracellular loop of the TMDs could be cross-linked to cysteines introduced into the opposite NBD. As observed with P-gp (this study), it was found that processing mutations in Yor1p inhibited NBD1-TMD2 interactions. The native NBD1-TMD2 interactions could be restored when suppressor mutations were introduced into the mutant to promote maturation. Therefore, different ABC transporters appear to share many similarities in structure and folding pathways.

Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The majority of substrate specificity is conferred by a wide array of protein interaction motifs on the E3 ligase that are separate from the domains responsible for recruitment of the ubiquitination machinery (2Jackson P.K.

After covalent attachment of ubiquitin, other classes of ubiquitin-binding proteins decipher this highly informative post-translational modification by binding, editing, or removing the attached ubiquitin molecules (3Hicke L.

RING finger proteins are the most numerous and can be further divided into multisubunit complexes (SCF and anaphase-promoting complex) or single subunit proteins with modular domains (Cbl and Mdm2). Multisubunit complexes partition function into individualized protein components with the substrate-binding region contained in the F box for the SCFs (6Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 923-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas single subunit RING finger E3 ligases depend on substrate capture via protein-protein interaction domains particular to each (7Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The regions critical for substrate binding among RING finger E3 ligases vary greatly, making prediction and identification of potential substrates difficult. In addition, the limited number of E3 ligases compared with the total number of proteins regulated by ubiquitination requires that each E3 ligase have flexibility to regulate multiple protein targets. How E3 ligases achieve selective substrate specificity among the pool of potential cellular substrates is currently not well understood.The gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL) is a type 1 transmembrane E3 ligase cloned following differential display screening to identify early factors that promoted T cell anergy (8Anandasabapathy N.

GRAIL expression has been correlated with a number of systems that prevent T cell proliferation and cytokine production, and its activity depends upon an intact cytosolic RING finger domain (9Heissmeyer V.

However, GRAIL mRNA expression is not exclusive to lymphocytes, suggesting that it could target substrates and affect cellular processes across numerous tissues. In addition, the amino terminus of GRAIL contains a protease-associated (PA) domain, which has been proposed to serve as a protein-protein or protein-sorting motif in plants, but its precise function is unknown (11Bruinenberg P.G.

Therefore, we asked whether the amino-terminal PA domain of GRAIL might serve as a substrate-binding motif to capture a luminal or extracellular domain of transmembrane proteins followed by ubiquitination of cytosolic residues by the GRAIL RING finger. Two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with the amino terminus of GRAIL identified the tetraspanin family member CD151, a four-pass transmembrane protein that modulates cell-cell adhesion and integrin signaling (15Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16Fitter S. Sincock P.M. Jolliffe C.N. Ashman L.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses demonstrated that GRAIL utilized its PA domain to bind directly extracellular regions of both CD151 and another tetraspanin, CD81, and this interaction promoted cytosolic ubiquitination of the tetraspanin substrate for proteasomal degradation. These results demonstrate a unique ubiquitination model in which a single subunit E3 ligase contains a substrate interaction domain for transmembrane proteins that is spatially restricted from its ubiquitination machinery across a lipid bilayer. Using this membrane juxtaposition of binding and ubiquitination, GRAIL might target additional transmembrane proteins for degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Antibodies—Ammonium chloride, Brij96, CHAPS, chloroquine, Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, mouse anti-FLAG-horseradish peroxidase (M2), and rabbit anti-V5 were purchased from Sigma.

This vector was screened against a liver cDNA library according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. Carbenicillin-resistant clones containing high β-galactosidase activity were sequenced, and open reading frames were identified by BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) search (NCBI).Plasmids—All plasmids containing open reading frames for human and mouse tetraspanins were purchased from Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL, except for human CD81, which was a generous gift from Dr. Shoshana Levy (Stanford University). All tetraspanins were PCR-subcloned into the pIRES-hrGFP-2a in frame with a carboxyl-terminal 3×HA tag (Stratagene). For all human tetraspanin constructs, humanized recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) was first removed from the expression vector.Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293T and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected using TransIT-293 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI). Cells were lysed with Brij96 lysis buffer to detect protein-protein interactions (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Brij96, protease inhibitors), and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For ubiquitination assays, cells were incubated with ALLN (10 μg/ml) for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C prior to lysis.

Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline + 2% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells were stained in phosphate-buffered saline + 1% normal donkey serum and mounted using VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were imaged using an SP2 AOBS confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion, 1.3 numerical aperture objective (Leica, Bannockburn, IL).Flow Cytometry—Cells were dissociated 48 h following transfection and stained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated bovine serum. Samples were run on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree-Star, Ashland, OR).Cross-linking Assay—Transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells were lysed in 1% Brij96 buffer. Cell lysates were split in half, and one set was cross-linked for 2 h on ice with 2 mm DSP followed by neutralization of free cross-linker with 50 mm Tris for 15 min on ice. SDS (0.1%) was added to both samples, and the tetraspanin was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA beads. Samples were washed, boiled in loading buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, and analyzed by Western blot.RESULTSIdentification of Transmembrane Proteins That Bind the GRAIL PA Domain—The luminal portion of the type 1 transmembrane single unit E3 ubiquitin ligase GRAIL contains a PA domain, which is present in the sorting receptors of the plant vacuolar pathway and in the transferrin receptor in mammalian cells (17Sanderfoot A.A. Ahmed S.U. Marty-Mazars D. Rapoport I. Kirchhausen T. Marty F. Raikhel N.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9920-9925Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Lawrence C.M. Ray S. Babyonyshev M. Galluser R. Borhani D.W. Harrison S.C. Science. 1999; 286: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To identify potential PA-binding proteins, we screened a liver cDNA library in a bacterial two-hybrid system with the amino-terminal PA domain of mouse GRAIL, excluding the signal sequence, as “bait.” A bacterial system was used to avoid any secondary effects of the eukaryotic ubiquitin-proteasome system present in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Of the positive clones that contained regions of membrane-spanning proteins, the one chosen for further study contained the predominant protein-protein interaction motif, the large extracellular loop (LEL), of the transmembrane tetraspanin protein CD151 (Fig. 1A).To verify the interaction between CD151 and full-length GRAIL in a eukaryotic system, transient co-expression of epitope-tagged constructs of these two proteins was performed in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation of 3×HA-tagged CD151 resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of V5-tagged GRAIL (Fig. 1B), and reverse immunoprecipitation of GRAIL-V5 from separate lysates also pulled down CD151–3×HA (data not shown). This tetraspanin interaction was specific for the PA domain of GRAIL as another PA domain-containing protein with extensive intracellular co-localization with GRAIL, the transferrin receptor (8Anandasabapathy N. Ford G.S. Bloom D. Holness C. Paragas V. Seroogy C. Skrenta H. Hollenhorst M. Fathman C.G. Soares L. Immunity. 2003; 18: 535-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), did not co-immunoprecipitate with transfected 3×HA-tagged CD151 (Fig. 1B). One method to suggest a stoichiometric tetraspanin interaction is lysis with detergents of increasing hydrophobicity and ionic strength as was previously used to demonstrate the interaction between CD151 and the β1 and β3 integrins (16Fitter S. Sincock P.M. Jolliffe C.N. Ashman L.K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). GRAIL binding to CD151 survived solubilization with 1% Brij96 and with lower stoichiometry in 1% Triton X-100, implying a direct interaction between GRAIL and CD151 (Fig. 1C). Because Brij96 solubilization maintains the robust interaction between GRAIL and CD151 and avoids the formation of large tetraspanin complexes seen with CHAPS (19Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), this detergent was used for the remainder of the studies.To further define the region of GRAIL that bound CD151, a series of V5-tagged GRAIL mutant constructs were co-expressed with 3×HA-tagged CD151 in 293T cells and assessed by co-immunoprecipitation for binding to CD151. As predicted, CD151 co-immunoprecipitated GRAIL constructs containing deletions or point mutations in the carboxyl-terminal domains (ΔCC, H2N2, and ΔZF), whereas a mutation removing the PA domain (ΔPA) prevented binding of CD151 to GRAIL (Fig. 1D).The GRAIL PA Domain Directly Interacts with Transmembrane Tetraspanins—The predominant molecular characteristic of the tetraspanin family is the formation of an LEL domain. Although the sequence for the tetraspanin LEL regions diverge, a broad spectrum interaction of tetraspanin family members with proteins of the very late antigen family of β1 integrins has been reported (20Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the PA domain of GRAIL might serve as an interaction domain for other members of the tetraspanin family in addition to CD151. To test our hypothesis, expression of V5-tagged GRAIL in 293T cells co-immunoprecipitated with 3×HA carboxyl-terminally tagged CD81 (Fig. 2A). Inclusion of an additional deletion mutant in an amino-terminal region of GRAIL (ΔVW) along with the ΔPA mutant in a co-immunoprecipitation assay with CD81 produced results similar to those seen with CD151 where an intact GRAIL amino terminus is required for binding (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate a direct interaction between GRAIL and tetraspanins, a covalent cross-linker (DSP) was added during lysis before supplementing with 0.1% SDS to prevent co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C). The addition of DSP maintained the interaction between GRAIL and CD81, indicating that the GRAIL PA domain bound directly to the luminal/extracellular region of the transmembrane tetraspanins and acts as a bona fide protein-protein interaction motif in mammalian cells (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2The PA domain of GRAIL directly binds tetraspanins. A, left, 293T cells were transfected with expression constructs for V5-tagged GRAIL and 3×HA-tagged CD81 along with empty control vectors. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-V5 and anti-HA. Right, 293T cells were transfected with various V5-tagged expression constructs for wild-type GRAIL and GRAIL mutants along with 3×HA-tagged CD81. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and immunoblotted with anti-V5 or anti-HA. B, 293T cells were transfected with either 3×HA vector and V5-tagged GRAIL, 3×HA-tagged CD81 and V5 vector only, or 3×HA-tagged CD81 and V5-tagged GRAIL. Cells were lysed in 1% Brij96, lysates were divided in half, and one-half was cross-linked with DSP on ice for 2 h. Free DSP was neutralized with Tris, and 0.1% SDS was added to each sample. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and immunoblotted with anti-GRAIL or anti-HA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The GRAIL PA Domain Captures Tetraspanins for Cytosolic Ubiquitination by Its RING Finger—The cytosolic RING finger of GRAIL has been shown previously to confer E3 ligase activity against the cellular Rho family inhibitor RhoGDI (21Su L. Lineberry N. Huh Y. Soares L. Fathman C.G. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7559-7566Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether tetraspanin capture by the luminal PA domain of GRAIL could result in ubiquitination of one or more of the small cytosolic domains of these four-pass transmembrane proteins. Using a cellular ubiquitination assay in live cells, we determined whether GRAIL, compared with the enzymatically inactive H2N2 or nonbinding ΔPA mutants, could ubiquitinate tetraspanins. Because of the short half-life typical of polyubiquitinated proteins, a potent inhibitor of both proteasomes and lysosomal cathepsins, ALLN, was added to the cells no longer than 2 h prior to lysis to stabilize ubiquitinated proteins. In the presence of GRAIL, compared with LacZ, there was a dramatic increase in the amount of ubiquitinated CD81 and CD151 (Fig. 3A). To prevent detection of ubiquitinated proteins that could co-immunoprecipitate with tetraspanins, including autoubiquitinated GRAIL, cell lysates for the remaining cellular ubiquitination assays were first denatured in 0.5% SDS before immunoprecipitation. In these studies, transmembrane tetraspanin ubiquitination was dependent both on the ability of GRAIL to bind to the tetraspanin and its E3 ligase activity as demonstrated by reduced ubiquitination of CD81 and CD151 seen with the H2N2 or ΔPA mutants compared with wild-type GRAIL (Fig. 3B). The result of GRAIL ubiquitination was a decrease in the steady-state level of tetraspanin as seen when GRAIL was titrated into a fixed population of wild-type CD81 (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3GRAIL ubiquitination requires the PA and RING domains and results in tetraspanin degradation. A, following transfection with either V5-tagged GRAIL or lacZ; 3×HA-tagged CD81, CD151, or vector alone; and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (Ub), 293T cells were incubated with ALLN for 2 h prior to lysis to enrich for ubiquitinated proteins. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA beads and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-FLAG and anti-HA. B, 293T cells were transfected with V5-tagged GRAIL, ΔPA, H2N2, or vector alone constructs; 3×HA-tagged CD81 or CD151; and 3×FLAG-tagged ubiquitin. Cell lysates were denatured in SDS, diluted in lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated with anti-HA beads, and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-V5. C, 293T cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of 3×HA-tagged CD81 and V5-tagged GRAIL at 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 μg (empty V5 vector was added for a total of 1.6 μg of total V5 plasmid for each transfection). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GRAIL Ubiquitinates Residues Only within the Tetraspanin Cytosolic Amino Terminus—Ubiquitin molecules are predominantly added to lysine residues of target proteins. Previous alignments of human tetraspanins showed that the few conserved sequences were mainly centered in the transmembrane domains and cysteine motifs in the LEL along with a single lysine residue in the cytosolic amino terminus proximal to the first transmembrane region (22Stipp C.S. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 106-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 23Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 588-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This orientation potentially provides access to the cytosolic RING finger of GRAIL for ubiquitin conjugation and suggested a conserved motif for tetraspanin ubiquitination. To test whether this shared lysine provided a preferred site for GRAIL-mediated ubiquitination, point mutants of the lysines in human CD81 and CD151 were constructed. Human CD81 (hCD81) contains two intracellular lysines only in the amino terminus at positions Lys-8 and conserved Lys-11, whereas human CD151 (hCD151) contains three lysines in the amino terminus at positions Lys-7, Lys-8, and conserved Lys-17 along with one lysine in each of the two other cytosolic domains (Fig. 4A). When GRAIL was co-expressed in cellular ubiquitination assays with hCD81 constructs containing single point mutations at either lysine 8 (K8R) or the conserved lysine at position 11 (K11R), the amount of hCD81 ubiquitination was reduced for both mutants roughly equally when compared with the ubiquitination density of wild-type hCD81 (Fig. 4B). In addition, an hCD81 protein devoid of both lysines (K8R,K11R) showed no GRAIL-mediated ubiquitination, whereas substituting a lysine for glutamic acid at position 4 in the double lysine-deleted hCD81 construct (K8R,K11R,E4K) restored the ability of GRAIL to ubiquitinate the tetraspanin. Mutating the conserved lysine (Lys-17) on hCD151 did not change the GRAIL-mediated ubiquitination seen compared with wild-type hCD151. However, the hCD151 mutant devoid of all three amino-terminal lysines (K7R,K8R,K17R) but still containing two additional non-amino-terminal cytosolic lysines was not ubiquitinated when co-expressed with GRAIL (Fig. 4B). Finally mutation of all the amino-terminal lysines conferred resistance to GRAIL-mediated degradation. Titrating in GRAIL to a fixed amount of the hCD81 K8R,K11R mutant, unlike the wild-type protein, did not change the steady-state levels of the tetraspanin (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4GRAIL ubiquitinates intracellular lysine residues only present in the tetraspanin amino terminus.

In addition, results seen with the hCD81 K8R,K11R,E4K construct suggest that GRAIL can ubiquitinate lysines positioned anywhere in the amino terminus. Therefore, although the “conserved” amino-terminal lysine of tetraspanins does not serve as the primary site for ubiquitination, the GRAIL RING finger exhibits “regional specificity” for ubiquitinating lysine residues only within the amino-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of tetraspanins.GRAIL Binding Promotes Lys-48-linked, Proteasomal Degradation of Tetraspanins—Ubiquitin itself contains seven lysine residues that can form isopeptide bonds with other ubiquitin molecul"
https://openalex.org/W1979856860,"To investigate the effect of phosphorylation on the interactions of phospholamban (PLB) with itself and its regulatory target, SERCA, we measured FRET from CFP-SERCA or CFP-PLB to YFP-PLB in live AAV-293 cells. Phosphorylation of PLB was mimicked by mutations S16E (PKA site) or S16E/T17E (PKA+CaMKII sites). FRET increased with protein concentration up to a maximum (FRET(max)) that was taken to represent the intrinsic FRET of the bound complex. The concentration dependence of FRET yielded dissociation constants (K(D)) for the PLB-PLB and PLB-SERCA interactions. PLB-PLB FRET data suggest pseudo-phosphorylation of PLB increased oligomerization of PLB but did not alter PLB pentamer quaternary structure. PLB-SERCA FRET experiments showed an apparent decrease in binding of PLB to SERCA and an increase in the apparent PLB-SERCA binding cooperativity. It is likely that these changes are secondary effects of increased oligomerization of PLB; a change in the inherent affinity of monomeric PLB for SERCA was not detected. In addition, PLB-SERCA complex FRET(max) was reduced by phosphomimetic mutations, suggesting the conformation of the regulatory complex is significantly altered by PLB phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2046705884,"Rtt106 is a histone chaperone that has been suggested to play a role in heterochromatin-mediated silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It interacts physically and functionally with the chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1), which is associated with replication-coupled nucleosomal deposition. In this work, we have taken several approaches to study Rtt106 in greater detail and have identified a previously unknown function of Rtt106. We found genetic interactions between rtt106Δ and mutations in genes encoding transcription elongation factors, including Spt6, TFIIS, and members of the PAF and yeast DSIF complexes. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that Rtt106 is associated with transcribed regions of active genes. Furthermore, our results show that Rtt106 is required for the repression of transcription from a cryptic promoter within a coding region. This observation strongly suggests that Rtt106 is involved in the regulation of chromatin structure of transcribed regions. Finally, we provide evidence that Rtt106 plays a role in regulating the levels of histone H3 transcription-coupled deposition over transcribed regions.

In eukaryotic organisms, the chromatin structure has a major impact on important nuclear processes such as DNA replication or transcription. Most transcriptional regulation mechanisms involve chromatin modulation by histone-modifying enzymes or ATP-remodeling machines. However, another mechanism emerged from recent advances in chromatin studies that links nucleosomal assembly, disassembly, and histone dynamics to the control of transcription (1Williams S.K. Tyler J.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At gene promoters, histone dynamics could modulate histone marks that play a critical role during activation or repression of genes (2Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2009-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As is the case for transcription initiation, chromatin structure is also a major obstacle to elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) 3The abbreviations used are: RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; CAF-1, chromatin assembly factor-1; SPT, suppressor of Ty insertion; ORF, open reading frame; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; SGA, synthetic genetic array. 3The abbreviations used are: RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; CAF-1, chromatin assembly factor-1; SPT, suppressor of Ty insertion; ORF, open reading frame; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; SGA, synthetic genetic array. (3Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, cells have developed mechanisms involving different factors that deal with this challenge and allow RNAP II movement during elongation. Interestingly, these factors also play a role in chromatin refolding in the wake of transcription by promoting different mechanisms such as histone displacement, exchange, and redeposition (4Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar). The refolding of nucleosomes in the wake of RNAP II is of great importance to the cell because its absence has detrimental consequences. A defect in this process results in transcriptionally permissive chromatin along the transcribed regions (5Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This permissive structure allows initiation of spurious transcription from cryptic sites within coding regions (5Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 6Mason P.B. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Importantly, recent observations show that this phenomenon is widespread in yeast. 4V. Cheung and F. Winston, personal communication. 4V. Cheung and F. Winston, personal communication. Repression of inappropriate transcription is very important, and key factors involved in this function are highly conserved and essential to cell survival. This includes histone chaperone proteins such as Spt6, Asf1, and the Facilitating Chromatin Transcription (FACT) complex (5Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 7Schwabish M.A. Struhl K. Mol Cell. 2006; 22: 415-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast to these factors, there is no evidence of the involvement of the replication-associated histone chaperone chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) in the repression of spurious transcription. This suggests the existence of a specific role for some histone chaperones associated with transcription. Interestingly, the newly discovered factor Rtt106 was exclusively linked to the CAF-1 function (8Huang, S., Zhou, H., Katzmann, D., Hochstrasser, M., Atanasova, E., and Zhang, Z. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar). Rtt106 possess a histone chaperone activity and interacts both functionally and physically with CAF-1 and histones H3/H4 (8Huang, S., Zhou, H., Katzmann, D., Hochstrasser, M., Atanasova, E., and Zhang, Z. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar). Moreover, Rtt106 and CAF-1 play an important role in heterochromatin silencing by controlling the spreading of the Sir proteins in yeast (9Huang S. Zhou H. Tarara J. Zhang Z. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2274-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, the new histone chaperone Rtt106 was proposed to connect the S-phase to epigenetic inheritance in yeast (8Huang, S., Zhou, H., Katzmann, D., Hochstrasser, M., Atanasova, E., and Zhang, Z. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a previously uncharacterized function of Rtt106 that is independent from its functional interaction with CAF-1. Our data demonstrate that Rtt106 is a histone chaperone involved in transcription elongation. Indeed, we found that Rtt106 interacts functionally and genetically with various elongation factors. Importantly, in the absence of Rtt106, we observe a derepression of spurious transcription from the cryptic promoter of the model gene FLO8. This phenotype is generally associated with a defect in the adequate refolding of chromatin structure after RNAP II passage (5Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 10Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Therefore, both molecular evidence and genetic evidence link Rtt106 to the modulation of chromatin associated with elongation. In addition, ChIP assays clearly show that Rtt106 associates with transcribed regions of chromatin. Finally, using an in vivo histone deposition assay, we found that Rtt106 is important for the deposition of new histones in the transcribed regions of active genes. Altogether, our data show a new role for the histone chaperone Rtt106 in the chromatin modulations within transcribed regions.

Deletions or promoter replacement of genes were performed by homologous recombination and standard yeast genetics methods. The GAL1-FLO8-HIS3 was described previously (12Nourani A. Robert F.

All oligonucleotide sequences are listed in supplemental Table S2. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP analyses were performed as described previously (12Nourani A. Robert F. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1496-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Rufiange A. Jacques P.E. Bhat W. Robert F. Nourani A. Mol.

Biol. 2006; 26: 1496-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. We showed that the high mobility group-like factor Spt2/Sin1 plays an important role in chromatin structure modifications during transcription elongation (12Nourani A. Robert F. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1496-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We conducted a synthetic genetic array (SGA) using the spt2Δ strain as the query strain (12Nourani A. Robert F. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1496-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This method allowed us to construct and analyze double mutants in which spt2Δ was combined with deletions in most of the non-essential genes of S. cerevisiae. We found several candidates, among which was the gene encoding the histone chaperone Rtt106 (supplemental Fig. S1). It has specific affinity toward histone H3 and H4 and was suggested to function in the S-phase (8Huang, S., Zhou, H., Katzmann, D., Hochstrasser, M., Atanasova, E., and Zhang, Z. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar). In vivo, Rtt106 interacts physically with the CAF-1 that is involved in chromatin assembly coupled to replication and also in heterochromatin silencing in yeast (8Huang, S., Zhou, H., Katzmann, D., Hochstrasser, M., Atanasova, E., and Zhang, Z. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar, 9Huang S. Zhou H. Tarara J. Zhang Z. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2274-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since Spt2 function is tightly associated with transcription elongation, our finding of synthetic interaction between spt2Δ and the mutation in RTT106 could suggest a specific replication-independent role of this new histone chaperone. To get more insights into the biological function of Rtt106, we conducted another SGA screen using, this time, rtt106Δ as the query strain. In Fig. 1A, we show all the potential interactions of Rtt106 identified in our SGA screen. We found 58 candidates representing different cellular functions. Interestingly, our analysis of gene ontology terms revealed an enrichment of genes involved in DNA replication and CAF-1 function (p value of 0.00015). This is consistent with previous reports showing a functional link between Rtt106 and CAF-1 (8Huang, S., Zhou, H., Katzmann, D., Hochstrasser, M., Atanasova, E., and Zhang, Z. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar, 14Collins S.R. Miller K.M. Maas N.L. Roguev A. Fillingham J. Chu C.S. Schuldiner M. Gebbia M. Recht J. Shales M. Ding H. Xu H. Han J. Ingvarsdottir K. Cheng B. Andrews B. Boone C. Berger S.L. Hieter P. Zhang Z. Brown G.W. Ingles C.J. Emili A. Allis C.D. Toczyski D.P. Weissman J.S. Greenblatt J.F. Krogan N.J. Nature. 2007; 446: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Importantly, we also found an enrichment of genes involved in transcription by RNAP II (Fig. 1A, genes in green). It is interesting to note that this group is significantly enriched in factors that are mainly involved in the elongation step (p value of 0.003). As shown in Fig. 1A (in green), Rtt106 interacts with Spt4, which is a subunit of the elongation factor DSIF, the PAF elongation complex component Leo1, elongation factor 1 (Elf1), and the Ctk1 kinase, which controls the transition from transcription initiation to elongation through the phosphorylation of the largest RNAP II subunit Rpb1 C-terminal domain repeats on the serine 2 residue. These data suggest a potential role of Rtt106 in transcription that is independent from its function with CAF-1 in both chromatin assembly coupled to DNA replication and heterochromatin silencing. Genetic Evidence That Rtt106 Interacts with Transcription Elongation Factors—To examine this possibility further, we tested the interaction between rtt106Δ and the rpb1Δ-104 mutant, which is deleted in several C-terminal domain repeats. As shown in Fig. 1B, the double mutant rtt106Δ rpb1Δ-104 grew more slowly than either single mutant. This synthetic phenotype confirms a link between Rtt106 and the transcription process. In addition, we found that rtt106Δ strains containing the suppressor of Ty insertion (SPT) phenotype reporter lys2-128δ are also able to grow on medium lacking lysine, indicating an SPT phenotype of these mutants (Fig. 1C). An SPT phenotype is presumably associated with genes that have a clear connection to transcription and chromatin structure regulation. It is interesting to note that in contrast to rtt106Δ and in parallel to the wild type strain, the CAF-1 subunit mutant cac1Δ is not able to grow on medium lacking lysine (Fig. 1C). This further indicates that Rtt106 possesses a specific function in transcription that is independent of the CAF-1 factor. To confirm a potential Rtt106 function in elongation, we studied the possible interaction with the PAF complex members. The PAF complex plays an important role in chromatin modulation associated with transcription elongation. It coordinates the recruitment of different epigenetic marks that are of great importance for the regulation of chromatin structure during elongation (reviewed in Ref. 4Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar). We constructed pairwise double mutants of rtt106Δ and each of the PAF genes (Fig. 1D). In addition to Leo1 that was identified in our SGA screen, we found that the rtt106Δ paf1Δ and rtt106Δ ctr9Δ grew more slowly than each single mutant. Moreover, the double mutants did not grow at 33 °C, indicating a strong synthetic phenotype. The genetic interactions between Rtt106, Spt2, Spt4, PAF, and Elf1 factors indicate a strong link between Rtt106 and the transcription elongation process. This is further supported by our observation that rtt106Δ genetically interacts with mutations in genes encoding several other elongation factors, including TFIIS, the DSIF subunit Spt5, and the histone H3 Lys-36 methyltransferase gene Set2 (supplemental Fig. S2). Rtt106 Is Recruited to Transcribed Chromatin Regions—Taken together, the results described above strongly indicate that Rtt106 is involved in transcription elongation. To test whether this new Rtt106 function is direct, we asked whether this factor is physically associated with actively transcribed regions. To this end, we analyzed by ChIP assays the association of Rtt106 across the constitutively active gene PMA1 and to a non-transcribed locus (intergenic region of chromosome V, hereafter called NoORF). As shown in Fig. 2A, after immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against Rtt106-Myc, we observed a significant enrichment at both the coding region (probe C) and the 3′-untranslated region (probe D) versus the non-transcribed region (NoORF:probe A). In contrast, we did not observe a significant enrichment at the non-transcribed upstream activation sequence of PMA1 (probe B). In Fig. 2B, in addition to different PMA1 locations, we analyzed by ChIP-QPCR the association of Rtt106 to several transcribed regions of active genes. Our data confirm that Rtt106 is significantly associated with transcribed chromatin. Since Rtt106 has been suggested to play a role during the S-phase, we wanted to exclude the possibility that its association with chromatin is linked to DNA replication. To this end, we analyzed by ChIP assay the association of Rtt106 with the coding regions of several genes in G1-arrested cells but did not find it to be significantly different from that seen in exponentially growing cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, our data show association of Rtt106 with the coding region of active genes and exclude the possibility that this recruitment is linked to the role of Rtt106 during S-phase. Rtt106 Is Critical for the Repression of Spurious Transcription from Cryptic Promoter—To test further the role of Rtt106 in elongation, we used a reporter system sensitive to transcription elongation defects in vivo. This reporter is based on previous studies showing that cryptic promoters exist within the coding regions of certain genes and can become active in particular transcription elongation mutants (5Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This phenotype has been most extensively characterized for the FLO8 gene (5Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 10Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 12Nourani A. Robert F. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1496-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Prather D. Krogan N.J. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10122-10135Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test whether an rtt106Δ mutation allows cryptic initiation, we used a reporter for FLO8 cryptic initiation in which the 3′-coding region of FLO8 has been replaced with the HIS3 coding region such that HIS3 is only expressed when the FLO8 cryptic promoter is active (12Nourani A. Robert F. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1496-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Using this reporter, we tested the expression of FLO8-HIS3 in wild type, rtt106Δ, and spt2Δ mutant strains by assaying growth on medium lacking histidine. Our results (Fig. 2C) show that, similar to spt2Δ, rtt106Δ allows growth on medium lacking histidine, indicating HIS3 expression from the FLO8 cryptic promoter. After that, we tested cryptic initiation at FLO8-HIS3 more directly and performed Northern hybridization analysis using a HIS3 probe. In addition to the full-length FLO8-HIS3 transcript, we observed a short HIS3 transcript only in the rtt106Δ mutant (Fig. 2E). This observation confirms that in the absence of Rtt106, the repression of cryptic transcription is impaired and suggests that Rtt106 plays a direct role in regulation of chromatin structure during elongation. Rtt106 Cooperates with the Essential Elongation Factor Spt6 to Inhibit Spurious Transcription—Recent studies show that Spt6 plays a central role in the refolding of normal chromatin in the wake of transcription. It controls the level of histone H4 over transcribed regions and also modulates the histone H3 and H4 acetylation through the control of H3 Lys-36 methylation (5Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 10Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Rtt106 may play an important role in the refolding of repressing chromatin structure at the transcribed region of active genes and suggest a potential functional link between Rtt106 and the essential elongation factor Spt6. To address this possibility, we constructed the double mutant rtt106Δ spt6-1004 and assayed growth in different conditions. We observed synthetic growth defects in the double mutant at 33 °C (Fig. 2D). This phenotype could suggest that both factors are required to regulate chromatin structure at the transcribed regions and thereby inhibit spurious transcription. We addressed this possibility by asking whether the double mutant rtt106Δ spt6-1004 produces higher levels of transcripts from cryptic promoters. For that, we performed Northern blot analyses using a FLO8 probe to study the endogenous FLO8 gene transcripts in different strains (Fig. 2F). We found that both rtt106Δ and spt6-1004 produce short transcript indicative of spurious transcription. However, the level of FLO8 short transcript is significantly increased in the double mutant rtt106Δ spt6-1004, suggesting that the two factors cooperate to inhibit cryptic promoters and spurious transcription. Rtt106 Plays an Important Role in Chromatin Assembly Coupled to Transcription—These genetic and molecular data suggest a role for Rtt106 in the regulation of chromatin structure during transcription elongation. To gain additional insights into the role of Rtt106 in this process, we wanted to know whether this histone chaperone is involved in the histone dynamics associated with transcription elongation. To address this, we asked whether the deletion of RTT106 would affect the levels of histone H3 exchange in the coding region of the inducible GAL1 or the constitutive PMA1 genes. We used a histone exchange assay previously described by us and others (13Rufiange A. Jacques P.E. Bhat W. Robert F. Nourani A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 16Schermer U.J. Korber P. Horz W. Mol Cell. 2005; 19: 279-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Dion M.F. Kaplan T. Kim M. Buratowski S. Friedman N. Rando O.J. Science. 2007; 315: 1405-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In this system, there are two different sources of histone H3 in the cell, the endogenous histone tagged with the Myc epitope and a galactose-inducible form fused to the FLAG tag coexpressed with histone H4. To eliminate the contribution of DNA replication-dependent histone deposition, exponentially growing cells containing the double histone H3 tag system are blocked in G1 with α-factor. After incubation with α-factor, cells are either fixed or induced to express FLAG-H3 prior to formaldehyde treatment to cross-link chromatin. Next, the levels of total H3, FLAG-H3, and RNAP II are assayed by standard ChIP-QPCR (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, after induction of the new histone H3 in galactose medium, we observe a high level of incorporation at both GAL1 and PMA1 coding regions in wild type strain. These levels are consistent with those previously reported (13Rufiange A. Jacques P.E. Bhat W. Robert F. Nourani A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Importantly, although we do not observe a significant change in Rpb1 association (Fig. 3B), deletion of RTT106 results in a significantly reduced incorporation of histone H3 at the coding regions of GAL1 and PMA1. It is interesting to note that in the absence of Rtt106, histone deposition at the non-transcribed intergenic V region (NoORF) is not decreased. These observations clearly indicate that in the absence of Rtt106, new histone deposition in the wake of the RNAP II is reduced. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that the Rtt106 histone chaperone regulates transcription-dependent histone H3 deposition during elongation to ensure that transcribed regions regain normal chromatin structure in the wake of transcription. Previous studies have suggested that Rtt106 is a histone chaperone protein that plays a role in heterochromatin silencing through a link to the S-phase and DNA replication-dependent chromatin assembly (8Huang, S., Zhou, H., Katzmann, D., Hochstrasser, M., Atanasova, E., and Zhang, Z. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.Google Scholar, 9Huang S. Zhou H. Tarara J. Zhang Z. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2274-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The present study shows several new results that strongly indicate an important role of Rtt106 during transcription elongation. First, our synthetic lethal screen using rtt106Δ and the yeast deletion library uncovered several genes involved in transcription and, more specifically, in transcription elongation. Second, a direct test of genetic interactions between rtt106Δ and mutants of genes encoding elongation factors confirmed a strong genetic link between this histone chaperone and transcription elongation. Third, our ChIP data clearly show that Rtt106 is physically associated with transcribed regions. Fourth, in the absence of Rtt106, we observe a derepression of spurious transcription from the FLO8 cryptic promoter. This provides strong evidence that Rtt106 is required for chromatin structure refolding in the wake of transcription elongation. Finally, we show that Rtt106 is important for normal transcription-dependent histone H3 deposition at active genes. This result indicates that Rtt106 is involved in the histone dynamics that are tightly associated with an elongating RNA polymerase II. We have previously shown that in highly expressed genes, newly synthesized histone H3 is incorporated in the transcribed regions of those genes (13Rufiange A. Jacques P.E. Bhat W. Robert F. Nourani A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that nucleosomes are disassembled in front of RNAP II and reassembled in its wake using new histones at these locations. Our new data clearly indicate that Rtt106 is important for the deposition of new histones in the highly transcribed genes GAL1 and PMA1. This effect is similar to the one we observed in asf1Δ in a previous study (13Rufiange A. Jacques P.E. Bhat W. Robert F. Nourani A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Rtt106 provides new histones H3/H4 to the machinery that reassemble nucleosomes in the wake of transcription at highly transcribed genes. Alternatively, Rtt106 could deposit histones directly after the RNAP II passage. Regardless of the exact mechanism, redeposition of nucleosomes in the wake of RNAP II is impaired in the absence of Rtt106, and this provides strong evidence that this factor plays an important function in transcription-coupled chromatin assembly. The Spt6 histone chaperone is essential for the maintenance of histone H4 over transcribed regions and thereby for normal nucleosomal occupancy (5Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Moreover, Spt6 is required for methylation of histone H3 on lysine 36, which mediates subsequent deacetylation of histone H3 and H4 by Rpd3 at coding regions (10Carrozza M.J. Li B. Florens L. Suganuma T. Swanson S.K. Lee K.K. Shia W.J. Anderson S. Yates J. Washburn M.P. Workman J.L. Cell. 2005; 123: 581-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). This deacetylation plays an essential role in stabilizing the chromatin structure after RNAP II passage, resulting in inhibition of cryptic promoters (4Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar). Our genetic and molecular data show that Rtt106 cooperates with Spt6 to repress the FLO8 cryptic promoter. It is possible that Rtt106 plays a significant role in the Spt6 pathway described above. It may cooperate with Spt6 to maintain a normal level of histones and, therefore, adequate nucleosomal occupancy. Alternatively, similarly to other histone chaperones that were shown to be required for some histone modifications, Rtt106 may stimulate the histone methyltransferase activity of Set2 and therefore regulate indirectly the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4. A future study distinguishing between these possible mechanisms will be undoubtedly interesting. We thank Nikita Avvakumov for helpful comments and advice on the manuscript.

Two-dimensional diffusion of membrane proteins is central to G protein-mediated signal transduction.

The activated GTP-bound α-subunit of transducin, Gαt-GTP, dissociates from R* and Gβγt and diffuses on the membrane surface to bind and activate the effector, a membrane-bound cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, PDE6. The recovery of a photoresponse is similarly composed of a series of diffusional encounters between phototransduction proteins on the membrane. It has been suggested that such diffusion is rate-limiting for both the activation and recovery phases of phototransduction based on results with genetically modified mice (1Calvert P.D.

However, the nature, regulation, and functional consequences of membrane-delimited diffusion in G protein signaling have yet to be characterized. Roles for lipid microdomains, such as rafts, in the regulation of membrane protein dynamics have been implicated in G protein signaling and other signaling pathways (2Chini B. Parenti M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), but current evidence is not definitive, and it is unknown whether lipid microdomains play a role in phototransduction.

DNA Constructs—DNA encoding bovine transducin Gαt with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fused into a loop in the helical domain (Gαt-EGFP), as shown in Fig. 1, was inserted into a baculovirus vector for expression in Sf9 cells or into a plasmid containing the Xenopus opsin promoter (illustrated in Fig. 1) for transgenesis. The rhodopsin-EGFP-1D4 transgene plasmid (3Jin S. McKee T.D. Oprian D.D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Daniel Oprian of Brandeis University. The pXOP-EGFP-Gαt and pVL1392-EGFP-Gαt expression plasmids were constructed using standard PCR mutagenesis and subcloning techniques. In both cases, the coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY292281) encodes the first 115 amino acids of bovine Gαt followed by EGFP, connected with a 6-residue linker sequence (SGGGGS) at each end, followed by the remainder of the bovine Gαt sequence. The transgene construct was made by inserting the EGFP-Gαt sequence in place of EGFP in the pXOP-EGFP vector described previously (4Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin), 2d Ed. Elsevier/North Holland, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar), so that the Xenopus rhodopsin promoter (5Mani S.S. Batni S. Whitaker L. Chen S. Engbretson G.

For transgenesis, pXOP-EGFP-Gαt was cut by ApaLI and MluI, and the 4.1-kb fragment having the Xenopus rhodopsin promoter, EGFP-Gαt and SV40 poly(A) was gel-purified (Qiaex II, Qiagen) with final elution in water. To produce transgenic Xenopus expressing EGFP only, pXOP-EGFP was digested by RsrII and ApaLI, and a 4.0-kb fragment having a rhodopsin promoter, EGFP coding sequence, and SV40 poly(A) was gel-purified and eluted in water. The plasmid for baculovirus production was prepared by inserting a fragment encoding EGFP-Gαt into NotI- and SmaI-digested pVL1392 vector (Pharmingen). Expression and Purification of Proteins—Recombinant baculoviruses were isolated following co-transfection of the linearized BaculoGold viral DNA (Pharmingen) and the transfer vector into Sf9 cells following the manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 (from Spodoptera frugiperda, ATCC CRL-1711) cells were cultured to a density of ∼2 × 106/ml and infected with wild-type bovine Gαt and γ1/β1.2 or with EGFP-Gαt and γ1/β1.2 recombinant baculoviruses. The infected cells were incubated at 28 °C for 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer G and then sonicated on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in buffer H supplemented with 4% sodium cholate (Sigma) or 0.5% polyoxyethylene-10-laurylether (Sigma) and then homogenized using 16–21-gauge needles. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C after incubation at 4 °C for 3 h. The pellet was extracted with 4% sodium cholate or 0.5% polyoxyethylene-10-laurylether in buffer H again. The supernatants from two extractions were combined and diluted 4-fold using buffer H. The detergent extract was loaded onto a 100-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Sigma) column under gravity at 4 °C. After washing the column with 500 ml of buffer H, EGFP-Gt was eluted with a 200-ml gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m in buffer H. Fractions containing EGFP-Gt were pooled and dialyzed with buffer I. Characterization of Purified Gαt-EGFP—Gαt-EGFP expressed in Sf9 cells was purified by anion exchange chromatography, reconstituted with Gβγt purified from bovine rod outer segments, and assayed along with purified bovine Gαβγt for [35S]GTPγS uptake in the presence of photoisomerized rhodopsin in urea-washed rod disk membranes. Purified EGFP-Gαβγt or wild-type bovine Gαβγt was mixed with urea-washed ROS (6Yamanaka G. Eckstein F. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8094-8101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) on ice under a dim red light in buffer F in a 300-μl assay volume. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, the assay was started by exposure to room light and the addition of [35S]GTPγS solution to a final concentration of 2.5 μm GTPγS and 10 nm rhodopsin. At various time points, 20-μl portions of the reaction mixture were filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters, which were washed three times with buffer F and air-dried before liquid scintillation counting. The very low amounts of radioactivity binding to the filters without Gαβγt were subtracted. No detectable binding of [35S]GTPγS was observed without the addition of ROS. Preparation of Bovine ROS Lipid Vesicles—For reconstitution of purified EGFP-Gαβγt, small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion from extracted bovine rod outer segment lipids as described (7Wensel T.G. He F. Malinski J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 307: 289-313PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine ROS were prepared using standard procedures, and membrane pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in buffer E and then mixed with an equal volume of chloroform/methanol/12 n HCl (100:100:1, v/v/v), vortexed, and incubated at 23 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, the aqueous layer was collected and extracted again with an equal volume of chloroform/methanol/12 n HCl (100:100:1, v/v/v). The organic phases containing ROS lipid were pooled and dried under a stream of argon. The dried ROS lipids were resuspended in buffer F and subjected to at least five freeze/thaw cycles in liquid N2. The lipid suspension was then extruded 10 times through 0.1-μm polycarbonate filters using a liposome extruder (Lipex Biomembranes). The concentration of lipid was determined by the assay of inorganic phosphorous. For reconstitution of purified EGFP-Gαβγt, a polylysine-coated coverslip was covered with the suspension of small unilamellar vesicles to form supported bilayers. Purified Gαt-EGFP bound to GDP and Gβγt was added to the supported bilayers and washed briefly with buffer to remove unbound protein. The reconstituted bilayers were then used for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements. Transgenesis—Procedures with animals were carried out according to an approved protocol in accordance with guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine. Transgenesis was carried out essentially as described previously (8He W. Lu L. Zhang X. El-Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) by intracytoplasmic injection. About 400,000 snap-frozen sperm nuclei in 4 μl were added to 250–500 ng of transgene DNA in 2.5 μl, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then diluted 410-fold with buffer D for injection. Xenopus laevis eggs were injected in 0.4× Marc's modified Ringer's solution containing 6% (w/v) Ficoll (GE Healthcare). Properly gastrulating embryos were selected, raised in 0.1× Marc's modified Ringer's solution until approximately stage 42, and then transferred to dechlorinated water. Tadpoles were anesthetized in 0.01% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma) and monitored for EGFP expression using a fluorescence dissecting microscope (Leica MZFL III). Developmental stages of embryos were determined according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (4Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin), 2d Ed. Elsevier/North Holland, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Densitometry—Eyes were collected from four transgenic and four wild-type tadpoles and homogenized in 100 μl of buffer J. 20 μl of each sample (about 10 μg of total protein) was applied to SDS-PAGE alongside purified bovine Gt and insect cell-purified EGFP-Gαt. Immunoblotting was processed according to a standard protocol (9Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) on proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic transfer to supported nitrocellulose (NitroPure, Osmonics, Inc.) was carried out in buffer J supplemented with 20% (v/v) methanol for 60 min at 350 mA at 4 °C. The membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk-TBS/T solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody, Gαt1 (K-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), at a 1:600 dilution for 4 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Promega) anti-rabbit IgG with detection by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For densitometry, x-ray films were scanned and bands quantified by UN-SCAN-IT (Silk Scientific Inc.) software. Immunofluorescence Staining—Transgenic tadpoles at stage 45 were euthanized, and heads were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) for 10–16 h at 4 °C and then placed in 30% sucrose-PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Then they were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek), and frozen sections were cut at 12 μm. All post-fixation and staining steps were performed at room temperature. Tissue sections were post-fixed in 1:1 methanol:acetone (v/v) for 10 min and rehydrated twice in PBS for 10 min. Sections were blocked for 1 h with 10% goat serum (Sigma) in PBS. Then the sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody to rhodopsin, 1D4, at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in 10% goat serum in PBS. After being washed three times for 5 min in PBS, sections were incubated with secondary antibody, Cy5™-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) at a 1:300 dilution (5 μg/ml) in 10% goat serum-PBS for 1 h. Sections were washed twice for 10 min in PBS, mounted in aqueous mounting medium (Gel/Mount; Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and examined using a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope. Preparation of Samples for FRAP Measurements—To measure the diffusion coefficients of EGFP-rhodopsin and EGFP-Gαt in rod photoreceptor cells, Xenopus tadpoles at about stage 45 were anesthetized in 0.01% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester and sacrificed, and eyes were dissected in control Ringer's solution. To isolate single photoreceptor cells, dissected tadpole eyes were put on a slide and squashed gently by a coverslip coated with rhodopsin antibody, B6-30N (10Adamus G. Zam Z.S. Arendt A. Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Vision Res. 1991; 31: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), used to immobilize the rod cells. To measure the diffusion of Gαt in different states, tadpoles eyes were incubated in oxygenated Ringer's solution supplemented with 10 mm glucose and periodically (once/min) perfused with fresh oxygenated Ringer's with 10 mm glucose; incubated in buffer B with 1 mm ATP and 1 mm GTPγS (supplemented with 50 μm/ml α-toxin; for forming constitutively active Gαt); incubated in Ringer's solution with 6 mm 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG; Sigma) and 10 mm sodium azide (Sigma; nucleotide depletion for accumulating R*-Gαβγt); or incubated in Ringer's solution with 10 mm hydroxylamine (for accumulating Gαβγt). Raft-disrupting drugs used were 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD, Sigma; for solubilizing and removing cholesterol) or 2 μg/ml filipin III (Cayman Chemical; for binding cholesterol to form aggregates). To render photoreceptor cells permeable to externally added nucleotides and raft-disrupting drugs, tadpole eyes were incubated with buffer B supplemented with 50 μg/ml α-toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Inc.) and combined with one or two reagents as described above. The cholesterol-loaded MβCD (1.2 mm cholesterol (Sigma) in 10 mm MβCD) was prepared in degassed buffer B supplemented with 50 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, sealed in argon, and shaken at room temperature overnight. Previous studies found that treatment of rod disk membranes with these concentrations of cholesterol and MβCD increases disk membrane content of cholesterol from 15 to 38 mol % (11Niu S.L. Mitchell D.C. Litman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The above media were all supplemented with 10 mm glucose except in the nucleotide depletion treatments. To measure the diffusion coefficient of recombinant EGFP-Gαβγt on a supported bilayer of reconstituted lipids from bovine ROS, a poly-d-lysine (Roche Applied Science) precoated coverslip was dipped into bovine ROS lipid vesicles (see below) and washed twice with 5 ml of buffer F. Then 50 μl of purified EGFP-Gαβγt was added to the coverslip, which was then washed and placed on a slide for FRAP measurements. FRAP Measurements by Confocal Microscopy—Photobleaching experiments were carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with Zeiss LSM software, version 2.0 or version 2.8. Retinal samples were imaged using Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil lens, and supported lipid bilayers were imaged using Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil lens. The 488 nm line of a 15-milliwatt argon laser was used to bleach fluorescence of samples. Typical settings for prebleach and recovery image scans were 0.5–5% of maximum laser power. A single photoreceptor cell with EGFP fluorescence was selected and located to the center of a field, which was usually 29.6 × 29.6 μm or 256 × 256 pixels; 256 gray level images were collected in the xy plane. Maximum scan speed was selected to take images. The fastest scan time used was 0.098 s, although most images were taken between 0.148 and 0.395 s, depending on the size of the image field. For lateral diffusion (perpendicular to the long axis of the rod), no delay was set between images. For longitudinal diffusion (parallel to the long axis of the rod), data were collected at least once every second. Usually three to five pictures were taken before bleaching. Bleaching was at maximum laser power, and a narrow rectangular area was selected using the bleach control program. For lateral diffusion, the long axis of the selected area was parallel to the long axis of rod outer segments, and the width was usually set to 7–13 pixels (∼1 μm). For longitudinal diffusion, the length was set to ∼1 μm along the long axis of rod outer segments encompassing about 38 of the nearly 2000 disks in a rod cell (as shown in Fig. 3A), and the width was set to cover the entire width of the cell (6–8 μm). For diffusion of EGFP-Gαβγt on a reconstituted ROS lipid layer, a circle with a diameter of ∼9 μm was selected for bleaching. The minimum bleach time was 5 ms, although typical time was 50 ms. For recovery, a time series of up to 90 recovery images was collected. For slow diffusion, one or more images were taken at a long time point to determine to what extent the recovery approached completion. For every image at each time point, the average integrated intensities of three areas were recorded: the area selected for bleaching, a non-bleached area on the photoreceptor cell, and a non-bleached area of background. Usually data were captured as a time series of images in a single focal plane. The objectives used provided sufficient depth of field to ensure fairly uniform bleaching along the z axis, as verified by collection of z-stacks across the entire cell. FRAP Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using programs implemented in MATLAB®. The recorded intensities from the bleached and non-bleached areas were corrected for background by subtracting from the value for each pixel the average intensity of the selected background area to give Iraw and Inon, respectively. To correct for fading of fluorescence due to taking images, the intensity of the non-bleached area on photoreceptor cells over time was fitted using the first order decay Equation 1. In the equation, Inon(t) is the recorded average integrated intensity of the selected area at time t, and Inon(0) the intensity recorded in the first image collected. Inon(t)=Inon(0)exp(−t/T)(Eq. 1) After determination of the parameter T by nonlinear least squares fitting, the intensities in image were corrected by Equation 2, in which I(t) is the corrected intensity of the bleached area. I(t)=Iraw(t)exp(t/T)(Eq. 2) The pixel values in the images were integrated along the y axis, from the top to the bottom of the bleach stripe, to generate one-dimensional (x) integrated intensity profiles for each time point. For an initially uniform distribution across a rectangular membrane of width l, with average intensity I(0), the evolution of the integrated intensity Istripe within a central region of -w/2 ≤ x ≤ w/2 following an initial photobleaching with a Gaussian profile of full-width w, centered at x = 0, is given by the following equation (12Crank J. The Mathematics of Difffusion, 2d Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1975Google Scholar), Istripe(t)=−12Istripe(0)[−2+Afπ⋅erf−A(f−1)π⋅erf(ww2+16Dt)+A(f−1)π⋅erf(2l−ww2+16Dt)−A(f−1)π⋅erf(2l+ww2+16Dt)+A(f−1)π⋅erf(4l−ww2+16Dt)−A(f−1)π⋅erf(4l+ww2+16Dt)+…](Eq. 3) where A is the depth of bleach at x = 0 and t = 0, D is the diffusion coefficient, and f is the immobile fraction. For l, which varies along the z axis, as is the case for disks of circular profile, the root-mean-square value of 0.82l, where l is the cell diameter, can be substituted. The value of D extracted is insensitive to small changes in the value of l. The time course of integrated intensity across the pixels selected for bleaching (-w/2 to w/2 in length units) was fit to this function, with best estimates for f, D, A, and w selected by standard least-squares criteria. Initial estimates for A and w were extracted from the first image collected after photobleaching by fitting to Equation 4 where I(x, 0) is the corrected intensity of each pixel at t = 0, I(x,0)=I(0)⋅[1−Aexp(−4x2w2)](Eq. 4) Fits were accepted only if the values for A and w obtained after least-squares fitting of the entire time course were within ±8% of the values estimated from the first image. Final w values agreed within one pixel or less. The values of D were not corrected for the effects of invaginations of the disk membrane known as incisures; previous experiments by Wey et al. (13Wey C.L. Cone R.A. Edidin M.A. Biophys. J. 1981; 33: 225-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) provide an estimate of a factor of 2.7 that may be applied to the D values in Table 1 to obtain that D values would be expected to be observed in the absence of these barriers.TABLE 1Lateral diffusion coefficients of EGFP, EGFP-Gαt, and rhodopsin-EGFPSampleTreatmentDaMean ± S.E.nμm2/sROS with EGFP-Gαt (f < 1%)Gα-GTP (glucose only)0.19 ± 0.0215Gα-GTP (α-toxin only)0.18 ± 0.028Gα-GTPγS (α-toxin/ATP/GTPγS)0.21 ± 0.0110R*-Gαβγ (2-DG/sodium azide)0.047 ± 0.00510R*-Gαβγ/no rafts (α-toxin/MβCD/2-DG/NaN3)0.15 ± 0.017Gαβγ-GDP (hydroxylamine)0.37 ± 0.067Gα-GTP/no rafts (α-toxin/MβCD)0.32 ± 0.0211Gα-GTP/no rafts (α-toxin/filipin III)0.29 ± 0.029Gα-GTP/+ chol.

The radius of one lipid tail is taken to be 0.25 nm, and the radius of the seven-transmembrane domain of rhodopsin is 1.6 nm. Values of 0.35 and 2.0 nm, respectively, were used for two lipid tails on the Gαβγ and rhodopsin dimer and 2.3 nm for the R* dimer bound to Gαβγ. Photoexcitation of Rhodopsin—The intense laser illumination used for fluorescence excitation necessarily bleached a large fraction of rhodopsin in each cell imaged. At a typical setting of 1.5% of maximal laser power, i.e. 0.225 milliwatt, a 0.148-s scan of a 29.6 × 29.6 μm or 8.76 × 10-6 cm2 field delivers a dose of 8.61 × 1015 photons s-1cm-2 × 0.148 s or 1.27 × 1015 photons cm-2. The probability of any one rhodopsin being excited is Q(1−exp−kt)=Q(1−exp−Iσt)(Eq. 6) where Q is the quantum yield (0.65), k is Iσ (with I in units of photons/area/s, the absorbance cross-section, and σ in units of area), and t is the duration of the excitation. The absorbance cross-section, σ, of rhodopsin at 488 nm is 1.46 × 10-16 cm2 (calculated from the molar extinction coefficient, ϵ, according to σ = 3.82 × 10-21 ϵ cm2 m cm), so the probability of photoisomerization of each rhodopsin during a single image scan is 0.65(1-exp(-0.186)) = 0.11. Thus, a single image scan under these conditions excites sufficient rhodopsins to bind all transducins. In practice, several scans were always needed prior to the beginning of the FRAP experiments to locate the cell, find the correct focus position, and center it in the image field. Characterization of Purified Gαt-EGFP—To examine the dynamic properties of transducin in intact photoreceptor cells, we produced a fusion of Gαt with EGFP for measurements by FRAP. Previous studies revealed an essentially nonperturbing site for insertion of EGFP within the helical domains of Gα subunits (14Hughes T.E. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We made the analogous fusion with bovine Gαt (Fig. 1A), with EGFP inserted between Met115 and Pro116, in a loop between twoα-helices. For biochemical characterization, EGFP-Gαt was expressed using a baculovirus vector and purified from insect cells (Fig. 1B). The fusion protein bound photoreceptor Gβγ, bound to GTPγS, and exhibited nucleotide exchange kinetics (Fig. 1C) in the presence of photoexcited rhodopsin (metarhodopsin II, R*) similar to those of wild-type protein. On supported lipid bilayers it displayed very rapid redistribution kinetics (D = 42.8 ± 4.9 μm2/s), consistent with the diffusional properties of a soluble protein or of a peripheral protein to which the membrane provides very little viscous drag (Table 1). Expression of Gαt-EGFP in Transgenic Rods—To examine G protein dynamics in intact photoreceptor cells, we produced transgenic X. laevis expressing the fusion protein under control of the Xenopus opsin promoter (5Mani S.S.

The fusion protein is largely localized to the rod outer segments (Fig. 1, D–G) as is the endogenous Gαt, with additional signal visible in the inner segments, likely as a result of the well known light-induced migration of Gαt (18Brann M.R.

https://openalex.org/W2171728640,"The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors are regulated by calcium/calcineurin signals and play important roles in T cells, muscle, bone, and neural tissue. NFAT is expressed in the epidermis, and although recent data suggest that NFAT is involved in the skin's responses to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), the wavelengths of radiation that activate NFAT and the biological function of UV-activated NFAT remain undefined. We demonstrate that NFAT transcriptional activity is preferentially induced by UVB wavelengths in keratinocytes. The derived action spectrum for NFAT activation indicates that NFAT transcriptional activity is inversely associated with wavelength. UVR also evoked NFAT2 nuclear translocation in a parallel wavelength-dependent fashion and both transcriptional activation and nuclear translocation were inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. UVR also evoked NFAT2 nuclear translocation in three-dimensional skin equivalents. Evidence suggests that COX-2 contributes to UV-induced carcinogenesis. Inhibiting UV-induced NFAT activation in keratinocytes, reduced COX-2 protein induction, and increased UV-induced apoptosis. COX-2 luciferase reporters lacking functional NFAT binding sites were less responsive to UVR, highlighting that NFAT is required for UV-induced COX-2 induction. Taken together, these data suggest that the proinflammatory, antiapoptotic, and procarcinogenic functions of UV-activated COX-2 may be mediated, in part, by upstream NFAT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2104159031,"The molecular and structural basis of anesthetic interactions with conformations and functionalities of cell surface receptors remains to be elucidated. We have demonstrated that the widely used volatile anesthetic isoflurane blocks the activation-dependent conformational conversion of integrin lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), the major leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, to a high-affinity configuration. Perturbation of LFA-1 activation by isoflurane at clinically relevant concentrations leads to the inhibition of T-cell interactions with target cells as well as ligand-triggered intracellular signaling. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals that isoflurane binds within a cavity in the LFA-1 ligand-binding domain, which is a previously identified drug-binding site for allosteric small-molecule antagonists that stabilize LFA-1 in a low-affinity conformation. These results provide a potential mechanism for the immunomodulatory properties of isoflurane."
https://openalex.org/W2034956764,"Tautomycin (TTM) is a highly potent and specific protein phosphatase inhibitor isolated from Streptomyces spiroverticillatus. The biological activity of TTM makes it an important lead for drug discovery, whereas its spiroketal-containing polyketide chain and rare dialkylmaleic anhydride moiety draw attention to novel biosynthetic chemistries responsible for its production. To elucidate the biosynthetic machinery associated with these novel molecular features, the ttm biosynthetic gene cluster from S. spiroverticillatus was isolated and characterized, and its involvement in TTM biosynthesis was confirmed by gene inactivation and complementation experiments. The ttm cluster was localized to a 86-kb DNA region, consisting of 20 open reading frames that encode three modular type I polyketide synthases (TtmHIJ), one type II thioesterase (TtmT), five proteins for methoxymalonyl-S-acyl carrier protein biosynthesis (Ttm-ABCDE), eight proteins for dialkylmaleic anhydride biosynthesis and regulation (TtmKLMNOPRS), as well as two additional regulatory proteins (TtmF and TtmQ) and one tailoring enzyme (TtmG). A model for TTM biosynthesis is proposed based on functional assignments from sequence analysis, which agrees well with previous feeding experiments, and has been further supported by in vivo gene inactivation experiments. These findings set the stage to fully investigate TTM biosynthesis and to biosynthetically engineer new TTM analogs."

https://openalex.org/W2143038903,"Multiple pathways link expression of PTR2, the transporter of di- and tripeptides in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to the availability and quality of nitrogen sources. Previous work has shown that induction of PTR2 by extracellular amino acids requires, in particular, SSY1 and PTR3. SSY1 is structurally similar to amino acid transporters but functions as a sensor of amino acids. PTR3 acts downstream of SSY1. Expression of the PTR2 peptide transporter is induced not only by amino acids but also by dipeptides with destabilizing N-terminal residues. These dipeptides bind to UBR1, the ubiquitin ligase of the N-end rule pathway, and allosterically accelerate the UBR1-dependent degradation of CUP9, a transcriptional repressor of PTR2. UBR1 targets CUP9 through its internal degron. Here we demonstrate that the repression of PTR2 by CUP9 requires TUP1 and SSN6, the corepressor proteins that form a complex with CUP9. We also show that the induction of PTR2 by amino acids is mediated by the UBR1-dependent acceleration of CUP9 degradation that requires both SSY1 and PTR3. The acceleration of CUP9 degradation is shown to be attained without increasing the activity of the N-end rule pathway toward substrates with destabilizing N-terminal residues. We also found that GAP1, a general amino acid transporter, strongly contributes to the induction of PTR2 by Trp. Although several aspects of this complex circuit remain to be understood, our findings establish new functional links between the amino acids-sensing SPS system, the CUP9-TUP1-SSN6 repressor complex, the PTR2 peptide transporter, and the UBR1-dependent N-end rule pathway. Multiple pathways link expression of PTR2, the transporter of di- and tripeptides in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to the availability and quality of nitrogen sources. Previous work has shown that induction of PTR2 by extracellular amino acids requires, in particular, SSY1 and PTR3. SSY1 is structurally similar to amino acid transporters but functions as a sensor of amino acids. PTR3 acts downstream of SSY1. Expression of the PTR2 peptide transporter is induced not only by amino acids but also by dipeptides with destabilizing N-terminal residues. These dipeptides bind to UBR1, the ubiquitin ligase of the N-end rule pathway, and allosterically accelerate the UBR1-dependent degradation of CUP9, a transcriptional repressor of PTR2. UBR1 targets CUP9 through its internal degron. Here we demonstrate that the repression of PTR2 by CUP9 requires TUP1 and SSN6, the corepressor proteins that form a complex with CUP9. We also show that the induction of PTR2 by amino acids is mediated by the UBR1-dependent acceleration of CUP9 degradation that requires both SSY1 and PTR3. The acceleration of CUP9 degradation is shown to be attained without increasing the activity of the N-end rule pathway toward substrates with destabilizing N-terminal residues. We also found that GAP1, a general amino acid transporter, strongly contributes to the induction of PTR2 by Trp. Although several aspects of this complex circuit remain to be understood, our findings establish new functional links between the amino acids-sensing SPS system, the CUP9-TUP1-SSN6 repressor complex, the PTR2 peptide transporter, and the UBR1-dependent N-end rule pathway. Biological processes addressed by this study include the mechanisms and regulation of peptide import. Peptides can serve as a source of amino acids and nitrogen in all organisms. The import of di- and tripeptides (di/tripeptides) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to be regulated by the N-end rule pathway, one proteolytic pathway of the ubiquitin (Ub) 4The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; βgal, β-galactosidase; UPR, Ub-protein-reference. -proteasome system (1Byrd C.

The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue (reviewed in Refs. 5Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In eukaryotes, this pathway recognizes several kinds of degradation signals (degrons), including a set called N-degrons (5Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 6Mogk A. Schmidt R. Bukau B.

The determinants of an N-degron in a substrate protein are a destabilizing N-terminal residue that bears the unmodified N-terminal amino group, a substrate's internal Lys residue (the site of formation of a poly-Ub chain), and a nearby conformationally disordered region (11Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki T. Varshavsky A.

The N-end rule has a hierarchic structure. In eukaryotes, N-terminal Asn and Gln are tertiary destabilizing residues in that they function through their enzymatic deamidation, to yield the secondary destabilizing N-terminal residues Asp and Glu (Ref. 7Tasaki T. Kwon Y.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 520-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, and references therein). Destabilizing activity of N-terminal Asp and Glu requires their conjugation to Arg, one of the primary destabilizing residues, by the ATE1-encoded Arg-tRNA-protein transferase (arginyl-transferase or R-transferase) (14Kwon Y.T.

In mammals and other eukaryotes that produce nitric oxide (NO), the set of arginylated residues contains not only Asp and Glu but also N-terminal Cys, which is arginylated after its oxidation to Cys-sulfinate or Cys-sulfonate (14Kwon Y.T. Kashina A.S. Davydov I.V. Hu R.-G. An J.Y. Seo J.W. Du F. Varshavsky A. Science. 2002; 297: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The in vivo oxidation of N-terminal Cys requires NO, as well as oxygen (O2) or its derivatives (15Hu R.-G. Sheng J. Xin Q. Xu Z. Takahashi T.T. Varshavsky A. Nature. 2005; 437: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 18Lee M.J. Tasaki T. Moroi K. An J.Y. Kimura S. Davydov I.V. Kwon Y.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The N-end rule pathway is thus a sensor of NO, through the ability of this pathway to destroy proteins with N-terminal Cys, at rates controlled by NO, O2, and their derivatives. E3 Ub ligases of the N-end rule pathway are called N-recognins (7Tasaki T. Kwon Y.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 520-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Xia Z. Webster A. Du F. Piatkov K. Ghislain M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

(The term “Ub ligase” denotes either an E2–E3 holoenzyme or its E3 component.) At least four N-recognins, including UBR1, mediate the N-end rule pathway in mammals and other multicellular eukaryotes (7Tasaki T. Kwon Y.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 520-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The known N-recognins share a ∼70-residue motif called the UBR box. Mouse UBR1 and UBR2 are sequelogous (similar in sequence) 200-kDa RING-type E3 Ub ligases that are 47% identical. Several other mammalian N-recognins, either confirmed or putative ones, are HECT-type or SCF-type Ub ligases that share the UBR motif with the RING-type UBR1 and UBR2 but are largely nonsequelogous to them otherwise (20Tasaki T. Mulder L.C.F. Iwamatsu A. Lee M.J. Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. Muesing M. Kwon Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7120-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 21Tasaki T. Sohr R. Xia Z.

Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R181-R183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Besides their usefulness as separate terms for sequence and spatial similarities, the rigor-conferring advantage of sequelog and spalog is their evolutionary neutrality, in contrast to interpretation-laden terms such as “homolog,” “ortholog,” and “paralog.” The latter terms are compatible with the sequelog/spalog terminology and can be used to convey understanding about functions and common descent, if this (additional) information is available. The functions of the N-end rule pathway include: (i) the sensing of heme, owing to inhibition, in both yeast and mammals, of the ATE1 R-transferase by hemin (Fe3+-heme), which also inhibits N-recognins, the latter at least in yeast; (ii) the sensing of NO and O2, and the resulting control of signaling by transmembrane receptors, through the conditional, NO/O2-mediated degradation of G-protein regulators RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16; (iii) regulation of import of short peptides, through the degradation, modulated by peptides, of CUP9, the repressor of import; (iv) fidelity of chromosome segregation, through degradation of a separase-produced cohesin fragment; (v) regulation of apoptosis, through degradation of a caspase-processed inhibitor of apoptosis; (vi) a multitude of processes mediated by the transcription factor c-FOS, a conditional substrate of the N-end rule pathway; (vii) regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus replication cycle, through degradation of human immunodeficiency virus integrase; and (viii) regulation of meiosis, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiovascular development in mammals, and leaf senescence in plants (Refs. 2Du F.

Mutations in human UBR1, one of the E3s of the N-end rule pathway, are the cause of Johansson-Blizzard syndrome, which comprises mental retardation, physical malformations, and severe pancreatitis (26Zenker M. Mayerle J. Lerch M.M. Tagariello A. Zerres K. Durie P.R. Beier M. Hülskamp G. Guzman C. Rehder H. Beemer F.A. Hamel B. Vanlieferinghen P. Gershoni-Baruch R. Vieira M.W. Dumic M. Auslender R.

The N-end rule pathway of S. cerevisiae is mediated by a single N-recognin, UBR1, a 225-kDa sequelog of mammalian UBR1 and UBR2 (2Du F. Navarro-Garcia F. Xia Z. Tasaki T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14110-14115Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Xia Z. Webster A. Du F. Piatkov K. Ghislain M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

S. cerevisiae UBR1 contains at least three substrate-binding sites. The type-1 site is specific for basic N-terminal residues of polypeptides (Arg, Lys, and His). The type-2 site is specific for bulky hydrophobic N-terminal residues (Trp, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Ile). The third binding site of UBR1 recognizes an internal (non-N-terminal) degron in target proteins. The third binding site of UBR1 is autoinhibited but can be allosterically activated through a conformational change that is caused by the binding of short peptides, such as dipeptides, to the other, type-1 and type-2, binding sites of UBR1. The known substrate of the third binding site of UBR1 is CUP9 (1Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Du F. Navarro-Garcia F. Xia Z.

Nature. 2000; 405: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), a homeodomain protein and transcriptional regulator, largely a repressor, of more than 30 genes in S. cerevisiae. 6C. S. Hwang and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data. The regulon of CUP9 includes PTR2, a gene encoding the main transporter of di/tripeptides (28Cai H. Hauser M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Cai H. Kauffman S. Naider F. Becker J.M. Genetics. 2006; 172: 1459-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reversal of UBR1 autoinhibition by imported di/tripeptides with destabilizing N-terminal residues accelerates the UBR1-dependent ubiquitylation of CUP9, leads to its faster degradation, and thereby causes a derepression of PTR2. The resulting positive-feedback circuit allows S. cerevisiae to detect the presence of extracellular peptides and to react by increasing their uptake (2Du F. Navarro-Garcia F. Xia Z. Tasaki T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14110-14115Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 3Turner G.C. Du F. Varshavsky A. Nature. 2000; 405: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The evolution of peptide-import circuits is under conflicting selective pressures, because the ability of a cell to import peptides confers both a benefit (utilization of peptides as food) and a vulnerability to toxins that resemble short peptides. Although PTR2 is the major transporter of di/tripeptides in S. cerevisiae, some di/tripeptides can also be imported (with a low efficacy) by DAL5, whose major function is the import of other nitrogen sources, such as allantoate and ureidosuccinate (4Homann O.R. Cai H. Becker J.M. Lindquist S.L. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: e80Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Another set of S. cerevisiae peptide transporters comprises OPT1 (HGT1) and OPT2, which have partially overlapping functions, do not import di/tripeptides, but can import peptides of 4–5 residues. In addition, OPT1 (HGT1) is a high affinity importer of glutathione, a “noncanonical” tripeptide (Ref 30Wiles A.M. Cai H. Naider F. Becker J.M. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3133-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, and references therein). Similarly to the PTR2 transporter of di/tripeptides, the expression of OTP2 is down-regulated by CUP9, whereas the expression of OPT1 (HGT1) is independent of CUP9 (30Wiles A.M. Cai H. Naider F. Becker J.M. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3133-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition to PTR2 and OPT2, the N-end rule pathway also controls the expression of DAL5, but in a manner opposite to that of the other two transporters: whereas CUP9 is a transcriptional repressor of PTR2 and OPT2, CUP9 apparently up-regulates the expression of DAL5 (28Cai H. Hauser M. Naider F. Becker J.M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1805-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Wiles A.M. Cai H. Naider F. Becker J.M. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 3133-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether CUP9 down-regulates a repressor of DAL5 or whether CUP9 acts, in the context of DAL5, as a transcriptional activator. The induction of the PTR2 peptide transporter by di/tripeptides, a process controlled by the UBR1-CUP9 circuit (3Turner G.C. Du F. Varshavsky A. Nature. 2000; 405: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), is just one of regulatory inputs that couple PTR2 expression to the availability and quality of nutrients. For example, PTR2 expression is down-regulated by certain nitrogen sources, including ammonia, but not by other nitrogen sources, such as urea and allantoin (31Godard P. Urrestarazu A. Vissers S. Kontos K. Bontempi G. van Helden J. André B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3065-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The underlying systems, including the N-end rule pathway, ensure that a cell does not waste resources synthesizing large amounts of the PTR2 transporter in the absence of extracellular peptides, or when a more efficacious nitrogen source, such as ammonia, is present. PTR2 is also induced by extracellular amino acids, particularly leucine or tryptophan (32Island M.D. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This response is likely to be adaptive in natural habitats, because the amino acids that S. cerevisiae (a scavenging heterotroph) encounters outside the laboratory tend to be the breakdown products of peptides and thus signify a likely presence of di/tripeptides. In addition, it has not been precluded that the S. cerevisiae PTR2 transporter might itself import amino acids, in addition to peptides. For example, AtPTR2 and AtCHL1, members of the PTR2 family in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, transport histidine and nitrate, respectively (Ref. 33Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Rentsch D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, and references therein). Either of the above possibilities may underlie the fact that amino acids regulate PTR2 expression. Extracellular amino acids regulate PTR2 through the SPS (SSY1-PTR3-SSY5) pathway (34Andréasson C. Heessen S. Ljungdahl P.O.

SSY1, an integral membrane protein and a sensor of amino acids, is a sequelog of amino acid transporters but does not function as a transporter (36Wu B. Ottow K. Poulsen P. Gaber R.F. Albers E.

Both the inferred design of SSY1 and experimental evidence suggest that it is the concentration ratio of an amino acid across the plasma membrane, rather than the absolute concentration of extracellular amino acid that determines the signaling output by SSY1 (36Wu B. Ottow K. Poulsen P. Gaber R.F. Albers E. Kielland-Brandt M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Activated SSY1 induces expression of a regulon that includes the PTR2 peptide transporter and amino acid transporters such as AGP1, BAP2, BAP3, TAT1, TAT2, and GNP1 (38Fosberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Curr. Genet. 2001; 40: 91-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). PTR3 and SSY5 are peripheral membrane proteins associated with SSY1 (41Klasson H. Fink G.R. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5405-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). SSY5 is a protease regulated, in particular, by PTR3. SSY5 can cleave, and thereby activate, the latent (conditionally cytosolic) transcriptional activators STP1 and STP2, leading to their import into the nucleus and the induction of genes that encode, in particular, amino acid transporters (34Andréasson C.

In the present work, we show that an extracellular amino acid such as Trp acts via the SPS system to induce the PTR2-mediated import of di/tripeptides through the acceleration of degradation of CUP9 (the repressor of import) by the UBR1-dependent N-end rule pathway. The bulk of this effect of Trp on the rate of CUP9 degradation requires both SSY1 and PTR3. At the same time, no significant activation of the N-end rule pathway toward substrates with destabilizing N-terminal residues (i.e. toward substrates with N-degrons) was observed under these conditions, suggesting a differential regulation of three substrate-binding sites of the UBR1 Ub ligase. We also show that the repression of PTR2 by CUP9 requires the global corepressors TUP1 and SSN6, and that GAP1, a general amino acid transporter, strongly contributes to the induction of PTR2 by Trp. Although several aspects of this complex circuit remain to be understood, our findings establish new functional links between the amino acids-sensing SPS system, the CUP9-TUP1-SSN6 repressor complex, the PTR2 peptide transporter, and the UBR1-dependent N-end rule pathway. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Genetic Techniques—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table 1. AVY24 and AVY25 were constructed in the background of strain RJD347 (MATα ura3–52; a gift from Dr. R. Deshaies, California Institute of Technology). A PCR-based deletion strategy (44Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) was employed, using DNA fragments encoding the myc3-URA3-myc3 cassette to precisely delete SSY1 and PTR3 open reading frames (myc3 denotes 3 repeats of a nucleotide sequence encoding the myc epitope, flanked on either side by 50 bp of sequences identical to the sequences of either the SSY1 or the PTR3 gene, respectively). This technique was employed to produce deletions of the SSY1 and PTR3 open reading frames. We then selected for recombination within the myc3-URA3-myc3 module using 5-fluoroorotic acid, to produce strains AVY27 (MATα ura3–52 ssy1Δ::myc3) and AVY28 (MATα ura3–52 ptr3Δ::myc3), and verified the identity of these strains by Southern hybridization (data not shown). AVY26 (MATα ura3–52 ubr1Δ::HisG) was also a derivative of RJD347 (Table 1). It was constructed using the same PCR-based deletion strategy (44Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), except that a HisG-URA3-HisG cassette (see below) was used. Strains AVY30 (MATα leu2–3,112 ubr1Δ::LEU2), AVY31 (MATα leu2–3,112 cup9Δ::LEU2), and AVY32 (MATα LEU2) (Table 1) were derivatives of RJD350 (MATα leu2–3,112) (a gift from Dr. R.

https://openalex.org/W1971860749,"Iron-sulfur proteins play indispensable roles in a broad range of biochemical processes. The biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins is a complex process that has become a subject of extensive research. The final step of iron-sulfur protein assembly involves transfer of an iron-sulfur cluster from a cluster-donor to a cluster-acceptor protein. This process is facilitated by a specialized chaperone system, which consists of a molecular chaperone from the Hsc70 family and a co-chaperone of the J-domain family. The 3.0Å crystal structure of a human mitochondrial J-type co-chaperone HscB revealed an L-shaped protein that resembles Escherichia coli HscB. The important difference between the two homologs is the presence of an auxiliary metal-binding domain at the N terminus of human HscB that coordinates a metal via the tetracysteine consensus motif CWXCX9–13FCXXCXXXQ. The domain is found in HscB homologs from animals and plants as well as in magnetotactic bacteria. The metal-binding site of the domain is structurally similar to that of rubredoxin and several zinc finger proteins containing rubredoxin-like knuckles. The normal mode analysis of HscB revealed that this L-shaped protein preferentially undergoes a scissors-like motion that correlates well with the conformational changes of human HscB observed in the crystals.

Iron-sulfur proteins are a ubiquitous class of proteins that play essential roles in a wide range of biochemical processes in the cell (1Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). The unique characteristic of these proteins is that they harbor a distinctive class of prosthetic groups: the ironsulfur clusters formed from multiple iron and sulfide ions. The most common iron-sulfur clusters are tetranuclear [4Fe-4S]2+,+ and binuclear [2Fe-2S]2+,+. Usually, the clusters are attached to proteins by four cysteine residues, although in several cases other residue types have been as ligands (2Meyer J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2008; 13: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Many iron-sulfur proteins are considered to be evolutionarily ancient because they play important roles in some of the most fundamental biological pathways and processes (1Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). These processes include electron transfers in respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains, nitrogen fixation, and biosynthesis of coenzymes. In addition, iron-sulfur proteins can function as initiators of radical chemistry, as iron and/or iron-sulfur cluster storage proteins, as sensors of cellular iron levels, as sensors of oxygen levels involved in gene regulation of the aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathways, or as sulfur donors (1Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 3Rouault T.A. Tong W.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The functions of iron-sulfur proteins have been studied extensively for decades, but the mechanism and control of their biogenesis has started to be elucidated only recently (5Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 6Vickery L.E. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 95-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Three types of systems involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters and maturation of iron-sulfur cluster proteins have been identified so far. These include the nif system of nitrogen fixing bacteria involved in maturation of nitrogenase (7Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the suf (sulfur utilization factor) system that plays a significant role during iron and/or sulfur starvation and under oxidative stress conditions (8Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 9Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tokumoto U. Kitamura S. Fukuyama K. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem.

Nakamura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the genes of the isc pathway are organized into an operon that encodes a regulatory protein IscR, a cysteine desulfurase IscS, a scaffold protein for iron-sulfur cluster preassembly IscU, an alternate scaffold and/or iron-binding protein IscA, a J-type co-chaperone HscB, Hsp70-class chaperone HscA, and ferredoxin Fdx (11Takahashi Y.

Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and countless ferredoxin structures. The current model of the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins in bacteria proposes two major steps. First, the iron-sulfur cluster is assembled on a scaffold protein (IscU) in a series of reactions facilitated by IscS and an iron donor protein (25Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 26Ding H. Clark R.J. Ding B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the next step, the preformed iron-sulfur cluster is transferred to the acceptor apo-protein (28Muhlenhoff U. Gerber J. Richhardt N. Lill R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The transfer is facilitated by a specialized molecular chaperone system that consists of a chaperone from the Hsp70 family, HscA, and a J-type co-chaperone, HscB (29Chandramouli K. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11087-11095Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The co-chaperone HscB assists in delivery of IscU to HscA and enhances the intrinsic ATPase activity of the chaperone (30Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 31Silberg J.J. Tapley T.L. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53924-53931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The chaperone HscA specifically binds a conserved motif in the iron-sulfur scaffold protein IscU (24Cupp-Vickery J.R. Peterson J.C. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27353-27359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism of iron-sulfur cluster transfer has not been fully elucidated, it has been suggested that the chaperones facilitate cluster delivery to an acceptor apoprotein by destabilization of the IscU·[FeS] complex (6Vickery L.E. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 42: 95-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The isc biosynthetic pathway has been also described in fungi and higher eukaryotes. The biosynthesis of iron-sulfur proteins in eukaryotes is, however, less understood than in bacteria (5Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 133-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Here we present the x-ray structure of human co-chaperone protein HscB (hHscB) 2The abbreviations used are: hHscB, human HscB; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). 2The abbreviations used are: hHscB, human HscB; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). (Ref. 33Sun G. Gargus J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 48: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; UniProt ID HSC20_HUMAN) at 3.0 Å resolution. The overall architecture of hHscB resembles that of its E. coli homolog (with 29% sequence identity); however, comparison of the two structures revealed some important differences. Most notably, hHscB possesses a novel metal-binding domain at the N terminus. This domain, which is conserved in HscB homologs from many eukaryotic species, uses a tetracysteine motif situated in the two rubredoxin knuckles to bind a metal ion. Human HscB, which had <30% overall sequence identity to any structure in the Protein Data Bank at the time of its selection and deposition, was chosen as a “sequence-to-structure” target under the National Institutes of Health Protein Structure Initiative. Expression and Purification of hHscB Constructs—Bioinformatic analysis of the hHscB sequence suggested that residues 1–21 comprise a signal peptide whose presence was expected for a mitochondrial protein. To maximize the chances for success, a series of truncation constructs were prepared from the cDNA encoding hHscB: Δ(1–21)HscB (internal Centre for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics ID go.91294), Δ(1–29)HscB (go.91296), and Δ(1–35)HscB (go.91297). The cDNA encoding these constructs was cloned, and selenomethionine-labeled proteins were expressed and purified following the standard Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics pipeline protocols for cloning, protein expression, protein purification, and overall bioinformatics management (34Jeon W.B.

Rayment I. Ulrich E.L. Volkman B.F. Markley J.L. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2003; 4: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, truncated cDNAs were amplified by two-step PCR and cloned into pVP16, a custom plasmid derived from pQE80 (Qiagen). Δ(1–26)HscB (go.91295) failed at the PCR stage. All other targets proceeded through successful protein purification. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli B834 p(lacI+RARE) cells using 2 liters of auto-induction medium (38Blommel P.G. Becker K.J. Duvnjak P. Fox B.G. Biotechnol. Prog. 2007; 23: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Upon sonication of the harvested cells, the protein in the supernatant was purified by immobilized nickel affinity chromatography, and TEV protease was used to cleave the affinity/solubility tag consisting of His8 maltose-binding protein. After tag capture by subtractive nickel affinity chromatography and a final desalting step, the proteins were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and dialyzed against the protein buffer (50 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 0.3 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 5 mm bis-Tris, pH 7.0). Protein aliquots were then drop frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 193 K. Protein purifications resulted in ∼30.0 mg of protein with ∼89% selenomethionine incorporation for all constructs. All three purified samples had the same light green color and similar metal analysis results (∼0.3 mol of nickel and ∼0.2 mol of zinc ions/mol of protein). Crystallization and Data Collection—Protein samples were screened against commercial (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and custom solutions in microplate format and imaged with a CrystalFarm (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI). The best crystals from initial screening were obtained for Δ(1–29)HscB against 25% polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mm Li2SO4, 100 mm PIPES, pH 6.5 at 293 K. The best optimized crystals of Δ(1–29)HscB were obtained at 293 K by the hanging drop method from a 10 mg ml-1 protein solution in the protein buffer mixed with an equal amount of well solution containing 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm Li2SO4, 100 PIPES, pH 6.5. Crystals were cryoprotected at 293 K by soaking in four steps in solutions containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm Li2SO4, 100 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, and 0, 7, 14, and 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, respectively. Cryoprotected crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. After extensive synchrotron screening of tiny (<50 μm in the largest dimension) and poorly diffracting crystals, the diffraction data were collected from the best specimen with a diffraction limit of about 3 Å. The data set was collected near the selenium K absorption edge (0.97934 Å; 12,660 eV) at the General Medicine and Cancer Institutes Collaborative Access Team 23-ID-D beamline at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. The diffraction images were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). Structure Solution—The selenium substructure of selenomethionine-labeled Δ(1–29)HscB crystals was determined by using HySS (40Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1966-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and ShelxD (41Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80188) Google Scholar). The programs identified 10 consensus anomalous sites, which suggested the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was phased automatically and density-modified by using autoSHARP (42de la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) with the help of auxiliary programs from the CCP4 suite (43Collaborative Computational Project Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). Inspection of the experimental electron density map at this stage revealed several recognizable helices organized into helix bundles. A model of bacterial HscB (23Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1fpo) was manually placed into the electron density map. Inspection of the crystal packing that resulted from placement of the first molecule confirmed that a second molecule had to be present in the asymmetric unit to bridge the disconnected layers formed by the first molecule and its symmetry mates. However, no additional recognizable features were present in the map to guide placement of the second molecule in the asymmetric unit. Therefore ShelxC, ShelxD, and ShelxE programs (41Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80188) Google Scholar) were used to attempt an independent phasing. The resulting electron density map showed (marginal) additional features that allowed the second molecule of E. coli HscB to be placed into the asymmetric unit. The angle between the two helical bundle domains of the L-shaped HscB molecule had to be adjusted to obtain a satisfactory fit. The initial model of the asymmetric unit obtained from this procedure was rigid body refined and was used in additional model mask-guided density modification trials as implemented in the density improvement strategy of autoSHARP. This approach resulted in higher quality experimental electron density maps that allowed for more reliable model building. The structure was completed with multiple cycles of iterative manual building in Coot (44Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar), refinement in REFMAC5 (45Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13818) Google Scholar), and model mask constrained density modification in autoSHARP. All of the refinement steps were monitored using an Rfree value based on 8.1% of the independent reflections. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed using MOLPROBITY (46Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3817) Google Scholar). The figures were prepared using PyMOL (47DeLano W.L. The PYMOL Molecular Graphic System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Normal Mode Analysis—Normal mode analysis is a computational technique used to predict the preferred directions of flexibility of protein structures (48Brooks B. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6571-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 49Go N. Noguti T. Nishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3696-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 50Tama F. Brooks C.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The technique is based on the assumption that the native state is the minimum energy configuration and that the potential around it can be approximated by a quadratic function. Given a potential energy model of intramolecular interactions, the second derivative (Hessian) matrix gives the shape of the quadratic energy well around the native state. Diagonalization of the Hessian matrix yields the normal modes of deformation (eigenvectors) and the corresponding harmonic frequencies (square roots of the eigen values). The contribution of each mode to the total flexibility is proportional to the reciprocal of the frequency, because the lowest frequency modes represent the largest, most global deformations. Different models may be used to define the potential, ranging from complicated chemical force fields to simple models based on distances within the protein structure, known as elastic network models (51Tirion M.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 77: 1905-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). In the latter class of models, atoms or residues within a certain distance of each other are connected by linear (Hookean) spring potentials. Recently our group had proposed a residue level model, called the distance network model, that defines interactions between two residues based on distances between atoms from the respective residues (52Kondrashov D.A. Van Wynsberghe A.W. Bannen R.M. Cui Q. Phillips Jr., G.N. Structure. 2007; 15: 169-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this model, atomic contacts at different distances are given different weights (spring constants) and are then added together to form the total Hessian. In our implementation of the algorithm, the Hessian matrix is calculated using an in-house Perl script, and MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) is used to diagonalize the Hessian matrix of the system and analyze the normal modes. Normal modes were computed for chain A of hHscB (Protein Data Bank code 3bvo). The conformational differences between chains A and B of hHscB were compared with the deformations predicted by the lowest frequency normal modes. Dot products were computed between the low frequency modes and the difference vector between the Cα coordinates of monomers A and B. The dot product, defined below, is equivalent to a linear (Spearman) correlation, and its square represents the fraction of variance in the data (conformational change, v) captured by the prediction (normal mode, u). C=v→⋅u→∥v→∥∥u→∥(Eq. 1) The comparison had to be restricted to a subset of the residues for which coordinates were available in both chains A and B, specifically residues 40–46, 53–143, and 156–234. Because the normal mode vectors were effectively restricted (projected) to a subspace of the total normal mode space, they no longer formed an orthonormal basis set. Although the square dot product with each normal mode still measures the accuracy of prediction, the total sum of the dot products may exceed one. This means that the sum of the square dot products slightly overestimates the fraction of the overall variation of the conformational change represented by those normal modes. Structure Quality—The mature recombinant human co-chaperone Δ(1–21)HscB did not yield diffraction quality crystals from our crystallization screens. Therefore we cloned and expressed additional N-terminal truncation constructs and tested them in further crystallization trials. The N-terminal truncated version Δ(1–29)HscB (from now on referred to as hHscB) yielded diffraction quality crystals that supported the structure determination. A single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method (53Rice L.M. Earnest T.N. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1413-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was used to phase the 3.0 Å diffraction data set collected from a crystal of selenomethionine-labeled hHscB near the selenium K absorption edge. The structure was refined to a crystallographic R factor of 23.6% and free R factor of 28.8%. Details of data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. hHscB crystallized in space group P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final electron density map corresponding to molecule A of the hHscB model, which was of a quality expected for a ∼3 Å map (Fig. 1a), supported the building of a continuous polypeptide chain. However, two segments of molecule A (residues 48–53 and 148–159) had a markedly lower map quality. In fact, residue Asp54 of molecule A could not be modeled satisfactorily and remained an outlier in the Ramachandran plot. The final electron density map corresponding to molecule B of the hHscB model was of much lower quality, and several segments could not be modeled at all. The final model of hHscB therefore consists of residues 39–235 for molecule A and residues 40–46, 53–143, and 153–234 for molecule B. Residues not resolved in the electron density map were not modeled. Medium noncrystallographic symmetry constrains, as defined in the standard refinement protocol of Refmac5, were applied during the model refinement to two segments spanning residues 40–143 and 157–234.TABLE 1Crystal parameters, x-ray data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsPeakSpace groupP21Unit cell parameters (Å, °)a = 63.6, b = 32.8, c = 114.4, β = 105.2Data collection statisticsWavelength (Å)0.97934Energy (eV)12,660Resolution range (Å)44.75–3.00 (3.11–3.00)No. of reflections (measured/unique)aThe values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell61747/9770Completeness (%)96.7 (79.8)RmergebRmerge = ΣhΣi|Ii(h) – 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the intensity of an individual measurement of the reflection, and 〈I(h)〉 is the mean intensity of the reflection0.086 (0.342)Redundancy6.3 (4.3)Mean I/sigma(I)10.0 (3.0)Phasing statisticscPhasing by SHARP in 36.78–3.00 Å resolution rangePhasing power (isomorphous/anomalous)0.0/1.37Mean FOM (centric/acentric)0.09/0.285Rcullis (isomorphous/anomalous)0.0/0.736Refinement and model statisticsResolution range44.75–3.00 (2.15–2.10)No. of reflections (total/test)9242/753RcrystdRcryst = Σh|Fobs| – |Fcalc|/Σh|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectively0.236 (0.264)RfreeeRfree was calculated as Rcryst using ∼8.1% of the randomly selected unique reflections that were omitted from structure refinement0.288 (0.386)Root mean square deviation bonds (Å)0.008Root mean square deviation angles (°)1.047ESU from Rfree (Å)0.542TLS groups (residue range)A39–A70, A71–A147, A148–A158, A159–A235 B40–B70, B71–B143, B158–B234B factor - Wilson (Å2)75.5Average B factor – molecule A/B (Å2)72.4/72.8No. of protein molecules/all atoms2/3103No. of waters/zinc(II)/sulfates0/2/1Ramachandran Plot by MOLPROBITY (%)Favored regions95.1Additional allowed regions4.6Outliers0.3 (Asp-A54)Protein Data Bank code3bvoa The values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shellb Rmerge = ΣhΣi|Ii(h) – 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the intensity of an individual measurement of the reflection, and 〈I(h)〉 is the mean intensity of the reflectionc Phasing by SHARP in 36.78–3.00 Å resolution ranged Rcryst = Σh|Fobs| – |Fcalc|/Σh|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure-factor amplitudes, respectivelye Rfree was calculated as Rcryst using ∼8.1% of the randomly selected unique reflections that were omitted from structure refinement Open table in a new tab Similarities and Differences between E. coli and Human HscB—The phase improvement and subsequent building of the hHscB model was guided by the structure of E. coli HscB (23Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1fpo; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The two proteins show 29% sequence identity in the aligned regions and share the same overall fold (Fig. 1b). The most notable difference between the structures is that in addition to domains homologous to the J- and C-domains of E. coli HscB, hHscB possesses a novel N-terminal domain (the N-domain) capable of binding a metal ion (Fig. 1b, metal shown as a red sphere). The second important difference is related to the relative orientations of the J- and C-domain in these molecules. This subject will be treated in detail after the comprehensive description of the structure of hHscB. The N-Domain of hHsbB Possesses a Tetracysteine Metal-binding Motif—The structure of hHscB can be divided into three topologically distinct domains, the N-domain (residues 39–71), the J-domain (residues 72–145), and the C-domain (residues 156–235; Fig. 1b). The N-domain, which lacks any recognizable secondary structure elements, forms a small globular domain that harbors a metal-binding site. The metal atom is coordinated by a set of four cysteine residues Cys41, Cys44, Cys58, and Cys61 (Fig. 2a, inset, blue sticks) located on the two apposed β-hairpins.

https://openalex.org/W2080563217,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; however, the exact role of TNF signaling in the colon epithelium remains unclear. We demonstrate that TNF activation of TNF receptor (R)1 stimulates both pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in the colon epithelium; however, TNFR1 protects against colon epithelial cell apoptosis following TNF exposure. To investigate anti-apoptotic signaling pathways downstream of TNFR1, we generated an intestinal epithelium-specific Raf knock-out mouse and identified Raf kinase as a key regulator of colon epithelial cell survival in response to TNF. Surprisingly, Raf promotes NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylation, independent of MEK signaling, to support cell survival. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel pathway in which Raf promotes colon epithelial cell survival through NF-kappaB downstream of TNFR1 activation. Thus, further understanding of colon epithelial cell-specific TNFR signaling may result in the identification of new targets for inflammatory bowel disease treatment and define novel mediators of colitis-associated cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1988425997,"Previous studies have suggested that the mdmX gene is constitutively transcribed, and that MdmX protein activity is instead controlled by cellular localization and DNA damage induced Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination leading to proteasomal degradation. In these studies, we report that the human mdmX (hdmX) mRNA is reproducibly decreased in various human cell lines following treatment with various DNA-damaging agents. Repression of hdmX transcripts is observed in DNA-damaged HCT116 colon cancer cells and in isogenic p53(-/-) cells, suggesting that this effect is p53-independent. Reduction in the amount of hdmX transcript occurs in both human tumor cell lines and primary human diploid fibroblasts, and results in a significant reduction of HdmX protein. Examination of hdmX promoter activity suggests that damage-induced repression of hdmX mRNA is not significantly impacted by transcription initiation. In contrast, changes in hdmX mRNA splicing appear to partly explain the reduction in full-length hdmX mRNA levels in tumor cell lines with the destabilization of full-length hdmX transcripts, potentially through microRNA miR-34a regulation, also impacting transcript levels. Taken together, this study uncovers previously unrecognized cellular mechanisms by which hdmX mRNA levels are kept low following genotoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2161455758,"Glucocorticoids are anti-inflammatory steroids with important applications in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Endogenous glucocorticoids are mainly produced by the adrenal glands, although there is increasing evidence for extra-adrenal sources. Recent findings show that intestinal crypt cells produce glucocorticoids, which contribute to the maintenance of intestinal immune homeostasis. Intestinal glucocorticoid synthesis is critically regulated by the transcription factor liver receptor homologue-1 (LRH-1). As expression of steroidogenic enzymes and LRH-1 is restricted to the proliferating cells of the crypts, we aimed to investigate the role of the cell cycle in the regulation of LRH-1 activity and intestinal glucocorticoid synthesis. We here show that either pharmacological or molecular modulation of cell cycle progression significantly inhibited expression of steroidogenic enzymes and synthesis of glucocorticoids in intestinal epithelial cells. Synchronization of intestinal epithelial cells in the cell cycle revealed that expression of steroidogenic enzymes is preferentially induced at the G(1)/S stage. Differentiation of immature intestinal epithelial cells to mature nonproliferating cells also resulted in reduced expression of steroidogenic enzymes. This cell cycle-related effect on intestinal steroidogenesis was found to be mediated through the regulation of LRH-1 transcriptional activity. This mechanism may restrict intestinal glucocorticoid synthesis to the proliferating cells of the crypts."
https://openalex.org/W2126445356,"Ynt1 is the sole high affinity nitrate transporter of the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. It is highly regulated by the nitrogen source, by being down-regulated in response to glutamine by repression of the YNT1 gene and Ynt1 ubiquitinylation, endocytosis, and vacuolar degradation. On the contrary, we show that nitrogen limitation stabilizes Ynt1 levels at the plasma membrane, requiring phosphorylation of the transporter. We determined that Ser-246 in the central intracellular loop plays a key role in the phosphorylation of Ynt1 and that the nitrogen permease reactivator 1 kinase (Npr1) is necessary for Ynt1 phosphorylation. Abolition of phosphorylation led Ynt1 to the vacuole by a pep12-dependent end4-independent pathway, which is also dependent on ubiquitinylation, whereas Ynt1 protein lacking ubiquitinylation sites does not follow this pathway. We found that, under nitrogen limitation, Ynt1 phosphorylation is essential for rapid induction of nitrate assimilation genes. Our results suggest that, under nitrogen limitation, phosphorylation prevents Ynt1 delivery from the secretion route to the vacuole, which, aided by reduced ubiquitinylation, accumulates Ynt1 at the plasma membrane. This mechanism could be part of the response that allows nitrate-assimilatory organisms to cope with nitrogen depletion."

Interleukin (IL)-24/MDA-7 is a member of the IL-10 gene family, and FISP (IL-4-induced secreted protein), its murine homologue, is selectively expressed and secreted by T helper 2 lymphocytes. A novel splice variant of mouse IL-24/FISP, designated FISP-sp, lacks 29 nucleotides from the 5′-end of exon 4 of FISP. The level of FISP-sp expression is 10% of the level of total primary FISP transcription. Unlike FISP, FISP-sp does not induce growth inhibition and apoptosis.

Alternative splicing is a process occurring in eukaryotes, whereby a pre-mRNA transcribed from one gene can be processed into multiple alternative mature mRNA isoforms, thus leading to the formation of a number of different proteins from a single gene (1Stamm S. Ben-Ari S. Rafalska I. Tang Y. Zhang Z. Toiber D. Thanaraj T.A. Soreq H. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 344: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The number of transcripts generated is mediated by cis-regulatory elements such as the promoter, enhancer, and repressor control. Alternative splicing regulates the structure of transcripts, leading to functional diversification. Transcript variants generated by alternative splicing are often spatially and/or temporally specific, resulting in effects seen only in certain cells or developmental stages (2Kriventseva E.V.

Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). In addition, various studies suggest that alternative splicing is precisely and efficiently regulated to fulfill specific tasks (5Ast G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Hence, the identification and characterization of splicing variants generated in specific spatial, temporal, or stress conditions are likely to increase our understanding of their functional importance.Mouse interleukin 24 (mIL-24), also known as FISP (IL-4-induced secreted protein) was identified by representational difference analysis during the isolation of genes selectively expressed in T helper 2 (Th2) cells (6Schaefer G. Venkataraman C. Schindler U. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5859-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). mIL-24/FISP is a member of the IL-10 family along with IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, and IL-26, and it is selectively expressed in Th2 but not Th1 cells. mIL-24/FISP has significant homology with rat mob-5/c49a (80% to DNA and 69% to protein) and also with the human melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7 (IL-24/MDA-7; 89% to DNA and 93% to protein(7Soo C.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the mIL-24/FISP gene suppresses the growth of hepatoma cells in vivo after being delivered via intramuscular electroporation (14Chen W.Y. Cheng Y.T. Lei H.Y. Chang C.P. Wang C.W. Chang M.S. Genes Immun. 2005; 6: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), suggesting that mIL-24/FISP has anti-tumor activity, and that mIL-24/FISP is truly a homologue of MDA-7.MDA-7S, a splice variant of MDA-7/IL-24, was identified in normal human melanocytes, and the loss of the splice variant expression was associated with metastatic melanoma (15Allen M.

MDA-7S heterodimerizes with MDA-7 but does not influence the progress of MDA-7/IL-24-induced cell death.In this study, we identified a novel splicing variant of mouse IL-24/FISP from an activated Th2 cell clone (D10). The splice variant, designated FISP-sp, lacks 29 bp of exon 4 from FISP, resulting in a frameshift. Thus, FISP-sp mRNA encodes a truncated protein of 158 amino acid residues. Unlike FISP, the cytoplasmic localization of the FISP-sp protein appears to be restricted to the ER. The expression of this novel FISP splice variant is up-regulated under ER stress in normal cells in vivo. In addition, FISP-sp dimerizes with FISP and blocks its secretion. Overexpression of FISP-sp reduces FISP-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in tumor cells. Our results suggest that a novel splicing variant of mouse IL-24, FISP-sp, plays an important role in reducing the FISP-induced ER stress response in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRI Reagent® (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA by reverse transcription using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Quantitative Real Time PCR—A total of 50 ng of cDNA was used for quantitative real time PCR, following the manufacturer's protocol. Primers specific to FISP and FISP-sp are listed in Table 1. Primers for used analysis of GADD genes are as follows: GADD34 (forward) 5′-GAC CCC TCC AAC TCT CCT TC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-CTT CCT CAG CCT CAG CAT TC-3′; GADD45α (forward) 5′-TGG TGA CGA ACC CAC ATT CAT-3′ and (reverse) 5′-ACC CAC TGA TCC ATG TAG CGA C-3′; GADD153 (forward) 5′-ACA GAG GTC ACA CGC ACA TC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GGG CAC TGA CCA CTC TGT TT-3′. The primer pair for mouse L32, used as a control, was (forward) 5′-GCC CAA GAT CGT CAA AAA GA-3′ and (reverse) 5′-ATT GTG GAC CAG GAA CTT GC-3′. Primers were designed to span the intron-exon borders, to allow amplified cDNA to be distinguished from genomic DNA. Quantitative real time PCR using a thermocycler (Bio-Rad) was carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing SYBR Green I master mix (Takara) and 10 pm (each) PCR primers. Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and were then subjected to 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The final extension was for 5 min at 72 °C. The authenticity of the PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analysis. The Opticon Monitor software package 2.0 was used for detection of fluorescent signals and for Tm calculations.

The murine Th2 D10 clone (D10.G4.1) was maintained as described previously (16Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). CD4+ T cells were purified from spleen and lymph nodes of AKR mice by positive selection with anti-CD4 magnetic beads (Dynal) and differentiated under Th2 conditions according to a standard protocol (17Macian F.

All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.Transient Transfection and Reporter Assay—Transient transfections in HEK293 cells were carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To analyze whether FISP is degraded via the proteasome, and to prevent proteasomic degradation, HEK293 cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 (Sigma), a proteasome inhibitor, beginning 24 h after transfection for 12 h. For transfection into EL-4 cells, Metafectene (Biontex) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the transfection of B16F10.9, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and resuspended in Hypo-osmolar Electroporation Buffer (Eppendorf), at a concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots of the cell suspension (400 μl) were transferred into electroporation cuvettes (2-mm gap width). Cells were electroporated with 2 μg of DNA using a Multiporator® (Eppendorf), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To inhibit N-glycosylation and induce ER stress, cells were treated for 4 h with the ER stress inducer tunicamycin (250 ng/ml), beginning 20 h after transfection, for 6 h (19Iwawaki T. Hosoda A. Okuda T. Kamigori Y. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Transient transfections in mouse primary Th2 cells were carried out using Amaxa Nucleofecter Technology (Amaxa), according to manufacturers' instructions. Primary Th2 cells (in aliquots of 2 × 106) were transfected with 4 μg of pXPG vector (20Bert A.G. Burrows J. Osborne C.S. Cockerill P.N. Plasmid. 2000; 44: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) alone or with FISP-Luc, FISP-sp-Luc, or screening-Luc (+29-SP-ΔATG-frame-3-LUC). Six hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin plus 10 nm PMA for 2 h and were either left untreated or were further treated with tunicamycin for 4 h. To assess luciferase activity, cells were collected, and lysates were analyzed using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Co-transfection of 100 ng of the pRL-TK vector (Promega) was used to normalize transfection efficiency, by measuring Renilla luciferase activity.Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—For Western blots, HEK293 cells were harvested and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS). Subsequently, cells were lysed on ice in modified RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 μg/μl pepstatin, 10 μg/μl aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Aliquots containing 30–100 μg of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, using 10–12% polyacrylamide gels, and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran). To detect the secreted forms of protein, cells were cultured for 12 h in serum-free DMEM after 12 h of transfection. Using a Centriprep device with an Ultracel YM-3 (3,000 nominal molecular weight limit) membrane (Millipore), the collected medium (10 ml) was concentrated into 100 μl. To the concentrated supernatant was added 900 μl of ice-cold 100% acetone, and the protein was left to precipitate for 12 h. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and 30 μg of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The following antibodies were employed to detect proteins: anti-HA.11 monoclonal (Covance Research Products), anti-Myc monoclonal, and anti-GFP monoclonal (Molecular Probes), anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-caspase (Abcam), anti-KDEL to detect GRP-78 and GRP-94 (glucose-regulated protein 78 and 94) (StressGen), anti-calreticulin (Abcam), and anti-PDI (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-β-actin monoclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Lab Frontier) antibodies were used for loading controls. For immunoprecipitation analysis, HEK293 cells were harvested in PBS and incubated in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 μg/μl pepstatin, 10 μg/μl aprotinin) for 30 min on a rotary shaker at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, supernatants were incubated with 10 μl of 70% protein A-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h to eliminate nonspecific interactions. Samples were centrifuged and mixed with anti-Myc and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes) and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with 25 μl of 50% protein A-agarose for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed very gently with the immunoprecipitation buffer three times, resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% low fat dry milk in Buffer A (25 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.3)) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were immunoblotted using the anti-HA.11 monoclonal (Covance Research Products) and anti-Myc antibodies for co-immunoprecipitation and the anti-ubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody for the ubiquitination study in 10 ml of Buffer A containing 2% milk for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with Buffer A, the membranes were incubated with mouse IgG TrueBlot™ at a dilution of 1:1000 in buffer containing 2% milk, for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with Buffer A, developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to film. For mass spectrometric analysis, immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained, and the required bands were cut out of the gel and used for further analysis.Digestion of Samples for Micro-LC/LC-MS/MS Analysis—The samples were diluted 5-fold with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) and 8 m urea, then reduced by adding tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride at room temperature for 30 min, and then carboxy-amidomethylated in 10 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Endoproteinase Lys-C (Promega) was added to a final substrate:enzyme ratio of 100:1 and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The Lys-C-digested solution was diluted 4-fold with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) followed by the addition of CaCl2 to 2 mm. Modified trypsin (Promega) was added to a final substrate:enzyme ratio of 100:1. The trypsin digestion was performed by incubating at 37 °C for 14 h.Micro-LC/LC-MS/MS Analysis—A single-phase microcapillary column was constructed with 100-mm inner diameter fused silica capillary tubing pulled to a 5-mm inner diameter tip using a CO2 laser puller (Sutter Instruments, P-2000). The capillary column was packed sequentially with 7.5 cm of 5-mm inner diameter Polaris C18-A (Metachem), 4.5 cm of 5-mm inner diameter Partisphere strong cation exchange (Whatman), followed by another 3.5 cm of Polaris C18-A, using a homemade high pressure column loader. The columns were equilibrated with 5% CAN and 0.1% formic acid solution, and 10–25 mg of protein digests were directly loaded onto the capillary column. The buffer solutions used to separate protein digests were Buffer A (5% ACN and 0.1% formic acid), Buffer B (80% ACN and 0.1% formic acid), and Buffer C (500 mm ammonium acetate, 5% ACN and 0.1% formic acid). Six steps of SCX/RPLC peptide separation were performed. The first step of 120 min consisted of a 95-min gradient from 0 to 100% Buffer B and a 25-min hold at 100% Buffer B. The next five steps of 120 min each were with 55% Buffer B from 15 to 120 min. The Buffer C percentage in step 2 was 5% from 10 to 15 min, and in steps 3–6 were 10, 25, 50, and 100%, respectively, from 5 to 9 min. Peptides eluted from the capillary column were electrosprayed into an LCQ Deca XP Plus IT mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) with the application of a distal 2.4-kV spray voltage. A cycle of one full scan (400–1400 m/z) followed by three data-dependent MS/MS scans at a 35% normalized collision energy was repeated throughout the LC separation. Bioworks (version 3.1) was used to filter the search results, and the following Xcorr values were applied to the variously charged peptides as follows: 1.8 for singly charged peptides, 2.2 for doubly charged peptides, and 3.2 for triply charged peptides.Immunocytochemistry—Both COS-7 and HeLa cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 15 min and permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100. Samples were blocked in PBS containing 10% BSA at 37 °C for 30 min and then incubated in PBS containing the primary antibodies and 3% BSA for 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. The samples were washed six times with PBS and incubated in PBS containing the secondary antibodies and 3% BSA for 45 min at 37 °C. For Golgi staining, cells were washed six times in PBS and then incubated in PBS/Hanks' balanced salt solution containing Golgi-BODIPY TR Ceramide (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on a glass slide, and fluorescence images were acquired using an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a ×40 N.A. 1.0 or ×60 N.A. 1.4 oil lens and a CoolSNAP-Hq CCD camera (Roper Scientific) driven by MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corporation) imaging software. Light from a mercury lamp was shuttered using a VMM1 Uniblitz shutter (Vincent Associates). Analysis and quantification of data were performed using MetaMorph software and Sigmaplot, and data were presented as mean ± S.E. Primary antibodies were as follows: anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-His (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-PDI (Molecular Probes). Secondary antibodies were as follows: Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes), Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes), Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rat (Molecular Probes), and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes).Cell Growth and Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell growth analysis experiments were conducted with exponentially, asynchronously growing cells. B16F10.9 mouse melanoma cells were transfected with vector alone, FISP-myc, FISP-sp-HA alone, or with combinations of vectors. Cell counts were determined using a hemocytometer 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection. For the assessment of cytotoxicity in response to the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, HEK293 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of MG132 (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 μm) for 12 h. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. For cell cycle analysis, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and fixed overnight at –20 °C in 70% ethanol. The cells were treated with RNase A (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min and then with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) (Sigma). The cell cycle was analyzed using an EXPO32 ADC XL4 Color (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer, and data were analyzed with EXPO32 ADC analysis software (Beckman Coulter).Hoechst Staining—B16F10.9 cells were transferred to 6-well plates after electroporation with a clean slide and incubated at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2 for 48 h. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS (pH 7.2) and stained with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst 34580 (Invitrogen) or propidium iodide (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Nuclear morphology was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus).DNA Fragmentation Assay—Nucleosomal DNA degradation was analyzed as described previously (21Lebedeva I.V. Su Z. Chang Y. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 708-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, B16F10.9 mouse melanoma cells were transfected by electroporation with mock vector, FISP, or FISP-sp or were co-transfected and were seeded in 6-well culture dishes. 48 and 72 h post-transfection, cells were harvested (with trypsinization) and then lysed in a solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 25 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with 300 μg/ml proteinase K for 5 h at 65 °C and extracted with phenol/chloroform. The aqueous layer was treated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate; the DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 95% ethanol. After treatment with 100 mg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C, the sample was electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel at 50 V for 2 h and then stained with ethidium bromide.RESULTSIdentification of FISP-sp, a Novel Splicing Variant of Mouse IL-24/FISP—Mouse IL-24/FISP is selectively expressed in Th2 cells (6Schaefer G. Venkataraman C. Schindler U. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5859-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). During cloning of the mIL-24/FISP gene into a mammalian expression vector, we identified a novel splicing variant of FISP, namely FISP-sp. Initially, total RNA and cDNA were prepared from D10 cells (mouse Th2-type clone) and stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h. The cDNA was PCR-amplified using primer sets spanning the coding region of the FISP gene. In addition to the FISP-coding sequence fragment, a slightly smaller sized FISP-coding fragment, FISP-sp, was identified and cloned (Fig. 1A). Sequencing analysis revealed that FISP-sp lacks 29 bp from the 5′-end of the full-length FISP exon 4 gene (Fig. 1B). This alternative splicing occurs at an A(G/G)T site, which is the splice site sequence comprising the major class of AG-GT introns. The entire FISP-sp sequence was deposited in GenBank™ accession number DQ401033. Removal of 29 bp by splicing activity leads to a frameshift, starting at amino acid 116, and a subsequent translation termination because of a newly generated stop codon. The predicted primary structure of FISP-sp contains 158 amino acids, instead of 220 amino acids as in FISP. FISP-sp and FISP share identical amino acid sequences in their first 115 N-terminal amino acids, but FISP-sp has a completely different sequence in its 43 C-terminal amino acids, derived from the frame-shifted translation of the FISP ORF 3 (Fig. 1C).Quantitation of FISP-sp Expression Levels in T Cells—To determine the relative expression levels of FISP-sp and FISP, we performed quantitative real time RT-PCR with four sets of primer pairs (Fig. 2A, and Table 1). Primers were designed to detect sequences that were (i) common to FISP and FISP-sp (set 1; same amplicon size), (ii) FISP-specific (set 2), (iii) FISP-sp-specific (set 3; starting from just before the splicing site and extending to exon 4, and (iv) common to FISP and FISP-sp but yielding different amplicon sizes because of splicing of 29 bases (set 4). As shown in Fig. 2D, RT-PCR using primer set 4 resulted in PCR products of two different amplicons, confirmed by melting curve analysis. This result suggests that two transcript isoforms with different sizes exist in the T cell cDNA library. FISP-sp mRNA levels were found to be about 10% of total FISP mRNA, in both D10 cells (mouse Th2 clone) and primary Th2 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The specificity of the FISP and FISP-sp primer sets was confirmed by DNA sequencing and melting curve analysis (data not shown).FIGURE 2Relative mRNA levels of FISP and FISP-sp in Th2 cells. The mRNA expression levels of FISP and FISP-sp were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR in Th2 D10 cells and in 5-day differentiated primary Th2 cells. In quantitative real time PCR amplification, the normalized reporter signal represents the fluorescence changes adjusted to base-line levels before amplification and the threshold cycle (Ct) of amplified products. A, designed primer sets are as follows: common to FISP and FISP-sp (set 1), FISP (set 2), FISP-sp (set 3), and specific for both FISP and FISP-sp but yielding amplicons of different sizes because of splicing of 29 bases (set 4). B, ratio of FISP to FISP-sp mRNA was shown to be ∼10:1 in D10 and Th2 cells. C, threshold cycle of amplified products, which were amplified using primer sets 1, 2, and 3. D, melting curve graph for PCR products amplified by primer set 4 demonstrates the presence of two different species of amplified PCR products.

https://openalex.org/W2056415637,"Vibrio vulnificus, a septicemia-causing pathogenic bacterium, acquires resistance against various stresses and expresses virulence factors via an rpoS gene product. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional characteristics of this global regulator. Two distinct transcriptional initiation sites for the rpoS gene, the proximal promoter (Pp) and the distal promoter (Pd), were defined by primer extension experiments. Various rpoS::luxAB transcriptional fusions indicated that Pd is a major promoter of rpoS expression. Western blot analysis showed that RpoS levels were inversely correlated with intracellular levels of 3′,5′-cyclic AMP (cAMP). The expressions of both Pd and Pp were increased in cya and crp mutants. The exogenous addition of cAMP to the cya mutant resulted in repressed expression of rpoS. In addition, rpoS expression was significantly lowered in the cpdA mutant, in which the level of cAMP was elevated because of the absence of 3′,5′-cAMP phosphodiesterase. In vitro transcription assays using the V. vulnificus RNA polymerase showed that the transcripts from both promoters were reduced by addition of the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP). The cAMP-CRP was shown to bind to two rpoS promoters by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The alteration of the putative CRP-binding site on each rpoS promoter, via site-directed mutagenesis, abolished the binding of cAMP-CRP as well as regulation by cAMP-CRP. Therefore, this study shows a relationship between the level of intracellular cAMP and the degree of rpoS expression and further demonstrates, for the first time, the direct binding of the cAMP-CRP complex to rpoS upstream regions, which results in repression of rpoS gene expression.

Global and immediate response to diverse environmental stimuli is one of the characteristics of bacterial adaptation and survival. Cellular responses to stressful conditions have been extensively studied in many bacterial species, most notably in Escherichia coli (1Hengge-Aronis R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). To respond properly to diverse stresses, E. coli requires the rpoS gene product, which is a second principal σ factor, RpoS (σs), to endow it with the ability to mediate changes in bacterial physiology and structure. Vibrio vulnificus, a human pathogen causing a fatal septicemia with rapid pathogenic progression and a high mortality rate (2Strom M.S. Paranjpye R.N. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), has been shown to require RpoS for better survival under nutrient starvation, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and acidic conditions (3Hülsmann A. Rosche T.M. Kong I.-S. Hassan H.M. Beam D.M. Oliver J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6114-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Park K.-J. Kang M.-J. Kim S.H. Lee H.-J. Lim J.-K. Choi S.H. Park S.-J. Lee K.-H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3304-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). RpoS is also required for eliciting phenotypes related to virulence in many pathogenic bacteria belonging to the γ-subdivision of Proteobacteria (5Hengge-Aronis R. Storz G. R. Hengge-Aronis R. The General Stress Response in Escherichia coli. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 161-178Google Scholar). V. vulnificus has been shown to use RpoS to express its major virulence factors, such as an elastase (6Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.-J. Lee K.-H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and other exoproteases (3Hülsmann A. Rosche T.M. Kong I.-S. Hassan H.M. Beam D.M. Oliver J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 6114-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and for expression of the fur gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of virulence-associated iron-uptake systems (7Lee H.-J. Park K.-J. Lee A.Y. Park S.G. Park B.C. Lee K.-H. Park S.-J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5891-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Litwin C.M. Quackenbush J. Microb. Pathog. 2001; 31: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular level of RpoS needs to be finely adjusted depending on the environmental conditions, and it is modulated via transcriptional control of the rpoS gene, translational efficiency of rpoS mRNA, proteolysis of the RpoS protein, and the interaction of RpoS with RNA polymerase core subunits (1Hengge-Aronis R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of rpoS expression has been shown to be mediated by diverse trans-acting proteins (9Venturi V. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A transcription factor, ArcA, represses rpoS expression by binding to the regulatory regions flanking the major promoter of the E. coli rpoS gene (10Mika F. Hengge R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2770-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The repressor Fis and the activator PsrA directly bind to the rpoS gene regulatory regions of Salmonella enterica and Pseudomonas spp., respectively (11Hirsch M. Elliott T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1568-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Kojic M. Aguilar C. Venturi V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2324-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Borrelia burdorferi, another σ factor, RpoN, is involved in the expression of its rpoS gene (13Burtnick M.N. Downey J.S. Brett P.J. Boylan J.A. Frye J.G. Hoover T.R. Gherardini F.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The role of cAMP-CRP 2The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; IC, initiation codon; ORF, open reading frame; RNAP, RNA polymerase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RLU, relative light unit; mt, mutagenized. 2The abbreviations used are: CRP, cAMP receptor protein; IC, initiation codon; ORF, open reading frame; RNAP, RNA polymerase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RLU, relative light unit; mt, mutagenized. complex as a negative transcriptional regulator in rpoS expression was shown genetically using crp, cya, and crr knock-out mutants of E. coli and other bacterial species (14Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 15Ueguchi C. Misonou N. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, whether control by cAMP-CRP complex is direct or indirect has not yet been determined, because the effects of cAMP-CRP on rpoS expression were shown only by transcriptional fusion assays, and direct evidence for the binding of cAMP-CRP complex to rpoS promoter regions and the effect of cAMP-CRP on rpoS transcription have not been reported in any bacterial species (1Hengge-Aronis R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 16McCann M.P. Fraley C.D. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the locations of the putative CRP-binding sites of E. coli rpoS were predicted to be the sites centered at –61.5 and +56.5 with respect to the major transcription start site. Because the CRP-binding sites usually overlap with the promoters of the genes repressed by the cAMP-CRP complex, those putative CRP-binding sites are not typical for a negative regulation; one (centered at –61.5) is usually an activating site and the other (centered at +56.5) is located at the downstream region of the rpoS initiation codon (IC) (1Hengge-Aronis R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 10Mika F. Hengge R. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2770-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular basis of how the cAMP-CRP complex modulates the transcription of the rpoS gene has not been completely defined. We have previously isolated the rpoS homolog from V. vulnificus (17Park K.-J. Kim S.H. Kang M.-J. Chung D.H. Ha S.-D. Kim K.-S. Jahng D. Lee K.-H. J. Microbiol.

J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5891-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although the functions of RpoS are quite conserved in diverse bacteria, the regulatory modes of rpoS gene transcription are distinct in each bacterium (9Venturi V. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, we are interested in the transcriptional characteristics of V. vulnificus rpoS. In this study, we defined two distinct promoters for the V. vulnificus rpoS gene and demonstrated direct evidence for transcriptional regulation of rpoS via the interaction of the cAMP-CRP complex with these two promoters. Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Cultivation—Bacterial strains and plasmids used for this study are listed in Table 1. E. coli strains used for plasmid DNA preparation and conjugational transfer were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB plates containing 1.5% (w/v) agar. V. vulnificus strains were grown in LB medium supplemented with additional 2% (w/v) NaCl (LBS), unless stated otherwise. All medium components were purchased from Difco, and chemicals and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study Primer Extension Experiment—An oligonucleotide, PE+83 (Table 2), complementary to the open reading frame (ORF) of rpoS was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and then used for cDNA synthesis. RNA was converted to cDNA with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA products were purified and resolved on a sequencing gel alongside sequencing ladders generated with the same primer used for primer extension. The nucleotide sequence of pINE32 was determined using the dideoxy chain termination method with Top™ DNA polymerase (Bioneer) as described previously (18Roh J.-B. Lee M.-A. Lee H.-J. Kim S.-M.

The sequencing gels were dried and then visualized upon exposure to a PhosphorImager (Personal Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). Another oligonucleotide, PE-368 (Table 2), was used for synthesis of cDNA to examine rpoS expression derived from the second promoter as described above.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used in this studyaa Restriction sites are underlined and their usages in cloning experiments are described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Modified nucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis are italicized and the detailed information is described in the text. a Restriction sites are underlined and their usages in cloning experiments are described under “Experimental Procedures.” b Modified nucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis are italicized and the detailed information is described in the text. Construction of the ΔcpdA V. vulnificus Strain, HY101—A 762-bp cpdA upstream region was amplified using primers cpd5F and cpd5R (Table 2), which locate at –784 and –27 relative to the cpdA IC, respectively. The resultant PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, SpeI and BglII, and ligated to a suicide vector pDM4 treated with the same enzymes (19Milton D.L. O'Toole R. Hörstedt P. Wolf-Watz H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce pHY01. A 449-bp DNA fragment was amplified using primers icc3F and icc3R (Table 2), which are located at +302 and +750 relative to the IC of cpdA, respectively. This PCR product was digested with BglII and SphI and cloned into pHY01, resulting in pHY02. Finally, a 1.2-kb kanamycin resistance gene, isolated by digesting pUC4K (GE Healthcare) with BamHI, was inserted into the BglII site of pHY02 to yield pHY03. Plasmid pHY03 in the SM10 λpir (20Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar) strain was mobilized to V. vulnificus AR, a rifampin-resistant derivative strain of V. vulnificus ATCC29307, and the conjugates were selected by plating the mixture of E. coli and V. vulnificus on LBS supplemented with 4 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml rifampin. A colony with characteristics indicating a double homologous recombination event (resistance to 5% (w/v) sucrose, sensitivity to chloramphenicol, and resistance to kanamycin) was further confirmed by PCR, using primers cpd5F and icc3R, and named HY101. Construction of Δcya V. vulnificus Strain, KP301—A 3,245-bp DNA fragment containing the cya ORF and its upstream and downstream regions was amplified from the genomic DNA of V. vulnificus ATCC29307 using two primers, cya-F and cya-R (Table 2). The PCR product was digested with ApaI and XbaI and then cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) to produce pVVcya. A mutation in cya was created by deleting the NsiI fragment within the cya coding region in pVVcya, thus yielding pVVΔcya. A 1,973-bp DNA fragment of pVVΔcya digested with ApaI and XbaI was ligated into a suicide vector, pDM4, to generate pDMΔcya. The E. coli SM10 λpir strain carrying pDMΔcya was conjugated to V. vulnificus ATCC29307, and the exconjugants were then selected on thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose medium supplemented with 4 μg/ml chloramphenicol. A colony indicating double homologous recombination was confirmed by PCR, using primers cya-F and cya-R, and named KP301. Construction of rpoS luxAB Transcriptional Fusions—A set of rpoS::luxAB transcriptional fusions was made by subcloning a series of rpoS promoter DNA fragments into pHK0011 (6Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.-J. Lee K.-H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 278: 45072-45081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Primer rpoS+88 (Table 2) contained an XbaI restriction site followed by bases corresponding to the 5′-end of the rpoS coding region. Primer rpoS+88 was used in conjunction with one of the following primers to amplify DNA upstream of rpoS: rpoS-105 (for pKP-105), rpoS-368 (for pKP-368), rpoS-732 (for pKP-732), rpoS-891 (for pKP-891), rpoS-1315 (for pKP-1315), and rpoS-1640 (for pKP-1640) (Tables 1 and 2). The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and then inserted into pHK0011, which had been digested with the same enzymes, to create six different rpoS::luxAB fusions. Luciferase Assay—The rpoS::luxAB reporters were mobilized into wild type, ΔcpdA, crp, and Δcya V. vulnificus mutants via conjugal transfer. Overnight (16–18 h) cultures of the bacterial cells containing one of these fusions were inoculated into fresh LBS medium containing tetracycline (3 μg/ml) and then grown to the stationary phase. At various time points of bacterial growth, a portion of the samples was taken from each culture and diluted 100-fold with LBS medium. The expression from various lengths of the rpoS promoter was measured by monitoring light production in the presence of 0.006% (v/v) n-decyl aldehyde using a luminometer (TD-20/20; Turners Designs). Light production was expressed in arbitrary relative light units (RLU), and the specific bioluminescence was calculated by normalizing RLU with cell mass (A595), as described previously (7Lee H.-J. Park K.-J. Lee A.Y. Park S.G. Park B.C. Lee K.-H. Park S.-J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5891-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). cAMP at a concentration of 0.5 mm was added exogenously to the culture of Δcya mutant V. vulnificus either with pKP-368 or pKP-1315, and the light emission from these cells was monitored at the various phases of bacterial growth. Western Blot Analysis—The plasmid pQErpoS was constructed to express the recombinant RpoS protein as a histidine-tagged form, which was then used to produce polyclonal antibodies against V. vulnificus RpoS as described previously (4Park K.-J. Kang M.-J. Kim S.H. Lee H.-J. Lim J.-K. Choi S.H. Park S.-J. Lee K.-H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3304-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Wild type V. vulnificus was harvested at various phases of bacterial growth in LBS broth, and bacterial extracts were then prepared by sonication in TNT buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 8.0) (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 17.1-17.17Google Scholar). Forty micrograms of the extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. After a transfer to a Hybond P membrane (Amersham Biosciences), Western blot analysis was performed by serially incubating the filter with anti-V. vulnificus RpoS antibodies (1:5,000) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin G (1:5,000; Sigma). The RpoS protein of V. vulnificus was visualized using an nitro blue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate system (Promega). To investigate the role of cAMP-CRP in RpoS formation, cell extracts of wild type, crp, Δcya, and ΔcpdA mutant V. vulnificus were prepared and then examined by Western blot analysis with RpoS-specific antibodies. cAMP was added to the Δcya mutant at a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the bacterial extract was also prepared for Western blot analysis. Purification of V. vulnificus RNA Polymerase (RNAP) Coreenzyme and σ Factor 70 (RpoD)—V. vulnificus MO6–24/O was grown in LBS medium at 30 °C for 6 h. Cell pellet was resuspended in the cold grinding buffer (50 mm Tris, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 233 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0). After 20 min of incubation on ice, the bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication in the presence of 4% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. The core RNAP was purified by an immunoaffinity chromatography using the polyol-responsive monoclonal antibody 8RB13 (NeoClone Biotechnology) as described (22Bergendahl V. Thompson N.E. Foley K.M. Olson B.M. Burgess R.L. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Thompson N.E. Hanger D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7003-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Eluted core RNAP was then dialyzed with the storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.6). The coding region of V. vulnificus rpoD was amplified using oligonucleotide primers, F-rpoDvv and R-rpoDvv (Table 2). The 1.8-kb PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and then ligated to the expression vector, pET28a (Novagen), which was digested with the same enzymes, to produce pSH0505. His-tagged recombinant RpoD protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 in the presence of 1.0 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside and then purified by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's procedure (Qiagen). In Vitro Transcription Assay in the Presence of CRP—The plasmids containing the templates for RNAP were constructed by inserting the DNA fragments of rpoS promoter regions to pRLG770 (24Newlands J.T. Gaal T. Mecsas J. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 661-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The insert DNA, including rpoS Pd, was amplified using the PCR primers rpoS-IV-1 and rpoS-IV-2. The insert DNA, including rpoS Pp, was amplified using rpoS-IV-3 and rpoS-IV-5 (Table 2). Amplified DNA were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and then ligated to EcoRI/HindIII-treated pRLG770. Purified CRP (0, 72, 144, 216, and 288 nm) and the plasmid (0.25 nm) were mixed in the reaction buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm cAMP, pH 8.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The radiolabeled nucleotide (5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP) and cold nucleotides (25 μm UTP and 500 μm each ATP, CTP, and GTP) were added to the reaction mixture, and the transcription was initiated by adding the V. vulnificus RNAP holoenzyme premixture of 10 nm core RNAP and 10 nm RpoD (supplemental Fig. 1). The in vitro transcription reactions were stopped with the stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol, pH 8.0) after 15 min. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on a 6.5% polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide (19:1), 7 m urea denaturing gel. Transcripts were visualized and quantified using Personal Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software, respectively (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—V. vulnificus recombinant CRP protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 carrying pHK0201 (25Jeong H.S. Lee M.H. Lee K.-H. Park S.-J. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 276: 13875-13880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a pRSETA (Invitrogen)-based expression plasmid, and purified by a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's procedure (Qiagen). The 394-bp upstream region of the rpoS gene, extending from residues –732 to –339 with respect to the IC of rpoS, was amplified by PCR using 32P-labeled PE-368 and unlabeled rpoS-732 as primers (Table 2). The other rpoS promoter region used for binding assays was made with two primers, PE+83 and rpoS-368 (Table 2), which contained the 456-bp DNA fragment from –373 to +83 with respect to the IC of rpoS. Seven nanomolar of the labeled DNA fragment was incubated with varying concentrations of purified histidine-tagged CRP protein (150–600 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 1× binding buffer (26González-Gil G. Kahmann R. Muskhelishvili G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2877-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), including 500 μm cAMP (Sigma). Following the addition of 3 μl of loading buffer to each reaction, the samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For competition analyses, the identical but unlabeled rpoS DNA fragment was included as a competitor DNA. Various amounts of competitor DNA (14–70 nm) were added to the reaction mixture containing 7 nm of the labeled DNA prior to the addition of 600 nm CRP. A 378-bp DNA fragment encompassing the promoter region of the gap gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified from genomic DNA of V. vulnificus using primers gap-F and gap-R (Table 2) and included as nonspecific DNA in the binding assay. cAMP Assay—V. vulnificus cells grown in LBS were harvested, and the amounts of cAMP in the bacterial lysates were estimated according to the manufacturer's instructions (cAMP Biotrak EIA System, Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed Mutagenesis of the rpoS Promoters—The putative CRP-binding sites include the sequences homologous to the inverted repeat, TGTGAN6TCACA. Inverted repeats, which are located at –26 to –47 relative to the distal transcription initiation site (CRP-binding site I) and –27 to –48 relative to the proximal transcription initiation site (CRP-binding site II) of the rpoS gene, were mutagenized using primers carrying the substituted nucleotides. To amplify the mutated CRP-binding site I, two sets of primers, rpoS-1315/rpoSM1-R and rpoSM1-F/rpoS+88 (Table 2), were utilized. Two PCR products (an 846-bp PCR product using rpoS-1315 and rpoSM1-R and a 584-bp PCR product using rpoSM1-F and rpoS+88) were used as template DNAs to produce the mutagenized rpoS DNA fragment, encompassing the segment from –1315 and +88 relative to the IC of rpoS, using primers rpoS-1315 and rpoS+88. The resultant mutagenized rpoS promoter DNA was cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) to produce pGEMT-rpoSmt1. To amplify the mutated CRP-binding site II, two primer sets, rpoS-368/rpoSM2-R and rpoSM2-F/rpoS+88, were used. Two PCR products (a 345-bp PCR product using rpoS-368 and rpoSM2-R, and a 142-bp PCR product using rpoSM2-F and rpoS+88) were used as template DNAs to produce the mutagenized rpoS DNA fragment, encompassing the segment from –368 and +88 relative to the IC of rpoS, using primers rpoS-368 and rpoS+88. The resultant mutagenized rpoS promoter DNA was cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) to produce pGEMT-rpoSmt2. The mutagenized nucleotide sequences of both pGEMT-rpoSmt1 and pGEMT-rpoSmt2 were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Then the insert DNA fragment of each plasmid, digested with BamHI and XbaI, was ligated to BamHI/XbaI-digested pHK0011, which contained the promoterless luxAB genes. The resultant plasmids, prpoSM1 and prpoSM2, were mobilized into V. vulnificus strains by conjugation, and the exconjugants were selected in thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose medium supplemented with 3 μg/ml tetracycline. Statistical Analyses—Results were expressed as the means ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test (SYSTAT program, SigmaPlot version 9, Systat Software Inc.). Differences were considered significant at p values <0.01. Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers—The nucleotide sequences of the cpdA and cya genes isolated from V. vulnificus ATCC29307 have been deposited in the GenBank™ data base under the accession numbers AY221025 and AY240931, respectively. Identification of Two Transcription Start Sites of the V. vulnificus rpoS Gene—RNA prepared from the stationary phase cells was converted to cDNA using primer PE+83, which annealed to the nucleotide sequences between +54 and +83 relative to the IC of rpoS. Upon gel electrophoresis with the sequencing ladder of the rpoS gene with the same primer, a single signal was observed 29 bp upstream of the IC of RpoS (Fig. 1A), which is 52 bp downstream of the stop codon of the adjacent gene, nlpD. Putative –10 (TAAAGT) and –35 (TTGCGA) sequences were discernable, and this promoter was designated as Pp, a promoter proximal to the rpoS ORF (Fig. 1C). The same RNA was hybridized with another primer PE-368, which contained complementary sequences to nucleotide sequences between –368 and –339, relative to the IC of rpoS. The initiation site of the resultant cDNA was mapped at –473 with respect to the IC of rpoS (Fig. 1B). This putative promoter resided within the ORF of the upstream gene, nlpD, with reasonable promoter sequences (CTGTCA and AATAAC as –35 and –10, respectively), and was designated as Pd, a distal promoter to the rpoS ORF (Fig. 1C). Expressional Analysis of rpoS Promoters Using luxAB-transcriptional Fusions—A series of luxAB-transcriptional fusions were constructed by cloning various lengths of the rpoS promoter regions (Fig. 2A). Two rpoS::luxAB fusions, pKP-105 and pKP-368, contained only the Pp, whereas the remaining four fusions with longer promoter regions had both promoters Pd and Pp. During growth, the expressions of these diverse fusions were determined by measuring their luciferase activities (Fig. 2B). The basal and induced expression levels of pKP-105 were similar to those of pKP-368. The remaining four longer fusions (pKP-732, -891, -1315, and -1640) also showed similar levels of expression compared with each other, but significantly higher expression (over 200-fold) relative to the other two shorter fusions, including only Pp. When bacterial cells entered the stationary phase, the shorter fusions were induced about 3–4-fold, and the longer fusions were induced 12–15-fold. For further analyses, pKP-368 was chosen to represent the expression from Pp only, and pKP-1315 was chosen to represent the expression from both Pd and Pp. Intracellular Levels of RpoS and cAMP during V. vulnificus Growth—Using polyclonal antibodies specific to V. vulnificus RpoS, intracellular levels of RpoS were measured at various time points along a growth curve (Fig. 3). Upon Western blot analysis with RpoS-specific antibodies, an immunoreactive band of ∼40 kDa was observed in eight different bacterial extracts along the"

The X-residue usually determines the cognate substrate for a given enzyme (11Reid T.S. Terry K.L. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).

Ther. 2003; 2: S96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consequently, FTase and GGTase-I have been a major focus of cancer chemotherapeutic research for over a decade. Two FTase inhibitors, Lonafarnib (Schering) and Tipifarnib (Johnson & Johnson) have advanced to late-stage clinical trials (10Basso A.D. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 15-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) for the treatment of cancer.In lower eukaryotes, prenylation of essential signal transduction proteins is also required for function. In pathogenic micro-organisms, such as C. albicans, disruption of protein prenylation of such essential cellular proteins has the potential for the development of new antifungal medications (5Song J.L. White T.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Mazur P. Register E. Bonfiglio C.A. Yuan X. Kurtz M.B. Williamson J.M. Kelly R.

Lett. 2002; 12: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The Ram2 gene in C. albicans encodes the common α-subunit of FTase and GGTase-I; knock-out mutations of this gene are lethal (5Song J.L. White T.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As in mammalian cells, knock-out of a single β-subunit is not lethal, because the remaining CaaX prenyltransferase can cross-prenylate non-cognate substrates (7Kelly R. Card D. Register E. Mazur P. Kelly T. Tanaka K.I. Onishi J. Williamson J.M. Fan H. Satoh T. Kurtz M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 704-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Even so, at least one series of selective CaGGTase-I inhibitors has shown significant antifungal activity, suggesting that impairment of one of the CaaX prenyltransferase may be sufficient for effective treatment (23Sunami S. Ohkubo M. Sagara T. Ono J. Asahi S. Koito S. Morishima H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In C. albicans, Rho family substrates of the GGTase-I regulate cell wall biogenesis, while Ras family substrates of CaFTase have been strongly implicated in virulence by regulating the transition from yeast to hyphae (5Song J.L. White T.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Selective inhibitors of C. albicans CaaX prenyltransferases would therefore provide tools for understanding morphological changes in this yeast as well as potential antifungal treatments.Here we present the crystal structure of the CaGGTase-I at 1.8-Å resolution in complex with its cognate lipid substrate, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP). This structure reveals the structure of a non-mammalian protein prenyltransferase and provides high-resolution structural insights into the evolution of the protein prenyltransferase mechanism in lower eukaryotes and mammals. Although the yeast enzyme shares a similar overall architecture with its mammalian ortholog, close inspection of the active site reveals areas of significant divergence in critical regions. In particular, mechanisms of isoprenoid selection differ in the two enzymes; the putative product exit groove also varies significantly. We postulate that the unique structural features of CaGGTase-I will provide opportunities to design selective inhibitors for the development of new anti-fungal therapeutics.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Protein Expression—C. albicans genomic DNA (strain SC5314) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The RAM2 gene encoding the α-subunit was amplified from the genomic DNA using standard PCR methods and Platinum Pfx High Fidelity polymerase (Invitrogen). The forward primer sequence (SalI restriction site underlined) was 5′-CTGACGCCATGGATGACAGACTCCAAATATGAC-3′ and the reverse primer sequence (NotI site underlined) was 5′-CATTATGCGGCCGCTTACACCGATGTGAG-3′. The insert was digested with restriction enzymes SalI and NotI (New England Biolabs) for subcloning into the expression vector.Amplification of the CDC43 gene encoding β-subunit was challenging because of the particularly AT rich sequence. The insert was amplified in two steps. First, primers were designed to amplify from regions flanking the gene, ∼250 bases upstream and downstream of the coding sequence. PCR was performed using the Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the manufacturer's suggested procol, with the forward primer 5′-TCAAACCGGCTTCTTCAAGT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TGTTGATTGTGTGTGTGGGA-3′. The resulting fragment of ∼1.7 kb was used as the PCR template for another round of PCR amplification using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following primers: forward, 5′-GCGCTGCATATGAACCAACTGCTGATTAACAAACATGAGAAATTTTT-3′ (NdeI restriction site underlined); reverse, 5′-GCGCTGCTCGAGTTAATACTTTATTTTTTCTTTAAAAAATTGATACGATTCTTTTGTAATTG-3′ (XhoI site underlined). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the PCR2.1 TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit from Invitrogen. Plasmids isolated from colonies positive for insert incorporation were digested using restriction enzymes XhoI and NdeI (New England Biolabs) to liberate the CDC43 insert.The pCDFDuet-I vector (Novagen) was chosen to co-express both subunits of the enzyme in Escherichia coli (E. coli); the vector contains two multiple cloning sites (MCS) under the control of separate isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoters for robust co-expression of two gene products. The digested RAM2 gene encoding the α-subunit was subcloned into the SalI and NotI restriction sites in MCSI of the pCDFDuet-I vector. The digested CDC43 gene encoding the β-subunit was subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of MCSII of the pCDFDuet-I vector to achieve the final expression construct. The Duke University Medical Center DNA Analysis Facility performed the sequence analysis to confirm error-free construction of the expression vector.The final construct was transformed into C41 (DE3) Escherichia coli (AVIDIS, S.A.) for expression. A single colony was picked from the plate and grown overnight in a 50-ml LB culture supplemented with 50 mg/ml streptomycin. The 50-ml LB culture was used to inoculate 2 liters of LB media supplemented with streptomycin until the A600 reached 0.8, at which point the culture was induced with a final concentration of 1 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The culture was supplemented with 300 μm Zn(SO4)2 at induction. Cells were harvested at 6000 × g, and the cell paste could be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for several months.Protein Purification—The cell paste was resuspended in a 10-fold volume of Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ZnCl2) supplemented with SigmaFast general use protease inhibitor tablets (Sigma). Cells were lysed using a pressurized homogenizer (Microfluidics Corp.) and the resulting crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 30 min. The lysate was first applied to a DEAE Sepharose column and fractionated using gradient from Buffer A + 150 mm NaCl to Buffer A + 300 mm NaCl over 8 column volumes. The fractions containing CaGGTase-I as determined by SDS-PAGE were pooled and brought to a final concentration of 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4 by 2-fold dilution with Buffer A + 1.6 m (NH4)2SO4. As with the purification of mammalian GGTase-I, a 2-fold molar excess of GGPP was added to the pooled fractions at this point as well, and the mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 20 min before application to the column. The GGPP putatively displaces nonspecifically bound lipids in the active site of the molecule and results in a narrower elution peak from the phenyl-Sepharose column. After incubation with GGPP, the protein was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in Buffer A + 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4, and fractionated using a gradient of Buffer A + 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4 to Buffer A over 8 column volumes. The fractions containing CaGGTase-I (SDS-PAGE) were pooled and adjusted to 10 mS/cm conductivity by dilution in Buffer A (Thermo Scientific conductivity meter) and applied to a Q-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in Buffer A + 150 mm NaCl. The protein was fractionated using a gradient from Buffer A + 150 mm NaCl to Buffer A + 350 mm NaCl over 8 column volumes. The fractions containing CaGGTase-I (SDS-PAGE) were concentrated to 0.5 ml total volume using a centrifugal concentrator (50-kDa MWCO, Amicon), and applied to a 120-ml Superdex 16/10 gel filtration column equilibrated in Buffer A. The final fractions containing CaGGTase-I (SDS-PAGE) were concentrated again in a centrifugal concentrator (50 kDa MWCO, Amicon) to 15 mg/ml, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Typical yield was ∼3-5 mg of purified CaGGTase-I per liter of E. coli culture.Crystallization and Data Collection—GGPP was added to an aliquot of protein at a 0.5:1 GGPP/protein ratio for 30 min prior to setting up the crystallization drop. CaGGTase-I crystals were grown in hanging drop format in which 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of well solution consisting of 25% PEG 1500 and 1× PCB buffer, pH 7.0 (100 ml of 10× PCB contains 3.84 g of sodium propionate, 4.28 g of sodium cacodylate, and 11.29 g of Bis-Tris propane). Crystals appeared within 2-3 days and grew as long thin rods, with typical dimensions 400 μm × 50 μm × 50 μm. Prior to data collection, crystals were transferred to a stabilizing solution containing 1× PCB buffer pH 7.0, 30% PEG 1500, followed by cryoprotection in stabilizing solution plus 10% ethylene glycol. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory at 100 K. Crystals diffract beyond 1.7-Å resolution; a complete data set was collected to 1.8-Å resolution (Table 1). CaGGTase-I crystallized in space group C2 (a = 132.3 Å, b = 66.05 Å, c = 82.8 Å, α = γ = 90.0°, β = 100.0°) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit.

Fig. 2A shows the overall structural features of the enzyme. The sequence identities with respect to the mammalian ortholog are 28 and 25% for the α- and β-subunits, respectively. Despite this low overall sequence identity, the structure of CaGGTase-I is quite similar in overall architecture to mammalian GGTase-I (1.58 Å r.m.s.d. calculated over all aligned α-carbon atoms, Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2A, C. albicans protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I (α-subunit, red; β-subunit, blue). Secondary structure elements for each subunit are labeled, as are the lipid substrate GGPP (green) and catalytic Zn2+ ion (pink). B, CaGGTase-I superimposed on mammalian GGTase-I (PDB code 1N4P, gray).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The CaGGTase-I α-subunit is smaller than the mammalian protein (306 versus 377 amino acids). CaGGTase-I lacks an N-terminal domain rich in proline and glutamine residues present in the mammalian enzyme. This domain is disordered in all mammalian FTase and GGTase-I structures determined to date.Like the mammalian enzyme, the CaGGTase-I α-subunit consists of α-helices. There are 16 helices altogether, one short helix more than in mammalian enzyme, arranged in antiparallel pairs to form a crescent that envelopes part of the β-subunit. We observe variation in helix length in the α-subunit. Helices 5α and 8α extend one helical turn longer than the corresponding mammalian helix, and helix 12α is approximately one helical turn shorter. Five amino acids are inserted between the equivalents to12α and 13α in the mammalian enzyme and form an additional short helix in CaGGTase-I (13α).The β-subunit is slightly larger than that of mammalian GGTase-I (390 residues versus 377 for human GGTase-I). Variation in loop length between the helices in the β-subunit accounts for the additional residues. The β-subunit is predominantly α-helical forming an α-α barrel with a central, largely hydrophobic cavity, which contains most of the residues that bind substrate and coordinate the catalytic Zn2+ ion (Fig. 1). The CaGGTase-I β-subunit also has two short antiparallel β sheet regions (residues 67β-76β and 141β-154β) remote from the active site, which do not appear in the mammalian enzyme.Two loops (residues 176β-188β, 261β-272β) and several residues at the termini (1α-2α, 305α-306α;1β) are not visible in the final electron density maps. The disordered loops correspond to two areas of allelic and strain variation in the β-subunit: the region 176-188 contains a polyasparagine tract that can vary between 6 and 17 residues, depending on strain and allele. The variant described here contains six asparagines. The region 261-272 contains a region rich in asparagine, aspartate, and glycine. The number of repeats of these residues also varies across strains and alleles (8Mazur P. Register E. Bonfiglio C.A. Yuan X. Kurtz M.B. Williamson J.M. Kelly R. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); the amino acid sequence of the variant reported here is KDGNGDNGNGDN.Isoprenoid Substrate Binding and Selection—Like mammalian GGTase-I (14Taylor J.S. Reid T.S. Terry K.L. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5963-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), CaGGTase-I binds its isoprenoid substrate in a hydrophobic groove on one side of the active site cavity. The diphosphate moiety forms hydrogen bonds to lysine, arginine, and histidine residues, which are all mostly conserved across species. Although conformation of the GGPP lipid substrate is similar to mammalian GGTase-I (Fig. 3A), the binding mode of the fourth isoprene in CaGGTase-I varies significantly (Fig. 3A). In mammalian GGTase-I, this fourth isoprene is directed toward the CaaX substrate-binding pocket adjacent to the isoprenoid pocket; in the yeast GGTase-I, the phenylalanine 99β is bulkier than threonine 127β at the equivalent position in rat GGTase-I, directing the fourth isoprene away from the CaaX-binding site toward the edge of the active site cavity.FIGURE 3Isoprenoid substrate binding and selection.A, top; a superposition of GGPP binding modes in CaGGTase-I (isoprenoid, green) and rat GGTase-I (isoprenoid, gray). The shift in binding mode of isoprene 4 is observed where the lipid contacts Phe99β in CaGGTase-I. This residue substitutes for the smaller T127β in rat GGTase-I. Bottom, a closeup of shift in isoprene 4 binding mode. View is rotated ∼45° from top. B, GGPP-binding pocket in gray surface representation illustrates the channel for isoprene 4 binding. The leucine residues (L98β and L352β in red), which line this channel permit the longer GGPP lipid substrate to bind. In CaFTase, these residues are replaced by tyrosines (Y259β and Y502β, cyan), which impinge upon the channel and occlude binding of the 20-carbon GGPP substrate, thereby selecting for the 15-carbon FPP substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This conformational difference suggests that the C. albicans prenyltransferases have an alternative mechanism for isoprenoid substrate selection.

https://openalex.org/W2054409902,"To elucidate the mechanism of bifurcated oxidation of quinol in the cytochrome bc1 complex, Rhodobacter sphaeroides mutants, H198N and H111N, lacking heme bL and heme bH, respectively, were constructed and characterized. Purified mutant complexes have the same subunit composition as that of the wild-type complex, but have only 9-11% of the electron transfer activity, which is sensitive to stigmatellin or myxothiazol. The Em values for hemes bL and bH in the H111N and H198N complexes are -95 and -35 mV, respectively. The pseudo first-order reduction rate constants for hemes bL and bH in H111N and H198N, by ubiquiniol, are 16.3 and 12.4 s(-1), respectively. These indicate that the Qp site in the H111N mutant complex is similar to that in the wild-type complex. Pre-steady state reduction rates of heme c1 by these two mutant complexes decrease to a similar extent of their activity, suggesting that the decrease in electron transfer activity is due to impairment of movement of the head domain of reduced iron-sulfur protein, caused by disruption of electron transfer from heme bL to heme bH. Both mutant complexes produce as much superoxide as does antimycin A-treated wild-type complex. Ascorbate eliminates all superoxide generating activity in the intact or antimycin inhibited wild-type or mutant complexes."

One of the regulatory subunits, subunit H, is encoded by the VMA13 gene in yeast and is composed of two domains, the N-terminal domain (amino acids (aa) 1–352) and the C-terminal domain (aa 353–478). The N-terminal domain is required for the activation of the complex, whereas the C-terminal domain is required for coupling ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation (Liu, M., Tarsio, M., Charsky, C.

Analysis of the N-terminal domain shows that the first 179 amino acids are not required for the activation and full function of the V-ATPase complex and that the minimal region of Vma13p/subunit H capable of activating the V-ATPase is aa 180–353 of the N-terminal domain.

Intriguingly, the yeast Vma13p mimicking the mammalian subunit H β isoform is functionally equivalent to Vma13p lacking the entire C-terminal domain.
