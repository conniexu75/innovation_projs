https://openalex.org/W1969475526,"The drug chloroquine is bactericidal for Bacillus megaterium; it inhibits DNA and RNA biosynthesis and produces rapid degradation of ribosomes and dissimilation of ribosomal RNA. Inhibition of protein synthesis is also observed, evidently as a secondary effect. Inhibition of DNA replication is proposed as a general mechanism of the antimicrobial action of chloroquine."

https://openalex.org/W2159881005,"A preliminary technique was developed for conditioning grasp response in monkeys, for use in studying the effect of damage to the central nervous system on skilled movement. That subjects were able to learn this response with a deafferented hand, in the absence of vision, indicated that purposive movements of the distal musculature are less under the control of peripheral feedback than had been generally believed."

Similar inclusions were observed in cultures of fibroblasts from other members of the families, who appeared to be clinically normal but who were, judged from studies of pedigree, heterozygous or hemizygous for the abnormal gene."
https://openalex.org/W2070833400,Five of 17 adenoviruses of rhesus or cynomolgus monkey origin induced tumors in newborn hamsters. The tumors appeared between 42 and 280 days after subcutaneous inoculation and had the general characteristics of lymphomas. The tumors were specific by cross-complement fixation tests. An adenovirus recovered from Cercopithecus monkeys appeared to be highly oncogenic; all 23 inoculated hamsters developed tumors within 30 to 40 days.
https://openalex.org/W2011026101,"A transplantable plasma-cell tumor in mice produces both a γM-macroglobulin serum protein with a sedimentation coefficient of 17S and a kappa-type urinary protein. The reduced and alkylated macroglobulin, when examined by electrophoresis in acid-urea polyacrylamide gel, had a fast component which migrated in the same position as the urinary protein and also a slow component. These two components, as shown by exclusion chromatography, represent the light and heavy polypeptide chains of the γM-macroglobulin. The aforementioned macroglobulin was antigenically related to that in normal mouse serum."

https://openalex.org/W2042371702,"Chickens irradiated and bursectomized in the newly hatched period consistently develop agammaglobulinemia and form no circulating antibodies; if the birds are treated immediately after operations by intra-abdominal injection of unirradiated autologous bursa cells, immunoglobulin production, lymphoid germinal centers, and plasma cells are restored; however, the birds fail to produce antibody to specific antigenic challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2050233884,"A passage line of a spontaneous hamster fibrosarcoma is contaminated by the virus. of lymphocytic choriomeningitis. Tumors from animals receiving implants when newborn contain high titers of infectious lymphocytic-choriomeningitis virus and complement-fixing antigen, and hamsters receiving implants when weanlings develop high titers of complement-fixing antibody against lymphocytic-choriomeningitis virus. In contrast with the specific reactions of tumorous hamsters to the initiating virus in virus-induced tumors, the development of complement-fixing antibody to lymphocytic-choriomeningitis virus does not depend on the development of tumors. Infant hamsters bearing the tumor have a generalized subclinical infection and seem able to spread virus to other hamsters and to humans."
https://openalex.org/W1666973757,"Abstract The reaction mechanism for the first biosynthetic step leading to the formation of deoxy sugars has been studied with a specifically tritiated substrate, thymidine diphosphoglucose-4T. In the presence of partially purified TDP-glucose oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli B, the substrate was converted quantitatively to TDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose-6T. No exchange of tritium with the medium occurred during the reaction. Chemical degradation revealed that all of the tritium originally present on carbon 4 of the glucose had migrated to carbon 6 of the 4-keto derivative. The evidence for the possible intermediary formation of a nucleotide-bound 4-keto-5,6-glucoseen is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W183877184,"Dihydroorotase (4,5-ndihydro-orotate amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.2.3) catalyzes the reversible cyclization of L-ureidosuccinate to n-dihydroorotate. The enzyme was first shown by Lieberman and Kornberg (l-3) to be involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis and degradation in Zymobacterium oroticum. Dihydroorotase also has been identified in Escherichia coli (4,5), rat liver (6,7), human erythrocytes and leukocytes (8-11) and Novikoff ascites tumor cells (12-14). However, the enzyme has not been extensively purified and characterized from any of the above sources. During studies on the purification of dihydroorotase from Z. oroticum, we have had occasion to note considerable cationic stimulation of the activity following treatments with protamine sulfate and ammonium sulfate. The present investigation describes evidence for requirement of a cation, probably Zn++, in the catalytic function of dihydroorotase."

Immunoglobulins M, G, and D were not demonstrated within mucosal epithelial cells. The predominance of lymphoid cells containing immunoglobulin A in the lamina propria of intestinal tissues was confirmed."

These complexes render erythrocytes susceptible to lysis by the other factors of guinea pig complement, without the usual requirements for hemolytic antibody, Ca(++), and Mg(++)."

https://openalex.org/W2039320430,"Our records on marmosets, primarily Oedipomidas oedipus, plus data from the literature, confirm that these animals customarily have twins. Demonstrated chimerism for several tissues is significant, for virtually all twins are of biovular origin. Furthermore, a single birth may often be a survivor of twins. Births occur during any month, but springtime appears to be the most common period. An average interval of 240 days between births predicts the production level of a captive colony. A gestation period of about 140 days appears to be a valid estimate."

https://openalex.org/W1970593107,"Homologous and heterologous antiserums from several species of animals have been prepared against the Rauscher murine leukemia virus. The Ouchterlony technique, adapted to very small quantities, has been used to demonstrate at least two or three antigens in Rauscher virus preparations. Both infected-host materials and tissue-culture fluids were used as antigens. When monkey antiserum was used, one of the Rauscher virus antigens cross-reacted with an antigen in the virus strains isolated by Friend and Moloney, but there was apparently no reaction with the Moloney virus when guinea-pig antiserum was used."

Most of the energy from the ruby laser (wavelength 6943 angstroms) is absorbed by the pigment epithelium, where the greatest damage appears. With the neodymium laser (10,600 angstroms) the neural portions of the retina absorb more of damage than the pigment epithelium and adjacent tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2142679932,"SKIN infection, with members of the genus Dermatophilus has been reported from several countries in a variety of animals including man1,2. The initial isolate was named D. congolensis after the country of origin3,4, but the first isolates in Australia and later ones in Great Britain were thought to be new, previously undescribed organisms, and were named Actinomyces dermatonomus5 and Polysepta pedis6,7. Small differences in the ability to digest protein and to ferment certain sugars supported the view that the isolates belonged to separate species1,7. It was therefore concluded that ‘cutaneous streptothricosis’ of cattle was caused by Dermatophilus congolensis, ‘mycotic dermatitis’ of sheep by D. dermatonomus, and ‘strawberry foot rot’ of sheep by D. pedis1."

Both form and frequency of activity were influenced strongly by age; sex differences were minimal. Most activities decreased with age, but head movements, presumably reflecting visual scanning, were more frequent in adults."
