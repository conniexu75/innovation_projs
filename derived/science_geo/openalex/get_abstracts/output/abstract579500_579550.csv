However, the evidence base for antibiotic therapy is limited. DNA based methods offer better identification and quantification of microbial constituents of sputum than standard clinical culture and may help inform patient management strategies. Our study objective was to determine the longitudinal variability of the non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis microbiome in sputum with respect to clinical variables. Eighty-five patients with non-CF bronchiectasis and daily sputum production were recruited from outpatient clinics and followed for six months. Monthly sputum samples and clinical measurements were taken, together with additional samples during exacerbations. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the sputum microbiota was successful for 381 samples from 76 patients and analysed in conjunction with clinical data. Results Microbial communities were highly individual in composition and stability, usually with limited diversity and often containing multiple pathogens. When compared to DNA sequencing, microbial culture had restricted sensitivity in identifying common pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. With some exceptions, community characteristics showed poor correlations with clinical features including underlying disease, antibiotic use and exacerbations, with the subject showing the strongest association with community structure. When present, the pathogens mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae may also shape the structure of the rest of the microbial community. Conclusions The use of microbial community analysis of sputum added to information from microbial culture. A simple model of exacerbations driven by bacterial overgrowth was not supported, suggesting a need for revision of principles for antibiotic therapy. In individual patients, the management of chronic bronchial infection may be improved by therapy specific to their microbiome, taking into account pathogen load, community stability, and acute and chronic community responses to antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W2587440168,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric disease characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. BD shows substantial clinical and genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders, in particular schizophrenia (SCZ). The genes underlying this etiological overlap remain largely unknown. A recent SCZ genome wide association study (GWAS) by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium identified 128 independent genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The present study investigated whether these SCZ-associated SNPs also contribute to BD development through the performance of association testing in a large BD GWAS dataset (9747 patients, 14278 controls). After re-imputation and correction for sample overlap, 22 of 107 investigated SCZ SNPs showed nominal association with BD. The number of shared SCZ-BD SNPs was significantly higher than expected (p = 1.46x10-8). This provides further evidence that SCZ-associated loci contribute to the development of BD. Two SNPs remained significant after Bonferroni correction. The most strongly associated SNP was located near TRANK1, which is a reported genome-wide significant risk gene for BD. Pathway analyses for all shared SCZ-BD SNPs revealed 25 nominally enriched gene-sets, which showed partial overlap in terms of the underlying genes. The enriched gene-sets included calcium- and glutamate signaling, neuropathic pain signaling in dorsal horn neurons, and calmodulin binding. The present data provide further insights into shared risk loci and disease-associated pathways for BD and SCZ. This may suggest new research directions for the treatment and prevention of these two major psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2587547716,"Occludin is a key tight junction (TJ) protein in cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) playing an important role in modulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) functions. This protein (65kDa) has been shown to engage in many signaling pathways and phosphorylation by both tyrosine and threonine kinases. Despite yet unknown mechanisms, pro-inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides, LPS) may alter TJ proteins in CECs and BBB functions. Here we demonstrate the responses of occludin in an immortalized human cerebral endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) to stimulation by TNFα (10 ng/mL), IL-1β (10 ng/mL) and LPS (100 ng/mL). Exposing cells to TNFα resulted in a rapid and transient upward band-shift of occludin, suggesting of an increase in phosphorylation. Exposure to IL-1β produced significantly smaller effects and LPS produced almost no effects on occludin band-shift. TNFα also caused transient stimulation of p38MAPK and ERK1/2 in hCMEC/D3 cells, and the occludin band-shift induced by TNFα was suppressed by SB202190, an inhibitor for p38MAPK, and partly by U0126, the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 inhibitor. Cells treated with TNFα and IL-1β but not LPS for 24 h resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in the expression of occludin, and the decrease could be partially blocked by SB202190, the inhibitor for p38MAPK. Treatment with TNFα also altered cell morphology and enhanced permeability of the CEC layer as measured by the FITC-dextran assay and the trans-endothelial electrical resistances (TEER). However, treatment with SB202190 alone could not effectively reverse the TNFα -induced morphology changes or the enhanced permeability changes. These results suggest that despite effects of TNFα on p38MAPK-mediated occludin phosphorylation and expression, these changes are not sufficient to avert the TNFα-induced alterations on cell morphology and permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2567866555,"Exceptionally preserved fossils provide crucial insights into extinct body plans and organismal evolution. Molluscs, one of the most disparate animal phyla, radiated rapidly during the early Cambrian period (approximately 535-520 million years ago (Ma)). The problematic fossil taxa Halkieria and Orthrozanclus (grouped in Sachitida) have been assigned variously to stem-group annelids, brachiopods, stem-group molluscs or stem-group aculiferans (Polyplacophora and Aplacophora), but their affinities have remained controversial owing to a lack of preserved diagnostic characters. Here we describe a new early sachitid, Calvapilosa kroegeri gen. et sp. nov. from the Fezouata biota of Morocco (Early Ordovician epoch, around 478 Ma). The new taxon is characterized by the presence of a single large anterior shell plate and polystichous radula bearing a median tooth and several lateral and uncinal teeth in more than 125 rows. Its flattened body is covered by hollow spinose sclerites, and a smooth, ventral girdle flanks an extensive mantle cavity. Phylogenetic analyses resolve C. kroegeri as a stem-group aculiferan together with other single-plated forms such as Maikhanella (Siphogonuchites) and Orthrozanclus; Halkieria is recovered closer to the aculiferan crown. These genera document the stepwise evolution of the aculiferan body plan from forms with a single, almost conchiferan-like shell through two-plated taxa such as Halkieria, to the eight-plated crown-group aculiferans. C. kroegeri therefore provides key evidence concerning the long debate about the crown molluscan affinities of sachitids. This new discovery strongly suggests that the possession of only a single calcareous shell plate and the presence of unmineralised sclerites are plesiomorphic (an ancestral trait) for the molluscan crown."
https://openalex.org/W2586608125,"Eribulin mesylate (eribulin) is currently indicated for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). It is a cytotoxic agent with unique mechanisms that suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells. On the other hand, Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which are considered indicators of immune response monitoring, have been reported as prognostic factors and predictors of therapeutic efficacy. We thought that eribulin, which has an EMT-inhibiting mechanism, may produce an antitumor effect by improving the immune microenvironment, and in this study investigated the effects of breast cancer eribulin chemotherapy on the immune microenvironment with TILs as a marker.TILs was evaluated in 52 patients with MBC who underwent chemotherapy with eribulin. The correlation between TILs evaluated according to the standard method, and prognosis, including the efficacy of eribulin chemotherapy, was investigated retrospectively.Of the 52 MBC patients, 29 (55.8%) were in the high TILs group and 23 (44.2%) were in the low TILs group. The high TILs group included significantly more triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (p = 0.008) than the low TILs group. In an analysis of outcomes, TNBC patients in the high TILs group had significantly longer disease-free survival than TNBC patients in the low TILs group (p = 0.033, log-rank), but no significant differences were seen in all breast cancer patients (p = 0.489, log-rank) or in non-TNBC patients (p = 0.878, log-rank). In a multivariate analysis of recurrence in TNBC patients, being in the high TILs group was again an independent factor for a good outcome (p = 0.031, HR = 0.063).The results of this study suggest that TILs may be useful as a predictive marker of the therapeutic effect of eribulin chemotherapy in TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2587151628,"A suboptimal early nutritional environment (i.e., excess of energy, sugar, and fat intake) can increase susceptibility to diseases and neurocognitive disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate in nonobese Yucatan minipigs (Sus scrofa) the impact of maternal diet [standard diet (SD) vs. Western diet (WD)] during gestation and 25 d of lactation on milk composition, blood metabolism, and microbiota activity of sows (n = 17) and their piglets (n = 65), and on spatial cognition (n = 51), hippocampal plasticity (n = 17), and food preferences/motivation (n = 51) in the progeny. Milk dry matter and lipid content, as well as plasma total cholesterol and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations (P < 0.05) were higher in WD than in SD sows. Microbiota activity decreased in both WD sows and 100-d-old piglets (P < 0.05 or P < 0.10, depending on short-chain FAs [SCFAs]). At weaning [postnatal day (PND) 25], WD piglets had increased blood triglyceride and FFA levels (P < 0.01). Both SD and WD piglets consumed more of a known SD than an unknown high-fat and -sucrose (HFS) diet (P < 0.0001), but were quicker to obtain HFS rewards compared with SD rewards (P < 0.01). WD piglets had higher working memory (P = 0.015) and reference memory (P < 0.001) scores, which may reflect better cognitive abilities in the task context and a higher motivation for the food rewards. WD piglets had a smaller hippocampal granular cell layer (P = 0.03) and decreased neurogenesis (P < 0.005), but increased cell proliferation (P < 0.001). A maternal WD during gestation and lactation, even in the absence of obesity, has significant consequences for piglets' blood lipid levels, microbiota activity, gut-brain axis, and neurocognitive abilities after weaning.-Val-Laillet, D., Besson, M., Guérin, S., Coquery, N., Randuineau, G., Kanzari, A., Quesnel, H., Bonhomme, N., Bolhuis, J.

https://openalex.org/W2587021771,"Glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a multifunctional protein that also mediates cell death under oxidative stress. We reported previously that the active-site cysteine (Cys-152) of GAPDH plays an essential role in oxidative stress-induced aggregation of GAPDH associated with cell death, and a C152A-GAPDH mutant rescues nitric oxide (NO)-induced cell death by interfering with the aggregation of wild type (WT)-GAPDH. However, the detailed mechanism underlying GAPDH aggregate-induced cell death remains elusive. Here we report that NO-induced GAPDH aggregation specifically causes mitochondrial dysfunction. First, we observed a correlation between NO-induced GAPDH aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction, when GAPDH aggregation occurred at mitochondria in SH-SY5Y cells. In isolated mitochondria, aggregates of WT-GAPDH directly induced mitochondrial swelling and depolarization, whereas mixtures containing aggregates of C152A-GAPDH reduced mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, treatment with cyclosporin A improved WT-GAPDH aggregate-induced swelling and depolarization. In doxycycline-inducible SH-SY5Y cells, overexpression of WT-GAPDH augmented NO-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and increased mitochondrial GAPDH aggregation, whereas induced overexpression of C152A-GAPDH significantly suppressed mitochondrial impairment. Further, NO-induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria were both augmented in cells overexpressing WT-GAPDH but ameliorated in C152A-GAPDH-overexpressing cells. Interestingly, GAPDH aggregates induced necrotic cell death via a permeability transition pore (PTP) opening. The expression of either WT- or C152A-GAPDH did not affect other cell death pathways associated with protein aggregation, such as proteasome inhibition, gene expression induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, or autophagy.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a glycolytic enzyme that is responsible for the sixth step of glycolysis (1Nicholls C. Li H. Liu J.P.

In addition to this metabolic function, GAPDH is now recognized as a multifunctional protein that exhibits other functions, including transcriptional (2Zheng L. Roeder R.G. Luo Y.

The active-site cysteine (Cys-152) seems to play a crucial role in both pathways. For example, GAPDH binds to Siah (seven in absentia homolog) through oxidation/S-nitrosylation of Cys-152 and translocates into the nucleus in response to oxidative stress, such as that from nitric oxide (NO) (10Hara M.R.

We demonstrated previously that NO-induced cell death is attenuated by a GAPDH mutant with a substitution of Cys-152 to alanine (C152A-GAPDH) in a dominant-negative manner (24Kubo T. Nakajima H. Nakatsuji M. Itakura M. Kaneshige A. Azuma Y.T. Inui T. Takeuchi T. Active site cysteine-null glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) rescues nitric oxide-induced cell death.Nitric Oxide. 2016; 53: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the underlying mechanism by which this occurs. Our experiments using C152A-GAPDH revealed the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as the subsequent release of cyt c and nuclear translocation of AIF via PTP opening, in NO-induced necrotic cell death mediated by GAPDH aggregation. As an oxidant, we selected NOC18, an NO generator (14Nakajima H. Amano W. Kubo T. Fukuhara A. Ihara H. Azuma Y.T. Tajima H. Inui T. Sawa A. Takeuchi T. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase aggregate formation participates in oxidative stress-induced cell death.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 34331-34341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The IC50 for NOC18-induced decrease of cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells was ∼200 μm (Fig. 1A). Treatment with NOC18 caused GAPDH oligomer formation in cells and in insoluble fractions in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To validate the effect of GAPDH aggregation on mitochondria, we assessed mitochondrial membrane potential in cells using the anion dye rhodamine 123 (Rho 123). Compared with vehicle treatment, 200 μm NOC18 significantly increased Rho 123 fluorescence, indicating a disruption of the mitochondrial membrane, which was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner with NOC18 (Fig. 1C). We next examined the correlation between the formation of GAPDH oligomers and the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential; the result clearly indicated a strong correlation (R2 = 0.8036, Fig. 1D). These results indicate a relation between NO-induced GAPDH aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, in the following experiments, sufficient aggregates of GAPDH and mitochondrial dysfunction were observed after 48 h of treatment with 200 μm NOC18. To investigate the origin of the aggregates of GAPDH that induce mitochondrial dysfunction, we used Western blotting to study whether these aggregates exist within mitochondrial fractions in NOC18-treated SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2A). Successful mitochondrial fractionation was confirmed by the presence of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV (CIV)) and the absence of histone H2B (a marker for nuclear fraction) and triosephosphate isomerase (a marker for cytosolic fraction). A large amount of GAPDH was present in the mitochondrial fraction, as reported previously (Fig. 2A, left panel) (35Tarze A. Deniaud A. Le Bras M. Maillier E. Molle D. Larochette N. Zamzami N. Jan G. Kroemer G. Brenner C. GAPDH, a novel regulator of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial membrane permeabilization.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2606-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Further, we verified the presence of GAPDH aggregates in the mitochondrial fraction from SH-SY5Y cells. Although vehicle-treated control cells had only monomeric GAPDH (37 kDa), GAPDH oligomers and a lesser number of GAPDH monomers were present in the mitochondrial fraction of NOC18-treated cells (Fig. 2A, right panel). Similarly, we used immunofluorescence to assess whether GAPDH was localized near the mitochondria using the cell-permeable mitochondrial-selective dye MitoTracker Red (Fig. 2B). Whereas the juxtaposition of the GAPDH signal was around the mitochondria in vehicle-treated cells, NOC18-treated cells showed punctate GAPDH-positive signals that were consistent with aggregates of GAPDH, which partially merged with MitoTracker Red, indicating mitochondrial localization of GAPDH aggregates (Fig. 2B, right panels). To identify where the aggregates of GAPDH occurred in cells, we examined the amounts of oligomeric GAPDH in mitochondrial fractions with or without DTT, which reduces GAPDH oligomers and causes dissociation to monomers (15Nakajima H. Amano W. Fujita A. Fukuhara A. Azuma Y.-T. Hata F. Inui T. Takeuchi T. The active site cysteine of the proapoptotic protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is essential in oxidative stress-induced aggregation and cell death.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26562-26574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the absence of DTT (under a non-reduced condition), treatment with NOC18 significantly increased the amount of GAPDH oligomers and decreased the amount of GAPDH monomers in mitochondrial fractions, whereas in the presence of DTT (under a reduced condition), these changes were abolished, as assessed by both Western blotting and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that NO-induced aggregates are derived from mitochondrial GAPDH. We next evaluated whether GAPDH aggregation leads directly to mitochondrial dysfunction. It has been reported that the detectable amount of GAPDH bound to mitochondria differs depending on the method of isolation (34Letko G. Höfs T. Liese W. Binding of glycolytic enzymes on rat liver mitochondria.Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1973; 30: 365-374PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we attempted to obtain GAPDH-free mitochondria to accurately assess the direct action of GAPDH aggregates on mitochondria. According to the protocol reported previously (38Tanaka Y. Engelender S. Igarashi S. Rao R.K. Wanner T. Tanzi R.E. Sawa A. L. Dawson V. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Inducible expression of mutant α-synuclein decreases proteasome activity and increases sensitivity to mitochondria-dependent apoptosis.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 919-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), successful isolation of mitochondrial fractions was achieved and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 3A, left panel). The absence of GAPDH in the isolated mitochondria was ascertained by Western blotting (Fig. 3A, right panel) and by measuring GAPDH enzyme activity (Fig. 3B). We showed recently that the addition of the GAPDH mutant C152A-GAPDH inhibits NO-induced amyloidogenic aggregation of wild type GAPDH (WT-GAPDH) in vitro (24Kubo T. Nakajima H. Nakatsuji M. Itakura M. Kaneshige A. Azuma Y.T. Inui T. Takeuchi T. Active site cysteine-null glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) rescues nitric oxide-induced cell death.Nitric Oxide. 2016; 53: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, we treated the solutions of isolated mitochondria with aggregates of WT-GAPDH or a mixture containing aggregates of WT- and C152A-GAPDH. Mitochondrial dysfunction was monitored by the degree of mitochondrial swelling and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The treatment of isolated mitochondria with aggregates of WT-GAPDH significantly decreased the turbidity of the solutions, indicating mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 3C, red line and squares) relative to vehicle treatment (Fig. 3C, black line and circles). The mixture containing aggregates of WT- and C152A-GAPDH significantly reduced the degree of swelling compared with that of WT-GAPDH alone (Fig. 3C, blue line and triangles). We also found that treatment with aggregates of WT-GAPDH caused robust mitochondrial membrane depolarization, indicated by an increase in Rho 123 fluorescence (Fig. 3D, red line and squares), and the mixture containing aggregates of WT- and C152A-GAPDH significantly attenuated this mitochondrial membrane depolarization (Fig. 3D, blue line and triangles). Further, we morphologically examined the effects of aggregates of GAPDH on isolated mitochondria using transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 3E, left panels), and mitochondrial swelling was assessed quantitatively (Fig. 3E, right graph). Compared with vehicle treatment, marked mitochondrial swelling was observed after treatment with aggregates of WT-GAPDH, whereas treatment with a mixture containing aggregates of WT- and C152A-GAPDH attenuated but did not abolish the formation of this abnormal morphology (Fig. 3E). Similar to treatment with aggregates of WT-GAPDH, the swelling of isolated mitochondria was observed after treatment with 1 mm Ca2+, which was used as a positive control. These results indicate that NO-induced GAPDH aggregation directly participates in mitochondrial dysfunction. One of the most convincing proposed mechanisms underlying mitochondrial swelling and depolarization is the PTP-induced mitochondrial swelling model (39Ly J.D. Grubb D.R. Lawen A. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in apoptosis: an update.Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Based on this model, using cyclosporin A (CsA), which binds to cyclophilin D and inhibits the opening of PTP (39Ly J.D. Grubb D.R. Lawen A. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in apoptosis: an update.Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), we examined whether aggregates of GAPDH induce mitochondrial dysfunction via PTP opening. The treatment of isolated mitochondria with aggregates of WT-GAPDH for 30 min elicited mitochondrial swelling and depolarization, whereas these alterations were largely prevented by the addition of CsA (Fig. 3, F and G). Together, these results suggest that aggregates of GAPDH directly evoke mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in the swelling and depolarization of mitochondria via the opening of PTP. To investigate the involvement of aggregates of GAPDH in mitochondrial dysfunction at the cellular level, we used doxycycline (DOX)-inducible WT- or C152A-GAPDH-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells. Western blotting performed with an anti-GAPDH antibody showed that NOC18-induced GAPDH aggregation in mitochondrial fractions was augmented by overexpression of WT-GAPDH (by 2-fold) but was significantly attenuated by C152A-GAPDH overexpression (by 0.8-fold) (Fig. 4A). In addition, NOC18-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization was measured in these cells by Rho 123 fluorescence (Fig. 4B). Similar to the results shown in Fig. 3D, NOC18-induced mitochondrial membrane depolarization was significantly increased (by 2-fold) in cells overexpressing WT-GAPDH but inhibited by C152A-GAPDH overexpression (by 0.6-fold) (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that NO-induced aggregation of overexpressed GAPDH induces mitochondrial dysfunction in cells. Initiation of cell death induced by oxidative stress from NO involves mitochondrial membrane depolarization and causes the subsequent release of two cell death mediators from the mitochondria: cyt c, which goes into the cytosol, and AIF, which translocates into the nucleus (39Ly J.D. Grubb D.R. Lawen A. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in apoptosis: an update.Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether cyt c release into the cytosol and/or nuclear translocation of AIF were caused by GAPDH aggregation. Western blotting showed that when SH-SY5Y cells were treated with NOC18, the levels of cytosolic cyt c were significantly increased (Fig. 5A). Further, NOC18-induced release of cyt c was significantly augmented by the overexpression of WT-GAPDH, whereas the release was decreased by overexpression of C152A-GAPDH (Fig. 5B). This result was also observed by immunofluorescence. In the absence of DOX, cyt c partially merged with MitoTracker Red. This mitochondrial cyt c decreased, likely by diffusion into the cytosol, by overexpression of WT-GAPDH in DOX-treated cells. However, the overlap of MitoTracker Red and cyt c was retained by overexpression of C152A-GAPDH (Fig. 5C). Similarly, we confirmed that NOC18 induced nuclear translocation of AIF in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 5D). The levels of AIF in the nuclear fraction from cells treated with NOC18 were significantly incr"

We performed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis on Listeria monocytogenes from food, environmental and clinical sources, identifying two clusters and a single branch, belonging to PCR serogroup IIb and genetic lineage I. WGS Cluster I, representing one outbreak strain, contained 82 food and environmental isolates from Facility I and 4 clinical isolates. These isolates differed by up to 29 SNPs, exhibited 9 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type (ST) 5 of clonal complex 5 (CC5). WGS Cluster II contained 51 food and environmental isolates from Facility II, 4 food isolates from Facility I and 5 clinical isolates. Among them the isolates from Facility II and clinical isolates formed a clade and represented another outbreak strain. Isolates in this clade differed by up to 29 SNPs, exhibited 3 PFGE profiles and ST5. The only isolate collected from Facility III belonged to singleton ST489, which was in a single branch separate from Clusters I and II, and was not associated with the outbreak. WGS analyses clustered together outbreak-associated isolates exhibiting multiple PFGE profiles, while differentiating them from epidemiologically unrelated isolates that exhibited outbreak PFGE profiles. The complete genome of a Cluster I isolate allowed the identification and analyses of putative prophages, revealing that Cluster I isolates differed by the gain or loss of three putative prophages, causing the banding pattern differences among all 3 AscI-PFGE profiles observed in Cluster I isolates. WGS data suggested that certain ice cream varieties and/or production lines might have contamination sources unique to them. The SNP-based analysis was able to distinguish CC5 as a group from non-CC5 isolates and differentiate among CC5 isolates from different outbreaks/incidents."

Optimal control theory is then applied to investigate the optimal strategies for curtailing the spread of the diseases using the use of personal protection, indoor residual spraying and culling of infected reservoirs as the system control variables. Various combination strategies were examined so as to investigate the impact of the controls on the spread of the disease. And we investigated the most cost-effective strategy of all the control strategies using three approaches, the infection averted ratio (IAR), the average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Our results show that the implementation of the strategy combining all the time dependent control variables is the most cost-effective control strategy. This result is further emphasized by using the results obtained from the cost objective functional, the ACER, and the ICER."

Methods This study was a pragmatic randomized, conventional drug controlled, open-labeled clinical trial. After initial screen, 152 eligible participants were averagely randomized to receive two different treatment strategies: Moxibustion and conventional drugs. Participants and practitioners were not blinded in this study. The duration of each treatment was 3 months. The primary outcome was pain relief measured by the Visual Analogue Scale. The menstrual pain severity was recorded in a menstrual pain diary. Results 152 eligible patients were included but only 133 of them eventually completed the whole treatment course. The results showed that the menstrual pain intensity in experimental group and control group was reduced from 6.38±1.28 and 6.41±1.29, respectively, at baseline, to 2.54±1.41 and 2.47±1.29 after treatment. The pain reduction was not significantly different between these two groups (P = 0.76), however; the pain intensity was significantly reduced relative to baseline for each group (P<0.01). Three months after treatment, the effectiveness of moxibustion sustained and started to be superior to the drug’s effect (-0.87, 95%CI -1.32 to -0.42, P<0.01). Secondary outcome analyses showed that moxibustion was as effective as drugs in alleviating menstrual pain-related symptoms. The serum levels of pain mediators, such as PGF2α, OT, vWF, β-EP, PGE2, were significantly improved after treatment in both groups (P<0.05). No adverse events were reported in this trial. Conclusions Both moxibustion and conventional drug showed desirable merits in managing menstrual pain, given their treatment effects and economic costs. This study as a pragmatic trial only demonstrates the effectiveness, not the efficacy, of moxibustion for menstrual pain. It can’t rule out the effect of psychological factors during treatment process, because no blind procedure or sham control was used due to availability. In clinical practice, moxibustion should be used at the discretion of patients and their physicians. Trial registration ClinialTrials.gov NCT01972906"
https://openalex.org/W2587575901,"Background Immigration often results in changes in family dynamics, and within this process of dynamic relational adjustment youth can be conceptualised as contested sites of culture and associated intergenerational conflicts. This paper considers the experiences of migrant youth in Greater Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia using conflict as a useful lens through which to view issues of migrant youth identity and their sense of social connectedness, belonging, and agency. The aim of this study was twofold: 1) to explore how migrant youth cope with acculturative stress and intergenerational conflicts, and 2) to better understand the systemic and family-related factors that facilitate positive settlement experiences for migrant youth. Methods A total of 14 focus group discussions, comprising 164 people, were carried out in Greater Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. These focus groups targeted newly arrived migrant parents and young adults (aged 18–24) of African, Burmese, Nepalese, Indian, Afghani, Bangladeshi and Iraqi backgrounds. Each focus group was 1.5 hours in duration and was conducted by a team of three people (an experienced facilitator, an accredited interpreter/bilingual worker, and a note taker). Data were collected using a standard interview schedule, and an accredited interpreter/bilingual worker asked the questions in the appropriate language and translated participant responses into English. Results The findings highlight how youth in new migrant families become contested sites of culture as they try to balance integration into the new culture while maintaining their originating country’s cultural values. Two themes and four subthemes emerged from the analysis: Intergenerational acculturation gap (loss of family capital and intergenerational conflicts); and factors that successfully protected positive family values while still allowing young people to integrate (the legal system that disarm authoritarian parenting practices and family rules; and parental use of children’s increased knowledge of the new environment to navigate their new environment). Migrant families conceptualised family capital as the social solidarity, influence, and control governing obligations and expectations, intergenerational knowledge transmission and information flow, social norms, and cultural identity. The loss of family capital was characterised by children’s refusal to associate with or meet family members, preferring to be alone in their rooms and private space. Migrant youth find themselves caught between and negotiating two cultures, with unwanted negative consequences at the family level in the form of intergenerational conflicts. The new found freedom among children and their rapid transition into the Australian society gives children an increased sense of agency, which in turn threatens parental authority, allowing children to exercise three forms of power: increased assertiveness due to legal protection of children against any corporal punishment; and English language fluency and greater understanding of the functioning of Australian social institutions. Conclusion Our findings suggest the need for an inter-generational approach to healthy family dynamics within migrant communities when dealing with youth negotiating the complexity and sensitivity of forging their cultural identity."

Intracellular aggregation of TDP-43 is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ubiquitin-positive frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This TDP-43 pathology is also present in other types of neurodegeneration including Alzheimer's disease. We report here that TDP-43 is a substrate of MEK, a central kinase in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. TDP-43 dual phosphorylation by MEK, at threonine 153 and tyrosine 155 (p-T153/Y155), was dramatically increased by the heat shock response (HSR) in human cells. HSR promotes cell survival under proteotoxic conditions by maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing protein misfolding. MEK is activated by HSR and contributes to the regulation of proteome stability. Phosphorylated TDP-43 was not associated with TDP-43 aggregation, and p-T153/Y155 remained soluble under conditions that promote protein misfolding. We found that active MEK significantly alters TDP-43-regulated splicing and that phosphomimetic substitutions at these two residues reduce binding to GU-rich RNA. Cellular imaging using a phospho-specific p-T153/Y155 antibody showed that phosphorylated TDP-43 was specifically recruited to the nucleoli, suggesting that p-T153/Y155 regulates a previously unappreciated function of TDP-43 in the processing of nucleolar-associated RNA. These findings highlight a new mechanism that regulates TDP-43 function and homeostasis through phosphorylation and, therefore, may contribute to the development of strategies to prevent TDP-43 aggregation and to uncover previously unexplored roles of TDP-43 in cell metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2586268859,"Biological networks pervade nature. They describe systems throughout all levels of biological organization, from molecules regulating metabolism to species interactions that shape ecosystem dynamics. The network thinking revealed recurrent organizational patterns in complex biological systems, such as the formation of semi-independent groups of connected elements (modularity) and non-random distributions of interactions among elements. Other structural patterns, such as nestedness, have been primarily assessed in ecological networks formed by two non-overlapping sets of elements; information on its occurrence on other levels of organization is lacking. Nestedness occurs when interactions of less connected elements form proper subsets of the interactions of more connected elements. Only recently these properties began to be appreciated in one-mode networks (where all elements can interact) which describe a much wider variety of biological phenomena. Here, we compute nestedness in a diverse collection of one-mode networked systems from six different levels of biological organization depicting gene and protein interactions, complex phenotypes, animal societies, metapopulations, food webs and vertebrate metacommunities. Our findings suggest that nestedness emerge independently of interaction type or biological scale and reveal that disparate systems can share nested organization features characterized by inclusive subsets of interacting elements with decreasing connectedness. We primarily explore the implications of a nested structure for each of these studied systems, then theorize on how nested networks are assembled. We hypothesize that nestedness emerges across scales due to processes that, although system-dependent, may share a general compromise between two features: specificity (the number of interactions the elements of the system can have) and affinity (how these elements can be connected to each other). Our findings suggesting occurrence of nestedness throughout biological scales can stimulate the debate on how pervasive nestedness may be in nature, while the theoretical emergent principles can aid further research on commonalities of biological networks."

In this study, among the 106,893 transcripts in the head assembly, 8 OBPs and 13 CSPs were identified in B. tabaci MED based on head transcriptomes of adults. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships of B. tabaci OBPs and CSPs with those from several other important Hemipteran species, and the motif-patterns between Hemiptera OBPs and CSPs were also compared by MEME. The expression profiles of the OBP and CSP genes in different tissues of B. tabaci MED adults were analyzed by real-time qPCR. Seven out of the 8 OBPs found in B. tabaci MED were highly expressed in the head. Conversely, only 4 CSPs were enriched in the head, while the other nine CSPs were specifically expressed in other tissues. Our findings pave the way for future research on chemical recognition of B. tabaci at the molecular level."

Our laboratory has demonstrated that exposure of mice to second hand smoke triggers an increase in expression of metalloproteinase-9. Further, metalloproteinase-9 released by second hand smoke—activated leukocytes may propagate pro-atherogenic alterations in endothelial cells. We have shown that levels of metalloproteinase-9 were increased in the plasma from apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE-/-) mice exposed to second hand smoke relative to non-exposed controls. Moreover, we have collected data from two different, but complementary, treatments of second hand smoke exposed atherosclerotic mice. Animals received either cell specific metalloproteinase-9 directed siRNA to minimize metalloproteinase-9 expression in neutrophils and endothelial cells, or a pharmacological inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase which indirectly limits metalloproteinase-9 production in neutrophils. These treatments reduced atherosclerotic changes in mice and improved overall vascular health. We also demonstrated that metalloproteinase-9 could activate endothelial cells and induce their apoptosis via cleavage of protease activated receptor-1. In summary, better understanding of metalloproteinase-9’s pathogenic capabilities as well as novel signaling pathways involved may lead to development of treatments which may provide additional benefits to atherosclerosis patients with a history of second hand smoke exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2586447085,"Costly signaling theory provides an explanation for why humans are willing to a pay a premium for conspicuous products such as luxury brand-labeled clothing or conspicuous environmentally friendly cars. According to the theory, the extra cost of such products is a signal of social status and wealth and leads to advantages in social interactions for the signaler. A previous study found positive evidence for the case of luxury brand labels. However, an issue of this study was that some of the experiments were not conducted in a perfectly double-blind manner. I resolved this by replicating variations of the original design in a double-blind procedure. Additionally, besides the luxury label condition, I introduced a “green” label condition. Thus, the hypothesis that signaling theory is able to explain pro-environmental behavior was tested for the first time in a natural field setting. Further, I conducted experiments in both average and below-average socioeconomic neighborhoods, where, according to signaling theory, the effects of luxury signals should be even stronger. In contrast to the original study, I did not find positive effects of the luxury brand label in any of the five experiments. Nor did I find evidence for a green-signaling effect. Moreover, in poor neighborhoods a negative tendency of the luxury label actually became evident. This suggests that a signaling theory explanation of costly labels must take into account the characteristics of the observers, e.g. their social status."
https://openalex.org/W2586480751,"Fusarium wilt is one of the main diseases of cucumber, and bio-organic fertilizer has been used to control Fusarium wilt. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of bio-organic fertilizer applied at four levels on the suppression of Fusarium wilt disease in cucumber, the soil physico-chemical properties and the microbial communities. In comparison with the control (CK), low concentrations of bio-organic fertilizer (BIO2.5 and BIO5) did not effectively reduce the disease incidence and had little effect on soil microorganisms. High concentrations of bio-organic fertilizer (BIO10 and BIO20) significantly reduced the disease incidence by 33.3%-66.7% and the production was significantly improved by 83.8%-100.3%. The soil population of F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum was significantly lower in bio-organic fertilizer treatments, especially in BIO10 and BIO20. The microorganism activity increased with the bio-organic fertilizer concentration. High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that, at the order level, Sphingomonadales, Bacillales, Solibacterales and Xylariales were significantly abundant in BIO10 and BIO20 soils. At the genus level, the abundance and composition of bacterial and fungal communities in BIO10 and BIO20 were similar, illustrating that high concentrations of bio-organic fertilizer activated diverse groups of microorganisms. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that Xanthomonadales, Sphingomonadales, Bacillales, Orbiliales, Sordariales, and Mucorales occurred predominantly in the BIO10 and BIO20. These microorganisms were related to the organic matter, available potassium and available phosphorus contents. In conclusion, a high concentration of bio-organic fertilizer application suppressed the Fusarium wilt disease and increased cucumber production after continuous cropping might through improving soil chemical condition and manipulating the composition of soil microbial community."
https://openalex.org/W2586777486,"P450 family 4 fatty acid ω-hydroxylases preferentially oxygenate primary C–H bonds over adjacent, energetically favored secondary C–H bonds, but the mechanism explaining this intriguing preference is unclear. To this end, the structure of rabbit P450 4B1 complexed with its substrate octane was determined by X-ray crystallography to define features of the active site that contribute to a preference for ω-hydroxylation. The structure indicated that octane is bound in a narrow active-site cavity that limits access of the secondary C–H bond to the reactive intermediate. A highly conserved sequence motif on helix I contributes to positioning the terminal carbon of octane for ω-hydroxylation. Glu-310 of this motif auto-catalytically forms an ester bond with the heme 5-methyl, and the immobilized Glu-310 contributes to substrate positioning. The preference for ω-hydroxylation was decreased in an E310A mutant having a shorter side chain, but the overall rates of metabolism were retained. E310D and E310Q substitutions having longer side chains exhibit lower overall rates, likely due to higher conformational entropy for these residues, but they retained high preferences for octane ω-hydroxylation. Sequence comparisons indicated that active-site residues constraining octane for ω-hydroxylation are conserved in family 4 P450s. Moreover, the heme 7-propionate is positioned in the active site and provides additional restraints on substrate binding. In conclusion, P450 4B1 exhibits structural adaptations for ω-hydroxylation that include changes in the conformation of the heme and changes in a highly conserved helix I motif that is associated with selective oxygenation of unactivated primary C–H bonds. P450 family 4 fatty acid ω-hydroxylases preferentially oxygenate primary C–H bonds over adjacent, energetically favored secondary C–H bonds, but the mechanism explaining this intriguing preference is unclear. To this end, the structure of rabbit P450 4B1 complexed with its substrate octane was determined by X-ray crystallography to define features of the active site that contribute to a preference for ω-hydroxylation. The structure indicated that octane is bound in a narrow active-site cavity that limits access of the secondary C–H bond to the reactive intermediate. A highly conserved sequence motif on helix I contributes to positioning the terminal carbon of octane for ω-hydroxylation. Glu-310 of this motif auto-catalytically forms an ester bond with the heme 5-methyl, and the immobilized Glu-310 contributes to substrate positioning. The preference for ω-hydroxylation was decreased in an E310A mutant having a shorter side chain, but the overall rates of metabolism were retained. E310D and E310Q substitutions having longer side chains exhibit lower overall rates, likely due to higher conformational entropy for these residues, but they retained high preferences for octane ω-hydroxylation. Sequence comparisons indicated that active-site residues constraining octane for ω-hydroxylation are conserved in family 4 P450s. Moreover, the heme 7-propionate is positioned in the active site and provides additional restraints on substrate binding. In conclusion, P450 4B1 exhibits structural adaptations for ω-hydroxylation that include changes in the conformation of the heme and changes in a highly conserved helix I motif that is associated with selective oxygenation of unactivated primary C–H bonds. Cytochrome P450 family 4 fatty acid ω-hydroxylases are heme-containing monooxygenases that provide pathways for the reduction of potentially toxic non-esterified fatty acids and for the elimination of excess nutritive and non-nutritive lipids by catalyzing the addition of oxygen to a C–H bond of the terminal ω-carbon of fatty acids (1.Hsu M.H.

The resulting ω-alcohols are generally oxidized further to produce dicarboxylic acids, but they also may be transformed to glucuronides or esterified to glycerolipids. Urinary dicarboxylic fatty acids are elevated in humans by fasting or in uncontrolled diabetes, which are conditions where adipocyte lipolysis increases the availability of non-esterified fatty acids to fuel metabolism (3.Mortensen P.B. Gregersen N. The biological origin of ketotic dicarboxylic aciduria: in vivo and in vitro investigations of the ω-oxidation of C6–C16-monocarboxylic acids in unstarved, starved and diabetic rats.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 666: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is estimated that roughly 15% of fatty acids undergo ω-hydroxylation during peak periods of fatty acid catabolism (4.Kam W. Kumaran K. Landau B.R. Contribution of ω-oxidation to fatty acid oxidation by liver of rat and monkey.J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas this fraction is much smaller under conditions where concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids are low (5.Björkhem I. On the quantitative importance of ω-oxidation of fatty acids.J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 585-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these enzymes provide pathways for the metabolic clearance of branched chain fatty acids, eicosanoids, and xenobiotic substrates such as dietary phytanic acid, drugs, toxins, and vitamins E and K (1.Hsu M.H.

Twelve of the 57 cytochrome P450 genes in the human genome encode family 4 P450s, which are assigned to six subfamilies in mammals designated by a letter. P450s 4B1, 4V2, and 4X1 have orthologues in other vertebrate species, whereas the P450 4A and 4F subfamilies exhibit paralogues with differences in the number of genes for these two subfamilies in other species (1.Hsu M.H.

Although these enzymes often exhibit overlapping substrate specificities, genetic association studies link the ω-hydroxylase CYP4V2 to the Bietti's crystalline dystrophy, which is characterized by ocular lipid deposits (7.Nakano M. Kelly E.J. Wiek C. Hanenberg H. Rettie A.E. CYP4V2 in Bietti's crystalline dystrophy: ocular localization, metabolism of ω-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, and functional deficit of the p.

Generation and characterization of a murine model of bietti crystalline dystrophy.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2014; 55: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting a key role for CYP4V2 in the removal of excess lipids in ocular tissues. Furthermore, CYP4F22 genetic variants are associated with lamellar ichthyosis, which reflects deficiencies in the water permeability barrier of skin (9.Ohno Y. Nakamichi S. Ohkuni A. Kamiyama N. Naoe A. Tsujimura H. Yokose U. Sugiura K. Ishikawa J. Akiyama M. Kihara A. Essential role of the cytochrome P450 CYP4F22 in the production of acylceramide, the key lipid for skin permeability barrier formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 7707-7712Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This is likely to reflect the capacity of P450 4F22 to catalyze the ω-hydroxylation of very long chain fatty acids (C28 or greater). The resulting ω-hydroxylated very long chain fatty acids are essential for the formation of acylceramides, which are components of the water permeability layer of the skin. Additionally, some cytochrome P450 ω-hydroxylases, such as human cytochrome P450s 4A11, 4F2, and 4F3b, catalyze the formation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid from arachidonic acid, which contributes to regulation of vascular tone and renal sodium absorption (10.Fan F.

Genetic association studies link variants of human CYP4A11 and CYP4F2 with increased risks for hypertension, which in the case of CYP4A11 is likely to reflect dysregulation of renal sodium uptake as the blood pressure increase is sensitive to levels of dietary salt (12.Laffer C.L.

Fatty acid ω-hydroxylation reflects the addition of oxygen to a primary C–H bond of the terminal carbon of the fatty acid. This reaction is generally considered to be the most difficult reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases because the enzyme needs to exclude access of neighboring and more reactive secondary C–H bonds to the iron-bound reactive oxygen intermediate. The reactive intermediate is formed by the reduction of oxygen bound to the heme iron followed by protonation and heterolytic scission of the dioxygen bond with elimination of the water molecule and formation of a highly electrophilic oxygen atom bound to the hypervalent heme iron. Oxygenation of aliphatic C–H bonds is thought to proceed by abstraction of a hydrogen by the iron oxo intermediate followed by recombination of the resulting substrate radical with the transiently iron-bound hydroxyl radical (14.Groves J.T. McClusky G.A. Aliphatic hydroxylation by highly purified liver microsomal cytochrome P-450. Evidence for a carbon radical intermediate.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). As the strength of primary C–H bonds is greater than that of secondary C–H bonds, oxygen addition at the ω-1 or ω-2 positions of fatty acids is typically seen for less specialized enzymes (15.Korzekwa K.R. Jones J.P. Gillette J.R. Theoretical studies on cytochrome P-450 mediated hydroxylation: a predictive model for hydrogen atom abstractions.J. Am. Chem.

Rydberg P. Rod T.H. Ryde U. Prediction of activation energies for hydrogen abstraction by cytochrome p450.J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 6489-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These considerations suggest that the ω-hydroxylases have structural features that favor the approach to the reactive iron oxo species of the ω-carbon relative to the ω-1 carbon (18.Johnston J.B. Ouellet H. Podust L.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Structural control of cytochrome P450-catalyzed ω-hydroxylation.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2011; 507: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Within human family 4 cytochrome P450 enzymes, the capacity for ω-hydroxylation is associated with a substitution of glutamic acid for the first alanine or glycine in the canonical sequence motif, (A/G)GX(D/E)T (6.Edson K.Z. Rettie A.E. CYP4 enzymes as potential drug targets: focus on enzyme multiplicity, inducers and inhibitors, and therapeutic modulation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) synthase and fatty acid ω-hydroxylase activities.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2013; 13: 1429-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This sequence motif is located on helix I in the active site near the heme iron. The presence of the glutamic acid near the heme iron leads to autocatalytic formation of an ester bond between the glutamic acid and the 5-methyl group of the heme (19.LeBrun L.A. Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Autocatalytic mechanism and consequences of covalent heme attachment in the cytochrome P4504A family.J. Biol.

This covalent linkage is likely to contribute to an active site architecture that favors ω-hydroxylation over (ω-1)-hydroxylation by these enzymes because substitutions of alanine or glycine for the glutamic acid increase the propensity of the enzymes to catalyze ω-1 rather than ω-hydroxylation (21.Zheng Y.M. Baer B.R. Kneller M.B. Henne K.R. Kunze K.L. Rettie A.E.

Additionally, the related human enzymes 4F8 and 4F12 (which have glycine residues at this position) as well as human 4X1 and 4Z1 with the corresponding alanine have not been shown to exhibit a preference for ω-hydroxylation reactions. In contrast, human P450 4X1 catalyzes the 14,15-epoxidation of anandamide (23.Stark K. Dostalek M. Guengerich F.P. Expression and purification of orphan cytochrome P450 4X1 and oxidation of anandamide.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 3706-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); P450 4Z1 catalyzes in-chain hydroxylation of lauric and myristic acids (24.Zöllner A. Dragan C.A. Pistorius D. Müller R. Bode H.B. Peters F.T. Maurer H.H. Bureik M. Human CYP4Z1 catalyzes the in-chain hydroxylation of lauric acid and myristic acid.Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); and P450s 4F8 and 4F12 catalyze (ω-3)-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid (25.Stark K. Wongsud B. Burman R. Oliw E.H.

To identify structural features that underlie the function of family 4 P450s, the structure of rabbit P450 4B1 was determined by X-ray crystallography. P450 4B1 is distinguished from ω-hydroxylases in the 4A, 4F, and 4V2 subfamilies by its increased capacity to catalyze ω-hydroxylation of smaller fatty acids and n-alkanes (C7–C12). P450 4B1 has also been recognized for its role in activation of 4-ipomeanol and perilla ketone in livestock, two pulmonary toxins, as well as activation of small aromatic amines to cytotoxins (26.Wolf C.R. Statham C.N. McMenamin M.G. Bend J.R. Boyd M.R. Philpot R.M.

Rev. 2006; 38: 451-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Rabbit P450 4B1 has been successfully expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and isolated as functionally active full-length and N-terminally truncated enzymes with covalently linked hemes (28.Cheesman M.J. Baer B.R. Zheng Y.M. Gillam E.M. Rettie A.E. Rabbit CYP4B1 engineered for high-level expression in Escherichia coli: ligand stabilization and processing of the N-terminus and heme prosthetic group.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 416: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The expression vector used to express truncated CYP4B1 retains roughly half of the N-terminal transmembrane helix (TMH) of P450 4B1, which is predicted to encompass residues 7–29 using TMHMM (29.Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. Predicting transmembrane protein topology with a hidden Markov model: application to complete genomes.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9084) Google Scholar). The truncated enzyme retained its characteristic preference for hydroxylation of the terminal primary C–H bond of lauric acid, albeit at lower rates than the full-length enzyme (28.Cheesman M.J. Baer B.R. Zheng Y.M. Gillam E.M. Rettie A.E. Rabbit CYP4B1 engineered for high-level expression in Escherichia coli: ligand stabilization and processing of the N-terminus and heme prosthetic group.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 416: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The lower turnover number of the truncated enzyme could reflect altered interactions with P450 reductase when the P450 and P450 reductase are reconstituted. Additionally, the truncated enzyme exhibited 99% covalent linkage of the heme prosthetic group to the protein via an ester bond formed with the side chain of Glu-310 indicating that the enzyme was active in the expression host because the covalent linkage is formed auto-catalytically by the enzyme (28.Cheesman M.J. Baer B.R. Zheng Y.M. Gillam E.M. Rettie A.E.

Biophys. 2003; 416: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reduced flavodoxin is likely to drive reduction of the iron for this reaction as flavodoxin can support the monooxygenase activity of other mammalian microsomal P450s (30.Jenkins C.M. Waterman M.R. Flavodoxin and NADPH-flavodoxin reductase from Escherichia coli support bovine cytochrome P450c17 hydroxylase activities.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27401-27408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we report successful crystallization of the N-terminally truncated enzyme in the presence of octane and determination of its structure to a 2.7-Å limiting resolution. In addition to the covalent linkage between the heme and the protein, the structure exhibits other adaptations that promote the preference of the enzyme for ω-hydroxylation. Comparisons of the amino acid sequence of P450 4B1 with other family 4 ω-hydroxylases indicate that amino acids that restrain octane for ω-hydroxylation are highly conserved in these enzymes. The plasmid, pCW-4B1 #7, was employed for the expression of the previously characterized truncated form of rabbit P450 4B1 in E. coli (28.Cheesman M.J. Baer B.R. Zheng Y.M. Gillam E.M. Rettie A.E. Rabbit CYP4B1 engineered for high-level expression in Escherichia coli: ligand stabilization and processing of the N-terminus and heme prosthetic group.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 416: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The coding sequence was derived from the cDNA (Uniprot, M29852) cloned originally by Gasser and Philpot (31.Gasser R. Philpot R.M. Primary structures of cytochrome P-450 isozyme 5 from rabbit and rat and regulation of species-dependent expression and induction in lung and liver: Identification of cytochrome P-450 gene subfamily IVB.Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 617-625PubMed Google Scholar). This truncated P450 4B1 expression construct encodes amino acids 20–506 at the C terminus of the native protein (UniProt, P15128). Codons encoding Met-Ala precede the native codon for Gly-20 to provide a translation initiation site and an expression optimized second codon. Additionally, codons for Ser-Thr-His-His-His-His-His-His were inserted following the native C terminus of 4B1 to facilitate purification. Although microsomal P450s have generally been expressed and crystallized without their N-terminal membrane-targeting regions, the pCW-4B1 #7 construct retains roughly half of the protein's hydrophobic TMH. The expressed protein binds tightly to membranes, and a mixture of cholic acid and Nonidet P-40 was used to extract the protein from membranes as described previously (28.Cheesman M.J. Baer B.R. Zheng Y.M. Gillam E.M. Rettie A.E. Rabbit CYP4B1 engineered for high-level expression in Escherichia coli: ligand stabilization and processing of the N-terminus and heme prosthetic group.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 416: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Titration of the purified truncated enzyme with octane (Fig. 1) indicated that the protein exhibits a high affinity for binding to octane as judged by conversion of the low spin enzyme to the high spin state (32.Jefcoate C.R. Measurement of substrate and inhibitor binding to microsomal cytochrome P-450 by optical-difference spectroscopy.Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 258-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) with an estimated dissociation constant of 0.34 μm. This value is similar to a Kd of 0.13 μm determined for full-length P450 4B1. The isolated protein was crystallized in the presence of octane, and the structure of the P450 4B1-octane complex was determined using X-ray diffraction data collected from a single crystal at 100 K on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beam line 12-2. Initial phasing was obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser (33.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14444) Google Scholar) as implemented in Phenix (34.Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16439) Google Scholar) with the structure of P450 46A1 (PDB code 2Q9F) as the search model. This search identified the enantiomeric space group as P 32 2 1 with a single protein chain in the asymmetric unit. P450 46A1 (an enzyme that hydroxylates the alkyl side chain of cholesterol) is the most closely related and structurally characterized P450 by sequence similarity. Although the sequence identity was low (<30% identity), detailed 2mFo − DFc and mFo − DFc maps provided evidence for the covalently bound heme prosthetic group, the presence of the substrate octane, and sequence-related side-chain differences. The Autobuild module in Phenix was able to generate an initial model with side chains for much of the core helix bundle as well as backbone traces for other regions of regular secondary structure. The final model was built and refined iteratively against the data to a limiting resolution of 2.70 Å using Coot (35.Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17085) Google Scholar) and Phenix, respectively. The model encompasses residues 20–501 of the protein (Fig. 2A). Residue numbers in the structure correspond to that of the native protein (UniProt, P15128). The five remaining residues of the native protein and the His tag at the C terminus as well as the two amino acids added at the N terminus to facilitate purification and initiate mRNA translation, respectively, could not be modeled. Additionally, residues 196–200 in the connector between helices E and F and residues 272–276 in the connector between helices G and H could not be modeled as these surface loops were not well defined by the electron density maps. The overall fit of the model to the data and quality assessment statistics are documented in Table 1.

One pair, Cys-364 (helix K) and Cys-336 (helix J), with the sulfur atoms separated by 3.6 Å is conserved in other family 4 enzymes. A second pair, Cys-368 (helix K) and Cys-325 (helix I), with their sulfur atoms separated by 4.0 Å is not conserved in family 4B. These distances are too large to reflect covalent bonding between the two pairs of sulfur atoms. As synchrotron radiation can reduce disulfide bonds (36.Roberts B.R. Wood Z.A. Jönsson T.J. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Oxidized and synchrotron cleaved structures of the disulfide redox center in the N-terminal domain of Salmonella typhimurium AhpF.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is possible that one or both pairs were bonded in the protein prior to data collection. The tertiary structure and major elements of secondary structure of the P450 4B1 catalytic domain resemble that of other mammalian microsomal P450s. The distal surface of the catalytic domain from the heme prosthetic group of the enzyme is shown in Fig. 2A. The polypeptide chain of the catalytic domain is traced from red to blue beginning with proline 42. Conserved secondary structures are labeled according to commonly observed conventions for P450s. Substrates bind in an internal cavity above the heme and below helix G. A solvent channel rendered with a transparent surface (Fig. 2A) was identified by MOLE 2.0 (37.Sehnal D. Svobodová Varěková R. Berka K. Pravda L. Navrátilová V. Banáš P. Ionescu C.M. Otyepka M. Koča J. MOLE 2.0: advanced approach for analysis of biomacromolecular channels.J. Cheminform. 2013; 5: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). There is a constriction in the channel with a minimum radius of 1.6 Å that isolates the substrate-binding cavity from the protein surface, and the channel would need to open further for the passage of the substrate or product between the active site and the exterior. The channel branches before reaching the surface with the less restrictive and shorter channel exiting at the protein outer surface between helix F (Fig. 2A, green), helix A (red), and β-sheet 4 (blue). The second and more constricted solvent channel splits from the larger channel and exits between the β-sheet 1 (Fig. 2A, orange and cyan strands), the helix B-C loop (orange-yellow), and the helix F-G′ loop (green). The construct used for crystallization of P450 4B1 retains roughly half, residues 20–29, of the predicted TMH, and residues 7–29 of the native protein. The truncated hydrophobic TMH (Fig. 2A, dark gray) and most of the polar linker region (light gray), which connects the TMH to the catalytic domain, form a continuous A″ helix (gray) that"

Even though histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has shown remarkable antitumor activity in hematological malignancies, it has been less effective in solid tumors, including EOC. Here we report results that may explain the decreased efficiency of HDAC inhibition in EOC, based on our data demonstrating that HDAC inhibition specifically induces expression of IL-8/CXCL8 in SKOV3, CAOV3, and OVCAR3 cells. Suppression or neutralization of vorinostat-induced IL-8/CXCL8 potentiates the vorinostat inhibitory effect on cell viability and proliferation. The IL-8/CXCL8 expression induced by vorinostat in EOC cells is dependent on IκB kinase (IKK) activity and associated with a gene-specific recruitment of IKKα and IKK-dependent recruitment of p65 NFκB to the IL-8/CXCL8 promoter. In addition, HDAC inhibition induces acetylation of p65 and histone H3 and their IL-8/CXCL8 promoter occupancy. In vivo results demonstrate that combining vorinostat and the IKK inhibitor Bay 117085 significantly reduces tumor growth in nude mice compared with control untreated mice or either drug alone. Mice in the combination group had the lowest IL-8/CXCL8 tumor levels and the lowest tumor expression of the murine neutrophil [7/4] antigen, indicating reduced neutrophil infiltration. Together, our results demonstrate that HDAC inhibition specifically induces IL-8/CXCL8 expression in EOC cells and that the mechanism involves IKK, suggesting that using IKK inhibitors may increase the effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors when treating ovarian cancer and other solid tumors characterized by increased IL-8/CXCL8 expression.

Activation of NFκB is mediated by the enzymes of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which, in addition to phosphorylating IκBα, leading to its proteasomal degradation, can phosphorylate NFκB subunits and other transcription factors and cofactors (6.Hinz Hinz Scheidereit Scheidereit The IκB kinase complex in NF-κB regulation and beyond.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15: 46-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 7.Liu Liu Xia Xia Parker Parker Verma Verma IKK biology.Immunol.

Inhibition of HDACs with small molecules has led to the development of HDAC inhibitors (HDIs), which have been used in the treatment of hematological malignancies because they exhibit excellent differential action on normal and cancer cells at therapeutic dosages (19.Marks Marks Richon Richon Rifkind Rifkind Histone deacetylase inhibitors: inducers of differentiation or apoptosis of transformed cells.J.

In contrast, clinical trials with HDIs as single agents in the treatment of solid tumors, including EOC, have produced poor results, but the reasons are largely unknown. Here we show that HDAC inhibition specifically induces IL-8/CXCL8 expression in ovarian cancer cells, resulting in increased cell viability and proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Our in vitro results indicate that the mechanism involves increased nuclear accumulation of p65 NFκB and its gene-specific, IKK-dependent recruitment to the IL-8/CXCL8 promoter, where it is acetylated. Our in vivo results demonstrate that combination of vorinostat and the IKK inhibitor Bay 117085 significantly reduces tumor growth in ovarian cancer xenografts compared with either drug alone. Together, our results suggest that using IKK inhibitors may increase the effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors in ovarian cancer. To determine whether HDAC inhibition regulates expression of NFκB-dependent proinflammatory genes in ovarian cancer cells, we first analyzed IL-8/CXCL8, TNFα, and IL-6 expression in SKOV3 cells incubated for 48 h with vorinostat. Interestingly, although vorinostat significantly increased IL-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 1A) and cytokine release (Fig. 1B), it did not have a substantial effect on TNFα or IL-6 mRNA and cytokine release levels. The increased IL-8 mRNA expression (Fig. 1C) and cytokine release (Fig. 1D) in SKOV3 cells incubated with 1.5 μm vorinostat, which approximately corresponds to the clinically used concentrations (24.Zhang Zhang Richon Richon Ni Ni Talpur Talpur Duvic Duvic Selective induction of apoptosis by histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells: relevance to mechanism of therapeutic action.J.

The IL-8 expression in SKOV3 cells was also significantly induced by romidepsin; 10 nm romidepsin, which approximately corresponds to the clinically used concentrations, increased IL-8 mRNA expression ∼30-fold (Fig. 1E). Fig. 1F illustrates a dose response of IL-8 expression in SKOV3 cells on vorinostat, romidepsin, and apicidin, another class I HDAC inhibitor, on an equimolar basis. To investigate whether HDAC inhibition increases the expression of other NFκB-dependent genes in ovarian cancer cells, we analyzed the mRNA levels of the NFκB-dependent chemokine CXCL5 (epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78, ENA-78), which has the same NFκB binding promoter sequence as IL-8/CXCL8 (12.Singha Singha Gatla Gatla Manna Manna Chang Chang Sanacora Sanacora Poltoratsky Poltoratsky Vancura Vancura Vancurova Vancurova Proteasome inhibition increases recruitment of IκB kinase α (IKKα), S536P-p65, and transcription factor EGR1 to interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter, resulting in increased IL-8 production in ovarian cancer cells.J.

SKOV3 cells were transfected with IL-8-specific or control siRNA and incubated for 48 h with increasing vorinostat concentrations. As expected, vorinostat increased IL-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A) and cytokine release (Fig. 3B) in cells transfected with control siRNA.

Importantly, IL-8 suppression by IL-8-specific siRNA-1 or siRNA-2 significantly potentiated vorinostat-decreased cell viability (Fig. 3C). Suppression of IL-8 by si-RNA-1 also significantly increased apoptosis (Fig. 3D) and decreased the colony formation rate (Fig. 3E) and cell proliferation (Fig. 3F) in vorinostat-treated SKOV3 cells. These results indicated that suppression of vorinostat-induced IL-8 signaling might augment the vorinostat proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects in OC cells. To validate the above results and determine whether they can be duplicated by neutralization of the produced IL-8, we analyzed the viability and proliferation of OC cells incubated for 48 h with vorinostat in the presence of IL-8-neutralizing antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, compared with control mouse IgG1, incubation with mouse anti-IL-8 IgG1 significantly decreased the viability of untreated and vorinostat-treated SKOV3 and CAOV3 cells. IL-8 neutralization also significantly reduced the proliferation of SKOV3 and CAOV3 cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that inhibition of IL-8/CXCL8 signaling enhances the vorinostat antiproliferative effect in OC cells.

To test whether recombinant human IL-8/CXCL8 or CXCL5 proteins could reverse the decreased proliferation of cells incubated with anti-IL-8 antibody, we measured the proliferation of SKOV3 cells incubated in the absence and presence of vorinostat (5 μm, 48 h) with anti-IL-8 antibody and exogenously added recombinant IL-8/CXCL8 or CXCL5 proteins. As shown in Fig. 4D, addition of both IL-8/CXCL8 and CXCL5 proteins was able to reverse the reduced cell proliferation in the presence of anti-IL-8-neutralizing antibody, indicating that the CXCR1/2 receptors are functional. To investigate the transcriptional mechanisms responsible for the vorinostat-induced IL-8 expression in OC cells, we first analyzed the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of NFκB proteins in vorinostat-treated SKOV3 cells. As we have shown previously (12.Singha Singha Gatla Gatla Manna Manna Chang Chang Sanacora Sanacora Poltoratsky Poltoratsky Vancura Vancura Vancurova Vancurova Proteasome inhibition increases recruitment of IκB kinase α (IKKα), S536P-p65, and transcription factor EGR1 to interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter, resulting in increased IL-8 production in ovarian cancer cells.J.

Vorinostat further increased the nuclear levels of p65 and Lys-314/315-acetylated p65, whereas it did not have a marked effect on the nuclear levels of p50 NFκB.

Although p38 inhibition did not have a significant effect on IL-8 expression, IKK inhibition significantly decreased the vorinostat-induced IL-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 5C) and cytokine release (Fig. 5D). To determine whether HDAC inhibition might affect IKK recruitment to the IL-8 promoter, we measured the recruitment of IKKα, IKKα, and IKKɛ to the IL-8 promoter in vorinostat-treated SKOV3 cells by ChIP. Interestingly, although vorinostat markedly increased IKKα recruitment to the IL-8 promoter, it did not have a substantial effect on the recruitment of IKKα or IKKɛ (Fig. 5E). In addition, vorinostat-induced IKKα recruitment to the IL-8 promoter was gene-specific because IKKα recruitment to the TNFα and IL-6 promoters (Fig. 5F) and CXCL5, TGFα1, cIAP-1, and Bcl-2 promoters (data not shown) was much lower. The vorinostat-induced IKKα recruitment to the IL-8 promoter suggested that HDAC inhibition might increase the IKKα expression in OC cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed IKKα, α, and ɛ expression in SKOV3 cells incubated for 48 h with vorinostat. However, as shown in Fig. 5G, vorinostat did not have any significant effect on the IKK mRNA levels. Vorinostat also did not have any significant effect on the protein levels of IKKα (Fig. 5H), indicating that HDAC inhibition specifically increases recruitment of t"
https://openalex.org/W2587290015,"The β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and the predominant adrenergic receptor subtype in the heart, where it mediates cardiac contractility and the force of contraction. Although it is the most important target for β-adrenergic antagonists, such as β-blockers, relatively little is yet known about its regulation. We have shown previously that β1AR undergoes constitutive and regulated N-terminal cleavage participating in receptor down-regulation and, moreover, that the receptor is modified by O-glycosylation. Here we demonstrate that the polypeptide GalNAc-transferase 2 (GalNAc-T2) specifically O-glycosylates β1AR at five residues in the extracellular N terminus, including the Ser-49 residue at the location of the common S49G single-nucleotide polymorphism. Using in vitro O-glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage assays, a cell line deficient in O-glycosylation, GalNAc-T-edited cell line model systems, and a GalNAc-T2 knock-out rat model, we show that GalNAc-T2 co-regulates the metalloproteinase-mediated limited proteolysis of β1AR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that impaired O-glycosylation and enhanced proteolysis lead to attenuated receptor signaling, because the maximal response elicited by the βAR agonist isoproterenol and its potency in a cAMP accumulation assay were decreased in HEK293 cells lacking GalNAc-T2. Our findings reveal, for the first time, a GPCR as a target for co-regulatory functions of site-specific O-glycosylation mediated by a unique GalNAc-T isoform. The results provide a new level of β1AR regulation that may open up possibilities for new therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2586158349,"Brood parasitism frequently leads to a total loss of host fitness, which selects for the evolution of defensive traits in host species. Experimental studies have demonstrated that recognition and rejection of the parasite egg is the most common and efficient defence used by host species. Egg-recognition experiments have advanced our knowledge of the evolutionary and coevolutionary implications of egg recognition and rejection. However, our understanding of the proximate mechanisms underlying both processes remains poor. Egg rejection is a complex behavioural process consisting of three stages: egg recognition, the decision whether or not to reject the putative parasitic egg and the act of ejection itself. We have used the blackbird (Turdus merula) as a model species to explore the relationship between egg recognition and the act of egg ejection. We have manipulated the two main characteristics of parasitic eggs affecting egg ejection in this grasp-ejector species: the degree of colour mimicry (mimetic and non-mimetic, which mainly affects the egg-recognition stage of the egg-rejection process) and egg size (small, medium and large, which affects the decision to eject), while maintaining a control group of non-parasitized nests. The behaviour of the female when confronted with an experimental egg was filmed using a video camera. Our results show that egg touching is an indication of egg recognition and demonstrate that blackbirds recognized (i.e., touched) non-mimetic experimental eggs significantly more than mimetic eggs. However, twenty per cent of the experimental eggs were touched but not subsequently ejected, which confirms that egg recognition does not necessarily mean egg ejection and that accepting parasitic eggs, at least sometimes, is the consequence of acceptance decisions. Regarding proximate mechanisms, our results show that the delay in egg ejection is not only due to recognition problems as usually suggested, given that experimental eggs are not touched significantly more often. Thus, the delay in egg ejection is mainly the consequence of a delay in the decision to eject, probably triggered by mechanical constraints imposed by eggs that are harder to eject (i.e. larger). Our results offer important information on the relationships between recognition and ejection and contribute to a better understanding of host defences against brood parasites."
https://openalex.org/W3020897668,"Background Understanding the spatial distribution of stunting and underlying factors operating at meso-scale is of paramount importance for intervention designing and implementations. Yet, little is known about the spatial distribution of stunting and some discrepancies are documented on the relative importance of reported risk factors. Therefore, the present study aims at exploring the spatial distribution of stunting at meso- (district) scale, and evaluates the effect of spatial dependency on the identification of risk factors and their relative contribution to the occurrence of stunting and severe stunting in a rural area of Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross sectional study was conducted to measure the occurrence of stunting and severe stunting among children aged 0–59 months. Additionally, we collected relevant information on anthropometric measures, dietary habits, parent and child-related demographic and socio-economic status. Latitude and longitude of surveyed households were also recorded. Local Anselin Moran's I was calculated to investigate the spatial variation of stunting prevalence and identify potential local pockets (hotspots) of high prevalence. Finally, we employed a Bayesian geo-statistical model, which accounted for spatial dependency structure in the data, to identify potential risk factors for stunting in the study area. Results Overall, the prevalence of stunting and severe stunting in the district was 43.7% [95%CI: 40.9, 46.4] and 21.3% [95%CI: 19.5, 23.3] respectively. We identified statistically significant clusters of high prevalence of stunting (hotspots) in the eastern part of the district and clusters of low prevalence (cold spots) in the western. We found out that the inclusion of spatial structure of the data into the Bayesian model has shown to improve the fit for stunting model. The Bayesian geo-statistical model indicated that the risk of stunting increased as the child’s age increased (OR 4.74; 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI]:3.35–6.58) and among boys (OR 1.28; 95%BCI; 1.12–1.45). However, maternal education and household food security were found to be protective against stunting and severe stunting. Conclusion Stunting prevalence may vary across space at different scale. For this, it's important that nutrition studies and, more importantly, control interventions take into account this spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of nutritional deficits and their underlying associated factors. The findings of this study also indicated that interventions integrating household food insecurity in nutrition programs in the district might help to avert the burden of stunting."

ADA data generated in Europe during the more than 10 years of ADA monitoring in MS patients treated with interferon beta (IFNβ) and natalizumab have been pooled and characterized through collaboration within a European consortium. The aim of this study was to report on the clinical practice of ADA testing in Europe, considering the number of ADA tests performed and type of ADA assays used, and to determine the frequency of ADA testing against the different drug preparations in different countries. A common database platform (tranSMART) for querying, analyzing and storing retrospective data of MS cohorts was set up to harmonize the data and compare results of ADA tests between different countries. Retrospective data from six countries (Sweden, Austria, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and Denmark) on 20,695 patients and on 42,555 samples were loaded into tranSMART including data points of age, gender, treatment, samples, and ADA results. The previously observed immunogenic difference among the four IFNβ preparations was confirmed in this large dataset. Decreased usage of the more immunogenic preparations IFNβ-1a subcutaneous (s.c.) and IFNβ-1b s.c. in favor of the least immunogenic preparation IFNβ-1a intramuscular (i.m.) was observed. The median time from treatment start to first ADA test correlated with time to first positive test. Shorter times were observed for IFNβ-1b-Extavia s.c. (0.99 and 0.94 years) and natalizumab (0.25 and 0.23 years), which were introduced on the market when ADA testing was already available, as compared to IFNβ-1a i.m. (1.41 and 2.27 years), IFNβ-1b-Betaferon s.c. (2.51 and 1.96 years) and IFNβ-1a s.c. (2.11 and 2.09 years) which were available years before routine testing began. A higher rate of anti-IFNβ ADA was observed in test samples taken from older patients. Testing for ADA varies between different European countries and is highly dependent on the policy within each country. For drugs where routine monitoring of ADA is not in place, there is a risk that some patients remain on treatment for several years despite ADA positivity. For drugs where a strategy of ADA testing is introduced with the release of the drug, there is a reduced risk of having ADA positive patients and thus of less efficient treatment. This indicates that potential savings in health cost might be achieved by routine analysis of ADA."

One of the seven MARV genes encodes the matrix protein VP40, which forms a matrix layer beneath the plasma membrane inner leaflet to facilitate budding from the host cell. MARV VP40 (mVP40) has been shown to be a dimeric peripheral protein with a broad and flat basic surface that can associate with anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine. Although a number of mVP40 cationic residues have been shown to facilitate binding to membranes containing anionic lipids, much less is known on how mVP40 assembles to form the matrix layer following membrane binding. Here we have used hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry to determine the solvent accessibility of mVP40 residues in the absence and presence of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. HDX analysis demonstrates that two basic loops in the mVP40 C-terminal domain make important contributions to anionic membrane binding and also reveals a potential oligomerization interface in the C-terminal domain as well as a conserved oligomerization interface in the mVP40 N-terminal domain. Lipid binding assays confirm the role of the two basic patches elucidated with HD/X measurements, whereas molecular dynamics simulations and membrane insertion measurements complement these studies to demonstrate that mVP40 does not appreciably insert into the hydrocarbon region of anionic membranes in contrast to the matrix protein from Ebola virus.

https://openalex.org/W2587104291,"The yeast Rcf1 protein is a member of the conserved family of proteins termed the hypoxia-induced gene (domain) 1 (Hig1 or HIGD1) family. Rcf1 interacts with components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, in particular the cytochrome bc1 (complex III)-cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) supercomplex (termed III-IV) and the ADP/ATP carrier proteins. Rcf1 plays a role in the assembly and modulation of the activity of complex IV; however, the molecular basis for how Rcf1 influences the activity of complex IV is currently unknown. Hig1 type 2 isoforms, which include the Rcf1 protein, are characterized in part by the presence of a conserved motif, (Q/I)X3(R/H)XRX3Q, termed here the QRRQ motif. We show that mutation of conserved residues within the Rcf1 QRRQ motif alters the interactions between Rcf1 and partner proteins and results in the destabilization of complex IV and alteration of its enzymatic properties. Our findings indicate that Rcf1 does not serve as a stoichiometric component, i.e. as a subunit of complex IV, to support its activity. Rather, we propose that Rcf1 serves to dynamically interact with complex IV during its assembly process and, in doing so, regulates a late maturation step of complex IV. We speculate that the Rcf1/Hig1 proteins play a role in the incorporation and/or remodeling of lipids, in particular cardiolipin, into complex IV and. possibly, other mitochondrial proteins such as ADP/ATP carrier proteins."

Methods Cross-sectional case-control study of 1288 patients with sicca symptoms (587 SS and 701 non-SS sicca) evaluated in a multi-disciplinary research clinic. Smoking patterns were obtained from questionnaire data and disease-related clinical and laboratory data were compared between current, past, ever, and never smokers. Results Current smoking rates were 4.6% for SS patients compared to 14.1% in non-SS sicca (p = 5.17x10E-09), 18% in a local lupus cohort (p = 1.13x10E-14) and 16.8% in the community (p = 4.12x10E-15). Current smoking was protective against SS classification (OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.22–0.56, FDR q = 1.9E10-05), focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.15–0.44, FDR q = 1.52x10E-06), focus score ≥1 (OR 0.22, 95%CI 0.13–0.39, FDR q = 1.43x10E-07), and anti-Ro/SSA(+) (OR 0.36, 95%CI 0.2–0.64, FDR q = 0.0009); ever smoking was protective against the same features and against anti-La/SSB(+) (OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.39–0.70, FDR q = 5.82x10E-05). Duration of smoking was inversely correlated with SS even after controlling for socioeconomic status, BMI, alcohol and caffeine consumption. Conclusions Current tobacco smoking is negatively and independently associated with SS, protecting against disease-associated humoral and cellular autoimmunity. The overall smoking rate amongst SS patients is significantly lower than in matched populations and the effects of smoking are proportional to exposure duration. In spite of the protective effects of tobacco on SS manifestations, it is associated with other serious comorbidities such as lung disease, cardiovascular risk and malignancy, and should thus be strongly discouraged in patients with sicca."

Here we describe a new membrane protein, highly conserved in all Corynebacterineae, that is required for synthesis of full-length LM and LAM. Deletion of the Corynebacterium glutamicum NCgl2760 gene resulted in a complete loss of mature LM/LAM and the appearance of a truncated LM (t-LM). Complementation of the mutant with the NCgl2760 gene fully restored LM/LAM synthesis. Structural studies, including monosaccharide analysis, methylation linkage analysis, and mass spectrometry of native LM species, indicated that the ΔNCgl2760 t-LM comprised a series of short LM species (8–27 residues long) containing an α1–6-linked mannose backbone with greatly reduced α1–2-mannose side chains and no arabinose caps. The structure of the ΔNCgl2760 t-LM was similar to that of the t-LM produced by a C. glutamicum mutant lacking the mptA gene, encoding a membrane α1–6-mannosyltransferase involved in extending the α1–6-mannan backbone of LM intermediates. Interestingly, NCgl2760 lacks any motifs or homology to other proteins of known function. Attempts to delete the NCgl2760 orthologue in Mycobacterium smegmatis were unsuccessful, consistent with previous studies indicating that the M. tuberculosis orthologue, Rv0227c, is an essential gene.

Interestingly, this gene sits within a group of genes involved in synthesis of trehalose corynomycolates, including the recently described tmaT/NCgl2759 gene (Fig. 2A). We conclude that NCgl2760 has a direct role in regulating LM-A/LAM and LM-B synthesis, possibly by regulating the activity of LM mannosyltransferases and/or access of PIM intermediates to these enzymes, and that it may be a therapeutic target in pathogenic mycobacteria species. We have recently shown that the C. glutamicum gene NCgl2759 (orthologue of the essential M. tuberculosis gene, Rv0228) encodes an acetyltransferase that converts trehalose monocorynomycolate (TMCM) to an acetylated form (AcTMCM) and is essential for efficient transport of TMCM across the inner membrane for conversion to trehalose dicorynomycolate (TDCM) (41.Yamaryo-Botte Yamaryo-Botte Rainczuk Rainczuk Lea-Smith Lea-Smith Brammananth Brammananth van der Peet van der Peet Meikle Meikle Ralton Ralton Rupasinghe Rupasinghe Williams Williams Coppel Coppel Crellin Crellin McConville McConville Acetylation of trehalose mycolates is required for efficient MmpL-mediated membrane transport in Corynebacterineae.ACS Chem. Biol. 2015; 10: 734-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether other genes in this locus are involved in trehalose corynomycolate biosynthesis, we investigated the function of NCgl2760, the next gene in the genome of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032. NCgl2760 encodes a putative protein of 272 residues and is the orthologue of M. tuberculosis Rv0227c, sharing 16.4% identity and 24.9% similarity (supplemental Fig. S1) and synteny to Rv0227c and related genes in other mycobacterial genomes (Fig. 2A). NCgl2760 is predicted to contain a single transmembrane domain and a large periplasmic domain (Fig. 2B). To investigate NCgl2760 function, a two-step recombination strategy was used to create an NCgl2760 mutant for phenotypic characterization (Fig. 3). Deletion of the gene was achieved using the suicide vector pK18mobsacB (42.McKean McKean Davies Davies Moore Moore Identification of macrophage induced genes of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis by differential fluorescence induction.Microbes Infect. 2005; 7: 1352-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which carries a kanamycin resistance gene (aph) and Bacillus subtilis sacB gene, conferring sensitivity to sucrose. Potential deletion mutants were identified by PCR screening (data not shown) and then confirmed by Southern blotting analyses (Fig. 3). In contrast to the NCgl2759 null mutant (41.Yamaryo-Botte Yamaryo-Botte Rainczuk Rainczuk Lea-Smith Lea-Smith Brammananth Brammananth van der Peet van der Peet Meikle Meikle Ralton Ralton Rupasinghe Rupasinghe Williams Williams Coppel Coppel Crellin Crellin McConville McConville Acetylation of trehalose mycolates is required for efficient MmpL-mediated membrane transport in Corynebacterineae.ACS Chem. Biol. 2015; 10: 734-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the ΔNCgl2760 strain grew at the same rate as the wild-type (parental) strain on solid media. Growth curves performed in liquid brain heart infusion (BHI) medium confirmed the absence of any detectable growth defect arising from deletion of the NCgl2760 gene (data not shown). This contrasts with the situation in M. tuberculosis, where the gene is regarded as essential (39.Griffin Griffin Gawronski Gawronski Dejesus Dejesus Ioerger Ioerger Akerley Akerley Sassetti Sassetti High-resolution phenotypic profiling defines genes essential for mycobacterial growth and cholesterol catabolism.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002251Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 40.Sassetti Sassetti Boyd Boyd Rubin Rubin Genes required for mycobacterial growth defined by high density mutagenesis.Mol.

Our group generated the monoclonal antibody mAb-A4 against human embryonic stem cells (hESC), which also bound specifically to N-glycans present on 11 of 19 ovarian cancer (OC) and 8 of 14 breast cancer cell lines tested. Normal cell lines and tissue were unstained by mAb-A4. To characterize the N-linked glycan epitopes on OC cell lines targeted by mAb-A4, we used glycosidases, glycan microarray, siRNA, and advanced high sensitivity matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The mAb-A4 epitopes were found to be Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ (H type 1) and Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ (type 1 LacNAc). These structures were found to be present on multiple proteins from hESC and OC. Importantly, endo-β-galactosidase coupled with MALDI-MS allowed these two epitopes, for the first time, to be directly identified on the polylactosamines of N-glycans of SKOV3, IGROV1, OV90, and OVCA433. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of B3GALT5 expression in SKOV3 demonstrated that mAb-A4 binding was dependent on B3GALT5, providing orthogonal evidence of the epitopes' structures. The recognition of oncofetal H type 1 and type 1 LacNAc on OC by mAb-A4 is a novel and promising way to target OC and supports the theory that cancer can acquire stem-like phenotypes. We propose that the orthogonal framework used in this work could be the basis for advancing anti-glycan mAb characterization.

Therefore, a strategy for enhancing the signal of low abundance cellular mAb targets is needed. mAb-A4 was part of a panel of mAbs initially developed by immunizing mice with live pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESC) (29.Choo A.B. Tan H.L. Ang S.N. Fong W.J. Chin A. Lo J. Zheng L. Hentze H. Philp R.J. Oh S.K. Yap M.

Choo A. mAb 84, a cytotoxic antibody that kills undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells via oncosis.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because fetal antigens may be expressed on cancers (oncofetal antigens), it was hypothesized that the mAb-A4 against hESC might recognize cancers. In this study, we characterized the binding of mAb-A4 to a panel of cancer and normal cell lines. Importantly, we elucidated the cellular glycan epitope responsible for mAb-A4 binding in ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3, IGROV1, OV90, and OVCA433 using a multipronged orthogonal approach involving glycosidases, glycan microarray, siRNA knockdown, and advanced high sensitivity mass spectrometry of polyLacNAc. We report that the mAb-A4 epitopes on ovarian cancer cell lines are Fucα1–2Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ (H type 1) and Galβ1-3GlcNAcβ (type 1 LacNAc). These proposed epitopes were confirmed by diagnostic fragments in tandem mass spectrometry and also by siRNA knockdown of the galactosyltransferase gene B3GALT5. FACS analysis found that mAb-A4 bound to hESC, 11 of 19 ovarian cancer cell lines, and 8 of 14 breast cancer cell lines studied (Table 1). In contrast, mAb-A4 did not bind to the normal human cell lines from foreskin fibroblast, lung fibroblast (IMR90), breast epithelial cells (MCF10A), immortalized ovarian surface epithelium (IOSE523), and mesenchymal stem cells from fetal, umbilical, and adult sources. This suggested that although the mAb-A4 antigen was not present on all ovarian or breast cancer cell lines, its expression was restricted to the cancer state.Table 1mAb-A4 binding to cancer and normal cell lines on flow cytometryCell lineBindinghESC HES-3+++Ovarian cancer OVCA433+++ CH1+++ HEY+++ CaOV3++ IGROV1++ OV90++ OVCAR3++ PEA 1++ SKOV3++ HEY A8+ HEY C2+ A2780− COLO720E− OV17R− OVCAR8− OVCAR10− OVCA432− PEO 14− TOV112D−Breast cancer BT474+++ MCF7+++ CAMA1+++ HCC2218+++ HCC1954+++ MB231+++ MDA453++ HCC1395+ HCC1937− BT20− BT549− HS578T− T47D− SKBR3−Normal IOSE523 (ovary)− MCF10A (breast)− HFF (human foreskin fibroblast)− IMR90 (fibroblast)− Fetal MSC− Umbilical MSC− Adult MSC− Open table in a new tab To characterize the mAb-A4 epitope, the ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV3 was chosen as the model cell line based on strong binding of the mAb in FACS, high growth rate, and available prior work on its glycome (10.Machado E.

The mean fluorescence of mAb-A4 staining on hESC and SKOV3 on FACS was 2 orders of magnitude higher than the negative control (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the binding profile on IOSE523 was identical to the negative control, indicating that the epitope was not expressed on the surface or was inaccessible on IOSE523. Interestingly, mAb-A4 also had a direct cytotoxic effect against hESC and SKOV3 within 1 h of incubation, as measured by propidium iodide exclusion assay. After mAb-A4 was added, cell viability decreased from 47.9 to 0.83% in hESC and from 90.1 to 27.0% in SKOV3 (Fig. 1B). This cytotoxic effect of mAb-A4 was also seen in the high binding OC cell lines (Table 1). In contrast, mAb-A4 was not cytotoxic to IOSE523, consistent with the lack of binding to this cell line (Fig. 1). In an initial screen using tissue microarrays, mAb-A4 positively stained tumor tissue from breast, ovary, testis, lung, pancreas, bone, and small intestine but was unreactive with normal breast stroma, testis, liver, ovary, and skin (supplemental Fig. 1). Staining of adenocarcinoma of breast, lung, and small intestine was ductal, whereas staining of adenocarcinomas of ovary and pancreas was homogeneous. This initial screen suggested that mAb-A4 could potentially target malignant cells in a clinical setting. The mAb-A4 antigen in SKOV3 was found by immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by Western blotting to be a smear from 40 to 191 kDa with more intense regions at 51, 60, and 100 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 5). This staining of IP product was similar to that of SKOV3 whole cell lysate (Fig. 3E, lane 4), suggesting that IP with mAb-A4 successfully enriched its antigen from the cell lysate. The presence of the smear suggested that the mAb-A4 antigen was a glycoprotein.Figure 3Identifying potential epitopes targeted by mAb-A4.

Oligosaccharides used were Lewis X (LeX), Lewis Y (LeY), Lewis A (LeA), Lewis B (LeB), blood group A (bgA), blood group B (bgB), H type 1 (H1), and H type 2 (H2). All data were representative of three biological replicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Removing N-glycans from the antigen using PNGaseF abolished mAb-A4 binding (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). In contrast, mAb-A4 binding was unaffected by removal of sialic acid (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 6) or removal of O-glycans (lane 5). As a positive control for removal of O-glycans, mAb-84 binding to O-glycans of hESC was abolished by on-blot β-elimination, as expected (Fig. 2B) (30.Tan H.L. Fong W.J. Lee E.H. Yap M. Choo A. mAb 84, a cytotoxic antibody that kills undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells via oncosis.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, tunicamycin treatment reduced mAb-A4 binding by almost half (mean fluorescence decreased by 45 ± 15%) and raised cell viability from 27.3 ± 5.7% to 82.0 ± 7.1% live cells (Fig. 2, C–F). Tunicamycin treatment also abolished the Western blotting signal for mAb-A4 (Fig. 11F, lane 6). Therefore, mAb-A4 binding was demonstrated to be dependent on N-glycans and not O-glycans. To identify the unknown epitope, mAb-A4 binding to a panel of oligosaccharides was tested. Without any soluble oligosaccharide added, mAb-A4 bound to and was cytotoxic to HES-3 (<5% viable cells after 1 h) and SKOV3 (<30% viable cells after 1 h) (Fig. 3, A–C). This binding and cytotoxicity to HES-3 was blocked only by preincubation of mAb-A4 with the H type 1 trisaccharide, causing a 10-fold decrease in mean fluorescence and a rescue from <5 to 62% relative viability (Fig. 3, A and B). This inhibition by the H type 1 trisaccharide on binding and cytotoxicity was also observed for SKOV3 (100-fold decrease in mean fluorescence, rescued from 30 to 98% relative viability). When other fucosylated oligosaccharides were screened, only Lewis B tetrasaccharide had a blocking effect (10-fold decrease in mean fluorescence and rescued from 30 to 83% relative viability) (Fig. 3, A and C). In contrast, Lewis A, Lewis X, and Lewis Y had no effect on binding and cytotoxicity of mAb-A4 to SKOV3. Lewis B also partially blocked mAb-A4 on Western blotting of SKOV3 IP product (Fig. 3D, lane 2), whereas H type 1 completely blocked mAb-A4 (lane 3). Therefore, blocking was stronger when Fucα1–2 was present on Gal. In addition, because the glycans H type 2 and Lewis Y (both having type 2 LacNAc) were unable to block mAb-A4, we hypothesized that the type 1 LacNAc structure was also important to mAb-A4 binding. Comparing the strongly blocking H type 1 to the partially blocking Lewis B, adding Fucα1–4 to GlcNAc inhibited the binding, possibly by steric hindrance. Taken together, the preceding data suggested that type 1 LacNAc was critical to mAb-A4 binding and that α2-fucosylation of Gal improved binding, whereas fucosylation of GlcNAc hindered binding. To identify possible glycan epitopes, mAb-A4 was used to probe two different glycan microarrays. On the glycosylamine array, glycans that gave the highest signal had the common epitopes of type 1 LacNAc or H type 1 (Fig. 4A). The low binders were likely to be binding non-specifically. Lewis B, which blocked mAb-A4 binding at 2 mm, was a non-binder on this array. Similar results were obtained on a PNPA glycan microarray (Fig. 4B). The high binders were H type 1, followed by type 1 LacNAc. The signal produced by sialyl type 1 was due to the presence of contaminating (desialylated) type 1 LacNAc as determined by HPLC (data not shown). The very low binders were Lewis A and Lewis B and could be due to nonspecific binding. The results from two glycan microarrays with different attachment chemistries corroborated. We hypothesized that mAb-A4 was targeting H type 1 and, to a lesser extent, also type 1 LacNAc on N-glycans on ovarian cancer cells. Next, the presence of H type 1 or type 1 LacNAc on ovarian cancer cell lines was investigated. To determine the cellular glycan target, total N-glycans were analyzed on MALDI-TOF as permethylated sodiated adducts in the positive mode (supplemental Fig. 3). Sialylated structures were more abundant than fucosylated structures and hindered identification of fucosylated structures by MS/MS. Therefore, to better identify potentially fucosylated structures, the N-glycans were desialylated (Fig. 5). The desialylated N-glycome consisted of high mannose and core-fucosylated complex-type N-glycans. Bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary structures were observed. Outer-arm fucosylated glycans were present but were less abundant than non-fucosylated antennae. For example, the biantennary glycan at m/z 2244 was five times more intense than the m/z 2418 species with one antennal fucose (Fig. 5). This pattern was repeated for the tri- and tetra-antennary structures at m/z 2693/2867 and 3142/3316, respectively. This indicated that although there are active outer-arm fucosyltransferases in SKOV3, the fucosylation of antennae does not go to completion. No sialyl Lewis antigens were observed by MS/MS in the non-desialylated N-glycome (supplemental Fig. 3). In other words, antennae were either sialylated or fucosylated, but not both. Glycans with potential polyLacNAc antennae were detected above m/z 3400 and were confirmed by MS/MS to have up to (LacNAc)3 (the m/z 1384 fragment ion). Sensitivity of these peaks to endo-β-galactosidase provided additional confirmation of polyLacNAc structures (supplemental Fig. 2). From the comprehensive MS/MS analysis done on many of the peaks, four representative glycans (m/z 3286, 3490, 4215, and 4664) were chosen to demonstrate the pool of p"
https://openalex.org/W2586757673,"Expert’s risk evaluation of radiation exposure strongly influences the public’s risk perception. Experts can inform laypersons of significant radiation information including health knowledge based on experimental data. However, some experts’ radiation risk perception is often based on non-conclusive scientific evidence (i.e., radiation levels below 100 millisievert), which is currently under debate. Examining perception levels among experts is important for communication with the public since these individual’s opinions have often exacerbated the public’s confusion. We conducted a survey of Korean radiation researchers to investigate their perceptions of the risks associated with radiation exposure below 100 millisievert. A linear regression analysis revealed that having ≥ 11 years’ research experience was a critical factor associated with radiation risk perception, which was inversely correlated with each other. Increased opportunities to understand radiation effects at < 100 millisievert could alter the public’s risk perception of radiation exposure. In addition, radiation researchers conceived that more scientific evidence reducing the uncertainty for radiation effects < 100 millisievert is necessary for successful public communication. We concluded that sustained education addressing scientific findings is a critical attribute that will affect the risk perception of radiation exposure."

https://openalex.org/W2586525951,"Introduction The emergence of urinary retention (UR), specifically acute urinary retention (AUR), has been a concern when treating men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with antimuscarinic drugs. Materials and methods In NEPTUNE (12-week, double-blind), men (≥45 years) with LUTS were randomized to receive tamsulosin oral-controlled absorption system (TOCAS) 0.4 mg, fixed-dose combination (FDC) of solifenacin (Soli) 6 mg + TOCAS 0.4 mg, FDC Soli 9 mg + TOCAS 0.4 mg, or placebo. In NEPTUNE II (40-week, open-label extension of NEPTUNE), continuing patients received 4-week FDC Soli 6 mg + TOCAS, then FDC Soli 6 mg or 9 mg + TOCAS for the remainder of the study, switchable every 3 months. Results Across both studies, 1208 men received ≥1 dose of FDC Soli 6 mg or 9 mg + TOCAS for up to 52 weeks; 1199 men completed NEPTUNE and 1066 received ≥1 dose in NEPTUNE II. In total, 13 men (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.6%–1.8%) reported a UR event while receiving FDC, eight of which were AUR (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.3%–1.3%, incidence 7/1000 man-years). Six men reported UR events while taking Soli 6 mg + TOCAS (three AUR), and seven men reported a UR event while taking Soli 9 mg + TOCAS (five AUR). One man developed AUR while taking TOCAS alone and four reported UR (three AUR) during placebo run-in. Most AUR/UR events occurred within 4 months of treatment initiation. Conclusions FDC Soli and TOCAS was associated with a low rate of UR and AUR in men with LUTS."
https://openalex.org/W2587006487,"Climatic and biome changes of the past million years influenced the population structure and genetic diversity of soil-living arthropods in Europe. However, their effects on the genetic structure of widespread and abundant soil animal species such as the Collembola Parisotoma notabilis remain virtually unknown. This generalist and parthenogenetic species is an early colonizer of disturbed habitats and often occurs in human modified environments. To investigate ancient climatic influence and recent distributions on the genetic structure of P. notabilis we analyzed populations on a pan-European scale using three genetic markers differing in substitution rates. The results showed that P. notabilis comprises several genetic lineages with distinct distribution ranges that diverged in the Miocene. Genetic distances of COI between lineages ranged between 15% and 18% and molecular clock estimates suggest Late Miocene divergences considering the standard arthropod rate of 2.3% per my. Compared to other soil-living arthropods like oribatid mites, European lineages of P. notabilis are rather young and genetically uniform. The close association with anthropogenic habitats presumably contributed to rapid spread in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2587400763,"Background Hepatocyte poliploidization is an age-dependent process, being cytokinesis failure the main mechanism of polyploid hepatocyte formation. Our aim was to study the role of p38α MAPK in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cytokinesis in hepatocytes during development and aging. Methods Wild type and p38α liver-specific knock out mice at different ages (after weaning, adults and old) were used. Results We show that p38α MAPK deficiency induces actin disassembly upon aging and also cytokinesis failure leading to enhanced binucleation. Although the steady state levels of cyclin D1 in wild type and p38α knock out old livers remained unaffected, cyclin B1- a marker for G2/M transition- was significantly overexpressed in p38α knock out mice. Our findings suggest that hepatocytes do enter into S phase but they do not complete cell division upon p38α deficiency leading to cytokinesis failure and binucleation. Moreover, old liver-specific p38α MAPK knock out mice exhibited reduced F-actin polymerization and a dramatic loss of actin cytoskeleton. This was associated with abnormal hyperactivation of RhoA and Cdc42 GTPases. Long-term p38α deficiency drives to inactivation of HSP27, which seems to account for the impairment in actin cytoskeleton as Hsp27-silencing decreased the number and length of actin filaments in isolated hepatocytes. Conclusions p38α MAPK is essential for actin dynamics with age in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2587016553,"Arabidopsis thaliana SAG12, a senescence-specific gene encoding a cysteine protease, is widely used as a molecular marker for the study of leaf senescence. To date, its potential orthologues have been isolated from several plant species such as Brassica napus and Nicotiana tabacum. However, little information is available in rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), a rubber-producing plant of the Euphorbiaceae family. This study presents the identification of SAG12-like genes from the rubber tree genome. Results showed that an unexpected high number of 17 rubber orthologues with a single intron were found, contrasting the single copy with two introns in Arabidopsis. The gene expansion was also observed in another two Euphorbiaceae plants, castor bean (Ricinus communis) and physic nut (Jatropha curcas), both of which contain 8 orthologues. In accordance with no occurrence of recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) events, most duplicates in castor and physic nut were resulted from tandem duplications. In contrast, the duplicated HbSAG12H genes were derived from tandem duplications as well as the recent WGD. Expression analysis showed that most HbSAG12H genes were lowly expressed in examined tissues except for root and male flower. Furthermore, HbSAG12H1 exhibits a strictly senescence-associated expression pattern in rubber tree leaves, and thus can be used as a marker gene for the study of senescence mechanism in Hevea."
https://openalex.org/W2587295270,"Date palm cultivation is economically important in the Sultanate of Oman, with significant financial investments coming from both the government and private individuals. However, a widespread Dubas bug (DB) (Ommatissus lybicus Bergevin) infestation has impacted regions including the Middle East, North Africa, Southeast Russia, and Spain, resulting in widespread damages to date palms. In this study, techniques in spatial statistics including ordinary least squares (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GRW), and exploratory regression (ER) were applied to (a) model the correlation between DB infestations and human-related practices that include irrigation methods, row spacing, palm tree density, and management of undercover and intercropped vegetation, and (b) predict the locations of future DB infestations in northern Oman. Firstly, we extracted row spacing and palm tree density information from remote sensed satellite images. Secondly, we collected data on irrigation practices and management by using a simple questionnaire, augmented with spatial data. Thirdly, we conducted our statistical analyses using all possible combinations of values over a given set of candidate variables using the chosen predictive modelling and regression techniques. Lastly, we identified the combination of human-related practices that are most conducive to the survival and spread of DB. Our results show that there was a strong correlation between DB infestations and several human-related practices parameters (R2 = 0.70). Variables including palm tree density, spacing between trees (less than 5 x 5 m), insecticide application, date palm and farm service (pruning, dethroning, remove weeds, and thinning), irrigation systems, offshoots removal, fertilisation and labour (non-educated) issues, were all found to significantly influence the degree of DB infestations. This study is expected to help reduce the extent and cost of aerial and ground sprayings, while facilitating the allocation of date palm plantations. An integrated pest management (IPM) system monitoring DB infestations, driven by GIS and remote sensed data collections and spatial statistical models, will allow for an effective DB management program in Oman. This will in turn ensure the competitiveness of Oman in the global date fruits market and help preserve national yields."
https://openalex.org/W2587720736,"Northern red oak is a high-value hardwood used for lumber, furniture and veneer. Intensively managed northern red oak seed orchards are required to obtain genetic gain for trait improvement. Data from conifer seed orchards and natural and managed stands of hardwood trees have shed light on the distance over which pollen can move, and underscore the need for managerial attention to seed orchard design, placement, and maintenance. We used eleven microsatellite markers to investigate pollen gene flow, female mate choice, and male reproductive success in a clonal seed orchard of northern red oak based on paternity analysis of seed orchard offspring in progeny tests. Nearly all (93%) offspring were sired by a male parent within the seed orchard. The mean number of male parents per year was 69.5, or 47.6% of all clones in the seed orchard. Female clones in the early phenology group had more offspring sired from extra-orchard pollen (13%) than clones in the intermediate (5%) and late (1%) phenology groups. Distance was the largest influence on pollination success, and pollination occurred most often by male trees in the same subline as the maternal tree. Males in the early phenology group sired more offspring overall in the progeny pool and more offspring per mother tree than males in the intermediate or late phenology groups. Average genetic correlations among all OP progeny ranged between 0.2557 and 0.3529 with a mean of 0.28±0.01. The importance of progeny test genotyping for northern red oak improvement likely is increasing with the demand for improved varieties. The current study demonstrated the feasibility of post hoc assembly of full-sib families for genetic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2586059580,"Purpose To develop the treatment algorithm from multivariate survival analyses (MVA) in patients with Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) C (advanced) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with Trans-arterial Chemoembolization (TACE). Methods Consecutive unresectable and non-tranplantable patients with advanced HCC, who received DEB TACE were studied. A total of 238 patients (mean age, 62.4yrs) was included in the study. Survivals were analyzed according to different parameters from the time of the 1st DEB TACE. Kaplan Meier and Cox Proportional Hazard model were used for survival analysis. The SS was constructed from MVA and named BCLC C HCC Prognostic (BCHP) staging system (SS). Results Overall median survival (OS) was 16.2 months. In HCC patients with venous thrombosis (VT) of large vein [main portal vein (PV), right or left PV, hepatic vein, inferior vena cava] (22.7%) versus small vein (segmental/subsegmental PV) (9.7%) versus no VT had OSs of 6.4 months versus 20 months versus 22.8 months respectively (p<0.001). On MVA, the significant independent prognostic factors (PFs) of survival were CP class, eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status (PS), single HCC<5 cm, site of VT, metastases, serum creatinine and serum alpha-feto protein. Based on these PFs, the BCHP staging system was constructed. The OSs of stages I, II and III were 28.4 months, 11.8 months and 2.4 months accordingly (p<0.001). The treatment plan was proposed according to the different stages. Conclusion On MVA of patients with advanced HCC treated with TACE, significant independent prognostic factors (PFs) of survival were CP class, ECOG PS, single HCC<5 cm or others, site of VT, metastases, serum creatinine and serum alpha-feto protein. New BCHP SS was proposed based on MVA data to identify the suitable advanced HCC patients for TACE treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2557801926,"The affiliation with various social groups can be a critical factor when it comes to quality of life of each individual, making such groups an essential element of every society. The group dynamics, longevity and effectiveness strongly depend on group’s ability to attract new members and keep them engaged in group activities. It was shown that high heterogeneity of scientist’s engagement in conference activities of the specific scientific community depends on the balance between the numbers of previous attendances and non-attendances and is directly related to scientist’s association with that community. Here we show that the same holds for leisure groups of the Meetup website and further quantify individual members’ association with the group. We examine how structure of personal social networks is evolving with the event attendance. Our results show that member’s increasing engagement in the group activities is primarily associated with the strengthening of already existing ties and increase in the bonding social capital. We also show that Meetup social networks mostly grow trough big events, while small events contribute to the groups cohesiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2587517240,"We present new results concerning probability distributions of times in the coalescence tree and expected allele frequencies for coalescent with large sample size. The obtained results are based on computational methodologies, which involve combining coalescence time scale changes with techniques of integral transformations and using analytical formulae for infinite products. We show applications of the proposed methodologies for computing probability distributions of times in the coalescence tree and their limits, for evaluation of accuracy of approximate expressions for times in the coalescence tree and expected allele frequencies, and for analysis of large human mitochondrial DNA dataset."
https://openalex.org/W2586653685,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic structure, and evolutionary history have been studied for years by several genotyping approaches, but delineation of a few sublineages remains controversial and needs better characterization. This is particularly the case of T group within lineage 4 (L4) which was first described using spoligotyping to pool together a number of strains with ill-defined signatures. Although T strains were not traditionally considered as a real phylogenetic group, they did contain a few phylogenetically meaningful sublineages as shown using SNPs. We therefore decided to investigate if this observation could be corroborated using other robust genetic markers. We consequently made a first assessment of genetic structure using 24-loci MIRU-VNTRs data extracted from the SITVIT2 database (n = 607 clinical isolates collected in Russia, Albania, Turkey, Iraq, Brazil and China). Combining Minimum Spanning Trees and Bayesian population structure analyses (using STRUCTURE and TESS softwares), we distinctly identified eight tentative phylogenetic groups (T1-T8) with a remarkable correlation with geographical origin. We further compared the present structure observed with other L4 sublineages (n = 416 clinical isolates belonging to LAM, Haarlem, X, S sublineages), and showed that 5 out of 8 T groups seemed phylogeographically well-defined as opposed to the remaining 3 groups that partially mixed with other L4 isolates. These results provide with novel evidence about phylogeographically specificity of a proportion of ill-defined T group of M. tuberculosis. The genetic structure observed will now be further validated on an enlarged worldwide dataset using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)."
https://openalex.org/W2586939348,"In a rural district hospital in Burundi offering Emergency Obstetric care-(EmOC), we assessed the a) characteristics of women at risk of, or with an obstetric complication and their types b) the number and type of obstetric surgical procedures and anaesthesia performed c) human resource cadres who performed surgery and anaesthesia and d) hospital exit outcomes.A retrospective analysis of EmOC data (2011 and 2012).A total of 6084 women were referred for EmOC of whom 2534(42%) underwent a major surgical procedure while 1345(22%) required a minor procedure (36% women did not require any surgical procedure). All cases with uterine rupture(73) and extra-uterine pregnancy(10) and the majority with pre-uterine rupture and foetal distress required major surgery. The two most prevalent conditions requiring a minor surgical procedure were abortions (61%) and normal delivery (34%). A total of 2544 major procedures were performed on 2534 admitted individuals. Of these, 1650(65%) required spinal and 578(23%) required general anaesthesia; 2341(92%) procedures were performed by 'general practitioners with surgical skills' and in 2451(96%) cases, anaesthesia was provided by nurses. Of 2534 hospital admissions related to major procedures, 2467(97%) were discharged, 21(0.8%) were referred to tertiary care and 2(0.1%) died.Overall, the obstetric surgical volume in rural Burundi is high with nearly six out of ten referrals requiring surgical intervention. Nonetheless, good quality care could be achieved by trained, non-specialist staff. The post-2015 development agenda needs to take this into consideration if it is to make progress towards reducing maternal mortality in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2587170806,"Inferring the structure of molecular networks from time series protein or gene expression data provides valuable information about the complex biological processes of the cell. Causal network structure inference has been approached using different methods in the past. Most causal network inference techniques, such as Dynamic Bayesian Networks and ordinary differential equations, are limited by their computational complexity and thus make large scale inference infeasible. This is specifically true if a Bayesian framework is applied in order to deal with the unavoidable uncertainty about the correct model. We devise a novel Bayesian network reverse engineering approach using ordinary differential equations with the ability to include non-linearity. Besides modeling arbitrary, possibly combinatorial and time dependent perturbations with unknown targets, one of our main contributions is the use of Expectation Propagation, an algorithm for approximate Bayesian inference over large scale network structures in short computation time. We further explore the possibility of integrating prior knowledge into network inference. We evaluate the proposed model on DREAM4 and DREAM8 data and find it competitive against several state-of-the-art existing network inference methods."
https://openalex.org/W2587055548,"The inadequate efficiency of existing therapeutic anti-cancer regiments and the increase in the multidrug resistance of cancer cells underscore the need to investigate novel anticancer strategies. The induction of apoptosis in tumors by cytotoxic agents produced by pathogenic microorganisms is an example of such an approach. Nevertheless, even the most effective drug should be delivered directly to targeted sites to reduce any negative impact on other cells. Accordingly, the stabilized nanosystem (SNS) for active agent delivery to cancer cells was designed for further application in local anti-tumor therapy. A product of genetically modified Escherichia coli, listeriolysin O (LLO), was immobilized within the polyelectrolyte membrane (poly(ethylenimine)|hyaluronic acid) shells of 'LLO nanocarriers' coupled with the stabilizing element of natural origin.The impact of LLO was evaluated in human leukemia cell lines in vitro. Correspondingly, the influence of the SNS and its elements was assessed in vitro. The viability of targeted cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Visualization of the system structure was performed using confocal microscopy. The membrane shell applied to the nanocarriers was analyzed using atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Furthermore, the presence of a polyelectrolyte layer on the nanocarrier surface and/or in the cell was confirmed by flow cytometry. Finally, the structural integrity of the SNS and the corresponding release of the fluorescent solute listeriolysin were investigated.The construction of a stabilized system offers LLO release with a lethal impact on model eukaryotic cells. The applied platform design may be recommended for local anti-tumor treatment purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2586200005,"Cryopreservation of zebrafish embryos is still an unsolved problem despite market demand and massive efforts to preserve genetic variation among numerous existing lines. Chilled storage of embryos might be a step towards developing successful cryopreservation, but no methods to date have worked.In the present study, we applied a novel strategy to improve the chilling tolerance of zebrafish embryos by introducing a preconditioning hydrostatic pressure treatment to the embryos. In our experiments, 26-somites and Prim-5 stage zebrafish embryos were chilled at 0°C for 24 hours after preconditioning. Embryo survival rate, ability to reach maturation and fertilizing capacity were tested.Our results indicate that applied preconditioning technology made it possible for the chilled embryos to develop normally until maturity, and to produce healthy offspring as normal, thus passing on their genetic material successfully. Treated embryos had a significantly higher survival and better developmental rate, moreover the treated group had a higher ratio of normal morphology during continued development. While all controls from chilled embryos died by 30 day-post-fertilization, the treated group reached maturity (~90-120 days) and were able to reproduce, resulting in offspring in expected quantity and quality.Based on our results, we conclude that the preconditioning technology represents a significant improvement in zebrafish embryo chilling tolerance, thus enabling a long-time survival. Furthermore, as embryonic development is arrested during chilled storage this technology also provides a solution to synchronize or delay the development."
