https://openalex.org/W1972222251,"Autologous fragments of transplanted marrow have survived in various extramedullary sites in the rat, rabbit, and dog. Survival of the fragments occurs with a complete reconstitution of the hemopoietic and adventitial structures. The process originates from a network of surviving reticular cells which proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts and give rise to trabecular bone. Later, the reticular cells reconstruct the marrow's microcirculation. Hemopoietic repopulation of the marrow implant takes place only after its sinusoidal microcirculation has been established."

https://openalex.org/W1573318520,"Abstract The levels of glycogen, glucose, glucose-6-P, the sum of fructose diphosphate plus dihydroxyacetone-P, ATP, and the pyridine nucleotides were measured in endocrine and exocrine tissue of the pancreas of obese hyperglycemic mice. Sorbitol was determined in both types of tissue after a single intravenous injection of the compound. Quantitative histochemical techniques were employed. The necessary analytical sensitivity was achieved by working in small volumes under oil and by using enzymatic methods in combination with cycling assays for pyridine nucleotides. In islet tissue the levels of glycogen and glucose were much higher than in the acinar tissue. Concentrations of glucose in islets were equal to those in blood over a concentration range from 5 to 100 mm. Acinar tissue, on the contrary, contained much less glucose than the blood. When blood glucose levels were low, glucose-6-P levels were about the same in islet and acinar tissue, but with increasing blood glucose, glucose-6-P rose to very high levels in islets whereas acinar levels increased only to a moderate degree. In islets, fructose diphosphate plus dihydroxyacetone-P also increased greatly when blood glucose rose. The velocities of glucose penetration and of glucose-6-P accumulation in β-cells were as rapid as other authors have observed to be true for the onset of insulin release. It was found that sorbitol can enter islet cells, but the rate appeared to be much slower than in the case of glucose. The extracellular space of islets and acini, based on the rapid initial distribution of sorbitol between serum and tissue, was calculated to be 39 and 26%, respectively, of the tissue water. A study in vitro of glucose phosphorylation by islet tissue indicated the presence of two enzymes, one with high and one with low affinity for glucose. Islet but not acinar tissue hydrolyzed glucose 6-phosphate. A scheme for the early steps of glucose metabolism in the β-cells is presented, and the possible significance of the findings regarding the mechanism of insulin release is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1550256141,"Abstract A particulate enzyme system from strains of Escherichia coli is described which catalyzes the utilization of the uridine nucleotides, UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-l-Ala d-Glu-α, e-diaminopimelyl-d-Ala-d-Ala and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, for peptidoglycan synthesis. Unlike the systems previously studied in gram-positive cocci, this particulate enzyme catalyzes the terminal cross-linking reaction in cell wall synthesis, a transpeptidation in which a d-alanine residue is lost from the end of one of the N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide residues incorporated into the product. The d-alanine residue is also lost from the end of the second unit involved in the cross-linking, apparently through the action of a d-alanine carboxypeptidase. Both the transpeptidase and the d-alanine carboxypeptidase are inhibited by various penicillins and cephalosporins."
https://openalex.org/W1480823958,"Abstract Two proteins, a galactose-binding protein and a leucine-binding protein, have been isolated from shock fluid of a mutant of Escherichia coli K12 that lacks galactokinase. They were purified by conventional methods to a homogeneous state as judged by electrophoresis on acrylamide columns and other physicochemical criteria. The leucine-binding protein was crystallized by treatment with ammonium sulfate. Binding activity was measured by means of equilibrium dialysis. The osmotic shock procedure was an essential part of the scheme of purification. The purified galactose-binding protein was substantially free of galactokinase, acid hexose phosphatase, and uridine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphatase activities. Of a number of carbohydrates tested, only galactose and glucose were bound. A number of related sugars, including mannose, fucose, lactose, galactosamine, and galactose 1- and 6-phosphate did not interfere with the binding of galactose. The leucine-binding protein showed specificity for leucine, isoleucine, and valine but not for other amino acids tested. Dissociation constants were measured for the galactose-binding protein with galactose and glucose. The values were in the range of 10-6 m. The binding proteins carried out a reversible binding of galactose or leucine in the absence of any chemical alteration of the substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1481435834,"Abstract Palmityl thioesterase of Escherichia coli has been purified 260-fold. Its molecular weight is estimated at 22,000 by sedimentation velocity. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of long chain fatty acyl thioesters of acyl carrier protein or coenzyme A to form free fatty acid and the respective thiol. The enzyme is readily inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Palmityl thioesterase was found to exhibit specificity for fatty acyl thioesters of chain length greater than C10 and palmityl, palmitoleyl, and cis-vaccenyl thioesters are the preferred substrates. The enzyme was shown to be capable of mediating the synthesis of free fatty acids by preparations of the E. coli fatty acid-synthesizing system. Palmityl thioesterase activity is also present in highly purified preparations of pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase. The pigeon liver thioesterase was shown to be specific for fatty acyl-coenzyme A thioesters of C16 and C18 chain length."

The enzyme is competitively inhibited by penicillins and cephalosporins at very low concentrations. d-Alanine carboxypeptidase II, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the penultimate d-alanine residue of the uridine nucleotide substrate, has also been purified and separated from d-alanine carboxypeptidase I. This enzyme is not inhibited by penicillins and cephalosporins. The possible physiological substrate and function of these enzymes are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1501927495,"Abstract The inducible arginine decarboxylase of Escherichia coli, a pyridoxal-P enzyme, has been purified to a specific activity of 410 µmoles of CO2 per min per mg. It can be crystallized from ammonium sulfate solutions without increase in specific activity, sediments as a single species in the analytical ultracentrifuge, and shows only slight impurities on acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its preferred substrate is l-arginine (Km, 0.65 mm, Vmax, 500 µmoles per min per mg), but l-canavanine (Km, 1.2 mm) also is attacked at a rate 40% of that for l-arginine. Several other guanido and ureido derivatives are not attacked by the enzyme but do inhibit it competitively; the most effective of these inhibitors are α-chloro-δ-guanidovaleric acid (Ki, 0.026 mm) and α-hydroxy-δ-guanidovaleric acid (Ki, 0.19 mm). The pH optimum of arginine decarboxylase is 5.2 and the temperature optimum is 37–40°. Its absorption spectrum has maxima at 280 and 420 mµ and is not affected by variations in pH between 5.2 and 9.0. The formyl group of pyridoxal-P in arginine decarboxylase is bound to the e-amino group of a lysine residue. The holodecarboxylase can be resolved by dialysis against cysteine and reconstituted by addition of excess pyridoxal-P; it binds 10 moles of pyridoxal-P per mole (850,000 g). The apoenzyme is also reactivated by 2-norpyridoxal-P, ω-methylpyridoxal-P, and 6-methylpyridoxal-P, although its affinity for these pyridoxal-P analogues and the affinity of the resulting analogue holoenzymes for arginine are reduced by these structural alterations. Pyridoxal, 5-deoxypyridoxal, 2-nor-2-butylpyridoxal-P, and β-(2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-formylpyridine-5)-propionic acid do not reactivate the apoenzyme but do inhibit its reactivation by pyridoxal-P when present in sufficient concentrations."

https://openalex.org/W1642484988,"Abstract Shocked cells have been examined with respect to their sensitivity to inhibitors of active transport. They behave similarly to unshocked cells except that their transport ability is reduced. The process of restoration of active transport has been studied. Metabolic energy appears to be necessary to restore the uptake ability of shocked cells. Evidence is presented which suggests that the galactose- and leucine-binding proteins can become reassociated with the shocked cells. The process shows saturation kinetics and results in an increase in transport ability. We speculate that there are specific sites capable of interacting with the binding proteins. In addition to binding protein, another nondialyzable factor in shock fluid is found to be active in restoration of transport. This factor is precipitated by low concentrations of ammonium sulfate and does not have binding properties. Its activity is substantial and restoration of transport to nearly the original level can be shown only when this factor is used in combination with binding protein."

These effects resemble those elicited from caudate cells by microiontophoretic ejections of dopamine. Since histochemical evidence suggests that dopamine-containing fibers link the substantia nigra with the caudate, this pathway may mediate the changes in caudate spike rates produced by nigral stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1492085991,"The galactose- and leucine-binding proteins of Escherichia coli were obtained and their physicochemical properties were studied. Both proteins were homogeneous as judged by sedimentation behavior. Molecular weights of 35,000 and 36,000 were obtained for the galactose- and leucine-binding protein, respectively. Analyses for amino acid composition, inorganic phosphate, and pentose content are reported. The proteins were relatively heat- and acid-stable but were alkali-labile. No selective inhibitors for binding activity have been found so far. The nature of the complex of binding protein with substrate has been examined. The complex consisted of 1 molecule of substrate per molecule of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1480225220,"Abstract The inducible arginine decarboxylase of Escherichia coli B has a sedimentation coefficient, s°20, ω of 23.3 S and a molecular weight of 850,000. It dissociates to five subunits of identical size which have a sedimentation coefficient of 8.0 S and a molecular weight of 165,000. Dissociation occurs when the buffer cations are monovalent, the pH is greater than 6.5, and the concentration of monovalent cations is less than 0.05 m. It proceeds more rapidly at elevated temperatures and low protein concentrations. The characteristics of this dissociation suggest that it is caused by the creation of a new electrostatic repulsion, possibly by ionization of the carboxyl groups of glutamic or aspartic acid. The dissociated species can be reassociated fully with an activity loss of less than 10% by dialysis against a buffer containing divalent cations or a high concentration of monovalent cations at a pH less than 6. If the dissociated species is exposed to an inhibitory substrate analogue such as α-chloroδ-guanidovaleric acid, as many as five species can be observed in the ultracentrifuge. Two of these correspond to the 8 S and 23 S species; the other three have sedimentation coefficients of approximately 12.1 S, 16.4 S, and 19.5 S. The five sedimentation coefficients are consistent with a molecular weight ratio of 5:4:3:2:1, providing excellent support for the conclusion that the 23 S species is composed of five 8 S subunits. Preliminary experiments indicate that the 8 S subunit is itself a dimer; this is consistent with the observation of 10 pyridoxal-P binding sites per (associated) molecule. Measurements of decarboxylase activity indicate that the 23 S species is almost certainly active, whereas the 8 S species is either less active or inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1496137778,"Abstract Evidence is presented for the existence of several ligand-stabilized forms of aspartate transcarbamylase, as identified by their susceptibilities to proteolysis. The rate of tryptic digestion of the enzyme is significantly increased when the substrate, aspartate, is present in the digestion mixture. On the other hand, both ATP and CTP, allosteric activator and inhibitor, respectively, cause a marked decrease in the digestibility of the enzyme. The apparent loosening of the enzyme structure caused by aspartate and the opposite effect produced by the allosteric effectors are shown not only by digestion with trypsin, but also with subtilisin, Pronase, and, to a smaller extent, chymotrypsin. The tryptic digestibility of the enzyme shows a sigmoid dependence on the aspartate concentration, thus mimicking the substrate activity curve. As in the substrate activity curves, the co-operative nature of the digestibility is more pronounced in the presence of CTP, while the presence of ATP causes the loss of the sigmoid character. It seems, therefore, that conformational changes accompany the binding of the substrate, and that these effects are modified by the presence of the allosteric effectors. Tryptic hydrolysis of the enzyme results in a complete loss of allosteric properties, both homotropic and heterotropic, at an extent of digestion at which no impairment of catalytic activity can be observed. This and other observations indicate that the primary target of tryptic attack is the regulatory subunit. Both CTP and ATP, when present during digestion, protect against the loss of allosteric properties. The results are discussed in relation to the allosteric theories of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (J. Mol. Biol., 12, 88 (1965)) and of Koshland, Nemethy, and Filmer (Biochemistry, 5, 365 (1966)). The relaxed conformation resulting from substrate binding is predicted by the former theory, while the sequential nature of the conformational change upon substrate binding is the cardinal feature of the latter. It appears, however, that neither model accounts fully for the behavior of aspartate transcarbamylase."
https://openalex.org/W1521521522,"Abstract As the first step in the investigation of the structure and action of little known gastric zymogens and enzymes, pepsinogen has been isolated from the mucosa of the fourth stomach (abomasum) of the cow. The pepsinogen was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, batch absorption on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose, recycling gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and finally chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The preparation appears to be homogeneous by chromatography, amino acid analysis, ultracentrifugation, and amino-terminal analysis, and nearly homogeneous by disc electrophoresis. Amino acid analysis by ion exchange chromatography indicates the presence of 362 ± 2 amino acid residues, which account quantitatively for the total nitrogen of the preparation. Compared to swine pepsinogen (Rajagopalan, T. G., Moore, S., and Stein, W. H., J. Biol. Chem., 241, 4940 (1966)), which has 363 amino acids, the bovine pepsinogen shows considerable similarity in composition, especially with respect to the large number of acidic and small number of basic residues. However, there are at least 22 amino acid substitutions. In both proteins there are five amino acids that occur in equal numbers of residues per molecule; these are 4 methionine, 6 half-cystine, 6 tryptophan, 15 phenylalanine, and 35 glycine. In addition, the sum of the residues of certain similar amino acids is constant for bovine and swine pepsinogens; this is true for the pairs lysine and arginine (14 residues), aspartic and glutamic acids (72 residues), and leucine and isoleucine (57 to 58 residues). Significant differences occur in some other amino acids, notably histidine (2 residues in bovine pepsinogen, 3 in swine) and proline (15 and 19, respectively). The molecular weight of the bovine pepsinogen is 38,900 by amino acid analysis and 37,500 by ultracentrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W1571005957,"Abstract When complete transfer of DNA from phage T5 to Escherichia coli F is allowed, the induction of three classes of proteins can be revealed kinetically by means of pulse-labeling, disc electrophoresis, and autoradiography. At 37° T5 proteins of Class I are synthesized from about 1 to 5 min after protein synthesis is first allowed following infection. Synthesis of Class II proteins, which include the early enzymes, occurs during the 5- to 20-min period after initiation of protein synthesis. T5 proteins of Class III, among which are certain phage structural components, are synthesized from about 14 min until lysis at 45 to 60 min. When only the initial 8% section of T5 DNA is permitted to enter host cells, proteins of Class I can be synthesized but not proteins of Class II or III. The 8% section not only induces the synthesis of Class I proteins but also directs the of their synthesis as well as the shutoff of the synthesis of host proteins at the expected time. The initiation of the synthesis of Class II proteins depends on the prior formation of Class I proteins. It is therefore proposed that one or more of the Class I proteins exerts an active regulatory role in this shift of the synthesis from one class of proteins to another. Class I proteins are not precursors of Class II or III proteins and their period of synthesis can be extended by irradiation of the free phage prior to infection. They are therefore considered to be a new distinct class, which are probably coded for by the initial 8% section of the phage T5 genome."
https://openalex.org/W1516967571,"Abstract The components of the uridine diphosphate galactose:lipopolysaccharide α-3-galactosyltransferase system from Salmonella typhimurium were studied. Binary complexes (lipopolysaccharide-phospholipid) and ternary complexes (enzyme-lipopolysaccharide-phospholipid), previously postulated as intermediates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, were reconstituted from the purified components. The complexes were isolated and characterized by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The association of phospholipid with lipopolysaccharide did not require a fixed molar ratio of the two components, and the binary complex appeared to be a multimolecular complex of the two components. The reconstituted complexes showed restoration of activity in the UDP-galactose:lipopolysaccharide α-3-galactosyltransferase system. The apparent role of phosphatidylethanolamine was to promote binding of the enzyme to its lipopolysaccharide substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1968200698,"The study of genetic regulatory mechanisms operating in plants and animals is of paramount importance in contemporary biology. A precise understanding of the mechanisms that underlie normal cellular differentiation is a prerequisite for understanding neoplastic transformation and genetic disease. At present, we are not aware of a single assay system that can give answers to all questions we are already able to pose. Studies of RNA synthesis are valuable because they provide a direct measurement of transcriptional activity. But these studies remain incomplete until we succeed in unraveling the metabolic roles of the molecules whose synthesis we study. In this respect, the study of enzyme synthesis represents a better defined assay system, although the interpretation of observed fluctuations in synthetic rates is made difficult by the many steps that intervene between the genes and their finished protein products. We propose that a combination of protein biosynthetic and cytogenetic analysis is a promising assay system for further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1508442610,"Abstract A quantitative study of the inhibition of the pepsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-tyrosine at pH 2 and 37° is reported. Comparison of the inhibition constants and the -ΔF° values for 43 compounds that are structurally related to pepsin substrates allows those characteristics which dominate binding of inhibitor to enzyme at pH 2 to be ascertained. The results indicate that compounds are bound to pepsin principally by hydrophobic forces. The -ΔF° values are of a magnitude consistent with the view that more than a single amino acid residue of pepsin is directly involved in the binding of an inhibitor molecule to the enzyme. The kinetics of inhibition show that 1 molecule of inhibitor is bound per molecule of enzyme at low concentrations of inhibitor, and that at higher concentrations the kinetics is consistent with the binding of 2 inhibitor molecules. Two alternative mechanisms are presented that are consistent with the kinetic observations. One implies that inhibitor and substrate bind to different regions of the enzyme; the other implies that both bind to the substrate-binding region of the active center of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1601347703,"Abstract A dihydroorotate-oxidizing complex of high molecular weight was purified from respiratory particles of Escherichia coli, strain B. This material was found to be an active dihydroorotate-ubiquinone-30 reductase. The complex lacked cytochrome reductase and oxidase activities but catalyzed the reduction of various artificial electron acceptors, including 2,6-dichloroindophenol, simple 1,4-quinones, and ferricyanide. Molecular oxygen was also an oxidant, although a less efficient one than the artificial electron acceptors. Detergent-dispersed ubiquinone-30 was the most effective oxidizing agent that was tested. This compound was also rapidly reoxidized in a coupled reaction with 2,6-dichloroindophenol in the presence of the complex. The complex contained, in addition to the dihydroorotate-oxidizing enzymes, an active peroxidase, catalase, succinate dehydrogenase, and DPNH oxidase. In crude soluble fractions and in particulate systems of aerobic microorganisms, the oxidation of dihydroorotate is cytochrome-linked. This linkage may occur via non-heme iron proteins and ubiquinone. The oxygen-mediated oxidation of dihydroorotate leads to the quantitative conversion to orotate. Linkage of the reaction with the respiratory chain may represent an important site of respiratory control over pyrimidine biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2075369463,"An injection of rabbit antiserum to mouse lymphocytes causes temporary lymphopenia and prolonged survival of A-strain skin grafts on CBA mice. Cortisone or amethopterin without further antilymphocytic serum prolongs lymphopenia and immunosupression. When cortisone or amethopterin precedes the administration of the antiserum, the immunosuppressant action of the combination is less than that of the antiserum given alone. Whether the serum or the drug is given first does not affect the induction of lymphopenia by the serum. Thus, immunosuppressant action of antilymphocytic serum can be distinguished from its ability to induce lymphopenia. The results suggest that this serum may act as a mitogenic agent redirecting the proliferation of lymphocytes into immunologically incompetent pathways."

A large number of ring-altered analogues showed a lower Ka value, although at high concentration, many of these gave the same activation as AMP. Alteration at positions 1', 2', 3', and 5' of the ribosyl moiety abolished allosteric activity. These data indicate that the ribosyl ring is of primary importance, whereas large variations in the adenine ring can be tolerated without deleterious effect."

Radioactive guanine is used, and there is evidence that guanine incorporation reflects the DNA dependent portion of tRNA synthesis. In control experiments in which doubly labeled samples of tRNA from similarly treated cultures of Escherichia coli K 12 were fractionated, the ratio of the isotopes throughout elution remained constant. tRNA synthesis was studied during the first 5 min following induction of the lactose operon in E. coli K-12. No difference was found between induced and control cells. It is estimated that synthesis of a new tRNA species accounting for 2% or more of the tRNA synthesized during the period of labeling could have been detected. The results suggest that the composition of the pool of tRNA species remains unchanged following induction despite the significant alteration in protein synthesis that occurs."
