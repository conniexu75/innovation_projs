https://openalex.org/W1967179801,"A NEW blood group character, designated as 'Lewis', was first described by Mourant1, who found that the blood of 25 per cent of English people contained the Lewis factor, and that this group character is independent serologically of the ABO, MN, Rh, P, Lutheran and Kell systems. Somewhat later, Andresen2 described 'anti-L sera' which are now known to be anti-Lewis sera. These sera agglutinated the red cells of 21 per cent of adult Danes and the cells of about 70 per cent of Danish children less than seven months old. Andresen put forward the view that the Lewis blood group was inherited by means of two allelomorphic genes L and 1, the three possible genotypes being LL, LI and II. The data observed indicated that anti-Lewis serum agglutinates the red cells of adults if they are of genotype LL only, whereas in young children the genotype LI is also detectable."

https://openalex.org/W2036495647,"SOME years ago, I pointed out that in my opinion the cave deposits in the dolomite of the Transvaal when fully worked will give us the remains of most stages of early man and pre-man that have inhabited South Africa from probably Middle Pliocene to Recent. In the Sterkfontein area alone there are apparently in about ten square miles more than a hundred different cave deposits, and many of these are of quite different ages judging by the faunas. Almost all the animals at Kromdraai main deposit are quite different species from those at the main quarry at Sterkfontein. The jackals, the sabre-toothed tigers, the baboons, the dassies and the ape-men are quite different species."
https://openalex.org/W1968307543,"IN 1935, T. E. Weichselbaum1 demonstrated that rats on a diet poor in sulphur-containing amino-acids developed ‘hæmorrhages' in the liver. Four years later, Gyorgy and Goldblatt2 established that these were, in fact, areas of necrosis, and in 1945 Glynn, Himsworth and Neuberger3 showed that the factor in protein, lack of which caused such necrosis, was cystine. But since that time it has become clear that, even when similar diets are used, there are surprising discrepancies between the results obtained in different laboratories ; some investigators producing the lesion regularly, others occasionally, and some not at all4. In view of the fact that much work is being started in this field, it may be useful to make known without delay the results of a pilot experiment which seems to throw some light on these discrepancies."
https://openalex.org/W2026058542,"THERE Would seem little doubt that the nervous system controls the activity of the anterior pituitary gland, but the mechanism by which this control is exerted is debatable. Many workers have cut possible nerve pathways to the gland. Interruption or removal of the cervical sympathetic system, or the facial and petrosal nerves, has little or no effect on the normal functioning of the gland. Section of the pituitary stalk has given discordant results in the hands of different workers1, but it would seem established that some animals retain normal anterior pituitary function after this operation. This fact indicates that the nerve fibres of the pituitary stalk are not involved in the link between the nervous system and the anterior pituitary, for once cut these fibres do not regenerate."
https://openalex.org/W2072750866,"THE detection and identification of pterins in small quantities was carried out by Schöpf and Becker1 in the course of their classical work on this class of pigments. They employed a chromatographic technique using 0·004 N aqueous hydrochloric acid or 0·01 N methyl alcoholic hydrochloric acid solutions on micro-absorption columns of alumina or frankonite. The technique of paper chromatography has now been applied successfully to certain of the common pterins, and as a result a method has been elaborated for the rapid identification of very small quantities of these compounds such as may be obtained by extraction of individual butterfly wings. Indications that this method might be applied in the pterin series had been given by Crammer2, who mentioned that xanthopterin and leucopterin could be concentrated by a paper chromatographic technique."

https://openalex.org/W1990967024,"FIBRINOGEN dissolved in 30 per cent urea solution readily consumes iodine even at 0° C. Analysis has shown that the action of iodine is twofold : part of the consumed iodine is substituted in the tyrosine rings in the fibrinogen molecule, and part of the iodine oxidizes certain of its groups. Thus as a result of the action of iodine, fibrinogens, iodinated and oxidized to various extents, can be prepared. To obtain such iodinated fibrinogens, a known amount of N/100 iodine solution was allowed to act on samples of fibrinogen dissolved in slightly alkaline 30 per cent urea solution. After various incubation times the action of the iodine was stopped by removing the remaining free iodine with thiosulphate. The urea was then dialysed off and the fibrinogen precipitated isoelectrically several times and finally dissolved in slightly alkaline water. The iodine bound to fibrinogen was then estimated. It was found that the iodine bound to the fibrinogen reached its maximum value in the first few minutes and then remained constant. This maximum value corresponds to two iodine atoms per tyrosine residue of fibrinogen. Simultaneously, the Millon reaction for phenolic groups disappeared."

It is hoped that this technique will assist in elucidating the mode of formation of the wool fibre and also facilitate investigations already in progress in this laboratory, which are concerned with developing methods for removal of wool from sheepskins."

https://openalex.org/W2002721650,"ALTHOUGH it is well known that the non-protein nitrogen content of insect hæmolymph is high and that a large proportion of it is present as amino-acids, few investigations have been made as to their nature. Florkin and Duchateau1 showed that the hæmolymph of Dytiscus marginalis contained small quantities of histidine and tyrosine, and reported the absence of arginine, tryptophane, phenylalanine and cystine. A more thorough analysis by Ussing2 revealed the presence in the blood of Melolontha vulgaris of lysine, arginine, histidine, tyrosine, leucine, valine, tryptophane and almost certainly hydroxyproline. The latter is also present in the blood of Oryctes nasicornis."

https://openalex.org/W2023869564,"IT has frequently been suggested that a linear accelerator could be constructed using a wave-guide consisting of a circular metal tube lined with an insulating tube of dielectric, and several writers have recently published theoretical investigations of this type of wave-guide, as, for example, Frankel1. The performance of a linear accelerator using such a wave-guide is ultimately limited by the power losses which occur in the metal tube and in the dielectric itself, and calculations show that the performance compares unfavourably with other forms of accelerator, such as corrugated wave-guides2. However, some recent theoretical investigations show that the performance should be greatly improved by using a different form of dielectric loading, and that certain practical advantages should also ensue."

Most authors suppose that increased gamma-globulin forms the basis of these tests, but it has been suggested that beta-globulin may be responsible, too."
https://openalex.org/W2051037949,"THE recent work of Knox and Grossman1 has shown the existence of a new metabolite of nicotinic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2064019987,"I HAVE seen hitherto unnoted large round or polyhedric cells, of 10–20 µ diameter, in the outskirts of middle-sized and big choroidal arteries in the region of the posterior pole of many human eyes. These big cells are conspicuous by their clear cytoplasm, only a few of them containing small granules. The plasm is outlined by a smooth continuous cell membrane. The nuclei are stained with haematoxylin an even dark purple without visible chromosomes or nucleoli ; they are round or oblong and situated predominantly centrally. These large cells are present relatively infrequently in normal choroid (Fig. 1), where they are found singly ; they occur in groups in the media or adventitia of arteries in cases of hypertension and other circulatory disturbances (Fig. 2)."

https://openalex.org/W1999376275,"IN 1926, Knaffl-Lenz1 introduced a method for the bioassay of digitalis preparations by determining the minimal lethal dose on intravenous injection in anæsthetized guinea pigs. The method, which may be used for all kinds of cardiac glucosides, has since become official in, for example, Britain2 and Sweden3. According to this procedure, the solution to be tested is introduced into the vena jugularis under constant pressure and at constant speed (either from a burette with a Mariotte stopper or with a motor-driven injection apparatus). The lethal dose is determined by direct observation of the cardiac standstill (concerning the details of the procedure, see, for example, Burn4, Fønss Bech5 and Goldberg6). The number of animals required is determined by the degree of accuracy one wishes to give the results ; this may be calculated with the help of the usual statistical methods."
https://openalex.org/W2010875817,"DESPITE the contributions of Lorleberg1, Hilton2, Hecht3, Cate4, Bacq6, and Das6, the picture of tunicate nervous relations is still incomplete. Although the central nervous system consists of only one compact intersiphonal ganglion and the peripheral system of a few nerves emanating from the former, the extreme sensitivity of monascidians to touch, vibrations, etc., is astounding. A person walking about in a room where expanded Ciona, Ascidiella, or Styelopsis are lying in a jar on a table is enough to make some of the ascidians contract. Lorleberg1 stated that Styelopsis had free nerve terminations, whereas Das6 found in Herdmania an extensive nerve supply, not only to the organs lying inside the mantle, but also to receptor cells of the test as well. I have now found these nerve fibres, ramifying into the mantle, the test, and ending in the receptor organs, in Ciona, Ascidiella as well as Styelopsis. Free nerve terminations have been found in Styelopsis and Ascidiella and probably occur in all Tunicata."

A number of distinguished men of science addressed the conference, and their speeches were followed by a general discussion. While there was general agreement on questions of scientific fact, the different speakers placed widely different interpretations upon the present national and international difficulties with regard to control, secrecy and individual freedom, which reflected to a large extent their different political outlooks. Prof. R. E. Peierls in his opening remarks emphasized that the Association as such does not adhere to any particular political philosophy ; its primary function is to spread a knowledge of the facts and to provide a platform for informed discussion."

https://openalex.org/W2006768900,"IN a communication bearing this title, and when referring to our papers1 on the uncrystallizable compound (m.p. 311–312°) formed during the course of the reaction which takes place between anethole and maleic anhydride, Bruckner and Kovács2 state that we have not recognized that this compound was a heteropolymer. In a series of other reports on the same subject published later, the heteropolymer character of the compound was established and, furthermore, its molecular weight was determined3 with the help of the cis-hexahydro-para-aminobenzoic acid lactam4. The product which is obtained first under Bruckner's working conditions and our own, when refluxed with chloroform, yields two compounds, one of them soluble (m.p. 245° decomp.), with a molecular weight equal to 738 (theoretical for 3: 3·735), and the other insoluble (m.p. 310° decomp.), with a molecular weight equal to 1,010 (theoretical for 4: 4.980)."

https://openalex.org/W2036865552,"IN attempting to culture excised immature plant embryos, it is frequently desirable to avoid autoclaving the nutrilite components (for example, malt extract). These are usually Seitz-filtered separately and transferred by pipette to the individual culture vials containing the previously autoclaved sugar and inorganic components of the medium. To workers unskilled in bacteriological methods, this represents a tedious and time-consuming operation."
https://openalex.org/W2071542878,"NOTHING was known of tunicate receptors before 1899, when Herdman1, in his description of Ascidia, mentioned a few structures that might act as receptors, but gave no proof or details. Lorleberg2, on the other hand, stated in 1907 that in Stylopsis ""there is complete lack of sense cells"". Hecht3 could not find any receptor organs besides the tentacles and margins of the siphons. Das4 showed for the first time definite receptor cells in the test and mantle. He demonstrated red pigmented cells which act as photoreceptors. Besides these, the tentacles and dorsal tubercle have been mentioned by various workers as having definite receptor functions. I have found a new structure in Ciona, in the intersiphonal region, which appears like an eye-spot and is definitely a photoreceptor. No mention of this structure is found in the various accounts of Ciona given by different authors. This eye-spot can be easily seen when the atrial aperture is wide open. It lies on the wall of the mantle just behind the base of the atrial siphon on its dorsal aspect. It is specially conspicuous in dark-adapted animals."

https://openalex.org/W2800363194,"ONE of the paradoxes of civilized life is the lowly position occupied among the sciences by the study of living things. There seems, in Great Britain at least, to be a general disposition to regard biology as something in the nature of a pastime, while the physicist, and the chemist are held in respect as serious practitioners. Only in the treatment and, to a modest degree, the prevention of disease, and in agriculture, has biological science a recognized position. That the well-being of the human race is closely bound up with the ineludible facts of life, which together constitute the equilibrium of Nature, is not generally recognized."
https://openalex.org/W4210705583,"AN interesting discussion on ""Anti-vitamins in Food"", arranged by the Nutrition Society, took place on October 23 at the Royal Society of Arts. Sir Edward Mellanby, who might justly claim to be the originator of the modern concept of anti-vitamins, was chairman. In his introductory remarks he pointed out that the 'anti-vitamin' or 'toxamin' theory is now some twenty years old, although his early claims that cereals must contain substances which antagonize vitamin D had not been immediately accepted. Later work, however, in identifying phytic acid as an anti-calcifying factor, had placed the existence of anti-vitamins beyond dispute. Considerable progress is now being made towards an understanding of the general principles underlying the mode of action of the anti-vitamins, and both their significance as dietary factors and their potentialities as therapeutic agents are clearly recognized."
