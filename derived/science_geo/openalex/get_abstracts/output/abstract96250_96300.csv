https://openalex.org/W2030677119,"Immunohistochemical and axonal transport methods were used to describe the organization of a series of central noradrenergic pathways that interrelate the nucleus of the solitary tract, which receives primary visceral sensory information, and the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, which participate in autonomic and neuroendocrine modes of homeostatic control. The results indicate that pathways arising from noradrenergic cells in the dorsal vagal complex, the ventrolateral medulla, and the locus coeruleus end in specific subdivisions of the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei which are involved in the regulation of responses from the pituitary gland and from both divisions of the autonomic nervous system. This circuitry may play an important role in the integration of hypothalamic responses to visceral stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W1989580390,Bovine brain gangliosides were applied to primary and established neuronal cultures to examine the role of gangliosides in neuronal development. Media containing gangliosides enhanced the degree of axonal elongation exhibited by sensory ganglia neurons and increased the length and number of Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell processes. Ganglioside-supplemented media caused a twofold increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity in both culture systems. These experiments suggest that gangliosides function as acceptor molecules for growth-promoting substances in embryonic and tumor-derived neurons.
https://openalex.org/W2019530923,Squirrel monkeys pressed a lever at high rates under a second-order schedule of reinforcement in which lever pressing produced a brief visual stimulus that was occasionally contiguous with an intravenous injection of nicotine. The rate of lever pressing could be markedly reduced either by substituting saline for nicotine injections or by blocking the effects of nicotine with mecamylamine. The rate of lever pressing could also be reduced by eliminating the brief visual stimulus. These results show that nicotine can function as an effective reinforcer under a second-order schedule of drug self-administration and that an environmental stimulus associated with nicotine intake can contribute to the maintenance of persistent drug-seeking behavior.
https://openalex.org/W2041458301,"The classic procedures for testing potential carcinogens in animals have basically not changed in the past 50 years. Considerable knowledge of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis has accrued in the last 20 years, particularly concepts on the metabolic activation of chemicals to reactive electrophilic compounds that can interact with nucleophilic including DNA. These developments, in turn, have yielded a framework for integrating into carcinogen testing the determination of genetic effects of chemicals. A systematic decision point approach to carcinogen testing has been developed which entails a sequential decision-making process as specific tests are performed and evaluated prior to initiation of higher order, more complex tests. Compared to conventional bioassays in rodents, this approach provides knowledge based on mechanisms of carcinogenesis, yields a substantial amount of data at minimal cost, and forms a solid base for eventual heath risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W1972233047,In rats subjected to thyroidectomy there was a two- to fourfold increase in cerebral cortex iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase activity within 24 hours. This increase was prevented by thyroxine replacement. The increased cortical 5'-deiodinase in chronically hypothyroid rats was normalized within 4 hours by a single intravenous injection of triiodothyronine. These results indicate that the adult central nervous system can give a very rapid biochemical response to thyroid hormone.

https://openalex.org/W1489446974,"A high molecular weight glycoprotein, reported to be secreted by endothelial cells (Sage, H., Crouch, E., and Bornstein, P. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 5433-5442), has been purified to apparent homogeneity from culture medium of adult bovine aortic endothelial cells. Purification was achieved by ammonium sulfate fractionation and successive chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300, and hydroxylapatite. The glycoprotein was found to be a disulfide-linked oligomer with a subunit molecular weight of 190,000, as judged by its mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO4)-polyacrylamide gels. The endothelial cell-derived protein is distinct from high molecular weight serum glycoproteins such as fibronectin and alpha 2-macroglobulin. However, immunological and structural studies indicate that the Mr = 190,000 glycoprotein is either identical with or closely related to thrombospondin, a glycoprotein contained in platelet granules and released in response to thrombin-induced aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2063136300,"In electric fish of the mormyrid family, an efference copy is present in the brain region that receives afferent input from ampullary electroreceptors. The efference copy is elicited by the motor command to fire the electric organ. Its effect is always opposite that of ampullary afferents responding to the electric organ discharge, and it changes to match variations in this afferent input. It probably reduces the central effects of activity in ampullary receptors evoked by the electric organ discharge."

In a two-response situation, pigeons' response proportions approximately equaled reinforcement proportions, even when this behavior pattern substantially decreased the rate of reinforcement. Optimization or reinforcement maximization was not supported as the basic mechanism underlying choice behavior."

Cats viewing patterns containing a single spatial frequency presented at all orientations show columns of increased deoxyglucose uptake extending through all cortical layers. A control stimulus containing all spatial frequencies presented at all orientations produces no columnar density differences within the striate cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1972399550,"Natural abundance carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonances (NMR) from human arm and rat tissues have been observed in vivo. These signals arise primarily from triglycerides in fatty tissue. Carbon-13 NMR was also used to follow, in a living rat, the conversion of C-1-labeled glucose, which was introduced into the stomach, to C-1-labeled liver glycogen. The carbon-13 sensitivity and resolution obtained shows that natural abundance carbon-13 NMR will be valuable in the study of disorders in fat metabolism, and that experiments with substrates labeled with carbon-13 can be used to study carbohydrate metabolism in vivo."

The same agent did not induce tumors in Lobund-Wistar rats. The number of tumors was significantly smaller in rats given drinking water containing indomethacin (beginning 14 days after the injections) than in control rats given drug-free water."
https://openalex.org/W2086620537,Parenteral and intracerebroventricular administration of calcitonin in rats resulted in the suppression of gastric acid secretion. This suppression also occurred in rats with insulin-induced hypoglycemia and after the administration of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Intracerebroventricularly administered calcitonin was 1000 times more effective than parenterally administered calcitonin in suppressing gastric acid secretion. Calcitonin also inhibited the development of stress-induced ulcers in rats.

The mean survival time of the rats on the restricted diet was increased by approximately 40 percent compared to control rats given free access to food. Dopamine receptor concentrations in striata of 24-month-old rats that had been on a restricted diet since weaning were 50 percent higher than those of control animals of the same age, and essentially comparable to 3- and 6-month-old control rats."

Implants in the medial preoptic and supra- and retrochiasmatic areas elicited complete gonadal regression after 7 weeks. Implants in other brain regions had little effect on the animals' reproductive state."
https://openalex.org/W1988433929,"Mice systematically bred for randomization of their genotype show large individual differences when performing a two-way avoidance task (shuttle-box learning). Their behavioral scores correlate strongly (r = -0.80, P less than .01) with the number of mossy fibers synapsing on basal dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, poor avoiders having relatively more such terminals. This confirms previous findings showing that rat and mouse strains known for genetically dependent poor avoidance learning have extended intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber projections."

Since pheromonal activity is present in yolk and liver tissue of untreated females and can be induced with estrogen treatment in the serums and livers of males, the pheromone may be associated with the circulating yolk lipoprotein, vitellogenin."

https://openalex.org/W1992086275,Circulating metallothionein was measured by radioimmunoassay over a 13-day period in male Sprague-Dawley rats that received a sequence of three intraperitoneal injections (at 3-day intervals) of either 5 milligrams of zinc or 0.8 milligrams of cadmium per kilogram of body weight. These amounts of zinc and cadmium produced metallothionein concentrations in the range of 2 to 5 nanograms per milliliter of serum (zinc) and 2 to 15 nanograms per milliliter of serum (cadmium). In control rats given saline injections over the same period the metallothionein concentration ranged from 1 to 3 nanograms per milliliter of serum.
https://openalex.org/W1998262112,"The active portion of the alpha subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase in rat frontal cortex was elevated after a training experience. No change in total pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was observed. The phosphorylation in vitro of pyruvate dehydrogenase (band F-2) was also elevated after training. Since activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase requires its dephosphorylation, the following sequence is proposed. Training alters frontal cortex and reduces the phosphate content of pyruvate dehydrogenase in vivo; this leads to enzyme activation; and an increase in back-titration of sites available for phosphorylation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1479800785,"Peripheral membrane proteins (Mr = 43,000) are associated with Torpedo membranes highly enriched in nicotinic receptor. These 43,000-dalton proteins are not required for ion translocation or other known receptor functions, but they have been implicated in constraint of the nicotinic receptor within the plane of the membrane bilayer. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis allows partial resolution of the 43,000-dalton band into a doublet. We have carried out further analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which reveals the existence of at least seven Coomassie blue-staining spots in the isoelectric focusing dimension. Peptide maps of the individual spots serve to elucidate the observed electrophoretic complexity. Three different membrane-bound proteins, designated v1, v2, and v3, were identified on the basis of their characteristic peptide maps which show no apparent homology in amino acid sequence. Two of these proteins, v1 and v2, are resolved into multiple spots in the isoelectric focusing dimension, but each group of isoelectric focusing variants has nearly identical peptide fingerprints. Of relevance to the putative role of these proteins in synaptic or receptor supramolecular structures is the observation that only v1 is exclusively membrane bound, and co-purifies with receptor whereas both v2 and v3 are also prominent proteins of the cytoplasm and are depleted from membrane fractions most enriched in receptor. These proteins may interact in the formation or maintenance of synaptic and nicotinic receptor supramolecular structures."
https://openalex.org/W1977694119,"Transient amacrine cells were identified by their intracellularly recorded response to flashes of light. These cells typically respond with a transient depolarization, often followed by a steady-state response during the stimulus. When two electrodes were placed in different transient amacrine cells, current of either polarity passed through one electrode produced a steady-state voltage change that was recorded by the electrode in the nearby cell. Following identification of the physiological type, transient amacrine cells were injected with horseradish peroxidase and the tissue was processed for light and electron microscopy. Both conventional chemical synaptic junctions and gap junctions were found to connect amacrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048285987,"Voltage clamp studies of macrophages from cultures of mouse spleen macrophages produced N-shaped steady-state current-voltage curves containing a region of negative slope resistance. Some macrophages exhibit two stable states of membrane potential, having current-voltage relationships that cross the voltage axis at three points. Outward currents that turn on at voltages of +15 millivolts or greater were noted in several cells. The addition of barium chloride to the bathing medium abolished the negative slope resistance and reduced the inward currents in response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps. These data provide direct evidence that macrophages exhibit at least two different voltage-dependent conductances and demonstrate that voltage clamp techniques can be useful in studying the membrane properties of leukocytes."

The digital subtraction technique, which detects small differences in the concentration of the iodinated contrast material injected, is relatively safe and does not usually require hospitalization of the patient. The technique can thus be used for serial evaluation of various clinical problems and for studying the natural history of certain disease processes, as well as for following therapeutic endeavors."
https://openalex.org/W1503363627,"The biosynthesis and secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been studied by pulse-chase labeling techniques in organ cultures of normal first trimester placentae. As we previously reported for human malignant trophoblastic cells (Ruddon et al. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5189-5196), first trimester placental tissue produces Mr = 18,000 and 15,000 intracellular forms of alpha subunit and Mr = 24,000 and 18,000 forms of beta subunit. In the placental tissue, there is a greater accumulation of mature subunit forms prior to secretion. The predominant intracellular form of alpha subunit in placental tissue is a high mannose, (Man)8(GlcNAc)2 oligosaccharide-containing form just as it is for malignant trophoblastic cells; however, in placenta there is evidence for a greater content of partially processed intermediates with oligosaccharides smaller than (Man)8(GlcNAc)2. Placental tissue secretes both a large free alpha subunit and an hCG-alpha subunit that is part of complete hCG, but there is a 3- to 6-fold greater secretion (on a molar basis) of free alpha than complete hCG. There is no evidence for the synthesis of high molecular weight prohormone forms that might be precursors to the secreted forms of hCG subunits."

On day 3 and each day thereafter, cells were prepared for ultrastructural radioautography and examined with an electron microscope. Maximal incorporation occurred on day 5, when 63 percent of the cardiocytes were labeled. Mitotic activity was never present in more than 0.5 percent of the cardiocytes examined. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine and mitosis occurred only in immature cardiocytes characterized by subsarcolemmal primary filaments and Z bands with or without specific granules; more mature cardiocytes were never labeled."
https://openalex.org/W1985585709,"Sympathetic neurons from newborn rats, cultured for 1 month or longer in the virtual absence of nonneuronal cells, were capable of regenerating neurites after neuritotomy. Regeneration occurred even after nerve growth factor was withdrawn from the cultures, although it was much less extensive and appeared limited to a few days following neuritotomy. Even after 29 days of nerve growth factor deprivation, reintroduction of the protein prompted a resumption of neurite growth. Possible roles of both nerve growth factor-independent and -dependent components in adult nerve regeneration are discussed."

The effect of heparin was additive to the effect of urea which is known to extract fibronectin. These experiments provide further evidence that fibronectin and glycosaminoglycans are associated in connective tissues and the use of heparin forms the basis for a simple method for extraction and quantitation of tissue fibronectin."

https://openalex.org/W2052152005,Choline stimulated secretion of catecholamines from primary dissociated cultures of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells by interacting with nicotinic receptors. Secretion was readily detected at a choline concentration of 1 millimole per liter and was maximal at 3 to 10 millimoles per liter; it was completely calcium-dependent. Further analysis suggested that choline acts as a partial nicotinic agonist.
https://openalex.org/W1593279095,"Cytoplasmic 10S ribonucleoprotein (iRNP) is a potent inhibitor of mRNA translation in vitro and contains a 4 S translation inhibitory RNA species (iRNA) (Sarkar, S., Mukherjee, A. K., and Guha, C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5077-5086). This ribonucleoprotein has now been resolved into protein and RNA components by DEAE-cellulose chromatography in the absence of both K+ and Mg2+ ions. These cations are required for maintaining the nucleoprotein structure of iRNP. Incubation of the dissociated protein and RNA components in the presence of K+ and Mg2+ at 35 degrees C reconstitutes a 10 S particle which is indistinguishable from native iRNP with respect to the elution profile by gel filtration, UV spectra, buoyant density, resistance to pancreatic RNase, and ability to inhibit exogenous mRNA translation in vitro. Chick muscle tRNA and globin mRNA could not form an RNP complex with the protein moieties of iRNP. The separated proteins, unlike iRNA and iRNP, do not inhibit mRNA translation. Their function may be to protect iRNA from ribonuclease digestion, since iRNP is ribonuclease-resistant. The ability to dissociate the iRNP particle and to specifically reconstitute it from the separated components indicates that it is a unique cellular entity which is distinct from other ribonucleoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2056648677,"The proposal that adhesive disparities between inpocketing populations of cells and surrounding epithelia drive epithelial invagination was tested in grafting experiments with moth pupal wing epithelium. Evidence exists that a cellular adhesiveness gradient spans the proximodistal axis of the wing. Although pupal wing cells normally do not invaginate or evaginate, epithelial folding can be induced after exchange of grafts from opposite ends of the proximodistal axis. The hypothesis that cytoskeletal elements are the primary agents in epithelial invagination should be reevaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1499099751,"Under continuous illumination, isolated planar sheets of purple membrane from Halobacterium halobium acidify the surroundings at alkaline pH. This light-induced change in H+ binding to the purple membrane (delta h) was studied by differential titration under varying conditions of pH, temperature, ionic strength, salt composition, light intensity, and wavelength. A maximum acidification was found between pH 9 and 10, with delta h less at neutral or more alkaline pH, consistent with a previously proposed three-state model. The light intensity and wavelength dependence also support this model. The temperature dependence of delta h, interpreted in terms of the three-state model, is anomalous. The apparent enthalpy of proton dissociation (delta H0) is -6 kcal/mol, a value of opposite sign to the expected delta H0 for a group of pK = 10. The apparent activation energy (Ea) for proton uptake is 14 kcal/mol in 15 mM NaCl and 18 kcal/mol in 3 M KCl, 5 to 10 times too large for a diffusion-limited proton transfer reaction from water. However, both delta H0 and Ea are consistent with conformational changes linked to light-independent proton dissociation and pump-dependent proton uptake. An increase in ionic strength increases delta h. This effect is shown to be quantitatively explained by a high negative electrostatic surface potential, which accumulates protons in a diffuse electrical double layer."

https://openalex.org/W1994023256,"In the crayfish a bilateral pair of interneurons (the 13's) are involved in the generation of two types of tail-flip escape responses, one mediated by giant neurons and the other by nongiant circuitry. The 13's make a variety of output connections with the motoneurons and with other interneurons involved in tail flipping. The motoneuronal outputs include strong synapses on telson flexor motoneurons, whose activity during tail flips mediated by lateral giant fibers would be maladaptive. The lateral giants always drive the 13's, but also drive inhibitory neurons that prevent the undesirable outputs of the 13's while permitting their adaptive outputs to be expressed. It is often adaptive for tail flips initiated by nongiant circuitry to utilize the telson flexor muscles that 13 strongly excites. During such tail flips 13 is often fired, and this firing is important in driving the telson flexors."
