https://openalex.org/W2131174104,"The inadvertent activation of the Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A small-molecule inhibitor of Abl (STI-571) is effective in the treatment of CML. We report the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Abl, complexed to a variant of STI-571. Critical to the binding of STI-571 is the adoption by the kinase of an inactive conformation, in which a centrally located ""activation loop"" is not phosphorylated. The conformation of this loop is distinct from that in active protein kinases, as well as in the inactive form of the closely related Src kinases. These results suggest that compounds that exploit the distinctive inactivation mechanisms of individual protein kinases can achieve both high affinity and high specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2171777099,"Extremely halophilic archaea contain retinal-binding integral membrane proteins called bacteriorhodopsins that function as light-driven proton pumps. So far, bacteriorhodopsins capable of generating a chemiosmotic membrane potential in response to light have been demonstrated only in halophilic archaea. We describe here a type of rhodopsin derived from bacteria that was discovered through genomic analyses of naturally occuring marine bacterioplankton. The bacterial rhodopsin was encoded in the genome of an uncultivated γ-proteobacterium and shared highest amino acid sequence similarity with archaeal rhodopsins. The protein was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and bound retinal to form an active, light-driven proton pump. The new rhodopsin exhibited a photochemical reaction cycle with intermediates and kinetics characteristic of archaeal proton-pumping rhodopsins. Our results demonstrate that archaeal-like rhodopsins are broadly distributed among different taxa, including members of the domain Bacteria . Our data also indicate that a previously unsuspected mode of bacterially mediated light-driven energy generation may commonly occur in oceanic surface waters worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2156101426,"Agriculture plays a major role in the global fluxes of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. From 1991 to 1999, we measured gas fluxes and other sources of global warming potential (GWP) in cropped and nearby unmanaged ecosystems. Net GWP (grams of carbon dioxide equivalents per square meter per year) ranged from 110 in our conventional tillage systems to -211 in early successional communities. None of the annual cropping systems provided net mitigation, although soil carbon accumulation in no-till systems came closest to mitigating all other sources of GWP. In all but one ecosystem, nitrous oxide production was the single greatest source of GWP. In the late successional system, GWP was neutral because of significant methane oxidation. These results suggest additional opportunities for lessening the GWP of agronomic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2090114393,"Fossilized fungal hyphae and spores from the Ordovician of Wisconsin (with an age of about 460 million years) strongly resemble modern arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomales, Zygomycetes). These fossils indicate that Glomales-like fungi were present at a time when the land flora most likely only consisted of plants on the bryophytic level. Thus, these fungi may have played a crucial role in facilitating the colonization of land by plants, and the fossils support molecular estimates of fungal phylogeny that place the origin of the major groups of terrestrial fungi (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomales) around 600 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2080912283,"The deep-sea sediment oxygen isotopic composition (delta(18)O) record is dominated by a 100,000-year cyclicity that is universally interpreted as the main ice-age rhythm. Here, the ice volume component of this delta(18)O signal was extracted by using the record of delta(18)O in atmospheric oxygen trapped in Antarctic ice at Vostok, precisely orbitally tuned. The benthic marine delta(18)O record is heavily contaminated by the effect of deep-water temperature variability, but by using the Vostok record, the delta(18)O signals of ice volume, deep-water temperature, and additional processes affecting air delta(18)O (that is, a varying Dole effect) were separated. At the 100,000-year period, atmospheric carbon dioxide, Vostok air temperature, and deep-water temperature are in phase with orbital eccentricity, whereas ice volume lags these three variables. Hence, the 100,000-year cycle does not arise from ice sheet dynamics; instead, it is probably the response of the global carbon cycle that generates the eccentricity signal by causing changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2037047850,"A high-resolution ice core record from Dasuopu, Tibet, reveals that this site is sensitive to fluctuations in the intensity of the South Asian Monsoon. Reductions in monsoonal intensity are recorded by dust and chloride concentrations. The deeper, older sections of the Dasuopu cores suggest many other periods of drought in this region, but none have been of greater intensity than the greatest recorded drought, during 1790 to 1796 A.D. of the last millennium. The 20th century increase in anthropogenic activity in India and Nepal, upwind from this site, is recorded by a doubling of chloride concentrations and a fourfold increase in dust. Like other ice cores from the Tibetan Plateau, Dasuopu suggests a large-scale, plateau-wide 20th-century warming trend that appears to be amplified at higher elevations."
https://openalex.org/W2080514032,"The cellular prion protein PrPc is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein whose biological function is unclear. We used the murine 1C11 neuronal differentiation model to search for PrPc-dependent signal transduction through antibody-mediated cross-linking. A caveolin-1-dependent coupling of PrPc to the tyrosine kinase Fyn was observed. Clathrin might also contribute to this coupling. The ability of the 1C11 cell line to trigger PrPc-dependent Fyn activation was restricted to its fully differentiated serotonergic or noradrenergic progenies. Moreover, the signaling activity of PrPc occurred mainly at neurites. Thus, PrPc may be a signal transduction protein."
https://openalex.org/W2120240537,"Silk fibroin produced by the silkwormBombyx mori consists of a heavy chain, a light chain, and a glycoprotein, P25. The heavy and light chains are linked by a disulfide bond, and P25 associates with disulfide-linked heavy and light chains by noncovalent interactions. Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that molar ratios of the heavy chain, light chain, and P25 were 6:6:1, both in cocoons and in fibroin secreted into the lumen of posterior silk gland. Trace amounts of fibroin produced by three “naked pupa” mutants of B. mori lacked the light chain, but the molar ratio of heavy chain and P25 was also 6:1. Gel filtration chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium analysis demonstrated that a large protein complex of approximately 2.3 MDa, designated an elementary unit of fibroin having 6:6:1 molar ratios of the heavy chain, light chain, and P25, existed in posterior silk gland cells. Inaccessibility of biotinylated concanavalin A to the native elementary unit and partial dissociation of the elementary unit after incubation with excess N-glycosidase F or endoglycosidase H suggest that a single molecule of P25 is located internally and plays an important role in maintaining integrity of the complex.

Both the efficient secretion of the vast amount of fibroin from PSG cells into the lumen and the maintenance of solubility of fibroin during the luminal transport have been speculated to be facilitated by the formation of a molecular complex consisting of fibroin heavy chain (H-chain) of 350 kDa and two lower molecular mass protein components: fibroin light chain (L-chain) of 26 kDa (1Yamaguchi K. Kikuchi Y. Takagi T. Kikuchi A. Oyama F. Shimura K. Mizuno S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and P25, which is a glycoprotein of about 30 kDa (2Tanaka K. Inoue S. Mizuno S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). H-chain and L-chain are linked by a single disulfide bond between Cys-172 of L-chain and Cys-c20 (twentieth residue from the C terminus) of H-chain (3Tanaka K. Kajiyama N. Ishikura K. Waga S. Kikuchi A. Ohtomo K. Takagi T. Mizuno S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The H-L linkage is essential for the secretion of a vast amount of fibroin, because the silkworm carrying theNd-s or Nd-s D mutation of the L-chain gene (fibL) could not form the disulfide linkage with H-chain, and less than 1% of the normal level fibroin is secreted (4Mori K. Tanaka K. Kikuchi Y. Waga M. Waga S. Mizuno S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This tremendous reduction of fibroin secretion has been suggested to be caused by the appearance of a free sulfhydryl group of Cys-c20 on H-chain, which prevents the transport of H-chain from ER to Golgi (4Mori K. Tanaka K. Kikuchi Y. Waga M. Waga S. Mizuno S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, P25 has been shown to associate with the H-L complex by noncovalent interactions, i.e. mainly by hydrophobic interactions with the H-chain moiety (2Tanaka K. Inoue S. Mizuno S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 5Tanaka K. Mori K. Mizuno S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the role of P25 in the formation of the fibroin molecular complex has not been elucidated, mainly because a silkworm carrying a mutation of theP25 gene has not been available. In the present study, a method of purifying P25 from the fibroin secreted into the lumen of PSG was established, and a specific polyclonal antibody against the purified P25 was prepared. When the quantitative ELISA was performed with the anti-P25 antibody and also with polyclonal antibodies against H-chain and L-chain, respectively, for the fibroin secreted into the PSG lumen or for the proteins of a cocoon shell, the 6:6:1 molar ratio for H-chain, L-chain, and P25 were obtained for all of the samples examined. Furthermore, the existence of a large protein complex of about 2.3 MDa, designated the elementary unit of fibroin, containing H-chain, L-chain, and P25 with a 6:6:1 molar ratio, in the PSG cells was demonstrated. For integrity of the elementary unit, hydrophobic interactions of P25 with H-chain(s) and interactions between H-chain(s) and N-linked oligosaccharide chains of P25 were suggested to be important. Based on the present biochemical analysis, a model is presented, in which a single molecule of P25 with its three N-linked high mannose type oligosaccharide chains associates with six sets of the disulfide-linked H-L heterodimer by noncovalent interactions. Fertilized eggs of B. mori J-139 (a Japanese breed), Sekko (a Chinese breed), Blanc des Cevennes (a French breed), and Turkish yellow cocoon (a Turkish breed), all of which are normal level producers of fibroin, and the three fibroin secretion-deficient “naked pupa” mutants of B. mori(Nd(2) (mutation of the fibroin H-chain gene,fibH; Refs. 6Hyodo A.

PSGs were dissected out from the larvae at the 5th day of the fifth instar, and the fibroin secreted into the PSG lumen was manually separated from surrounding tissues (7Takei F. Oyama F. Kimura K. Hyodo A. Mizuno S. Shimura K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The coagulated fibroin was immersed in 99.5% ethanol, washed three times in ether, and air-dried. The dried fibroin or a cocoon shell was dissolved in 60% lithium thiocyanate, followed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 m urea. Insoluble materials from the cocoon shell were precipitated by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used as a protein sample. H-chain and L-chain were purified from the fibroin secreted into the PSG lumen according to the published method (9Oyama F. Mizuno S. Shimura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1984; 96: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For the purification of P25, the fibroin sample prepared from the PSG lumen was subjected to 0.1% SDS, 12.5% PAGE (SDS-PAGE), and P25 was electroeluted in 5 mmTris, 38.4 mm glycine (10Garfin D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), passed through an Ampure DT column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove SDS, and concentrated using Molcut-II (the nominal molecular weight limit, 5,000; Millipore Corp.). Further purification of P25 was achieved by reversed phase HPLC using a 0.46 × 25-cm column of Sephasil Peptide C18 12 μm ST4.6/250 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a linear gradient of 20–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Three methods (i.e., SDS-PAGE (described as above and in the legend for Fig. 2), gel filtration column chromatography, and sedimentation equilibrium analysis were applied. For the gel filtration method, P25 was dissolved and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 m urea, 2 mm DTT, and the 200−μl sample (A280 = 0.3) was applied on the Sephadex G-75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1.3 × 30 cm; void volume = 12 ml). P25 or standard protein samples were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 m urea, and 2 mm DTT at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, andA280 was monitored using the Econo System (Bio-Rad). For the sedimentation equilibrium analysis, P25 was dissolved and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1m NaCl, 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, 2 mm DTT. Concentrations of samples were adjusted toA280 values of 0.15, 0.30, and 0.45 with the solution used for the dialysis. Samples were centrifuged with an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) in a four-hole An-60Ti rotor, equipped with 12-mm two-channel centerpieces and quartz windows, at 20 °C at 15,000, 20,000, and 25,000 rpm. Concentration profiles of samples were monitored by a UV scanner at 280 nm at 2-h intervals. The equilibrium was judged to be reached when the profiles of the last three scans superimposed. Data sets of the nine equilibrium scans were subjected to the global fitting, and the molecular mass was calculated using a program provided by Beckman. The partial specific volume of P25 and the solvent density of 1.058 g/ml, were calculated with the sednterp program (J. Philo, D. Hayes, and T. Laue; available on the World Wide Web). The former value was calculated considering the amino acid composition of P25 obtained from the deduced sequence and the sugar contents: 0.709 for P25 containing GlcNAc6 + Man27, and 0.715 for P25 containing GlcNAc6 + Man18. Female New Zealand rabbits were immunized with the purified H-chain or L-chain, each mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco), followed by a few more injections with each protein sample mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Difco). Female BALB/c mice were immunized with the purified P25 with the adjuvants as above. The antiserum for each protein was affinity-purified by adsorption and elution from the HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with each purified protein according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mouse anti-P25–25 antibody against the 25-residue-long synthetic peptide corresponding to a hydrophilic region of P25 was prepared previously (5Tanaka K. Mori K. Mizuno S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85; Schleicher & Schuell) in 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine using a Semi Dry Electroblotter (Sartorius). The protein blot was treated with TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk and subjected to the reaction with the rabbit anti-H-chain, the rabbit anti-L-chain, the rabbit anti-P25-25, or the mouse anti-P25 antibody in TBST for 1 h at room temperature (about 25 °C). Immune complexes were detected by the reaction with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Promega), followed by the color-developing reaction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride. The protein blots as above were treated successively, all at the room temperature for 60 min each, with TBST containing 5% skimmed milk and 5% gelatin (WAKO), with 1 μg/ml biotinylated ConA (HONEN) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% gelatin, and 4,000-fold diluted alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in TBST containing 5% gelatin. The protein blot was washed extensively with TBST containing 5% gelatin between the steps. The blot was finally subjected to the color-developing reaction as in the Western blotting. When protein samples adsorbed on a microtiter plate were subjected to the reaction, each sample well was treated successively for 1 h each at room temperature with 200 μl of TBST containing 5% skimmed milk; with 100 μl of 20 μg/ml biotinylated ConA in TBST containing 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2; and with 100 μl of 5,000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBST. The color-developing reaction was carried out by adding 100 μl of 0.012% H2O2, 1 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in 0.1 mcitrate buffer (pH 4.5) and incubating at room temperature for 15 min, followed by termination of the reaction with 100 μl of 3n H2SO4, and the absorbance at 490 nm (A490) was measured by the microplate reader (model 550; Bio-Rad). The purified P25 was dissolved in 0.5m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm EDTA, and intramolecular disulfide bonds were cleaved with 10 mm DTT under N2 atmosphere for 2 h at room temperature. Sulfhydryl groups were pyridylethylated with 4-vinylpyridine as described (3Tanaka K. Kajiyama N. Ishikura K. Waga S. Kikuchi A. Ohtomo K. Takagi T. Mizuno S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The mixture was dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 m urea, followed by incubation with lysyl endopeptidase (WAKO; 3 μg of enzyme against 50 μg of P25) at 37 °C for 10 h. The peptides produced were separated by reversed phase HPLC on a Resource RPC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a 0–60% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and A214 of each fraction was determined. A portion of each peak fraction (A214 × sample volume (μl) = 1.6) was lyophilized, acid-hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl, 0.1% phenol under N2 at 110 °C for 24 h, and lyophilized again. Each sample was dissolved in 20 μl of 50 mmNaHCO3 (pH 9.0), 40 μl of (1.3 mg/ml) dabsyl chloride (Dojindo Laboratories) in CH3CN was added, and the mixture was incubated at 70 °C for 12 min, followed by the addition of 440 μl of 70% ethanol. Each sample was diluted 5-fold with Milli-Q water (Millipore), and A436 was determined. Another portion (1250 volume) of each peak fraction was lyophilized and dissolved in 100 μl of PBS or 20 ng of the purified P25 was dissolved in 100 μl of PBS. These samples were then adsorbed on the microtiter plate at room temperature for 2 h and subjected to ELISA with the anti-P25 antibody under the conditions described below. The rest of each peak fraction, containing peptides, was concentrated by a SpeedVac concentrator (SAVANT), dissolved in distilled water, and dialyzed against 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.6) containing 10 mm EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100, and a portion (derived from 12.5 μg of P25) was digested with 0.1 unit of N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 8 h. The reaction was terminated by adjusting to 6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 1 mm DTT and boiling for 3 min. A portion of theN-glycosidase F-treated or -untreated peptide sample was applied onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85; Schleicher & Schuell) using Slot blotter (Schleicher & Schuell), and its reactivity was examined with biotinylated ConA as described above. TheN-glycosidase F-untreated peptide fraction, which gave a positive reaction with biotinylated ConA, was subjected to amino acid sequence analysis with the 491 Protein Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Standard curves were made using the purified H-chain, L-chain, or P25, each of which was dissolved in either 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 murea (condition 1) or dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 m urea, 13 mm DTT, 2% Triton X-100, kept at room temperature for 18 h, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 m urea, 0.14 mm DTT and 0.02% Triton X-100 (condition 2). Fibroin samples prepared from the PSG lumen or soluble protein samples from the cocoon shell were dissolved under condition 1. The purified elementary unit of fibroin dissolved in TMK (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl) was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2m urea (comparable with condition 1) or against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 m urea, 13 mm DTT, 2% Triton X-100, followed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 m urea, 0.14 mm DTT, 0.02% Triton X-100 (comparable with condition 2). Each sample was adsorbed onto the surface of a well of a microtiter plate (Dynatech Lab.) for 36 h at 4 °C, followed by the treatment with TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The fixed protein samples were subjected to the reaction with an antibody in TBST as for the Western blotting, and the immune complex was detected by a reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Promega), followed by a color-developing reaction with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as above. The amount of a protein was determined from theA490 value by comparing with the standard curve obtained under the comparable conditions. Purified P25 (150 ng) was digested with 0.1 unit of N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) in 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 7. 5 forN-glycosidase F or 5.5 for endoglycosidase H) in a total volume of 12 μl at 37 °C for 18 h (forN-glycosidase F) or 8 h (for endoglycosidase H). Two hundred fifty pairs of PSGs were excised from the silkworms (J-139) at the 5th day of the fifth instar, washed briefly in the cold 1.15% KCl, and immersed in TMK. PSGs were then cut into about 5-cm-long pieces, and a single layer of the giant cells of PSG was separated from each piece with a pair of forceps. These cell layers were washed three times in TMK and immersed in 5 ml of TMK containing 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and kept at 4 °C for about 24 h with occasional gentle mixing. After a few seconds of centrifugation at about 10,000 rpm, about 1 ml each of the supernatant was applied to five 1.0 × 41-cm columns of TSK-GEL HW75-F (TOSOH), proteins were eluted with TMK with a flow rate of 67 μl/min, and fractions (25 drops (about 1 ml) per fraction) were collected andA280 of each fraction was measured. A peak fraction that was estimated to be larger than 2,000 kDa and containing H-chain, L-chain, and P25, as detected by Western blotting, from each column was pooled and concentrated to about 1 ml using Molcut-II (Millipore). The concentrated sample was applied to the second gel filtration column (1.0 × 41 cm) of TSK-GEL HW65-S (TOSOH) and was eluted under the same conditions as above. TheA280 peak fractions (fractions 13–15) were pooled and used as the preparation of the purified elementary unit. In some experiments, pieces of PSGs as a whole, without separating the cell layer, were used for the preparation of the elementary unit, applying the same procedure as above. The molecular mass of the elementary unit was estimated by comparing its elution volume from the second gel filtration column with those of marker proteins: β-connectin (2.1 MDa; prepared by S. Kimura according to the published method (11Maruyama K. Kimura S. Yoshidomi H. Sawada H. Kikuchi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)), thyroglobulin (0.67 MDa), ferritin (0.45 MDa), catalase (0.24 MDa), and aldolase (0.16 MDa) (all protein samples except for β-connectin were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). One hundred twenty μl of TMK containing the elementary unit (A280 = 0.305) was subjected to the analytical centrifugation as described above, at 20 °C for 32 h at 3,000 rpm and then for 10 h at 2,500 rpm. Judgment of sedimentation equilibrium and calculation of the molecular mass were carried out as described above. For the latter calculation, the partial specific volume of the elementary unit (0.69), obtained from the amino acid compositions of H-chain (determined by the amino acid analysis; Ref. 12Shimura K. Experientia. 1983; 39: 455-461Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), L-chain (1Yamaguchi K. Kikuchi Y. Takagi T. Kikuchi A. Oyama F. Shimura K. Mizuno S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and P25 (13Chevillard M. Couble P. Prudhomme J.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6341-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Chevillard M. Deleage G. Couble P. Sericologia. 1986; 26: 435-449Google Scholar) (the latter two compositions were obtained from their deduced amino acid sequences) and the density of TMK (1.006 g/cm3) were included. The purified elementary unit was adjusted to 2 mg protein/ml in TMK, and a 100−μl sample was mixed with an equal volume of TMK or TMK containing 26 mm DTT, 4% Triton X-100, 4 m urea, or 4% Triton X-100 plus 4 m urea. A 100-μl sample was also mixed with an equal volume of the reaction buffer (TMK) or the reaction buffer containing 1 unit of N-glycosidase F or 1 unit of endoglycosidase H. The former five mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 18 h, and the latter three mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The mixture containing DTT was incubated under N2 atmosphere. Each sample was then applied to a column of TSK-GEL HW65-S (1.0 × 41 cm), eluted with TMK, or with TMK containing 13 mm DTT, 2% Triton X-100, 2m urea, or 2% Triton X-100 plus 2 murea, when the elementary unit had been treated with the corresponding conditions, and 1-ml fractions were collected.A280 of each fraction was determined, and a portion of every other fraction was subjected to Western blotting as above. The primary structure of P25 has been deduced from the sequence of its genomic clone (13Chevillard M. Couble P. Prudhomme J.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6341-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Chevillard M. Deleage G. Couble P. Sericologia. 1986; 26: 435-449Google Scholar). In this study, we first purified P25 from the fibroin secreted into the PSG lumen. The fibroin sample from B. mori J-139 was separated by SDS-PAGE without cleaving disulfide bonds, and a crude P25 fraction was electroeluted and further purified by the reversed phase column chromatography. Major (fraction 1) and a minor (fraction 2) protein components were separated by the gradient elution with acetonitrile (Fig. 1 A). When proteins in fractions 1 and 2 were each reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining, it was suggested that the fraction 1 contained only P25, which migrated as double bands (Fig. 1 B, lane 2) as shown previously (2Tanaka K. Inoue S. Mizuno S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the fraction 2 contained only L-chain (Fig. 1 B,lane 3), as judged by their electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 1 B; cf. lane 1 (fibroin secreted into the PSG lumen) and lanes 2 and 3). This suggestion was confirmed by Western blotting with the anti-P25-25 antibody (Fig. 1 C,left panel) or the anti-L-chain antibody (Fig. 1 C, right panel). There was no cross-contamination with L-chain or P25 (cf. Fig. 1 C, lanes 2 and 3). The P25 in fraction 1 was used as an antigen to raise the polyclonal antibody in mice, and the antibody produced was affinity-purified with the antigen polypeptide.Figure 7Isolation of the elementary unit of fibroin from PSG cells. A, proteins in the PSG cells, separated from two pairs of PSGs, were solubilized under nondenaturing conditions, applied to a TSK-GEL HW75-F gel filtration column, and eluted with TMK. The protein content of each fraction was monitored byA280. Samples from every other fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the anti-H-chain, anti-L-chain, and anti-P25 antibodies, respectively. B, fractions 23 and 24 from five equivalent columns as in A, but each loaded with proteins from 50 pairs of PSGs, were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to the second gel filtration chromatography on a TSK-GEL HW65-S column and Western blotting as in A. β-Connectin was detected after 0.1% SDS-gradient (2–15%) PAGE by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Peak positions of elution of marker proteins (shown in E) are indicated in Aand B. C, protein components in the purified elementary unit (lane 3; pooled fractions 13–15 in B), fibroin prepared from the PSG lumen (lane 1), and proteins solubilized under nondenaturing conditions from PSG cells (lane 2) were compared by SDS-PAGE after reducing disulfide bonds with 2-mercaptoethanol and by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R.D, fibroin prepared from the PSG lumen (lane 1) and pooled fractions 13–15 in B (lane 2) were subjected to SDS-discontinuous PAGE (volume ratio of 3% stacking gel, 12.5% resolving gel, and 17.5% resolving gel of 0.44:3:1) to examine the lower molecular mass region more clearly and were silver-stained.E, estimation of the molecular mass of the elementary unit by comparing its elution volume with those of marker proteins in the gel filtration chromatography as in B. Marker proteins used were as follows: 1, β-connectin (2,100 kDa); 2, thyroglobulin (670 kDa); 3, ferritin (450 kDa);4, catalase (240 kDa); 5, aldolase (160 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Separation of P25 peptides and their reactivity to biotinylated ConA.

Thus, about 27-kDa (major) and about 24-kDa (minor) bands were detected on SDS-PAGE when disulfide bonds were intact, but instead, about 30-kDa (major) and about 27-kDa (minor) bands were detected after the cleavage of disulfide bonds (5Tanaka K. Mori K. Mizuno S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These two bands were assumed to represent P25 molecules with different compositions of the oligosaccharide chains, because they were both reactive to ConA and they shifted to a single band on SDS-PAGE at the position of about 24 kDa after digestion withN-glycosidase F (2Tanaka K.

We have determined the structure of PGHS-1 at 3 angstrom resolution with arachidonic acid (AA) bound in a chemically productive conformation. The fatty acid adopts an extended L-shaped conformation that positions the 13pro S hydrogen of AA for abstraction by tyrosine-385, the likely radical donor. A space also exists for oxygen addition on the antarafacial surface of the carbon in the 11-position (C-11). While this conformation allows endoperoxide formation between C-11 and C-9, it also implies that a subsequent conformational rearrangement must occur to allow formation of the C-8/C-12 bond and to position C-15 for attack by a second molecule of oxygen."

Although the cluster diameter was similar in both hemispheres, their spacing was about 20 percent larger in the left hemisphere.

https://openalex.org/W2113511334,"The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase tankyrase was originally described as a telomeric protein whose catalytic activity was proposed to regulate telomere function. Subsequent studies revealed that most tankyrase is actually extranuclear, but a discordant pattern of cytoplasmic targeting was reported. Here we used fractionation and immunofluorescence to show in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts that tankyrase is a peripheral membrane protein associated with the Golgi. We further colocalized tankyrase with GLUT4 storage vesicles in the juxtanuclear region of adipocytes. Consistent with this colocalization, we found that tankyrase binds specifically to a resident protein of GLUT4 vesicles, IRAP (insulin-responsiveamino peptidase). The binding of tankyrase to IRAP involves the ankyrin repeats of tankyrase and a defined sequence (96RQSPDG101) in the IRAP cytosolic domain (IRAP1–109). Tankyrase is a novel signaling target of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); it is stoichiometrically phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation. Phosphorylation enhances the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity of tankyrase but apparently does not mediate the acute effect of insulin on GLUT4 targeting. Taken together, tankyrase is a novel target of MAPK signaling in the Golgi, where it is tethered to GLUT4 vesicles by binding to IRAP.

Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Besides the PARP1 domain, which catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of substrate proteins (1Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar), the sterile α module (SAM) in tankyrase is shared by signaling molecules such as the MAPK kinase kinase Byr2 (2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas its ANK domain containing 24 ankyrin repeats is homologous to the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin (3Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Tankyrase was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen where its ANK domain interacts with a telomeric protein, TRF-1 (telomere repeat bindingfactor-1) (1Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Tankyrase was initially described as a telomeric protein, and its PARP activity was proposed to regulate telomere function (1Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Subsequent data revealed that tankyrase targeting is cell cycle-dependent and, surprisingly, that only a minute fraction is found at the telomeres (4Smith S. de Lange T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mitotic HeLa cells tankyrase is highly concentrated around the centrosomes. During interphase, the reported pattern varies dramatically with fixation methods (4Smith S. de Lange T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With formaldehyde fixation, tankyrase appears to decorate the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope. With methanol fixation, however, a punctate pattern was observed in a cluster near the nucleus (4Smith S. de Lange T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of note, the identity of this juxtanuclear localization was not addressed. Given the complex targeting pattern of tankyrase, we hypothesized that it might interact with proteins besides TRF-1 in extranuclear compartments. A compartment of interest is defined by “GLUT4 vesicles”,i.e. endocytic vesicles in myocytes and adipocytes that contain the glucose transporter GLUT4, and IRAP (theinsulin-responsive aminopeptidase) (5Pessin J.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30777-30780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In insulin-deprived adipocytes, most GLUT4 vesicles are sequestered intracellularly in the trans-Golgi reticulum and also in scattered cytosolic sites. Upon insulin stimulation, a major fraction of GLUT4 vesicles in the trans-Golgi reticulum, and to a smaller extent in cytosolic sites, translocate toward the cell surface (7Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V.S. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation inserts GLUT4 and IRAP into plasma membrane, where GLUT4 can facilitate glucose uptake and IRAP can hydrolyze its extracellular substrates (9Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Following insulin withdrawal, both GLUT4 and IRAP are internalized by endocytosis and resequestered in GLUT4 vesicles. This reversible translocation of GLUT4 allows insulin to regulate glucose utilization, but the physiological function of IRAP remains unclear (10Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because IRAP can hydrolyze vasopressin and other vasoactive peptides (9Herbst J.J. Ross S.A. Scott H.M. Bobin S.A. Morris N.J. Lienhard G.E. Keller S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E600-E606PubMed Google Scholar), impaired translocation of IRAP has been implicated in vascular complications caused by insulin resistance (11Garza L.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2560-2567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The targeting machinery for GLUT4 vesicles has not been completely identified, but it presumably interacts with domains in GLUT4 and IRAP that specify their insulin-responsive targeting. The relevant domain(s) within GLUT4 has not been mapped conclusively, presumably because of the multi-spanning membrane topology of GLUT4 (12Corvera S. Chawla A. Chakrabarti R. Joly M. Buxton J. Czech M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 979-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Marsh B.J. Alm R.A. McIntosh S.R. James D.E. J.

By contrast, IRAP is a type II transmembrane protein with a single cytosolic domain (aa 1–109) that clearly confers insulin responsiveness to its targeting (15Subtil A. Lampson M.A. Keller S.R. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4787-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Curiously, overexpression of this IRAP domain causes GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes, suggesting that it can saturate a targeting machinery that also regulates GLUT4 exocytosis (16Waters S.B. D'Auria M. Martin S.S. Nguyen C. Kozma L.M. Luskey K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23323-23327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The IRAP cytosolic domain is therefore an ideal handle for identifying components of the machinery that targets GLUT4 vesicles. This study shows that the IRAP cytosolic domain binds to tankyrasein vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the binding, we also show that tankyrase colocalizes with a significant pool of GLUT4 vesicles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In contrast to previous studies, we consistently localize tankyrase to the Golgi in 3T3-L1 cells. Tankyrase is likely an important signaling molecule, because it is stoichiometrically phosphorylated by MAPK upon insulin stimulation. The phosphorylation of tankyrase by MAPK increases its PARP activityin vitro. However, the phosphorylation is apparently not involved mechanistically in the acute effect of insulin on GLUT4 translocation. Instead, we propose that tankyrase may mediate the long term regulation of GLUT4 vesicles by the MAPK cascade. Human tankyrase cDNA in pTT20 (1Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) was FLAG-tagged N-terminally using standard techniques to yield pFLAG-tankyrase. pFLAG-tankyrase-2 encoding full-length human tankyrase-2 with an N-terminal FLAG tag will be described elsewhere. pAnkG-AR encoding all 24 ANK repeats of ankyrin G (aa 1–850) was constructed by recombining pA3–29 and pA3–19 (3Peters L.L. John K.M. Lu F.M. Eicher E.M. Higgins A. Yialamas M. Turtzo L.C. Otsuka A.J. Lux S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For pIRAP-myc, cDNA encoding human IRAP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a skeletal muscle two-hybrid library (CLONTECH) and inserted into pCS2+MT (17Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) between BamHI and ClaI sites to tag it C-terminally with six myc epitopes. Bacterial vectors expressing GST fused C-terminally to human TRF-1 (aa 1–68), human IRAP (aa 2–109, 2–52, 55–82, 78–109, or 96–101), or rat GLUT4 C-terminal tail (aa 465–509) were generated by inserting the appropriate oligonucleotides or polymerase chain reaction products into the EcoRI site of pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST fusion proteins were induced in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (18Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) except that no detergents were used. Tankyrase and ankyrin G1–850 encoded by pTT20 and pAnkG-AR, respectively, were labeled with [35S]methionine by coupled in vitro transcription/translation (Promega). Labeled proteins were incubated with GST fusion proteins (20 μg) at 4 °C for 3 h in 100 μl of buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm niacinamide (Sigma), 7.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). The precipitants were washed with buffer A (1 ml four times) and separated in 6.5% SDS gels for autoradiography. For co-immunoprecipitation, BOSC cells (19Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) were transfected with pFLAG-tankyrase, pIRAP-myc, or both vectors using a calcium phosphate kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed at 48 h in buffer A and clarified at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with resins (6 μl/10-cm plate) containing anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) or anti-myc 9E10 antibody (BAbCo) at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitants were immunoblotted after washing in buffer A and buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl for 1 h. For antibody characterization, BOSC cells were similarly transfected with pFLAG-tankyrase or pFLAG-tankyrase-2, and the overexpressed proteins were purified using anti-FLAG affinity resin. The rabbit antiserum against IRAPaa1–109 was a generous gift from Dr. Steven Waters (Metabolex). The rabbit antiserum T1S was raised against KLH-conjugated C terminus of human tankyrase (KPEAPSQTATAAEQKT) and affinity purified using UltraLink iodoacetyl resin (Pierce) containing the same peptide. T12 was raised against the C terminus of mouse tankyrase-2 (YPDYLITYQIVRPEGMVDG) and affinity purified using the tankyrase-2 C-terminal peptide YLITYQIVRPEGMVDG (underlined residues shared by tankyrase). T2S was raised against human tankyrase-2 (aa 813–877 fused to GST) and affinity purified using a tankyrase-2 peptide (aa 813–831) showing no homology to tankyrase. Antibody concentrations were determined using an albumin standard (Pierce). For immunoblotting, 6.5% SDS gels (10% for FTCD) were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), blocked in 5% nonfat milk, and blotted in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 with antibodies against FLAG (4 μg/ml, M2, Sigma), myc (1:1000, 9E10, Covance), IRAP (1:2500), FTCD (1:5000, Sigma), T1S (1 μg/ml), T2S (2 μg/ml), or T12 (30 μg/ml). Prestained size markers and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or -rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000) are from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed in PBS and fixed in methanol (5 min) and acetone (2 min) at −20 °C. Alternatively, cells were fixed at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde (45 min, EM Science) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (5 min). Fixed cells were blocked with goat γ globulin (200 μg/ml, Jackson) and incubated with antibodies against tankyrase (T1S, 1 μg/ml), FTCD (1:200), GLUT4 (1F8, 5 μg/ml, Biogenesis), or GLUT1 (C-20, 10 μg/ml, Santa Cruz). After vigorous washes, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (2 μg/ml, Jackson) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (6 μg/ml, Jackson). For GLUT1 immunofluorescence, donkey-derived blocking and secondary antibodies (Cy3 anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-goat) were used. Each step is in PBS at room temperature for 45 min, and samples were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Lab). The images were acquired on a Nikon E800 microscope using the OpenLab software or on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal microscope using the LSN510 software. Confluent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (20Benito M. Porras A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum were serum-starved in DMEM for 2 h and stimulated when indicated with insulin (1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in buffer A, mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and passed through QIAshredder (Qiagen) to obtain total lysates. For subcellular fractionation, fibroblasts grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum were scraped at 4 °C in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and the same protease inhibitors as in buffer A (1 ml/15-cm plate). Cells were homogenized in a tight-fitting Dounce grinder and clarified at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernant was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20 min to recover high density microsomes. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 70 min to separate low density microsomes from soluble proteins. For solubility studies, fibroblasts grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum were Dounce-homogenized in 100 mm Na2CO3(pH 11.5) or in 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8 (750 μl/6-cm plate) at 4 °C, and soluble proteins were separated from the insoluble by centrifugation at 300,000 × g for 30 min. For PARP assays, serum-starved and insulin-stimulated fibroblasts were washed in PBS and lysed in buffer A (0.5 ml/15 ml plate). After preclearing by incubating with 40 μg of GST in buffer A at 4 °C for 2 h, tankyrase was affinity precipitated overnight using 40 μg of wild-type GST-IRAP2–109 or mutant GST-IRAP2–109containing a G101A substitution. The precipitant was washed in buffer N (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and the same protease inhibitors as in buffer A but without benzamide) and incubated with 1 μm[adenylate-32P]NAD (4 Ci/mmol) in 100 μl of buffer N at 37 °C for 90 min. The products were resolved in 6.5%/10% discontinuous gradient gels and detected by autoradiography and phosphorimaging (Fuji). Some products were also immunoblotted with antibodies against polymers of ADP-ribose (SA216, 1:1500, BioMol) and against tankyrase (T1S). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were differentiated from fibroblasts as described (16Waters S.B.

Except for specified modifications, day 8–16 adipocytes were serum-starved in DMEM for 6–15 h and pretreated with U0126 (30 μm, 30 min; Promega), wortmannin (1 μm, 1 h; Sigma), or LY294002 (100 μm, 30 min; Calbiochem) when indicated before a 10-min stimulation with insulin (1 μg/ml), PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml, Sigma), or EGF (100 ng/ml; Upstate Biotechnology) at 37 °C. At 4 °C thereafter, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in buffer A (1 ml/10-cm plate). Lysates were clarified at 14,000 × gfor 10 min and incubated with Sepharose beads containing GST-IRAP78–109 (20 μg/plate lysates) for 8–28 h. The precipitants were washed in buffer A (1 ml three times) and immunoblotted for tankyrase (∼1 plate equivalent/lane). For phosphatase treatment, affinity purified tankyrase was incubated at 30 °C with protein phosphatase-1 (3 units; New England Biolabs) in 60 μl of manufacturer's buffer. For in vitrophosphorylation, affinity purified tankyrase was incubated at 30 °C with activated p42 MAPK (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm at 0.3 Ci/mmol) in 55 μl of 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1.25 mm EGTA, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 50 μm sodium orthovanadate. Forin vivo 32P-labeling, cells were maintained in phosphate/pyruvate-free DMEM for 2 h and then labeled with [32P]Pi (300 μCi/ml) in the same medium for 2 h. The lysates were precleared by incubating with Sepharose beads containing GST (50 μg/plate lysates) for 30 min prior to affinity purification using GST-IRAP78–109. To identify novel components of the targeting machinery for GLUT4 vesicles, we screened a skeletal muscle cDNA library for proteins that interact with the IRAP cytosolic domain (aa 1–109) in a yeast two-hybrid system. This revealed a specific interaction of IRAP with the ANK repeat domain (aa 1–810) of tankyrase-2, a novel tankyrase homologue to be described elsewhere. 2N.-W. Chi and H. F. Lodish, manuscript in preparation. The ANK domain of tankyrase-2 shows 95% similarity to tankyrase, 3N.-W. Chi and H. F. Lodish, unpublished observation. suggesting that tankyrase may also interact with the IRAP cytosolic domain. The interaction was verified in vitro, where resins containing GST fused to the entire IRAP cytosolic domain (IRAP2–109) efficiently precipitated35S-labeled tankyrase (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). Fig. 1 A also shows that GST fused to the juxtamembranous hexapeptide RQSPDG (IRAP96–101) bound tankyrase as efficiently as GST fused to the entire IRAP cytosolic domain (lane 4), whereas the binding was abolished when this hexapeptide was shortened from either end (data not shown). We also examined the binding of tankyrase to the telomere repeat binding factor, TRF-1, because TRF-11–68 has been shown to interact with tankyrase in the yeast two-hybrid system (1Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). This interaction, however, has not been verified biochemically. Fig. 1 A shows that tankyrase indeed bound efficiently to GST-TRF-11–68 (lane 6). The observed binding was specific, as tankyrase did not bind to GST, GST fused to IRAP cytosolic fragments (IRAP2–52 and IRAP55–82) lacking the 96RQSPDG101 hexapeptide (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–3), or GST fused to GLUT4 C-terminal cytosolic tail (aa 465–509; data not shown). Conversely, neither GST-IRAP nor GST-TRF-1 bound to the 24 ANK repeats in the ANK domain of ankyrin (Fig. 1 B), which is homologous to the ANK domain of tankyrase. To show binding of tankyrase to IRAP in vivo, FLAG-tagged tankyrase and myc-tagged IRAP were transiently expressed either alone or in combination in BOSC cells. The expression of full-length tankyrase and IRAP was confirmed in Fig. 2 (A and B, respectively). Fig. 2 C shows that IRAP co-immunoprecipitated with tankyrase only when both proteins were expressed simultaneously (lane 3). BOSC cells were also transfected with FLAG-tagged tankyrase or tankyrase-2 to test the specificity of three affinity purified antisera against tankyrase and tankyrase-2. Fig. 3 A shows that the antiserum T12 recognized tankyrase-2, its immunogen, but also cross-reacted with tankyrase. Fig. 3 A also shows that the antisera T1S and T2S selectively recognized tankyrase and tankyrase-2, respectively. In immunoblots of 3T3-L1 fibroblast lysates, T1S detected endogenous tankyrase that co-migrated with recombinant tankyrase (Fig. 3 B). As expected, endogenous tankyrase cross-reacted with T12 but not T2S (data not shown). The tankyrase antibody used in previous immunofluorescence studies revealed a discordant pattern of tankyrase targeting that varied drastically with fixatives (4Smith S. de Lange T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the antibody was raised against a region in tankyrase (aa 973–1149) (1Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) that shows 68% identity to tankyrase-2 (aa 822–996)3 and thus can potentially cross-react with tankyrase-2. We therefore used the tankyrase-specific antiserum, T1S, to re-examine tankyrase localization by indirect immunofluorescence. In formaldehyde-fixed 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, wide field microscopy showed that most tankyrase was excluded from the nucleus and formed a Golgi-like pattern near the nucleus (Fig. 4 A). This juxtanuclear pattern was tankyrase-specific, because it was not observed with control immunoglobulin (Fig. 4 B). To show that tankyrase is indeed localized to the Golgi regardless of fixation methods, cells were also methanol-fixed and co-stained for tankyrase and the Golgi marker FTCD (21Gao Y.S. Alvarez C. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33825-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 C shows that methanol preserved the juxtanuclear pattern of tankyrase (left panel), which overlapped extensively with FTCD (right panel). Therefore, our data consistently localized tankyrase to the Golgi. The Golgi apparatus is disintegrated in cells treated with brefeldin A or nocodazole (22Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). These agents were therefore used to confirm the Golgi localization of tankyrase. In brefeldin-treated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, tankyrase was dispersed into a fine, punctate pattern throughout the cytosol (Fig. 4 D). By comparison, tankyrase was dispersed into a coarser granular pattern with nocodazole treatment (Fig. 4 E), presumably because nocodazole disrupted the Golgi using a different mechanism (22Dinter A. Berger E.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Of note, even with the disruption of the Golgi, tankyrase remained virtually excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 4, D and E). Golgi membranes cofractionate with the low density microsomes when cellular components are resolved by differential centrifugation (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To confirm the Golgi localization of tankyrase, we fractionated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and recovered the majority of tankyrase in the low density microsome fraction (Fig. 5 A, lane 3, upper panel). The soluble fraction also contained a significant amount of tankyrase, suggesting that tankyrase was not completely membrane-associated (Fig. 5 A, lane 4,upper panel). Like tankyrase, the Golgi marker FTCD was recovered in both the low density microsome and soluble fractions, consistent with FTCD being a peripheral membrane protein in the Golgi (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4, lower panel, and Ref. 21Gao Y.S. Alvarez C. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33825-33834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We also examined the solubility of tankyrase to see whether it associated with membranes as a peripheral or an integral membrane protein. Peripheral, but not integral, membrane proteins can be extracted by alkaline solutions of Na2CO3 (24Steck T.L. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 62: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only peripheral membrane proteins are soluble in the absence of detergents (24Steck T.L. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 62: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B shows that tankyrase was mostly soluble in a high salt buffer that contained no detergent (lanes 1 and 2), and it was quantitatively extracted by Na2CO3 (lanes 3 and4). By contrast, the integral membrane protein IRAP was completely insoluble in both conditions (Fig. 5 B). Our data therefore indicate that tankyrase is peripherally associated with Golgi membranes. Previous studies have shown that a significant pool of GLUT4 vesicles are closely associated with the trans-Golgi network (7Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8Martinez-Arca S. Lalioti V.S. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1705-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because tankyrase is a Golgi-associated protein that binds to IRAP (a resident of GLUT4 vesicles), we expected it to colocalize with GLUT4 near the Golgi. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were therefore co-stained for tankyrase and GLUT4, and 0.8-μm optical sections were obtained using confocal microscopy. Fig. 6 Ashows that in serum-starved adipocytes, tankyrase colocalized with the juxtanuclear pool of GLUT4 but not with the GLUT4 scattered in peripheral regions of the cytoplasm. Upon insulin stimulation, some GLUT4 was recruited from intracellular sites toward the cell surface (arrows in Fig. 6 B). However, insulin did not affect the Golgi localization of tankyrase or its colocalization with the GLUT4 that remained near the nucleus (Fig. 6 B). The observed colocalization was GLUT4-specific, because GLUT1 did not colocalize with tankyrase as shown in a wide field micrograph of adipocytes (Fig. 6 C). We could not address the colocalization of tankyrase with IRAP by indirect immunofluorescence, because available antibodies for both proteins were all raised in rabbits. Given that tankyrase binds to IRAP and colocalizes with a pool of GLUT4 vesicles, we hypothesized that tankyrase might constitute the insulin-regulated targeting machinery for GLUT4. We therefore examined the effect of insulin on endogenous tankyrase in 3T3-L1 cells. Fig. 7 A shows that tankyrase obtained from serum-starved fibroblasts migrated as a 165-kDa protein (lanes 1). Interestingly, the apparentMr shifted to 175 kDa within 10 min of insulin stimulation (lanes 2). Similar experiments in adipocytes showed that insulin, PDGF, and EGF elicited an indistinguishable Mr shift in tankyrase (Fig. 7 B, lanes 1, 2, 6, and7). The completeness of the shift indicated a stoichiometric modification on tankyrase upon growth factor stimulation. These factors (insulin, PDGF, and EGF) activate two major kinase pathways: the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, which can be blocked by LY294002 or wortmannin, and the MAPK cascade, where certain MAPK kinases (e.g. MAPK kinases 1 and 2) can be inhibited by U0126 (25Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 26Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A.

Among these inhibitors, only U0126 blocked the insulin-inducedMr shift of tankyrase (Fig. 7 B,lanes 3–5), suggesting that tankyrase is a target of the MAPK cascade. The Mr of tankyrase can be increased by auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (1Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). However, t"

This reactivity was attributed to the presence of one or more as-yet-unidentified inorganic superoxides or peroxides in the martian soil.

https://openalex.org/W2077198961,"The interferon (IFN)-induced, double-stranded (ds)RNA-activated serine-threonine protein kinase, PKR, is a key mediator of the antiviral activities of IFNs. In addition, PKR activity is also involved in regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and signal transduction. In virally infected cells, dsRNA has been shown to bind and activate PKR kinase function. Implication of PKR activity in normal cellular processes has invoked activators other than dsRNA because RNAs with perfectly duplexed regions of sufficient length that are able to activate PKR are absent in cellular RNAs. We have recently reported cloning of PACT, a novel protein activator of PKR. PACT heterodimerizes with PKR and activates it by direct protein-protein interaction. Overexpression of PACT in mammalian cells leads to phosphorylation of the α subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), the cellular substrate for PKR, and leads to inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we present evidence that endogenous PACT acts as a protein activator of PKR in response to diverse stress signals such as serum starvation, and peroxide or arsenite treatment. Following exposure of cells to these stress agents, PACT is phosphorylated and associates with PKR with increased affinity. PACT-mediated activation of PKR leads to enhanced eIF2α phosphorylation followed by apoptosis. Based on the results presented here, we propose that PACT is a novel stress-modulated physiological activator of PKR."
https://openalex.org/W2106333878,"Integrins α1β1 and α2β1 are two major collagen receptors on the surface of eukaryotic cells. Binding to collagen is primarily due to an A-domain near the N terminus of the α chains. Previously, we reported that recombinant A-domain of α1β1(α1A) had at least two affinity classes of binding sites in type I collagen (Rich, R. L., et al. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 24906–24913). Here, we compared the binding of the recombinant A-domain of α2β1 (α2A) to type I collagen with that of α1A using surface plasmon resonance and showed that α2A exhibited only one detectable class of binding sites in type I collagen, with a KD of ∼10 μm at ∼3 binding sites per collagen molecule. We further demonstrated that α1A and α2A competed with each other for binding to type I collagen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), suggesting that the binding sites in collagen for the two A-domains overlap or are adjacent to each other. By using rotary shadowing, the complexes of α1A- and α2A-procollagen were visualized. Morphometric analyses indicated three major binding regions (near the N terminus, in the central part, and near the C terminus) along the type I procollagen molecule for both A-domains. The positions of the respective binding regions for α1A and α2A were overlapping with or adjacent to each other, consistent with the ELISA results. Analysis of the sequences of type I collagen revealed that GER or GER-like motifs are present at each of the binding regions, and notably, the central region contains the GFOGER sequence, which was previously identified as a high affinity site for both α1A and α2A (Knight, C. G., et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35–40). Peptides containing GLOGERGRO (peptide I, near the N terminus), GFOGERGVQ (peptide II, central), and GASGERGPO (peptide III, near the C terminus) were synthesized. Peptides I and II effectively inhibited the binding of α1A and α2A to type I collagen, while peptide III did so moderately. The N-terminal site in type I collagen has the sequence GLOGER in all three chains. Thus, it seems that peptide I represents a newly discovered native high affinity site for α1A and α2A.

In addition to providing structural support, collagen can also affect cell behavior and gene expression through interactions with other matrix proteins and cellular receptors. We currently recognize 19 genetically distinct collagen types, and numerous other proteins have been described that contain collagenous domains. The collagen triple helix is formed by repeating GXY sequences within each chain, where X is often proline and Y is often hydroxyproline. Such molecules then interact to form higher structures of varying organization, such as fibrils (types I, II, III, V, and XI), networks (types IV, VIII, and X), and beaded filaments (type VI). Collagen type I, the most abundant collagen type, is a heterotrimer composed of two α1(I) and one α2(I) chains to give a molecular organization [α1(I)]2α2(I) (for review, see Ref. 1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors involved in cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, as well as in several signal transduction pathways (for reviews, see Refs 2Humphries M.J.

The interactions of both integrins with collagen involve a so-called von Willebrand factor A-like domain (A-domain), also called an inserted domain (I-domain), and require triple helical collagen structures. Furthermore, the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ is required for high affinity binding. Recombinant α1 and α2 A-domains (α1A and α2A) expressed in Escherichia coli were previously shown to bind to collagen type I and type IV in a concentration-dependent manner and to have the same cation dependence as the corresponding intact integrins (7Calderwood D.A.

Thus, integrins and MSCRAMMs appear to employ similar binding surfaces for their interactions with collagen. Other similarities in the collagen binding mechanisms of CNA-(30–531) and α1A have been observed. Both proteins bound to multiple sites in collagen type I with various affinities. The high affinity class of binding sites in type I collagen for α1A exhibited a KDof 0.09 ± 0.06 μm and occurred 2.5 ± 0.5 times per monomer, whereas CNA-(30–531) bound to 1.3 ± 0.1 sites per type I collagen monomer with highest affinity (KD = 0.21 ± 0.02 μm) (16Rich R.L.

Studies using CNBr or collagenase-generated fragments indicated that α1β1 and α2β1 bound to multiple sites in collagens (29Gullberg D. Gehlsen K.R. Turner D.C. Ahlen K. Zijenah L.S. Barnes M.J.

Replacement of residue Glu by Asp causes complete loss of recognition by α1A and α2A, whereas replacement of residue Arg by Lys causes substantial loss of recognition (34Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Recently, the GFOGER-containing collagen peptide was co-crystallized in complex with α2A (35Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Structural analyses of this complex revealed that residue Glu in the collagen peptide directly coordinates with the metal ion; residue Arg forms a salt bridge to an Asp residue in α2A, and residue Phe makes hydrophobic contact with α2A (35Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 100: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to residues Glu and Arg, it seems important that the second residue in this 6-amino acid segment is a hydrophobic residue. Comparison between the collagen-bound structure and α2A without ligand revealed that the formation of a complementary surface for collagen binding involves major conformational changes of the A-domain. Although both α1β1 and α2β1 bind to collagen types I and IV, their relative affinities for the two collagen types differ. Thus, α1β1 binds to collagen type IV with higher affinity than to type I, whereas α2β1 has a higher affinity for collagen type I than for type IV (36Kern A. Eble J. Golbik R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Similar differences have also been observed in the interaction of the α1A- and α2A-domains with these two collagen types (7Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Ebles J. Kühn K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, α1A and α2A appear to bind to collagen type I with different affinities although results from different studies are not consistent (7Calderwood D.A. Tuckwell D.S. Ebles J. Kühn K.

Comparison between the structures of α1A and α2A revealed that their trenches differ in dimensions, with the one of α1A being longer, wider, and deeper than that of α2A (16Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A. Moore D. Symerski J. Yang V.W.-C. Narayana S.V.L. Höök M. J. Biol.

In both α1A and α2A, a so-called αC helix was found between β-strand E and helix α6 and this αC helix forms a wall of each trench. The αC helix in α2A is more protruding than that of α1A, contributing to the smaller dimensions of its trench. Mutations of residues in the αC helix affect collagen binding of α2A, but the reported results differ perhaps due to the introduction of different amino acids and/or to the different assay systems used (9Kamata T.

The MIDAS residues and their spatial arrangement are conserved between α1A and α2A, suggesting a possible common metal-coordinating mechanism in their interactions with collagen. The structural differences observed in the binding trenches, however, raise the possibility of differences in binding characteristics for α1A and α2A. We previously reported that α1A has at least two classes of binding sites in type I collagen with the highest affinity class having a KD of 0.09 ± 0.06 μmand approximately three binding sites. We now report on the characterizations of the binding of α2A to type I collagen using both surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and ELISAs. We show that α2A binds type I collagen in a slightly different manner compared with α1A. However, the two A-domains seem to target the same or overlapping sites in type I collagen. By using rotary shadowing followed by electron microscopy of mixtures of each A-domain and type I procollagen, we located these sites along the collagen molecule. Amino acid sequences within these regions were selected and incorporated into synthetic collagen peptides. Analyses of these triple helical peptides identified a new high affinity binding site in type I collagen for both α1A and α2A. A DNA fragment encoding the A-domain of α1 was amplified by PCR from a human hepatoma cDNA library and cloned in the expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) as described previously (16Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A. Moore D. Symerski J. Yang V.W.-C. Narayana S.V.L. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24906-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The A-domain of α2 was cloned by using a similar strategy. In this case, oligonucleotide primers 5′ CGG ATC CCC TGA TTT TCA GCT CTC AGC C and 5′ GCT GCA GTC AAA TGC TGA AAA TTT GTT CTC C were used to amplify by PCR the DNA fragment encoding α2A-domain from a human hepatoma cDNA library. AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers contained restriction sites for BamHI and PstI. The PCR product was purified, digested with BamHI and PstI, purified again, and ligated to pQE30 digested with the same enzymes and treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli JM101. The construct was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The encoded amino acid sequence of the α2A-domain was as published (37Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Large scale expression and purification of α1A and α2A proteins were as described previously using HiTrap Ni2+-chelating chromatography (16Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A.

Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm as measured on a Beckman DU-70 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The molar extinction coefficient at λ280 of each protein was calculated using the method of Pace et al. (38Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). Previous analysis showed gradual precipitation of the recombinant A-domains within several days of post-purification. Addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol delayed the precipitation for several weeks (16Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A. Moore D. Symerski J. Yang V.W.-C. Narayana S.V.L.

Analysis of immediately purified protein in buffer with or without 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol gave the same results, indicating that 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol does not disturb the interaction. Thus, all analyses were performed in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol and within 2 weeks of purification. Analyses were carried out at ambient temperature using the BIACORE 1000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (16Rich R.L. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Owens R.T. Carson M. Höök A.

Briefly, 3000–4000 response units of bovine type I collagen (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Biomaterials, Palo Alto, CA) or chicken type I procollagen were immobilized on one of the flow cells on a CM5 chip. The α1A and α2A proteins at the indicated concentrations in HBS (10 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.4) buffer containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside were run over these surfaces at 5 μl/min for 4 min. Regeneration of the collagen surface was achieved by running 20 μl of a solution of 0.02% SDS, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside through the flow cell at 5 μl/min. Binding of α1A and α2A to reference flow cells, which had been activated and deactivated without the coupling of collagen, was also measured and was subtracted from the binding to collagen-coated chips. SPR sensorgrams from different injections were overlaid using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software (BIAcore AB). Data from the equilibrium portion of the sensorgrams were used for analysis. Based on the correlation between the SPR response and change in soluble A-domain protein binding to the immobilized collagen, values for the binding ratio, νbound, and the concentration of free protein, [P]free, were calculated using the equations described previously (28Rich R.L. Kreikemeyer B. Owens R.T. LaBrenz S. Narayana S.V.L. Weinstock G.M. Murray B.E. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26939-26945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis was performed by plotting νbound/[P]free against νboundin which the negative reciprocal of the slope is the dissociation constant, KD, and the X-intercept is the number of binding interactions, n. Nonlinear regression was also performed by plotting νbound against [P]free and fitted with the one-binding class or the two-binding class models using the GraphPad Prism™ software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Results from the two models were compared with respect to the value of R 2 and the degree of freedom of the curve fit. KD values outside the experimental data range were excluded. In the case when the two KD values given by the two-class equation were similar to each other, one-binding class equation was used to calculateKD and n. Experiments were performed with at least three independent protein preparations and three flow cells coated independently with bovine type I collagen. For chicken type I procollagen, two BIAcore runs were performed for each A-domain. The results were reproducible. EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) was dissolved in distilled H2O to a concentration of 1 μg/μl. The solution was immediately added to the recombinant proteins in HBS with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol at a ratio of 70 μl of biotin solution per mg of protein and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in an end-over-end shaker. The proteins were then dialyzed against HBS containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C with three buffer changes. Final protein concentration was measured as described above. Microtiter wells (Immulon 4, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 1 μg of bovine type I collagen or ovalbumin in HBS overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with HBS and incubated with blocking buffer (HBS containing 0.1% w/v ovalbumin and 0.05% v/v Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Varying concentrations of the biotinylated recombinant proteins in blocking buffer containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol were added to the wells. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking, the wells were extensively washed with HBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 mm MgCl2. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted 10,000-fold with blocking buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2 and added to the wells. After incubation at room temperature for 45 min, the wells were washed with HBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1 mm MgCl2. For color development, 100 μl of 1.3 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, containing 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) were added to the wells. Absorbance at 405 nm (A405 nm) was measured using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA) after 20–30 min of incubation at room temperature. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated with independently prepared protein preparations. Binding to ovalbumin-coated wells was considered background and therefore subtracted from binding to collagen. Data were presented as the mean value ± S.E. ofA405 nm from a representative experiment (n = 3). Apparent dissociation constants,KD(app), were calculated using the nonlinear regression method described above, withA405 nm versus [P], instead of νbound and [P]free, where [P] is the total protein concentration. Analysis of the results indicated that the one-binding class model rather than the two-binding class model was a better fit for both α1A and α2A. Thus the one-binding class model was used to calculate the apparent dissociation constants (KD(app)) of both the α1A and α2A interaction with collagen. Competition ELISAs were performed essentially as described above except that biotinylated proteins were mixed with unlabeled proteins in varying ratios and added to the wells. The binding to the blocking agent ovalbumin was subtracted from the binding to collagen. TheA405 nm of biotinylated protein in the absence of competitors was set to 100%. Data was presented as the mean value ± S.E. of percent binding from three independent experiments (n = 9). The concentration of protein required to compete for half the specific binding, IC50, was calculated based on the one-site competition equation using GraphPad PrismTM software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Purification of type I procollagen from 11-day embryonic chicken tendons was as described previously (39Swasdison S. Mayne P.M. Wright D.W. Accavitti M.A. Fitch J.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Mayne R.

However, it remains unknown which component of the dystrophin complex interacts with caveolin-3.

Our results indicate that caveolin-3 co-localizes, co-fractionates, and co-immunoprecipitates with a fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic tail of β-dystroglycan. In addition, we show that a novel WW-like domain within caveolin-3 directly recognizes the extreme C terminus of β-dystroglycan that contains a PPXY motif.

As dystrophin is known to bind β-dystroglycan through 15 residues at the C-terminal of β-dystroglycan (13Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Cell Biol.

Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-caveolin-3 IgG (mouse mAb1 cl 26 (11) was the generous gift of Dr. Roberto Campos-Gonzalez, BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-β-dystroglycan IgG (mouse mAb, Novocastra) and anti-placental alkaline phosphatase IgG (rabbit pAb)Zymed Laboratories Inc. A variety of other reagents were purchased commercially: cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc.; glutathione-Sepharose 4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; “SPOTs” membranes and blocking buffer were from Genosys, Inc. The construction of the alkaline phosphatase-tagged β-dystroglycan (AP-β-DG) was as described previously (15Rentschler S. Linn H. Deininger K. Bedford M.T. Espanel X. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, AP-β-DG is a fusion protein carrying the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan fused to the ectodomain of alkaline phosphatase (AP). The cDNA for caveolin-3 was as previously described (10Tang Z.-L. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Cells (∼30–50% confluent) were transiently transfected using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation method and analyzed 48 h post-transfection. The derivation of a 293T stable cell line overexpressing AP-β-DG was as described previously (15Rentschler S. Linn H. Deininger K. Bedford M.T. Espanel X. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were grown on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then immunostained with monoclonal anti-caveolin-3 and polyclonal anti-placental alkaline phosphatase. Bound primary antibodies were visualized with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.). As expected, omission of the primary antibodies prevented immunostaining. Transfected 293T cells were scraped into 0.7 ml of Mes-buffered saline (MBS, 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15m NaCl) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (19Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Chun M.C. Sargiacomo M.

Homogenization was carried out with 10 strokes of a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 0.7 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MBS and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was formed above the homogenate and centrifuged at 44,000 rpm for 16–20 h in a SW60 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light scattering band confined to the 15–20% sucrose region was observed that contained caveolin-3, but excluded most other cellular proteins. From the top of each gradient, 0.375-ml gradient fractions were collected to yield a total of 12 fractions. An equal amount of protein from each gradient fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). The protein bands were visualized with Ponceau S (Sigma). Membranes were blocked with 5% low-fat dried milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with either anti-β-dystroglycan IgG or anti-caveolin-3 IgG, washed in TBST, and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (BD Transduction Laboratories). Bound IgG were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed essentially as previously described (11Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Okamoto T.

Briefly, 293T cells stably expressing AP-β-DG were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of the caveolin-3 cDNA and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Pre-cleared lysates were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a specific mouse monoclonal IgG directed against caveolin-3, and immunoprecipitated using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After extensive washing, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with a mAb directed against β-dystroglycan. The construction of GST-β-dystroglycan and GST-dystrophin fusion proteins was as described previously (13Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1996; 233: 272-277Google Scholar, 15Rentschler S. Linn H. Deininger K. Bedford M.T. Espanel X. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dystroglycan GST fusion proteins used were as follows: GST-β-DG (corresponding to amino acids 467–895), GST-β-DG (), GST-β-C3 (), and GST-β-C2 (). The GST-WW-dystrophin fusion protein used corresponds to amino acids 3046–3447. Cav-3-WW-like domain (corresponding to amino acids 34–129) and Cav-1-WW-like domain (corresponding to amino acids 61–156) were amplified and subcloned into the BamHI/SalI sites of pGEX-4T vector. All the GST fusion protein constructs were transformed intoEscherichia coli (BL21 strain; Novagen, Inc.). After induction of expression through addition of 5 mmisopropyl-β-d-galactoside (Sigma), GST fusion proteins were affinity purified on glutathione-agarose beads, using the detergent Sarcosyl for initial solubilization (30Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). GST-β-dystroglycan full-length, a variety of deletion mutants and GST alone (bound to glutathione-agarose beads) were extensively washed first with TNET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) (3 times) and lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mmoctylglucoside), both containing protease inhibitors. SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining was used to determine the approximate molar quantities of the fusion proteins per 100 μl of packed bead volume. Pre-cleared lysates of 293T cells overexpressing caveolin-3 were diluted in buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20) and added to approximately 100 μl of equalized bead volume for overnight incubation at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline (6 times). Finally, the beads were resuspended in 3 × sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The pull-down assay using GST alone or GST-Cav-3 fusion proteins was essentially as described above, except that 293T cells stable expressing AP-β-DG cDNA were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycolate). Pre-cleared lysates were diluted in Tween buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) and added to approximately 100 μl of equalized bead volume for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Overlay binding assays were performed essentially as described previously, with minor modifications (15Rentschler S. Linn H. Deininger K. Bedford M.T. Espanel X. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Peptide dot blots (SPOTs; Genosys Biotechnologies) were blocked overnight with blocking buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Genosys, Inc.) and then probed with 125I-labeled GST-Cav-3-WW, GST-Cav-1-WW, or GST alone. Bound protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA encoding caveolin-3. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were collected into 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octylglucoside), containing protease inhibitors. After pre-clearing, biotinylated β-dystroglycan-derived peptides (either WT or the AA mutant) were added pre-bound to streptavidin-agarose beads. After incubation for 4 h at 4 °C, the beads were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline (6 times). Finally, the beads were resuspended in 3 × sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with a mouse mAb directed against the N terminus of caveolin-3 (11Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15160-15165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). To generate streptavidin beads containing pre-bound biotinylated peptides, the beads (50 μl) were incubated overnight with a 1-ml solution containing ∼15 μg/ml of peptide dissolved in lysis buffer. A 10-cm plate of confluent cells overexpressing AP-β-DG and four 10-cm plates overexpressing caveolin-3 were lysed in Buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycolate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Clarified AP-β-DG cell lysates were diluted in Tween buffer and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose immobilized GST-dystrophin fusion protein, glutathione-Sepharose immobilized GST, or with glutathione-Sepharose alone. Samples were then treated with 0.75 ml of cell lysate from 293T cells transfected with caveolin-3 cDNA, or with an equal volume of lysis buffer. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, glutathione-Sepharose conjugates were pelleted by centrifugation and washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline. Complexes were disrupted by boiling in 3 × Laemmeli buffer. Equal volumes of each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the cDNAs encoding full-length caveolin-3 and β-dystroglycan. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in IP buffer containing protease inhibitors. After pre-clearing, antibodies directed against caveolin-3 and a given peptide competitor (200 μg/ml) were added to the cell lysates. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with IP buffer, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with antibodies directed against β-dystroglycan. Caveolin-3 and β-dystroglycan are known to localize to the sarcolemma and both coincide with the distribution of dystrophin (11Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Okamoto T. Li S. Chafel M. Chu C.

Nature. 1989; 338: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). To examine a possible association between caveolin-3 and β-dystroglycan, we used a heterologous expression system. NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with the cDNAs encoding caveolin-3 and alkaline phosphatase-tagged β-dystroglycan (AP-β-DG) and subjected to immunostaining. Caveolin-3 expression was detected with a specific mouse monoclonal Ab (clone 26); β-dystroglycan expression was detected with a rabbit polyclonal Ab that recognized the alkaline phosphatase epitope. Cells expressing both gene products were visualized with imaging by confocal laser fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). Our results indicate that caveolin-3 and β-dystroglycan demonstrate significant co-localization at the level of the plasma membrane.Figure 5Caveolin family members contain a central WW-like domain. A, caveolin family members. The protein sequences of vertebrate caveolins identified to date are shown. Note the positions of the conserved aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr, or Phe) and proline (Pro) that are characteristic of known WW domains.

Note that the WW-like domain within caveolins overlaps with a domain previously suggested to function as a putative membrane spanning domain (based soley on its predicted hydrophobicity); however, experimental evidence has now shown that this region does not attach caveolins to the membrane (39Schlegel A.

In addition, caveolin-2 lacks certain critical residues that are required to form a WW domain.B, other WW-like domains. WW-like sequences have also been identified in the PDGF-β receptor and related receptors (32Irusta P.M. DiMaio D.

NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with the cDNAs encoding caveolin-3 and AP-β-DG.

To separate membranes enriched in caveolin-3 from the bulk of cellular membranes and cytosolic proteins, an established equilibrium sucrose density gradient system was utilized (19Scherer P.E.

In this fractionation scheme, immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-3 IgG can be used to track the position of caveolae-derived membranes within these bottom-loaded sucrose gradients. Fig.2 shows that ∼90–95% of caveolin-3 (fractions 4 and 5) is separated from the bulk of cellular proteins. We also examined the distribution of β-dystroglycan in these sucrose density gradients. Fig. 2 demonstrates that ∼20–25% of β-dystroglycan co-fractionates with caveolin-3. To further investigate whether caveolin-3 and β-dystroglycan are physically associated, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Lysates from 293T cells overexpressing both proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-caveolin-3 IgG. As a negative control, a lysate from cells overexpressing only β-dystroglycan was used. Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with a mAb directed against β-dystroglycan. Fig.3 shows that caveolin-3 specifically co-immunoprecipitates with β-dystroglycan; no β-dystroglycan was found in the precipitate lacking caveolin-3. In addition, transfection experiments employing an increasing amount of the caveolin-3 cDNA showed that an increasing amount of β-dystroglycan co-immunoprecipitated. To examine whether caveolin directly interacts with β-dystroglycan, we expressed and affinity purified a GST fusion protein carrying the full-length β-dystroglycan molecule GST-β-DG FL-(467–895). GST-β-DG FL, immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, was incubated with lysates from 293T cells transiently overexpressing caveolin-3. After extensive washing, the samples were resuspended in 3 × sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Blots were then immunostained with anti-caveolin-3 IgG. Fig.4 A shows that caveolin-3 bound specifically to full-length β-dystroglycan, as compared with GST alone or with beads alone. To identify the region within β-dystroglycan that interacts with caveolin-3, we used GST fusion proteins carrying various portions of the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan. These β-dystroglycan GST fusion proteins were as follows: GST-β-DG-(467–895), GST-β-DG-(467–787), GST-β-C3-(787–819), and GST-β-C2-(787–895). These fusion proteins are shown schematically in Fig. 4 B and were essentially as described previously (13Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1996; 233: 272-277Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, the GST-β-dystroglycan fusion protein lacking the C-terminal domain (residues 467–787) shows little or no binding activity. In contrast, the GST-β-dystroglycan fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain (residues 787–895), i.e.GST-β-C2, retains significant binding activity. Also, note that the GST-β-dystroglycan fusion lacking the extreme C-terminal domain (residues 787–819), i.e. GST-β-C3, does not retain any binding activity. These experiments demonstrate that the extreme C-terminal domain (residues 819–895) of β-dystroglycan can serve as an interaction site for caveolin-3. As the extreme C-terminal domain of β-dystroglycan serves as the dystrophin anchoring site (13Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Cell Biol.

Although traditionally thought of as a nuclear transcription factor, the estrogen receptor has also been identified in the cell plasma membrane to signal but serve largely undefined roles. Here we show that estradiol (E2) rapidly activates p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase in endothelial cells (EC), which activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and the phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27. The sex steroid preserves the EC stress fiber formation and actin and membrane integrity in the setting of metabolic insult. E2 also prevents hypoxia-induced apoptosis and induces both the migration of EC and the formation of primitive capillary tubes. These effects are reversed by the inhibition of p38β, by the expression of a dominant-negative mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 protein, or by the expression of a phosphorylation site mutant heat shock protein 27. E2 signaling from the membrane helps preserve the EC structure and function, defining potentially important vascular-protective effects of this sex steroid.

This occurs through multiple potential and described mechanisms leading to the modulation of vascular cell function and blood vessel tone and remodeling (2Mendelsohn M.E. Karas R.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1801-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). The known mechanisms that underlie the preservation of vascular function include E2 inducing a favorable lipid profile, serving as an anti-oxidant, inhibiting the synthesis of prothrombotic proteins, and stimulating nitric oxide generation. However, the cell-based actions of E2, which lead to the preservation of the structure and function of important vascular cells, such as endothelial cells (EC), are not well understood. These actions are important because it has recently been appreciated that endothelial cell dysfunction underlies many acute and chronic vascular diseases (3Biegelsen E.S. Loscalzo J. Coron. Artery Dis. 1999; 10: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Steroid hormones have traditionally been thought to act exclusively by binding to nuclear receptors, which then transactivate target genes (4Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has additionally supported rapid, non-genomic actions of several steroids (5Blackmore P.F. Neulen J. Lattanzio F. Beebe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18655-18659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wehling M. Steroids. 1995; 60: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, the estrogen receptor (ER) has also been identified in the cell plasma membrane (7Pietras R. Szego C.M. Nature. 1977; 265: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), serving largely undefined roles. Some effects of E2 appear to originate from the cell membrane, probably through binding plasma membrane ER that activates downstream signaling (8Aronica S.M. Kraus W.L. Katznellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8517-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 9Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 10Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). However, the range of signal transduction pathways activated by the membrane ER has not been defined, and the potential roles of these pathways to mediate important E2 actions in target cells are largely unknown. Here, we investigated potential roles of the ER in the function of the EC. We report the novel observation that E2 induces the activation of the p38β member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, leading to the activation of the serine/threonine kinase, MAPKAP-2 kinase, and the phosphorylation of heat shock protein (HSP) 27. This signal transduction pathway in the EC substantially underlies the ability of E2 to preserve the actin cytoarchitecture during metabolic stress, rescue EC from hypoxia-induced apoptosis, and induce the migration of EC leading to tube formation. These findings implicate the membrane ER in the vascular cell protective actions of this steroid. A p38β dominant-negative adenoviral vector was obtained from Jiahuai Han (Scripps), a dominant-negative MAPKAP-2 kinase expression plasmid was from Matthias Gaestel (Max Delbuck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany), and a triple serine mutant, non-phosphorylatable HSP27 expression vector was a gift from Lee Weber (University of Nevada). Bovine aortic EC cultures were prepared as described previously (12Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and plated as primary cultures in phenol red-free medium and in serum stripped with charcoal to remove steroids. EC were synchronized in the absence of serum for 24 h. For p38 or MAPKAP-2 kinase activity assays, the cells were incubated with E2 (10 nm) for 10 min based on preliminary time course studies. The cells were lysed, and the lysate was immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose conjugated to antiserum for p38 or MAPKAP-2 kinase. Immunoprecipitated kinases were washed and then added to the proteins ATF-2 (for p38) or HSP27 (for MAPKAP) for in vitro kinase assays, similarly as described previously (12Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This procedure was followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation and autoradiography/laser densitometry. BAEC (passages 4–5) were grown to 40–50% confluence and then transiently transfected with 1.5–10 μg of fusion plasmids depending upon the plate size and the amount of cells. Plasmids for transfection included dominant-negative MAPKAP-2 kinase (MK2-R76K) (13Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), control plasmids pKS+ and pcDNA3, or a phosphorylation mutant HSP27 (pSV2711–3G) (14Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-L940PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with LipofectAMINE liposome-DNA complexes at 37 °C for 5 h followed by overnight recovery in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were synchronized for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then experimentally treated. For the p38β dominant-negative, a recombinant adenovirus expressing this construct (p38TY) (15Jiang Y. Chewn C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) was added to subconfluent EC in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% serum, and infection occurred at a multiplicity of 50–100 particles/cell for 12 h. The cells were then cultured in serum-free medium for 36 h before experimentation. Non-transfected or transfected EC were grown to confluence on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and then exposed to 20 μm CCCP, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of 40 ng/ml glucose for 2 h. Some cells were exposed to concomitant E2 (10 nm)or E2-BSA (100 nm). The cells were permeabilized, washed, and then stained with fluorescent-labeled phalloiden (Molecular Probes). Actin distribution was examined under a Nikon epifluorescent microscope. Non-transfected or transfected EC were grown to confluence on 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum. The cells were synchronized for 24 h in the absence of serum, and a wound was created by scraping the monolayer with a single-edge razor blade. Selected reagents were added to the wounded BAEC for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and assessed for migration. BAEC migration was measured using an image analyzer system composed of an inverted microscope and a 20–24-inch digitizing board (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA) attached to an IBM computer. The Sigma Scan program (Jandel) was used for analysis of measurements of the distance traveled by the cells within the calibrated area adjacent to the wound. Five measurements/well were taken, and the results from three separate experiments contributed to the bar graph (see Fig. 4). Non-transfected or transfected EC were placed into an anaerobic chamber for 24 h (Gas Pack System, Becton-Dickinson), which was purged with 95% N2, 5% CO2 and sealed with an oxygen-consuming palladium catalyst. This created hypoxic conditions of 35 mm Hg PO2. Some cells were exposed to 10 nm E2 or 100 nmE2-BSA. The control cells were subjected to normoxia (atmospheric air/5% CO2, 150 mm Hg PO2) in the absence of E2. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining, and the cells undergoing programmed cell death were counted in five separate fields/experiment. Data from three experiments constitute the bar graph (see Fig. 3). Human dermal microvascular EC were plated on growth factor-reduced Matrigel in the presence or absence of E2 and maintained for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed at 6 h (maximum tube formation), stained with Diff-Quik, and photographed and assessed at ×10 magnification using phase microscopy. Five random fields/condition were examined, the number of cords/tubes was counted in each, and the mean values were determined. The experiment was repeated twice additionally. Endothelial cells have been previously demonstrated to contain ER (16Russell K.S. Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We first determined that in the primary cultures of bovine aortic endothelial cells, E2 stimulated the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family member, p38β (Fig. 1 A, right) while inhibiting p38α activity (Fig. 1 A, left) maximally at 10-min incubation. This finding indicates a unique differential regulation of the isoforms of this kinase. E2 effects were significant at 1 nm and were substantially reversed by the specific ER antagonist, ICI 182,780. No effects were seen with 10 nm of the relatively inactive stereoisomer 17-α-E2 or with testosterone, but a cell-impermeable membrane ER ligand, E2-BSA, affected the activity of the two isoforms of p38 comparable to E2. E2-BSA has been shown in several studies to neither enter the cell nor bind and/or activate the nuclear ER (10Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Watters J.J. Campbell J.S. Cunningham M.J. Krebs E.G. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4030-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 18Morey A.K. Pedram A. Razandi M. Prins B.A. Hu R.M. Biesiada E. Levin E.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These data implicate a membrane ER in the modulation of signaling, mainly based upon the rapid and specific effects of E2 but also based upon the lack of precedence for any nuclear receptor to rapidly signal, as well as the comparable effects of E2-BSA and E2. Little is known in general about the cell biologic importance of p38β except that it might participate in cardiac hypertrophy (19Wang Y. Bing S. Valerie P.S. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, a known immediate downstream target of p38 is the serine/threonine kinase MAPKAP-2 (20Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We found that E2 or E2-BSA was each capable of stimulating the activity of this kinase in EC directed against a substrate protein, exogenous heat shock protein 27 (Fig. 1 B). The stimulation of MAPKAP-2 kinase activity was reversed by the soluble and specific inhibitor of p38 activity, SB203580 (21Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar), or by infecting the EC with an adenoviral vector expressing a dominant-negative mutant p38β protein (15Jiang Y. Chewn C. Li Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the β-isoform of p38 mediates the actions of E2 to phosphorylate exogenous HSP27. We then sought to link this pathway to endogenous HSP27 phosphorylation, a known substrate for MAPKAP-2 kinase. E2 or E2-BSA stimulated the phosphorylation of endogenous HSP27, and this was reversed by SB203580 (Fig. 1 C). Transiently transfecting and expressing a dominant-negative MAPKAP-2 protein MK2-R76K (13Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) also abrogated the phosphorylation of HSP27 in response to the steroid (Fig. 1 D). This process identified a novel and rapid signal pathway for estrogen, potentially contributing to the steroid cellular actions. HSP27 is phosphorylated by MAPKAP-2 at three serine residues at positions 15, 78, and 82 (22). HSP27 acts as a capping protein for the barbed ends of actin in the unphosphorylated state (23Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) but is believed to play a role as a phosphoprotein in stabilizing F-actin and allowing the polymerization of this myofibril (24Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In quiescent EC, a predominantly cortical pattern of F-actin localization was observed (Fig. 2 A, left). Upon exposure to E2, the actin filaments were localized to stress fibers and focal adhesions (Fig. 2 B, left). We exposed the EC to an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, CCCP (20 μm), in the presence of low glucose; this metabolic stress simulates an ischemic insult (25Loktionova S.A. Ilyinskaya O.P. Kabakov A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H2147-H2158PubMed Google Scholar). The stress led to the distortion of the actin cytoarchitecture, the severing of actin, and a severely disrupted stress fiber and focal adhesion formation (Fig. 2 C, left). Incubation of the cells with E2 strongly preserved the cell membrane integrity and stress fiber/focal adhesion localization of the actin (Fig. 2 D, left). However, treatment of the cells with SB203580 or expression of the dominant-negative MAPKAP-2 protein substantially prevented the effects of E2 (Fig. 2, A, E, and F, left). Similarly, the expression of a triple serine mutant HSP27 that is unable to be phosphorylated reversed the ability of E2 to preserve cytoskeletal integrity in the stressed EC (Fig. 2 G, left). Similar results were seen when the EC were exposed to E2-BSA (Fig. 2,right). The stable and localized expression of actin to stress fibers is necessary to preserve cell morphology and function and prevent EC dysfunction, which is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular disease (3Biegelsen E.S. Loscalzo J. Coron. Artery Dis. 1999; 10: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This expression identifies a potentially important cell biologic effect of E2. We then explored other cell biologic effects of E2 in this context. EC become dysfunctional or undergo cell death after acute/chronic ischemia or hypoxia. We subjected the EC to 24 h of hypoxia in a chamber containing 1% O2. This resulted in substantial apoptotic cell death as shown by TUNEL staining (Fig. 3, b versus controla). E2 was capable of rescuing the cells, preventing 64% of the hypoxia-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3 c), but this was substantially reversed by inhibiting p38 or MAPKAP-2 kinase activation (Fig. 3, d and e) or by expressing the non-phosphorylatable HSP27 (Fig. 3 f). Similar protection was afforded by the E2-BSA ligand (data not shown). Thus, this pathway serves an important function for cell survival. The migration of vascular cells is critical to the process of blood vessel remodeling. For instance, the migration of a subpopulation of endothelial cells is an important step in the process of angiogenesis. We determined whether E2 could promote EC migration via a signaling-related mechanism. E2 clearly promoted the migration of EC across a wound barrier (Fig. 4,A versus B and bar graph) and was not capable of stimulating EC proliferation in 24 h, which supported migration as the mechanism. The effect of E2 was prevented by 85% from the incubation of cells with SB203580 (Fig. 4 C) and was substantially reversed by the expression of MAPKAP-2 dominant-negative protein (Fig. 4 D) or the expression of the phosphorylation mutant HSP27 (Fig. 4 E). These results support the idea that signal transduction from the membrane ER is necessary for E2 to promote this important step in angiogenesis. E2-BSA again simulated these actions of E2. Previous work suggests that E2 may stimulate angiogenesis (26Morales D.E. McGowan K.A. Grant D.S. Maheshwari S. Bhartiya D. Cid M.C. Kleinman H.K. Schnaper H.W. Circulation. 1995; 91: 755-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as exemplified by the sex steroid-entrained growth and regression of blood vessels in the uterus during the course of the menstrual cycle. Classical angiogenic growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, signal to the various steps of new blood vessel formation (12Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Capillary tube formation in vitro has been used as a model of the early organization of new blood vessels (26Morales D.E. McGowan K.A. Grant D.S. Maheshwari S. Bhartiya D. Cid M.C. Kleinman H.K. Schnaper H.W. Circulation. 1995; 91: 755-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the direct effects of E2, we plated human dermal microvascular EC onto growth factor-deficient Matrigel, a protein substratum mixture that supports the organization of EC into tubes. All cells were incubated in the absence of exogenous growth factors, serum, or phenol red medium. EC incubated with E2 or E2-BSA developed into branching, cordlike primitive capillaries to a much greater extent than the media-incubated control cells during a 6-h period (Fig. 5, a versus b orc). This effect was again substantially reversed by SB203580 (Fig. 5, e and f), whereas SB203580 alone had little effect (Fig. 5 d). Expression of MK2-R76K (Fig. 5 g) substantially reduced E2 or E2-BSA-induced capillary formation (Fig. 5, h and i versus band c). Similar results were seen with the expression of the triple serine mutant HSP27 (Fig. 5, k and l versus b and c). These results suggest that the activation of this signal transduction pathway underlies the ability of E2 to stimulate the early stages of capillary tube formation. Steroids traditionally are thought to exclusively act in the cell as nuclear transcription factors, modulating target genes through complex interactions of steroid receptors, co-activators or co-repressor proteins, histone acetylase, and proteins comprising the basal transcriptional machinery (27Budhram-Mahadeo V. Parker M. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, a functional plasma membrane ER was identified more than 20 years ago (7Pietras R. Szego C.M. Nature. 1977; 265: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), and additional evidence has supported its existence and suggested a potential role in the biology of estrogen action (8Aronica S.M. Kraus W.L. Katznellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8517-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 9Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol.

As a plasma cell membrane receptor, ER might be expected to modulate signal transduction, and several pathways have recently been identified as being activated by E2 (9Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 10Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Here, we report novel findings that E2 can activate a signal pathway that leads to the preservation of function and form of vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 6). These results define several mechanisms by which E2 can protect against EC dysfunction and resulting vascular disease (3Biegelsen E.S. Loscalzo J. Coron. Artery Dis. 1999; 10: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We first found that E2 or E2-BSA activated the p38β isoform but inhibited p38α at 10 min. A specific ER antagonist reversed these effects. We, therefore, propose that a membrane ER rapidly regulates these kinases. Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein kinases localize to the plasma membrane where they are activated by upstream signal transduction pathways, which originate at this location (29Carraway C.A. Carvajal M.E. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25659-25667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Activation of the p38β member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family has not been reported for any steroid, and the differential modulation of p38α and p38β isoforms by any substance has not been previously reported. The p38 family consists of four isoforms (α, β, δ, γ), and the precise cellular roles of each are incompletely understood. p38α has been shown to participate in the induction of apoptosis (30Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 31Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeuad J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar), whereas p38β is known to participate in cardiac hypertrophy (19Wang Y. Bing S. Valerie P.S. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and mediates the transcriptional regulation of Bcl-2 and anti-apoptosis (32Nemoto S. Xiang J. Huang S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16415-16420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that estrogen inhibits p38α in the EC. Taken together, modulation of these two isoforms of p38 may contribute to anti-apoptosis in the EC (see below). We determined that E2 or E2-BSA comparably activated p38β and the downstream signaling and endothelial cell biology. Several laboratories (17Watters J.J. Campbell J.S. Cunningham M.J. Krebs E.G. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4030-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 33Russell K.S. Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Clerisme E. Bender J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), in addition to our own (9Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 10Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have provided evidence that E2-BSA does not enter the cell to bind the nuclear ER or dissociate into E2 and BSA components as implicated in a single publication (34Stevis P.E. Deecher D.C. Shuhadolnik L. Mallis L.M. Frail D.E. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5455-5458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, considering 1) the rapidity of E2 (or E2-BSA) effects, 2) that a specific ER antagonist can prevent the signaling by the steroid compounds actions, and 3) the fact that there is no precedent for nuclear receptors to rapidly signal, we therefore believe that these non-genomic effects of E2 are mediated at the membrane ER. The activation of p38 by E2 then led to the activation of the MAPKAP-2 kinase, a member of a serine/threonine family of related kinases that is stimulated by a variety of cell stressors and growth factors. MAPKAP-2 kinase mediates the direct phosphorylation of transcription factors (cAMP-response element-binding protein, serum response factor) (35Heidenreich O. Neininger A. Schratt G. Zinck R.

Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In our studies, E2 induced the phosphorylation of endogenous HSP27, and this required MAPKAP-2 kinase because the expression of a dominant-negative MAPKAP-2 significantly prevented HSP27 phosphorylation. Expression of this dominant-negative MAPKAP-2 construct has been previously shown to prevent the activation of this kinase (13Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), and we confirmed this in response to E2 or E2-BSA (data not shown). What is the importance of the ability of estrogen to trigger this signaling pathway? The integrity of F-actin is necessary for the physiological functions of EC, such as creating a selective vascular permeability barrier to proteins (38Wong M.K. Gotlieb A.I. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 212-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Shasby D.M. Shasby S.S. Sullivan J.M. Peach M.J. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton occurs after ischemia or other stresses and results in tissue edema formation or vascular thrombosis (40Sunnergren K.P. Rovetto M.J. Am. J.

This disruption is because of ATP depletion during ischemic stress, a metabolic condition that we have simulated here with low glucose and an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation (25Loktionova S.A. Ilyinskaya O.P. Kabakov A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H2147-H2158PubMed Google Scholar). Upon subjecting the EC to this stress, the F-actin integrity and localization were markedly disrupted. E2 or E2-BSA was capable of preventing this disruption through signaling to HSP27 phosphorylation. In this respect, EC survival is also related to our demonstrated effects of E2. HSP27 is a known survival factor for a variety of cells (42Wagstaff M.J. Collaco-Moraes Y. Smith J. de Belleroche J.S. Coffin R.S. Latchman D.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) perhaps through helping to maintain cytoskeletal integrity, thus preventing apoptosis in response to several stresses in various cell types (44Huot J. Houle F. Spitz D.R. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar, 45Landry J. Huot J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). ATP depletion results in cellular calcium overload, which can activate gelsolin, an actin-severing protein (46Kuhne W. Besselmann M. Noll T. Muhs A. Watanabe H. Piper H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1599-H1608PubMed Google Scholar). It is unknown but possible that phosphorylated HSP27 can prevent gelsolin or related protein activation in this setting. Phosphorylated HSP27 also promotes EC migration that is (47Piotrowicz R.S. Hickey E. Levin E.G. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in part related to the ability of the phosphoprotein to allow F-actin polymerization (23Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), which is critical for the extension of cell processes, such as lamellopodia (48Machesky L.M. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 542-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cell migration is dependent on a complex series of events that include active signaling from components of the focal adhesion complex, such as Src family kinases and focal adhesion kinase (49Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 1999; 286: 1102-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that E2 can activate Src in MCF-7 cells (10Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Migliaccio A. Piccolo D. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Gong W. Beato M. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Proximal signaling to the activation of the focal adhesion complex, possible activation of the small GTPases (Rac and Rho), and the activation of the p38-mediated signaling pathway described here may be linked or may occur in parallel in response to E2. Cell migration is one important step in the process of angiogenesis. An excellent example of hormone-entrained neovascularization/regression of blood vessels occurs in the uterus during the menstrual cycle. Angiogenesis may result in part from the ability of E2 to stimulate local vascular endothelial growth factor production (51Garrido C. Saule S. Gospodarowicz D. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and subsequent neovascularization. Here, we show a direct effect of E2 in stimulating primitive capillary tube formation, at least in part, through signaling to HSP27 posttranslational modification. The actions of E2 to signal to cell biology through the membrane ER do not preclude important effects of the nuclear ER to transcribe genes that are critical to maintain EC function. For instance, E2 can transcriptionally activate the HSP27 gene through an Sp1-related mechanism (52Porter W. Wang F. Wang W. Duan R. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1371-1378PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates an important synergism where the nuclear ER promotes HSP27 protein synthesis, and the membrane ER probably triggers the rapid, function-regulating phosphorylation of the protein. In this way, acute and chronic modulation of HSP27 can be achieved through the potentially coordinated actions of distinct and compartmentalized pools of ER. In total, these effects of E2 remarkably preserve EC form and function in the setting of several relevant in vitro stresses. This interaction may unfortunately extend to breast cancer where HSP27 expression and function correlate with the survival and invasiveness of tumors (53Lemieux P. Oesterreich S. Lawrence J.A. Steeg P.S. Hilsenbeck S.G. Harvey J.M. Fuqua S.A. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar, 54Oesterreich S. Weng C.N. Qiu M. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Fuqua S.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4443-4448PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are promoted by E2. This may be related to the dependence of the tumor vasculature on the survival and preservation of EC function that is induced by E2 in an HSP27-dependent fashion as shown here.

Only caspase-1 is known to activate interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, and caspase-11 activates pro-caspase-1 in vivo. Almost nothing is known about caspases 4, 5, and 13. Here we report a sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction system to analyze closely related genes. We employed this system to analyze the gene expression and regulation of human caspases 1, 4, 5, and 13, demonstrating that they have different expression patterns in normal tissues and cell lines. Interferon-γ strongly induced CASP1 and CASP5 but notCASP4 or CASP13 gene expression in HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. In contrast to the mRNA, interferon-γ up-regulated caspase-1 but not caspase-5 protein. In the monocytic cell line THP-1, CASP1 mRNA and caspase-1 protein are expressed constitutively, and their levels were not increased by lipopolysaccharide, whereas both CASP5 mRNA and caspase-5 protein were induced by lipopolysaccharide. Caspase-1 subfamily members displayed different in vitro activities toward pro-caspases 1 and 3 and pro-interleukin-1β.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Currently, 14 caspases have been discovered in mice and humans that represent at least 11 different enzymes (2Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 3Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.

Whereas caspases 1–3, 6–9, and 14 have homologues in mice and humans, caspases 4, 5, 10, and 13 have no known counterparts in mice; and conversely, caspases 11 and 12 have no known counterparts in humans (2Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 3Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar).Based on amino acid sequence homology and to a lesser extent the presence of a long N-terminal prodomain, caspases 1, 4, and 5 and caspases 11–13 constitute one distinct group: the caspase-1 subfamily (4Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The in vitro substrate preferences of caspases 1, 4, and 5 have been determined using small peptides, and they are very similar (5Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the caspase-1 subfamily is large and constitutes almost half the total number of known caspases, an appreciation of their regulation, functions, and activities is still inadequate. Caspase-1 is the best characterized and appears to be involved in some pathophysiological cell deaths (6Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Importantly, it fulfills a major physiological role as an essential mediator of inflammation and immune regulation through the proteolytic processing and activation of IL-1β1 in macrophages and IL-18 (also called interferon-γ-inducing factor) in T cells (3Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Friedlander R.M. Yuan J.

Immunol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).Murine caspase-11 is the only other partially characterized member of the caspase-1 subfamily. Mice deficient in caspase-11 have a very similar phenotype to Casp-1 −/− mice; for example, Casp-11 −/− mice are resistant to endotoxic shock induced by bacterial LPS and fail to produce mature interleukin-1α and IL-1β after LPS stimulation (8Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.-K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Moreover,Casp-11 −/− embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to apoptosis induced by ectopic expression of caspase-1, suggesting that caspase-11 is an upstream activator of caspase-1 (3Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 8Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.-K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Unlike caspase-1, the expression of caspase-11 is LPS-inducible (8Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.-K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 9Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and it is reasonable to anticipate that other members of the family are regulated at the transcriptional or translational level by extracellular stimuli. The human homologue of caspase-11 is unknown because of the dearth of information about the expression, induction, and in vivo substrates of human proteases related to caspase-1, but it could be caspase-4, -5, or -13 based on sequence homology (4Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar).Here we report the development of a highly specific PCR approach to elucidate and compare the gene expression and regulation of very closely related members of the caspase-1 subfamily. Our PCR approach is generally applicable, enabling very highly homologous genes to be clearly distinguished, which is frequently uncertain using Northern blotting. We find that IFN-γ strongly induces expression of the humanCASP1 and CASP5 but not the CASP4 orCASP13 genes. Whereas IFN-γ up-regulates theCASP5 gene but not the caspase-5 protein, bacterial LPS specifically induces both CASP5 mRNA and caspase-5 protein. Thus, the human CASP5 gene resembles the murineCasp-11 gene in its LPS inducibility. We also show that the caspase-1 family members show different in vitro activities toward selected substrates.DISCUSSIONCompared with conventional Northern blot analysis, RT-PCR is more sensitive, straightforward, and less time-consuming but does depend on a careful verification of the specificity of the PCR primers. In this study, we took great care that the PCR primers only amplified their cognate mRNAs (Fig. 1). Moreover, the elevation of CASP5mRNA by IFN-γ and LPS that we demonstrated by RT-PCR is real, because we also verified the IFN-γ-mediated induction ofCASP1 mRNA (16Tamura T. Ueda S. Yoshida M.

Caspase-4, -5, and -13 proteins have 53, 51, and 47% sequence identity with caspase-1, respectively (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M.

Even more striking, the sequence identity among caspases 4, 5, and 13 is over 80% when compared at the DNA level (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M.

When Northern blot analysis is used to assess CASP4, -5, and -13 mRNA levels, the possibility cannot be excluded that cross-hybridization may arise even under very highly stringent hybridization conditions. On the other hand, we designed short PCR primers for RT-PCR chosen from the few divergent regions of each mRNA and ensured that four 3′ nucleotides from each primer are 75–100% mismatched compared with the corresponding positions in the other CASP sequences (Fig. 1, A andB). This is probably the crucial factor that ensures the total absence of cross-priming and forms the basis of our PCR approach for measuring the expression of very closely related genes. Using this approach, we have carried out for the first time a comprehensive assessment of gene expression for the human caspase-1 subfamily in normal tissues and in unstimulated or stimulated cell lines.Human caspase-13 has 47, 75, and 61% sequence identity to caspase-1, -4, and -5, respectively (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Caspase-13 is processed by caspase-8, and overexpressed caspase-13 induces apoptosis, suggesting a potential role of caspase-13 in a caspase-8-mediated signaling pathway (15Humke E.W. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15702-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recombinant caspase-13 completely processed pro-caspase-3 (Fig. 7) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, 2X. Y. Lin, M. S. K. Choi, and A. G. Porter, unpublished observations. whereas other caspases within this family gave only partial cleavage (Fig. 7 and data not shown). In addition, caspase-13 completely cleaved Pro-IL-1β into the 28-kDa intermediate product, whereas caspase-1 cleaved pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β, with hardly a trace of the 28-kDa intermediate. Thus, caspase-13 may be more distinct from other members of the caspase-1 subfamily both on the basis of its substrate cleavage preference and the fact that the expression of its mRNA in many human tissues and cell lines is undetectable by RT-RCR. Nevertheless,CASP13 cDNA encodes an authentic protein, based on the sequence analysis of the RT-PCR product obtained from the skin fibroblast cells. The extremely restrictive and/or transient expression pattern of CASP13 mRNA and the strong potency of recombinant caspase-13 protein against some in vitrosubstrates tested suggest that caspase-13 could play an important role during embryonic development or that its expression may be specifically induced by a currently unknown stimulus.The functions of human caspases 4 and 5 are largely unknown. We found that caspases 5 (in high salt), 4, and 1 cleaved pro-caspase-3 with equivalent efficiencies. This was not the case with pro-IL-1β as substrate, because caspase-1 cleaved pro-IL-1β efficiently, caspase-4 cleaved pro-IL-1β weakly, and caspase-5 had virtually no activity on this substrate. Our results with pro-IL-1β as substrate are very similar to previous findings using a different system (21Fassy F. Krebs O. Rey H. Komara B. Gillard C. Capdevila C. Yea C. Facheu C. Blanchet A.M.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), there is no evidence that they play crucial roles in apoptosis, as do, for example, caspases 3, 8, and 9 (2Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that caspase-4 is activated during Fas-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (22Kamada S. Washida M. Hasegawa J.-I. Kusano H. Funahashi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of an inactive mutant of caspase-4 or microinjection of an anti-caspase-4 antibody delays Fas-induced apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-4 is involved (22Kamada S. Washida M. Hasegawa J.-I. Kusano H. Funahashi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of caspase-4 is most similar to murine caspase-11 (60% identity) (9Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15870-15876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). But caspase-4 is unlikely to be the human homologue of murine caspase-11, because the basal level ofCASP4 mRNA is quite high in tissues and cells, which is in contrast to the very low unstimulated levels of Casp-11in mice (9Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). More importantly, Casp-11 mRNA is LPS-inducible, but CASP4 mRNA is not.Like murine Casp-11, human CASP5 expression is very low in many normal tissues, and CASP5 expression can be induced by bacterial LPS, a property so far shared only withCasp-11. We did not detect pro-caspase-5 zymogen induction by LPS, although we observed an induction of a 35-kDa form of caspase-5, which very likely represents an intermediate or active form of caspase-5, a result of the processing of caspase-5 after induction by LPS. Because very similar size bands were detected in 293T cells overexpressing caspase-5, this would suggest that increased expression of caspase-5 results in its processing. Also, despite the fact that the apparent cleavage preferences of caspases 5 and 11 toward selected substrates are similar, the activity of caspase-5 relies on a high salt concentration, unlike caspase-11. Finally, caspase-5 contains a unique region (amino acids 1–44) in its prodomain that is present neither in caspase-11 nor in any other caspase-1 subfamily members (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P.

Interestingly, frameshift mutations were detected around this unique region in CASP5 in tumors of the endometrium, colon, and stomach (23Schwartz S. Yamamoto H. Navarro M. Maestro M. Reventós J. Perucho M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2995-3002PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our study, caspase-5 is more likely than caspase-4 to be the human homologue of mouse caspase-11, which activates pro-caspase-1 and is required for the generation of functional IL-1β. In this study, we also demonstrated thatCASP5 mRNA is strongly induced by IFN-γ, a pleiotropic cytokine that plays important roles in both antiviral defense and immune cell activation. However, caspase-5 protein is not induced by IFN-γ, suggesting that caspase-5 protein synthesis is post-transcriptionally regulated. The significance of these results will be the subject of our future investigations. Caspases are a family of aspartic acid-specific proteases that fulfill varied and often critical roles in mammalian apoptosis or proteolytic activation of cytokines (1Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 2Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Currently, 14 caspases have been discovered in mice and humans that represent at least 11 different enzymes (2Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 3Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.

Whereas caspases 1–3, 6–9, and 14 have homologues in mice and humans, caspases 4, 5, 10, and 13 have no known counterparts in mice; and conversely, caspases 11 and 12 have no known counterparts in humans (2Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 3Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.

Based on amino acid sequence homology and to a lesser extent the presence of a long N-terminal prodomain, caspases 1, 4, and 5 and caspases 11–13 constitute one distinct group: the caspase-1 subfamily (4Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The in vitro substrate preferences of caspases 1, 4, and 5 have been determined using small peptides, and they are very similar (5Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Zamboni R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the caspase-1 subfamily is large and constitutes almost half the total number of known caspases, an appreciation of their regulation, functions, and activities is still inadequate. Caspase-1 is the best characterized and appears to be involved in some pathophysiological cell deaths (6Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Importantly, it fulfills a major physiological role as an essential mediator of inflammation and immune regulation through the proteolytic processing and activation of IL-1β1 in macrophages and IL-18 (also called interferon-γ-inducing factor) in T cells (3Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Fantuzzi G. Dinarello C.A. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Murine caspase-11 is the only other partially characterized member of the caspase-1 subfamily. Mice deficient in caspase-11 have a very similar phenotype to Casp-1 −/− mice; for example, Casp-11 −/− mice are resistant to endotoxic shock induced by bacterial LPS and fail to produce mature interleukin-1α and IL-1β after LPS stimulation (8Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.-K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Moreover,Casp-11 −/− embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to apoptosis induced by ectopic expression of caspase-1, suggesting that caspase-11 is an upstream activator of caspase-1 (3Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 8Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.-K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Unlike caspase-1, the expression of caspase-11 is LPS-inducible (8Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.-K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 9Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and it is reasonable to anticipate that other members of the family are regulated at the transcriptional or translational level by extracellular stimuli. The human homologue of caspase-11 is unknown because of the dearth of information about the expression, induction, and in vivo substrates of human proteases related to caspase-1, but it could be caspase-4, -5, or -13 based on sequence homology (4Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Here we report the development of a highly specific PCR approach to elucidate and compare the gene expression and regulation of very closely related members of the caspase-1 subfamily. Our PCR approach is generally applicable, enabling very highly homologous genes to be clearly distinguished, which is frequently uncertain using Northern blotting. We find that IFN-γ strongly induces expression of the humanCASP1 and CASP5 but not the CASP4 orCASP13 genes. Whereas IFN-γ up-regulates theCASP5 gene but not the caspase-5 protein, bacterial LPS specifically induces both CASP5 mRNA and caspase-5 protein. Thus, the human CASP5 gene resembles the murineCasp-11 gene in its LPS inducibility. We also show that the caspase-1 family members show different in vitro activities toward selected substrates. DISCUSSIONCompared with conventional Northern blot analysis, RT-PCR is more sensitive, straightforward, and less time-consuming but does depend on a careful verification of the specificity of the PCR primers. In this study, we took great care that the PCR primers only amplified their cognate mRNAs (Fig. 1). Moreover, the elevation of CASP5mRNA by IFN-γ and LPS that we demonstrated by RT-PCR is real, because we also verified the IFN-γ-mediated induction ofCASP1 mRNA (16Tamura T. Ueda S. Yoshida M.

Caspase-4, -5, and -13 proteins have 53, 51, and 47% sequence identity with caspase-1, respectively (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M.

Even more striking, the sequence identity among caspases 4, 5, and 13 is over 80% when compared at the DNA level (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M.

When Northern blot analysis is used to assess CASP4, -5, and -13 mRNA levels, the possibility cannot be excluded that cross-hybridization may arise even under very highly stringent hybridization conditions. On the other hand, we designed short PCR primers for RT-PCR chosen from the few divergent regions of each mRNA and ensured that four 3′ nucleotides from each primer are 75–100% mismatched compared with the corresponding positions in the other CASP sequences (Fig. 1, A andB). This is probably the crucial factor that ensures the total absence of cross-priming and forms the basis of our PCR approach for measuring the expression of very closely related genes. Using this approach, we have carried out for the first time a comprehensive assessment of gene expression for the human caspase-1 subfamily in normal tissues and in unstimulated or stimulated cell lines.Human caspase-13 has 47, 75, and 61% sequence identity to caspase-1, -4, and -5, respectively (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Caspase-13 is processed by caspase-8, and overexpressed caspase-13 induces apoptosis, suggesting a potential role of caspase-13 in a caspase-8-mediated signaling pathway (15Humke E.W. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15702-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recombinant caspase-13 completely processed pro-caspase-3 (Fig. 7) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, 2X. Y. Lin, M. S. K. Choi, and A. G. Porter, unpublished observations. whereas other caspases within this family gave only partial cleavage (Fig. 7 and data not shown). In addition, caspase-13 completely cleaved Pro-IL-1β into the 28-kDa intermediate product, whereas caspase-1 cleaved pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β, with hardly a trace of the 28-kDa intermediate. Thus, caspase-13 may be more distinct from other members of the caspase-1 subfamily both on the basis of its substrate cleavage preference and the fact that the expression of its mRNA in many human tissues and cell lines is undetectable by RT-RCR. Nevertheless,CASP13 cDNA encodes an authentic protein, based on the sequence analysis of the RT-PCR product obtained from the skin fibroblast cells. The extremely restrictive and/or transient expression pattern of CASP13 mRNA and the strong potency of recombinant caspase-13 protein against some in vitrosubstrates tested suggest that caspase-13 could play an important role during embryonic development or that its expression may be specifically induced by a currently unknown stimulus.The functions of human caspases 4 and 5 are largely unknown. We found that caspases 5 (in high salt), 4, and 1 cleaved pro-caspase-3 with equivalent efficiencies. This was not the case with pro-IL-1β as substrate, because caspase-1 cleaved pro-IL-1β efficiently, caspase-4 cleaved pro-IL-1β weakly, and caspase-5 had virtually no activity on this substrate. Our results with pro-IL-1β as substrate are very similar to previous findings using a different system (21Fassy F. Krebs O. Rey H. Komara B. Gillard C. Capdevila C. Yea C. Facheu C. Blanchet A.M.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), there is no evidence that they play crucial roles in apoptosis, as do, for example, caspases 3, 8, and 9 (2Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that caspase-4 is activated during Fas-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (22Kamada S. Washida M. Hasegawa J.-I. Kusano H. Funahashi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of an inactive mutant of caspase-4 or microinjection of an anti-caspase-4 antibody delays Fas-induced apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-4 is involved (22Kamada S. Washida M. Hasegawa J.-I. Kusano H. Funahashi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of caspase-4 is most similar to murine caspase-11 (60% identity) (9Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15870-15876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). But caspase-4 is unlikely to be the human homologue of murine caspase-11, because the basal level ofCASP4 mRNA is quite high in tissues and cells, which is in contrast to the very low unstimulated levels of Casp-11in mice (9Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). More importantly, Casp-11 mRNA is LPS-inducible, but CASP4 mRNA is not.Like murine Casp-11, human CASP5 expression is very low in many normal tissues, and CASP5 expression can be induced by bacterial LPS, a property so far shared only withCasp-11. We did not detect pro-caspase-5 zymogen induction by LPS, although we observed an induction of a 35-kDa form of caspase-5, which very likely represents an intermediate or active form of caspase-5, a result of the processing of caspase-5 after induction by LPS. Because very similar size bands were detected in 293T cells overexpressing caspase-5, this would suggest that increased expression of caspase-5 results in its processing. Also, despite the fact that the apparent cleavage preferences of caspases 5 and 11 toward selected substrates are similar, the activity of caspase-5 relies on a high salt concentration, unlike caspase-11. Finally, caspase-5 contains a unique region (amino acids 1–44) in its prodomain that is present neither in caspase-11 nor in any other caspase-1 subfamily members (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P.

Caspase-13 is processed by caspase-8, and overexpressed caspase-13 induces apoptosis, suggesting a potential role of caspase-13 in a caspase-8-mediated signaling pathway (15Humke E.W. Ni J.

Recombinant caspase-13 completely processed pro-caspase-3 (Fig. 7) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, 2X. Y. Lin, M. S. K. Choi, and A. G. Porter, unpublished observations. whereas other caspases within this family gave only partial cleavage (Fig. 7 and data not shown). In addition, caspase-13 completely cleaved Pro-IL-1β into the 28-kDa intermediate product, whereas caspase-1 cleaved pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β, with hardly a trace of the 28-kDa intermediate. Thus, caspase-13 may be more distinct from other members of the caspase-1 subfamily both on the basis of its substrate cleavage preference and the fact that the expression of its mRNA in many human tissues and cell lines is undetectable by RT-RCR. Nevertheless,CASP13 cDNA encodes an authentic protein, based on the sequence analysis of the RT-PCR product obtained from the skin fibroblast cells. The extremely restrictive and/or transient expression pattern of CASP13 mRNA and the strong potency of recombinant caspase-13 protein against some in vitrosubstrates tested suggest that caspase-13 could play an important role during embryonic development or that its expression may be specifically induced by a currently unknown stimulus. The functions of human caspases 4 and 5 are largely unknown. We found that caspases 5 (in high salt), 4, and 1 cleaved pro-caspase-3 with equivalent efficiencies. This was not the case with pro-IL-1β as substrate, because caspase-1 cleaved pro-IL-1β efficiently, caspase-4 cleaved pro-IL-1β weakly, and caspase-5 had virtually no activity on this substrate. Our results with pro-IL-1β as substrate are very similar to previous findings using a different system (21Fassy F. Krebs O. Rey H. Komara B. Gillard C. Capdevila C. Yea C. Facheu C. Blanchet A.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that caspase-4 is activated during Fas-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (22Kamada S. Washida M. Hasegawa J.-I. Kusano H. Funahashi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of an inactive mutant of caspase-4 or microinjection of an anti-caspase-4 antibody delays Fas-induced apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-4 is involved (22Kamada S. Washida M. Hasegawa J.-I. Kusano H. Funahashi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of caspase-4 is most similar to murine caspase-11 (60% identity) (9Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ali A. Casano F.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15870-15876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). But caspase-4 is unlikely to be the human homologue of murine caspase-11, because the basal level ofCASP4 mRNA is quite high in tissues and cells, which is in contrast to the very low unstimulated levels of Casp-11in mice (9Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). More importantly, Casp-11 mRNA is LPS-inducible, but CASP4 mRNA is not. Like murine Casp-11, human CASP5 expression is very low in many normal tissues, and CASP5 expression can be induced by bacterial LPS, a property so far shared only withCasp-11. We did not detect pro-caspase-5 zymogen induction by LPS, although we observed an induction of a 35-kDa form of caspase-5, which very likely represents an intermediate or active form of caspase-5, a result of the processing of caspase-5 after induction by LPS. Because very similar size bands were detected in 293T cells overexpressing caspase-5, this would suggest that increased expression of caspase-5 results in its processing. Also, despite the fact that the apparent cleavage preferences of caspases 5 and 11 toward selected substrates are similar, the activity of caspase-5 relies on a high salt concentration, unlike caspase-11. Finally, caspase-5 contains a unique region (amino acids 1–44) in its prodomain that is present neither in caspase-11 nor in any other caspase-1 subfamily members (11Munday N.A. Vaillancourt J.P.

Interestingly, frameshift mutations were detected around this unique region in CASP5 in tumors of the endometrium, colon, and stomach (23Schwartz S. Yamamoto H. Navarro M. Maestro M. Reventós J. Perucho M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2995-3002PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our study, caspase-5 is more likely than caspase-4 to be the human homologue of mouse caspase-11, which activates pro-caspase-1 and is required for the generation of functional IL-1β. In this study, we also demonstrated thatCASP5 mRNA is strongly induced by IFN-γ, a pleiotropic cytokine that plays important roles in both antiviral defense and immune cell activation. However, caspase-5 protein is not induced by IFN-γ, suggesting that caspase-5 protein synthesis is post-transcriptionally regulated.

Three SK channel subunits have been molecularly characterized. The SK3 gene was targeted by homologous recombination for the insertion of a gene switch that permitted experimental regulation of SK3 expression while retaining normal SK3 promoter function. An absence of SK3 did not present overt phenotypic consequences. However, SK3 overexpression induced abnormal respiratory responses to hypoxia and compromised parturition. Both conditions were corrected by silencing the gene. The results implicate SK3 channels as potential therapeutic targets for disorders such as sleep apnea or sudden infant death syndrome and for regulating uterine contractions during labor."

On the other hand, overexpression of PLB was associated with significant depression of contractile parameters, which could be reversed upon phosphorylation of PLB during β-agonist stimulation (4Kadambi V.J.

These results indicate that PLB is a key regulator of cardiac function and a prominent mediator of the β-adrenergic effects in the myocardium.

Several in vivo studies have shown that Ser16phosphorylation or dephosphorylation precedes Thr17phosphorylation or dephosphorylation during exposure or removal of β-agonist stimulation, respectively (7Luo W.

Furthermore, increases in intracellular Ca2+ to levels higher than those obtained by isoproterenol stimulation, elicited by changes in the perfusate Ca2+ or agents that cause inotropic stimulation, failed to result in phosphorylation of PLB (23Lindemann J.P. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4516-4525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results led to the suggestion that Thr17 phosphorylation has as a prerequisite phosphorylation of Ser16 in vivo. However, other studies, using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies for PLB (24Mundina-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M. de Cingolani G.C. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33561-33567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Vittone L. Mundina-Weilenmann C. Said M. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9804-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), indicated that increases in the Ca2+ supply (3.85 mm) to the heart, accompanied by inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 or acidosis (pH 6.8), may facilitate phosphorylation of Thr17 and acceleration of the contraction and relaxation rates. Thus, the findings on the physiological significance of Ser16 and Thr17phosphorylation appear controversial. A major limitation in previous studies has been the use of preparations expressing wild-type PLB with both phosphorylation sites intact, which presents difficulties in discriminating the independent and/or relative contribution of each phosphorylation site to cardiac function. This limitation was recently overcome by the availability of a PLB knockout mouse, which, in combination with transgenesis, provides a unique system to delineate the physiological role of each of the phosphorylation sites, Ser16 and Thr17, in PLB. In a previous study, a PLB mutant, in which Ser16 was replaced by Ala, was expressed in the hearts of the null background, and characterization studies indicated the lack of Thr17 phosphorylation and attenuation of the β-agonist stimulatory effects in Langendorff-perfused hearts (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was suggested that phosphorylation of Ser16 may be a prerequisite for Thr17phosphorylation during β-agonist stimulation. Although that report demonstrated the importance of Ser16 phosphorylation in PLB, the contribution of this site relative to Thr17phosphorylation in the stimulatory effects of β-agonists in vivo is not known. Thus, the present study was designed to determine the role of Ser16 phosphorylation in vivo. A PLB mutant in which Thr17 was replaced by Ala was expressed in the hearts of the null background, and the following questions were addressed: 1) Can phosphorylation of Ser16in PLB occur independently of Thr17 in vivo? 2) What is the relative contribution of Ser16 phosphorylation to the maximal stimulatory effects of β-agonists? and 3) Are the stimulatory effects of Ser16 and Thr17phosphorylation additive? Our findings indicate that phosphorylation of Ser16 in PLB can occur independently of Thr17 in vivo, and this single-site phosphorylation is sufficient in mediating the maximal mechanical and Ca2+-kinetic stimulatory effects of isoproterenol in cardiac myocytes. PLB phosphorylation site-specific mutation of Thr17 to Ala (ACT→GCT) was introduced into the PLB cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology as described previously (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y.

Briefly, a 0.9-kb SalI fragment of PLB cDNA and SV40 poly(A) signal sequence was subcloned into a pBluescript SKII(−) vector (Stratagene), with T3 and T7 primer sites flanking the insert. PCR mutagenesis was performed by two consecutive PCR reactions using two sets of primers. The first PCR amplification was designed to generate a desired mutant PLB minor product using the subclone plasmid DNA as a template, along with a 3′-end T7 primer and a 5′-end mutant primer (5′-CTATCAGGAGAGCCTCCGCTATTGAAATGCC-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 32–62 of the PLB coding sequence. An aliquot of the first PCR product and the T3 and T7 primers were used for the second PCR to amplify the full-length insert containing the desired mutation in PLB cDNA. The final amplified product was excised and purified for sequence analysis and subsequently re-subcloned into theSalI site of PLB overexpression vector pIBI 31, which has been successfully used to generate wild-type PLB-overexpressing transgenic mice in our laboratory (4Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W., II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter was used to direct cardiac-specific expression of the mutant PLB in the null background. The mutant mice expressing T17A PLB in the PLB knockout mouse heart (KO+T17A) were generated in the same manner as transgenic mice expressing wild-type (KO+WT) or S16A mutant PLB (KO+S16A) in the null background (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the entire expression construct was composed of the α-MHC promoter (5.5 kb), the PLB coding region with the T17A mutation (0.65 kb), and the SV40 poly(A) signal sequence (0.25 kb). The KpnI-HindIII fragment of vector pIBI 31 containing the entire expression construct was released and purified for pronuclear microinjection. The founder mice harboring the PLB mutant transgene were identified by PCR analysis using primers corresponding to the α-MHC promoter (primer 1, 5′-CACATAGAAGCCTAGCCCACAC-3′) and the PLB-encoding sequence (primer 2, 5′-GATTCTGACGTGCTTGCTGAGG-3′) with a resultant PCR product of 150 bp. Transgenic mice with the desired mutation in the null background were identified using PCR methodology and confirmed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies. The transgene expression, driven by the cardiac-specific α-MHC promoter, was determined by Northern analysis of total RNA from the transgenic mouse hearts. A ∼0.5-kb random-primed labeled PLB cDNA was used as a probe for hybridization. Hearts from transgenic mice were homogenized in buffer (pH 7.0) containing imidazole (10 mm), sucrose (300 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), sodium metabisulfite (1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.3 mm). The cardiac homogenates were incubated with equal volume of loading buffer (20% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 130 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8), subjected to 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (27Chu G. Li L. Sato Y. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Hoit B.D. Bers D.M. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33674-33680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were then reacted with a mouse monoclonal antibody to phospholamban or SR Ca2+-ATPase (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO). After washing out the unbound antibody with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8), the blots were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000; Cappel Division of Organon Teknika). The phospholamban and SR Ca2+-ATPase protein bands were visualized using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates for the alkaline phosphatase reaction, and the signals were analyzed by laser densitometry using ImageQuant software. In vitrophosphorylation of PLB was performed using cardiac homogenates from mutant mice, as described previously (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation of the cardiac homogenates (60 μg) was carried out at 30 °C in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmNaF, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 45 units of the PKA catalytic subunit. For endogenous CaMKII phosphorylation of the cardiac homogenates, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 2 μm calmodulin, and 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor peptide 5–24 amide (Sigma) were added to the above reaction mixture. Reactions were terminated with 30 μl of SDS sample buffer after a 2-min (PKA) or 5-min (CaMKII) incubation, which was associated with optimal phosphate incorporation in PLB. Thirty μg of protein was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Isolation of mouse left ventricular myocytes was carried out as described previously (27Chu G. Li L. Sato Y. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Hoit B.D. Bers D.M. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33674-33680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Li L. Chu G. Kranias E.G. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1335-H1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse hearts were excised from anesthetized (pentobarbital sodium, 70 mg/kg, i.p.) adult mice, mounted in a Langendorff perfusion apparatus, and perfused with Ca2+-free Tyrode solution at 37 °C for 3 min. The normal Tyrode solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. Perfusion was then switched to the same solution containing 75 units/ml type 1 collagenase (Worthington), and perfusion continued until the heart became flaccid (∼10–15 min). The left ventricular tissue was excised, minced, pipette-dissociated, and filtered through a 240-μm screen. The cell suspension was then sequentially washed in 25, 100, and 200 μmCa2+-Tyrode and resuspended in 1 mmCa2+-Tyrode for further analysis. Cell shortening and Ca2+ transients were simultaneously measured from the same cardiomyocytes. To obtain intracellular Ca2+ signals, cells were incubated with the acetoxymethyl ester form of fura-2 (fura-2/AM; 2 μm) for 30 min at room temperature and resuspended in 1.0 mmCa2+-Tyrode solution. The myocyte suspension was placed in a Plexiglas chamber, which was positioned on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot 200), and perfused with normal Tyrode solution at room temperature (22 °C–23 °C). Myocyte contraction was field-stimulated by a Grass S5 stimulator (0.5 Hz, square waves), and contractions were videotaped and digitized on a computer. A video edge motion detector (Crescent Electronics) was used to measure myocyte length and cell shortening, from which the shortening fraction and maximal rates of shortening and re-lengthening (±dL/dt) were calculated. For Ca2+ signal measurements, the cells were alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm by a Delta Scan dual-beam spectrophotofluorometer (Photon Technology International). Ca2+ transients were recorded as the 340/380 nm ratio of the resulting 510 nm emissions. The baseline, amplitude, and time for 80% decay of the Ca2+ signal were analyzed using software from Photon Technology International. To detect the phosphorylation of PLB in mouse cardiomyocytes, ventricular myocytes were isolated from transgenic mice as described above. Myocytes obtained from two mouse hearts with the same genotype were combined and suspended in 1 ml of the normal Tyrode solution containing 1.0 mm Ca2+. Aliquots (100 μl) of the myocyte suspension were then incubated with a final concentration of 0.1 μm isoproterenol for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-stop solution containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 15% glycerol, and a trace of bromphenol blue, pH 7.8. An aliquot of samples containing 50 μg of myocyte protein, as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, was applied to each well. For immunodetection of site-specific phosphorylation of PLB, myocyte preparations were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with PLB polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize either PLB phosphorylated at Ser16 (1:10,000) or PLB phosphorylated at Thr17 (1:5,000) (PhosphoProtein Research). The immunoreactivity was visualized by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies in conjunction with an ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's ttest for unpaired observations and analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Mutation of ACT to GCT (Thr17 to Ala) was introduced into the coding region of the mouse PLB cDNA by site-directed PCR mutagenesis, as described previously (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Chu G. Dorn G.W., II Luo W. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mutation and transgene construct integrity were confirmed by DNA sequencing before submission for pronuclear microinjection. The α-MHC promoter was used to direct expression of the PLB mutant in the cardiac compartment of the PLB knockout mouse. Three germ lines hosting the PLB transgene were identified using PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail biopsies. Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA with32P-labeled PLB cDNA revealed that the PLB transgene migrated at ∼3 kb, whereas the endogenous PLB gene migrated at ∼7.0 kb (Fig. 1 A). The genomic DNA also served as a template to amplify the transgene, using a set of primers flanking the PLB cDNA. The resultant PCR product was sequenced, and the presence of the desired mutation of ACT to GCT in PLB was confirmed. Expression of the transgene, which migrated at 1 kb, was detected by Northern blot analysis of total RNA prepared from transgenic hearts (Fig. 1 B). This 1.0-kb transcript was not present in PLB knockout or wild-type hearts. The wild-type control hearts showed the presence of the endogenous PLB transcripts, which migrated at 2.8 and 0.7 kb (Fig. 1 B). To determine the PLB protein expression levels, cardiac homogenates from transgenic mice were prepared and subjected to quantitative immunoblotting. The protein levels of PLB were 0.7-fold in one line and 2.0-fold in the other two transgenic lines, compared with control hearts. The line expressing 0.7-fold PLB, compared with nontransgenic wild-types, was propagated for additional characterization studies. Transgenic lines expressing similar (0.7-fold) levels of wild-type or S16A mutant PLB in the hearts of the null background (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were also processed in parallel. To verify incorporation of the re-expressed PLB in the SR membrane, quantitative immunoblotting of PLB and SERCA2 was performed, using SR-enriched membranes prepared from our mouse models (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with findings obtained in cardiac homogenates, the SR protein levels of T17A mutant PLB reinserted in the null background were ∼70% of those of the non-transgenic wild types (Fig. 2 B). Similar levels of wild-type or S16A mutant PLB were also observed in SR-enriched membranes, as described previously (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). No significant alterations in SERCA2 protein levels were detected among the SR-enriched membranes prepared from PLB knockout hearts with either wild-type, S16A mutant, or T17A mutant PLB reinserted in the null background (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether Ser16 can be phosphorylated in vitro upon mutation of Thr17 to Ala in PLB, cardiac homogenates from the T17A mutant PLB mice were incubated with the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA) under optimal phosphorylation conditions and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The degree of32P incorporation in PLB was similar in cardiac homogenates with either wild-type or T17A mutant PLB reinserted in the null background (Fig. 3 A). The Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of mutant PLB was also assessed in vitro. In the presence of Ca2+ and calmodulin, phosphorylation of wild-type PLB was detected, and, as expected, no 32P incorporation in T17A mutant PLB was observed (Fig. 3 B). Because endogenous CaMKII was used in the in vitro phosphorylation assays, quantitative immunoblotting was performed to determine the levels of this enzyme in the different models. There were no significant alterations of CaMKII between wild-type, S16A mutant, T17A mutant, and knockout hearts (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, phosphorylation of the T17A mutant PLB by protein kinase A catalytic subunit was completely abolished by a PKA inhibitor peptide (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of the S16A mutant PLB was inhibited by a CaMKII inhibitor (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate: 1) the specificity of the PLB phosphorylation pathways, and 2) the independence of the two phosphorylation sites in PLB in vitro.Figure 4In vitro phosphorylation of PLB. Cardiac homogenates from mice with wild-type or mutant PLB reintroduced in the null background were phosphorylated by either the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A, PKA) or the endogenous Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (B, CaMKII). Reactions were performed in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 1 μm PKA inhibitor peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, catalogue number 12-151) or 1 μm CaMKII inhibitor (Upstate Biotechnology, catalogue number 14-361), terminated by SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Myocytes from PLB knockout hearts exhibited significantly enhanced contractile properties and markedly accelerated Ca2+ transient kinetics compared with wild types (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (5Luo W.

To assess the functional significance of Thr17 phosphorylation in PLB, myocyte mechanics and Ca2+ kinetics were examined in parallel, using transgenic hearts expressing similar levels of wild-type PLB reinserted in the null background. Furthermore, myocytes from hearts expressing similar levels of S16A mutant PLB in the null background were studied in parallel to determine the role of dual-site PLB phosphorylation. The shortening fraction, maximal rates of shortening and re-lengthening (Fig. 5), Ca2+ amplitude, and rate of Ca2+ transient decline (Fig. 6) were similar among myocytes expressing wild-type, S16A, or T17A mutant PLB in the null background. Thus, the mutant S16A or T17A form of PLB inhibited myocyte mechanics and Ca2+ transients to a similar degree as wild-type PLB under basal conditions. The findings at the myocyte level of the S16A mutant PLB were similar to previous findings in Langendorff-perfused hearts (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol.

Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 2Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of T17A mutant PLB on the myocyte responses to β-agonists, cells from these mutant hearts, along with cells from wild-type or S16A mutant PLB hearts, were stimulated at a frequency of 0.5 Hz and sequentially perfused with 1, 10, 30, and 100 nmisoproterenol. Maximal stimulation by isoproterenol (100 nm) was associated with significant increases in the shortening fraction and the rates of shortening (+dL/dt) and re-lengthening (−dL/dt) in all three groups (Fig. 5). The maximally stimulated parameters were similar between T17A and wild-type PLB myocytes, whereas these parameters were significantly lower in S16A mutant PLB cells (Fig. 5). In parallel, the increases in the Ca2+ transient peaks and the decreases in the rate of Ca2+ signal decay (T80, time to 80% decline of Ca2+ transients) upon maximal isoproterenol (100 nm) stimulation were similar in myocytes expressing wild-type or T17A mutant PLB (Fig. 6). However, isoproterenol had a small effect on the peak of the Ca2+amplitude and no effect on the decline of the Ca2+transient (T80) in S16A mutant PLB cells (Fig. 6). Isoproterenol stimulation was associated with significant phosphorylation of both Ser16 and Thr17 in myocytes expressing wild-type PLB, as detected by the phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to PLB (Fig. 7). Note that Ser16 or Thr17 phosphorylation was barely detectable in isolated wild-type cardiomyocytes under basal conditions. In myocytes expressing T17A mutant PLB, Ser16was capable of being phosphorylated upon isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 7). Consistent with mutation of Thr17 to Ala, there was no phosphorylation of Thr17 detected in these cells. Similar findings were also obtained in SR-enriched membranes isolated from isoproterenol-stimulated Langendorff-perfused hearts expressing T17A mutant PLB in the null background (data not shown). In myocytes expressing S16A mutant PLB, there was no phosphorylation of Thr17, consistent with previous observations in Langendorff-perfused hearts (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, isoproterenol stimulation (1 μm) was not associated with any detectable phosphorylation of Thr17 in S16A mutant myocytes, even in the presence of high Ca2+ (3.6 mm) and the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (1 μm) (data not shown). The availability of the PLB knockout mouse in combination with transgenesis, allowing reintroduction of wild-type or mutant PLB in the null background, offered a unique opportunity to examine the functional significance of each phosphorylation site in PLB, the interrelationship between the PKA and CaMKII pathways at the level of PLB phosphorylation, and their stimulatory effects on cardiac contractilityin vivo. Cardiac-specific expression of a PLB mutant, in which one of the phosphorylation sites (Thr17) was mutated to Ala, was achieved using the α-myosin heavy chain promoter. The contractile properties and Ca2+ kinetics of T17A mutant PLB cardiomyocytes were characterized in parallel with cardiomyocytes expressing similar levels of wild-type or S16A mutant PLB (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of maximal isoproterenol stimulation. Mutation of Thr17 to Ala did not alter the ability of the adjacent Ser16 to be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. Similarly, mutation of Ser16 to Ala did not affect phosphorylation of Thr17 by CaMKII in vitro (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that Ser16 and Thr17 can be phosphorylated independently in SR membranes, consistent with previous observations in expression systems and native SR membranes (13Kranias E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 844: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Tada M. Inui M. Yamada M. Kadoma M. Kuzuya T. Abe H. Kakiuchi S. J. Mol. Cell.

Colyer J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which phosphorylation of PLB mediates its regulatory effects has been suggested to involve enhancement of the interaction between individual SERCA2 polypeptide chains due to spatial rearrangement and protein-protein interactions, thus allowing for the removal of inhibition of SERCA2 activity by PLB (2Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 31Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Sci. 1998; 853: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mutant T17A PLB was able to reverse the hyperdynamic cardiac myocyte function to the same extent as wild-type PLB upon its reinsertion in the null background, indicating that mutation of threonine 17 to alanine did not alter the ability of PLB to interact with and inhibit SERCA2. Isoproterenol administration was associated with increases in the rates of shortening and re-lengthening as well as abbreviation of Ca2+ kinetics in T17A mutant PLB cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the maximal stimulatory effects on mechanics and Ca2+ kinetics in T17A PLB mutant cardiomyocytes were similar to those in wild types. Thus, mutation of T17A in PLB was not associated with any significant alterations in the stimulatory effects of PLB in response to isoproterenol. However, in parallel studies, mutation of serine 16 to alanine in PLB diminished the stimulatory effects of isoproterenol in cardiomyocytes, consistent with our previous observations in Langendorff-perfused hearts (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Ser16 in PLB may be sufficient to mediate the maximal cardiac responses to β-agonists, and the effects of dual-site (Ser16 and Thr17) PLB phosphorylation do not appear to be additivein vivo. It is interesting to note that cardiomyocytes expressing the S16A mutant PLB exhibited increases in the shortening fraction and the maximal rates of shortening and relaxation compared with wild types upon isoproterenol stimulation, even though the S16A PLB was not phosphorylated. Thus, the functional changes in S16A mutant myocytes were associated with mechanisms independent of PLB phosphorylation, such as phosphorylation and functional modification of cardiac TnI, the ryanodine receptor, or L-type Ca2+ channels. However, the relative contribution of these phosphoproteins in the cardiac responses to β-agonists remains to be elucidated. The effect of β-agonist stimulation on PLB phosphorylation is mainly associated with activation of the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. Stimulation of adenylase cyclase and the consequent increase of cAMP lead to phosphorylation of Ser16 in PLB via PKA. Stimulation of β-receptors also elevates intracellular Ca2+, which is expected to contribute to phosphorylation of Thr17 in PLB via CaMKII. Thus, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the two protein kinase pathways and determine the significance of single-site PLB phosphorylation in vivo. The significance of Ser16 phosphorylation in the β-agonist stimulatory effects in vivo has been proposed by several studies (7Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Calaghan S.C. White E. Colyer J.

Physiol. 1999; 276: H1625-H1633PubMed Google Scholar), and a close correlation between the degree of phosphorylation of Ser16 and contractile parameters has been observed in perfused hearts (12Talosi L. Edes I. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H791-H797PubMed Google Scholar, 24Mundina-Weilenmann C. Vittone L. Ortale M. de Cingolani G.C. Mattiazzi A. J. Biol.

Pflugers Arch. 1998; 436: 948-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, in all these studies, Thr17 was also phosphorylated, and the importance of Ser16 single-site phosphorylation was not conclusive. The significance of CaMKII phosphorylation of PLB, independent of PKA phosphorylation, has been more difficult to assess in vivo. Phosphorylation of PLB by CaMKII was suggested to increase the Vmax of SERCA2 (34Mattiazzi A. Hove-Madsen L. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H812-H820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of this kinase resulted in prolongation of the Ca2+ decline in rat cardiac myocytes (34Mattiazzi A. Hove-Madsen L. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H812-H820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Bassani R.A. Mattiazzi A. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H703-H712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CaMKII phosphorylation of PLB has also been implicated in the regulation of the cardiac force-frequency relationship by enhancing SR Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ kinetics. However, opposite results have been observed in studies using isolated rat cardiomyocytes. In an earlier study (36Hussain M. Drago G.A. Colyer J. Orchard C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H695-H706PubMed Google Scholar), no significant changes in phosphorylation levels of Ser16 and/or Thr17sites of PLB were obtained with increasing stimulation frequency, whereas Thr17 phosphorylation was recently reported to increase in a frequency-dependent manner, and the increases in Thr17 phosphorylation were correlated with enhanced rates of myocyte contraction and relaxation in rat ventricular myocytes (37Hagemann D. Kuschel M. Kuramochi T. Zhu W. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22532-22536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In perfused rat hearts, phosphorylation of Thr17occurred upon inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 in the presence of elevated extracellular Ca2+ or under acidic conditions (24Mundina-Weilenmann C.

Pflugers Arch. 1997; 434: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible involvement of Thr17phosphorylation under pathophysiological conditions. In summary, the present study further elucidates the regulatory role of dual-site PLB phosphorylation by specifically addressing: 1) the interdependence of Ser16 and Thr17phosphorylation in PLB, and 2) the contribution of each phosphorylation site to Ca2+ handling and contractile parameters in cardiac myocytes in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. Our findings indicate that Ser16 in PLB can be phosphorylated independently of Thr17 in vitro and in vivo, whereas Thr17 can only be independently phosphorylated in vitro. Phosphorylation of Ser16 is sufficient to mediate the maximal cardiac calcium kinetic and contractile responses to β-adrenergic stimulation, suggesting that the effects of dual-site (Ser16 and Thr17) phosphorylation in PLB are not additive in vivo. Based on these results, we conclude that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser16 in PLB plays a dominant role in mediating the cardiac contractile responses to β-agonists. We thank Dr. Alicia Mattiazzi for helpful discussion and critical evaluation of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2001300582,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have recently drawn significant attention as putative mitogenic mediators downstream of activated growth factor receptors and oncogenic Ras; however, the possibility that a redox-related mechanism also operates in the negative control of cell proliferation by inhibitory signals has not been investigated thus far. Here we show that the arrest of growth induced by cell confluence (“contact inhibition”) is due, at least in part, to a decrease in the steady-state levels of intracellular ROS and the consequent impairment of mitogenic redox signaling. In confluent fibroblast cultures, the decrease in the concentration of oxygen species was associated with diminished activity of the small GTPase Rac-1, a signal transducer directly involved in the ligand-dependent generation of oxygen-derived molecules, and was effectively mimicked by exposure of sparse cultures to dithiothreitol (DTT) and inhibitors of enzymes (phospholipase A2 and lipoxygenase) acting in the arachidonic acid cascade downstream of growth factor receptors and Rac-1. Sparse fibroblasts treated with nontoxic amounts of DTT underwent growth arrest, whereas a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide significantly increased thymidine incorporation in confluent cultures, demonstrating a causal link between redox changes and growth control by cell density. Removal of oxygen species from sparse cultures was accompanied by a drastic decrease of protein tyrosine phosphorylation after epidermal growth factor stimulation, which, at a biochemical level, reproduced the signaling hallmarks of contact inhibition. Moreover, the cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 was identified as a putative target for redox signaling by cell density because the enzyme itself and the associated substrates appear markedly dephosphorylated in both confluent and reductant-treated cells after exposure to epidermal growth factor, and SHP-2 enzymatic activity is strongly activated by DTT in vitro. Taken together, these data support a model in which impaired generation of ROS and increased protein tyrosine phosphatase activity impede mitogenic signaling in contact-inhibited cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have recently drawn significant attention as putative mitogenic mediators downstream of activated growth factor receptors and oncogenic Ras; however, the possibility that a redox-related mechanism also operates in the negative control of cell proliferation by inhibitory signals has not been investigated thus far. Here we show that the arrest of growth induced by cell confluence (“contact inhibition”) is due, at least in part, to a decrease in the steady-state levels of intracellular ROS and the consequent impairment of mitogenic redox signaling.

Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) and are able to elicit signal transduction events, such as protein tyrosine phosphorylation and early gene activation, reminiscent of cell stimulation by growth factors (2Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). More importantly, “traditional” proliferative signals, such as those delivered by the activation of growth factor receptors and G proteins of the Ras family, are accompanied by intracellular production of endogenous oxygen species, which are, in turn, necessary for downstream propagation of mitogenic signaling. In fact, ROS and hydrogen peroxide, in particular, have been convincingly shown to operate as key signaling molecules in the cascades triggered by platelet-derived growth factor (3Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar), EGF (4Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Glodschmidt-Clermont P.J. Science. 1997; 275: 1649-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). Observations on redox regulation of growth factor signaling have been of special interest for the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the mitogenic properties of oxidants and their potential involvement in proliferative disorders such as cancer and atherosclerosis. Most growth factors activate, through their tyrosine kinase receptors, an intracellular cascade of events involving, as central components, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor itself and of a number of other substrates, the phosphotyrosine-dependent recruitment to the cell membrane of multiple signal transducers, and, eventually, the delivery of mitogenic stimuli to the nucleus (8Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). Although there are some noteworthy exceptions, tyrosine phosphatases exert a general inhibitory effect on such a cascade by attenuating the intensity of phosphorylation signals initiated by activated receptors and accelerating their extinction (9Tonks N.T. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), as shown clearly by the emergence of deregulated cell growth in association with the genetic inactivation of some specific member of this class of enzymes (10Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 84: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphatases are especially sensitive to redox regulation and are easily inactivated by oxidation of a critical cysteine residue located in the catalytic site (11Hecht D. Zick Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); they therefore represent a potential target for both exogenous and endogenously derived oxygen species. In fact, tyrosine phosphatase protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B is rapidly and transiently inactivated by ROS after EGF receptor triggering (12Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), and some reports exist on redox regulation of phosphatase activities under physiological conditions (13Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Downey G.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5409-5417PubMed Google Scholar). In multicellular organisms, normal cell growth is strictly regulated not only by the local availability of growth factors but also by a number of positive and negative co-stimuli delivered by the extracellular matrix and the neighboring cells. A clear example of such a complex network is provided by the negative regulation of normal cell growth by cell-cell contact, a phenomenon also known as “contact inhibition.” Normal adherent cells as well as some immortalized cell lines exit the cell cycle and stop proliferating when grown to confluence, even in the presence of optimal amounts of growth factors. This contact-dependent control of cell proliferation is believed to act in vivo during tissue regeneration and wound healing and is also conceivably involved in tissue patterning during embryonic development (14Wieser R.J. Renauer D. Schafer A. Heck R. Engel R. Schutz S. Oesch F. Environ. Health Perspect. 1990; 88: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cell transformation by oncogenes results in loss of contact inhibition; transformed cells maintain the capacity to divide at a very high density and pile up in foci instead of growing in monolayer. The transforming capacity of molecules such as the tyrosine kinase Src and the G protein Ras, as well as studies comparing growth factor signaling at different cell densities, has been helpful in starting to elucidate the molecular basis of growth control by cell-cell contact. For instance, confluent cells have been shown to have decreased levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation associated with an increase in protein tyrosine phosphatase activity (15Pallen C.J. Tong P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6996-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cell treatment with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors relieves contact inhibition and allows cell growth at a high saturation density (16Klarlund J.K. Cell. 1985; 41: 707-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Confluent cells are also refractory to the mitogenic effects of growth factors such as EGF and platelet-derived growth factor, and such hyporesponsiveness correlates with accelerated dephosphorylation of the corresponding tyrosine kinase receptors (17Sorby M. Ostman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10963-10966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, molecules associated with cell-cell adherent junction, such as cadherins, cathenins, and the growth factor receptor substrate p120, are also poorly phosphorylated in confluent endothelial cell cultures but are strongly phosphorylated by v-Src (18Brady-Kalnay S.M. Rimm D.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The idea that tyrosine phosphatases are directly involved in contact inhibition is therefore largely accepted, in view of the crucial role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in transducing signals delivered by growth factor receptor and by adhesion molecules; however, the modality of regulation of these enzymes by cell density remains unclear. In view of the reported sensitivity of tyrosine phosphorylation cascades and tyrosine phosphatases to oxidants and reductants (19Monteiro H.P. Stern A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and of the emerging importance of oxygen radicals as physiological regulators of cell proliferation (20Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), we asked whether a redox mechanism could be involved in the growth-inhibitory signals delivered by cell-cell contact. Experiments here provide evidence that growth inhibition by cell density operates, at least in part, through a redox regulation of growth factor signaling and, by extension, that the concentration of intracellular ROS might integrate positive and negative signals regulating cell proliferation. Swiss 3T3 murine fibroblasts and MRC-5 human embryonic fibroblasts were obtained from the Istituto Zoo-profilattico di Brescia (Brescia, Italy). Human adult fibroblasts immortalized by SV40 (Gm701) were a gift of Dr. Michael Jacobson (University College, London, United Kingdom). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). MRC-5 cells were used between passages 28 and 35. The Escherichia coli strain expressing the glutathioneS-transferase-PAK-CRIB domain fusion protein was a kind gift of Dr. J. Collard (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The fusion protein was purified from bacterial lysate, induced with β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Advanced Biotechnology), with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Antibodies used in the present studies are: anti-Rac-1 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-SHP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagents (anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Bio-Rad, respectively). Standard reagents for protein electrophoresis and Western blotting were from Bio-Rad and Sigma; dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO), diphenileneiodonium, 4-bromophenacyl-bromide, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), DTT, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma 104), sodium orthovanadate, hydrogen peroxide, and human EGF were purchased from Sigma. Reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence, protein G-Sepharose 4B, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCF-DA) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Methyl-[3H]thymidine was from Amersham Radiochemicals, and autoradiography films were from Kodak. For the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, fibroblasts were seeded in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Corning) in 200 μl of complete DMEM, with or without stimulants/inhibitors, at the following densities: (a) MRC-5 cells, 3 × 104 cells/well (Dense), 104 cells/well (subconfluent), and 3 × 103 cells/well (sparse); and (b) Gm701 cells, 105 cells/well (dense), 3 × 104 cells/well (subconfluent), and 104cells/well (sparse). The well area was approximately 0.3 cm2. After 40 h of incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator, [3H]thymidine was added at 1 μCi/well for an additional 8 h. Cells were then trypsinized, resuspended in 100 μl of PBS/well, and harvested with a semiautomatic cell harvester. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured using an automated β liquid scintillation counter. Counts are expressed as the cpm/1000 cells seeded. For the growth curve of Swiss 3T3 cells with or without DTT, cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate, and duplicate cultures were counted with a hemocytometer every 2 days. Culture medium was changed regularly (every 3 days), and fresh DTT was added when necessary. In some experiments, medium containing DTT was replaced after 8 days with standard medium after two washes with PBS. 3T3 and Gm701 cells were plated in 24-well plates (Corning) at a density of 6 × 105 (dense) or 105 (sparse) cells/well (corresponding to 3 × 105 and 5 × 104 cells/cm2, respectively) in standard culture medium. MRC-5 were seeded at 1.25 × 105(dense) or 2 × 104 (sparse) cells/well in DMEM. 16 h later, medium was replaced, and antioxidants or enzyme inhibitors were added for 1 h, followed by a 1-h incubation with 5 μg/ml DCF-DA, an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye. Cell were then detached from the substrate by trypsinization and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using a COULTER-EPICS flow cytometer equipped with an Argon laser lamp (FL-1; emission, 480 nm; band pass filter, 530 nm). For analysis of ROS generation in response to EGF, Gm701 cells (sparse and dense) were incubated overnight in 1% fetal calf serum, washed with HBSS, and treated with 100 ng/ml human EGF in HBSS for 5, 20, or 60 min at 37 °C. DCF-DA (dissolved in ethanol) was then added at a concentration of 20 μg/ml for 5 min. After fluorescence labeling, cells were quickly trypsinized and immediately subjected to flow cytometry. Equal numbers (usually 106) of cells plated at high or low density were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF (5 min), pervanadate (5 min), or 100 μm vanadate (1 h) in HBSS or left untreated. Pervanadate was prepared by mixing 100 mm hydrogen peroxide with 30 mm sodium orthovanadate. After 5 min on ice, pervanadate was added to cells at a 1:100 dilution. To terminate stimulation, adherent fibroblasts were washed once with PBS and lysed in 1% Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100; 150 mm NaCl; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 2 mmEDTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) with the help of a rubber scraper. After a 30-min lysis on ice, cell debris was spun down (14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min), and the supernatant was kept for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or immunoprecipitation studies. GTP-bound (active) Rac-1 was precipitated by protein lysates from sparse and dense cultures with a GST fusion protein containing the CRIB domain of the Rac-activated kinase PAK as described by Sander et al. (21Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 Gm701 or 2.5 × 105 MRC-5 cells were lysed as described above 16 h after seeding at high or low density. Precleared lysates were incubated with 5–10 μg of PAK-CRIB-GST fusion protein absorbed on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C with constant agitation, pellets were washed in lysis buffer, and PAK-bound proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoreactive Rac-1 precipitated by PAK-GST was then quantified by anti-Rac Western blot analysis. Total cell lysates were also immunoblotted with anti-Rac to determine the expression level of Rac-1 in sparse and dense cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation on total cell lysates was assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot with the mouse monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were detected on a nitrocellulose membrane by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antiserum, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. Immediately after protein electro-transfer to nitrocellulose, equal protein loading was verified, and molecular weight marker (Life Biotechnology) protein bands were visualized by reversible Ponceau S staining. To assess the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and SHP-2-associated proteins, the enzyme was immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified rabbit anti-SHP2 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound to protein G-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were boiled, and proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to an anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot. The same membrane was subsequently stripped and immunoblotted with the anti-SHP-2 antiserum to verify that equal amounts of immunoreactive enzyme were present in all samples. Phosphatase activity of anti-SHP2 immunoprecipitates was determined as described previously (22Pani G. Kozlowsky M. Cambier J.C. Mills G.B. Siminovitch K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunocomplexes were washed twice in phosphatase buffer (62 mm Hepes, pH 7, 6.25 mm EDTA) and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mmof the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate, with or without 3 mm DTT. Incubation was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped with 4 volumes of NaOH (200 mm). Substrate dephosphorylation (yellow product) was quantified spectrophotometrically (absorbance at 410 nm). Sham immunoprecipitations with preimmune rabbit IgG were performed as negative controls. Adherent cells grown in monolayers undergo cell growth arrest on reaching confluence. This is especially true for normal fibroblasts, which are used, in view of this property, for routine focus formation assays. Average DNA synthesis, as evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation, was drastically reduced in human embryonic fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) as a function of increasing cell density (Fig. 1 A, left panel). This was also the case for Swiss 3T3 murine immortalized fibroblasts (data not shown) and for human adult fibroblasts immortalized by SV40 (Gm701 cells; Fig. 1 A, right panel). Although the latter cell line was still remarkably sensitive to density-dependent growth inhibition, infection by SV40 allowed proliferation at a higher saturation density in comparison to normal human fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A; data not shown). In all cell lines examined, steady-state levels of intracellular ROS were significantly lower in confluent cells than in sparse cultures, as assessed by cytofluorometric analysis after exposure to the ROS-sensitive fluorescent probe DCF-DA (Fig. 1 B). Special co-cultures in which sparse and dense cells shared the same medium were used in some experiments to rule out the possible effect of pH andpO2 on the observed difference (data not shown). Interestingly, the fluorescence shift between confluent and sparse cultures was slightly less pronounced in Gm701 cells, which grow at a higher density than normal cells. A transient increase in the intracellular concentration of hydrogen peroxide has been reported as an important signaling event upon human cells stimulation with epidermal growth factor (4Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). Such an oxidative burst reversibly inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (12Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) and likely inhibits other tyrosine phosphatases, thereby promoting the propagation of tyrosine phosphorylation signals. In agreement with these previous observations, EGF raises the intracellular ROS concentration in Gm701 sparse cells (Fig. 1 C); this effect is markedly attenuated in the same cells plated at high density and follows a different kinetic, with a rapid decline after 20 min of stimulation, suggesting that redox signaling by EGF is impaired by cell confluence. It should be noticed that the culture density did not affect the expression of the EGF receptor (data not shown). The small GTPase Rac-1 mediates shape changes after cell stimulation by growth factors (23Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar) and is required for cell cycle progression (24Moore K.A. Sethi R. Doanes A.M. Johnson T.M. Pracyk J.B. Kirby M. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and for cell transformation by oncogenic Ras (25Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). This transducer has recently been involved in the ligand (26Sundaresan, M., Yu, Z. X., Ferrans, V. J., Sulciner, D. J., Gutkind, J. S., Irani, K., Goldsmith-Clermont, P. J., and Finkel, T. (1996) Biochem. J. 379–382.Google Scholar)- and adhesion (27Kheradmand F. Werner E. Tremble P. Symons M. Werb Z. Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar)-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species and therefore represents a key component of the redox signaling machinery activated by mitogenic stimuli. Active (i.e. GTP-bound) Rac-1 binds to and activates a number of downstream effectors, including the serine threonine kinase PAK (28Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We have used an assay developed by Sander et al.(21Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and based on co-precipitation of active Rac with a PAK-GST fusion protein to evaluate the level of activity of Rac-1 in cells plated at different densities. In MRC-5 and Gm701 cells, Rac-1 activity was found to be significantly higher in sparse cultures than in confluent cultures, whereas no change or minimal changes were observed in the expression level of the protein, as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A). It thus appears that, even in the presence of optimal amounts of serum-derived growth factors, the activity of Rac-1 is negatively regulated by cell density and, most likely, by cell-cell contact. Rac-1 can regulate at least two different sources of oxygen radicals: (a) one is represented by phagocytic NADPH oxidase or similar enzyme complexes expressed by nonphagocytic cells (29Bokoch G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and (b) the other is the conversion to prostaglandins and leukotrienes of arachidonic acid, whose release is stimulated by growth factors in a Rac-dependent fashion (30Peppelembosh M.P. Qiu R.-G. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Because both rac-1 activity and intracellular ROS generation are depressed in confluent cells, it is conceivable that a Rac-dependent radical source is involved in redox changes induced by cell density. Pretreatment of sparse Gm701 cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenileneiodonium had no effect on the steady-state concentration of intracellular ROS in sparse cells, ruling out the possibility that a NADPH oxidase-like complex is the target for ROS regulation by cell density (Fig. 2 B, b). Conversely, both the phospholipase A2 inhibitor 4-bromophenacyl-bromide and the lipoxygenase inhibitor NDGA, which act at different points of the cascade leading to leukotriene biosynthesis, nearly reduced the intracellular concentration of ROS to the level observed in dense cells (2B, c and d), indicating that the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid could be involved in negative redox signaling by cell-cell contact. To establish a causal link between redox changes induced by cell confluence and contact inhibition of cell growth, the intracellular ROS concentration of sparse 3T3 cells was artificially lowered with the cell-permeant reducing agent DTT to mimic dense cells. The same concentration of DTT (2 mm) that reduced intracellular ROS of sparse cells to the level observed in dense cultures (Fig. 3 A) had a profound inhibitory effect on 3T3 cell growth (Fig. 3 B). This effect was not due to a loss of cell viability (data not shown), and proliferative capacity was partially recovered after the removal of DTT (3B), which is consistent with a reversible block in cell progression through the cell cycle.Figure 2Impaired Rac-1 signaling and ROS generation by arachidonate metabolism in confluent fibroblasts. A, the activity of Rac-1, an upstream regulator of leukotriene biosynthesis in response to growth factors, was measured in sparse and dense cells using the pull-down assay developed by Sander et al. (21Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The amount of GTP-bound Rac-1 is significantly reduced in cells plated at high density (upper panels), whereas no change or minimal changes are observed in the amount of total Rac-1 (lower panels). Results are representative of at least two independent experiments. B, inhibitors of the leukotriene biosynthesis pathway, but not the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenileneiodonium, decrease the concentration of intracellular ROS in sparsely growing fibroblasts. 4-Bromophenacyl-bromide (phospholipase A2 inhibitor; 20 μm), NDGA (5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; 5 μm), diphenileneiodonium (flavin oxidase inhibitor; 10 μm), and Me2SO (vehicle control; 1:500) were added 1 h before fluorescence labeling with DCF-DA.Numbers beside the histograms indicate mean cell fluorescence.

BRCA1 is a 1863-amino acid protein with roles in transcriptional regulation and the cellular responses to DNA damage. Given its function in these nuclear processes, the subcellular localization of BRCA1 is an important issue and has been the object of recent controversy. BRCA1 contains two nuclear localization signals and is most frequently detected in the cell nucleus by immunofluorescence microscopy. In this study, we show that BRCA1 is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, capable of both entering and exiting the nucleus. We identified a functional Rev-type nuclear export sequence (81QLVEELLKIICAFQLDTGL) near the amino terminus of BRCA1 that facilitates export via the CRM1/exportin pathway. Mutational inactivation of this nuclear export sequence, or treatment of cells with the CRM1-specific export inhibitor leptomycin B, induced nuclear accumulation of ectopic full-length BRCA1. Moreover, overexpression of the CRM1 export receptor resulted in decreased nuclear localization of endogenous BRCA1.

The unexpected ability of BRCA1 to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm may have implications for the regulation and function of this tumor suppressor. nuclear localization signal(s) nuclear export sequence(s) leptomycin B yellow fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein, PCR, polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline human immunodeficiency virus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Approximately 50% of inherited breast cancers and up to 90% of the familial cases of breast and ovarian cancer are linked to germ-line mutations of the tumor suppressor gene Brca1, the first susceptibility gene linked to these malignancies (1Miki Y.

Although the biological basis for its tumor suppressive function is not yet clearly understood, mounting evidence suggests that Brca1 is a type of “caretaker” gene, whose inactivation renders cells prone to the accumulation of genetic abnormalities (reviewed in Ref. 3Deng C.-X. Scott F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The increased mutation rate because of loss of BRCA1 may in turn induce alterations in other cancer-related genes and thereby lead to tumor formation. The human Brca1 gene encodes a 1863-amino acid protein involved in a variety of cellular processes. These include transcriptional activation (4Chapman M.S. Verma I.M.

BRCA1 contains a carboxyl-terminal tandem of BRCT BRCA1carboxyl-terminus repeats (7Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat.

Apart from the BRCT motifs, BRCA1 homology to other known proteins is limited to an amino-terminal RING finger domain (9Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsou Tsan J. Spillmann M.A. Phung A. Xu X.-L. Yang M.-C.W.

Given the role of BRCA1 in critical nuclear processes, its localization within the cell is an important issue. In this regard, a series of conflicting reports on BRCA1 mislocalization in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells gave rise previously to some controversy regarding the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of BRCA1 (13Scully R.

Several cancer-associated proteins, such as the tumor suppressor p53 and the oncoproteins c-ABL and hdm2, were recently shown to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (19Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 20Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. McElroy A.K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Prompted by these findings, and by the controversy regarding BRCA1 localization, we sought to determine whether BRCA1 is also capable of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. In this study, we show that BRCA1 is able to exit the nucleus via the CRM1-dependent pathway. We also show that the NH2-terminal peptide81QLVEELLKIICAFQLDTGL99constitutes an active Rev-type nuclear export sequence (NES) that mediates CRM1-dependent export of BRCA1. Human breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF-7, the human breast epithelial cell line HBL-100, and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips and transfected at 50–70% confluency with 0.5–2 μg of plasmid DNA by using the FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy. When required, LMB was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 6 ng/ml for the indicated period of time. pF-BRCA1, encoding untagged BRCA1, was created by subcloning the full-length BRCA1 cDNA (provided by Dr. J. Holt, Nashville) into the pFlag-CMV2 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.) as a NotI/ClaI fragment. To generate pYFP-BRCA1, a DNA fragment encoding the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the pEYFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) and inserted in frame at the 5′ end of the BRCA1 cDNA in pF-BRCA1, using the uniqueNotI restriction site. The plasmid pRev-GFP, encoding the HIV Rev protein fused to GFP, was described previously (22Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The YFP-BRCA1 deletion mutant Δ1–70 was created by replacing a 0.5-kbNotI/AatII DNA fragment from the BRCA1 cDNA with a 330-bp PCR fragment generated with the primers BH9926 and BH9832 (see Table I for details of all PCR cloning primers) to re-initiate translation at the downstream site. The mutant Δ1–170 was created by deleting the same 0.5-kb NotI/AatII fragment from BRCA1 and inserting a 29-bp bridging sequence made by annealing the complementary synthetic oligonucleotides BH9924 and BH9925. To make YFP-BRCA1Δ1–297, a 0.9-kb NotI/EcoRI DNA fragment from BRCA1 was replaced with a 30-bp bridging sequence made by annealing the synthetic oligonucleotides BH9879 and BH9880. The NLS-defective YFP-BRCA1Δ306–1312 deletion mutant was made by replacing a 3-kb EcoRI/BamHI DNA fragment with a 21-bp bridging sequence created with the synthetic oligonucleotides JR3 and JR4. The NES-defective BRCA1 mutant BRCA1NESm1 was created by using a two-step PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis procedure. Wild-type BRCA1 cDNA was used as template, and the oligonucleotides BH986, BH9832, BH9848, and BH9849 were used as primers in the PCR reactions. The codons in bold in the oligo BH9848 (TableI) encode the alanine residues replacing BRCA1 NES amino acids Leu86 and Ile90. The correct sequence of the mutant constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To create the plasmid pYFP-CRM1, encoding the YFP-tagged CRM1 export receptor, CRM1 cDNA was excised from the pET16bHC1 plasmid (provided by Dr. M. Yoshida, Tokyo) and inserted into the pEYFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) as aXhoI/BamHI fragment.Table ISequence of the oligonucleotides used in plasmid constructionOligonucleotideSequence 5′–3′BH9926TGATCAATTGCGGCCGCAAAAAGGAGCCTACAAGAAAGBH9832ACCGGTATCTTCAGABH9924GGCCGCACGGATACAACCTCAAAAGACGTBH9925CTTTTGAGGTTGTATCCGTGCBH9879GGCCGCAATGAATGTAGAAAAGGCTBH9880AATCAGCCTTTTCTACATTCATCGTJR3AATTCTGTAATACCCAGJR4GATCCTGGGTATTACAGBH986TCTGCAGCGGCCGCCTCGAGAATGGATTTATCTGCTCTTBH9848AGGAGCCTAGACGTCAGTACGCGTTTTAGTCAACTTGTTGAAGAGGCATTGAAAATCGCTTGTGCTTTTCAGCTTGACBH9849TTGACTAAAACGCGTACTTTCTTGTAGBH977CGGGCCCGGGATCCABH994GTGGCGACCGGTGGCTTCTGATTTAATAACTTTAACATGCAGAACTTGCAGAAGATATGATCGCACTTTGGATCCCGGGCCCGBH9720GTGGCGACCGGTGGTAAGCCGGTATCTAACTGGAAAGCGCAGATGATCTTTAATAACTCCTCGACTAACTGTGGATCCCGGGCCCGBH995GTGGCGACCGGTGGGATATTTAACTCTAACTCCATATTTGAGATTGATGATGAGATAGGCTCAGCCTTTGGATCCCGGGCCCGBH9927TGTATCCGGGATCCAATGGATTTATCTGCTCTTBH9929TACTAAGACCGGTCTTTTGGTTATATCAATCTTACBH9930TGTATCCGGGATCCAAAGAATGATATAACCAAAAGGBH9931TACTAAGACCGGTATCCGCTGCTTTGTCCTCAGAGBH9825CGGGCCCGGGATCCACAGTTAGTCGAGGAGGCATTAAAGATCGCCTGCGCTTTCBH9826ATCTGCGCTGCCCAGGCAGATACCGGCTTACCACCGGTCGCCACBH9828CGGGCCCGGGATCCACAGGCAGTCGAGGAGBH9829GATACCGGCGCACCACCGGTCGCCAC Open table in a new tab The in vivoexport assay used in this study has been recently described in detail (22Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the ability of functional export sequences to restore the nuclear export activity of the chimeric protein Rev(1.4)-GFP, a fusion of an NES-deficient mutant HIV Rev protein and GFP. DNA fragments encoding the different amino acid sequences to be tested for export activity were cloned into theBamHI/AgeI-digested pRev(1.4)-GFP plasmid as follows: double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding each of the three NES-like motifs of BRCA1 were generated by annealing the common primer BH977 to specific single-strand synthetic oligonucleotides encoding each sequence, followed by extension with Klenow DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and digestion with BamHI andAgeI. The oligonucleotides used were BH994 for the first NES-like motif, BH9920 for the second, and BH995 for the third (the codons encoding the conserved hydrophobic amino acids are inbold, and the BamHI and AgeI sites areunderlined in Table I). DNA fragments encoding BRCA1 amino acids 1–70 and 65–170 were generated by PCR using BRCA1 cDNA as template, primers BH9927 and BH9929 for the 1–70 fragment, and BH9930 and BH9931 for the 65–170 fragment (the BamHI andAgeI restriction sites are underlined in TableI). The DNA fragments encoding mutant BRCA1 NES, harboring point mutations at specific hydrophobic residues as shown in Fig. 5, were also created by PCR, using the wild-type BRCA1 NES sequence as template. The mutagenic primers used were BH9825 for the mutant m1, BH9826 for m2, and BH9828 and BH9829 for m3 (the codons encoding the mutant residues are in bold, and the BamHI andAgeI restriction sites are underlined in TableI). The PCR products were digested with BamHI andAgeI and inserted into the pRev(1.4)-GFP plasmid. The sequence of all the constructs was verified by DNA sequencing prior to testing in the export assay. The assay was carried out in T47D cells as described (22Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate samples of cells were transfected with pRev(1.4)-GFP (negative control) and its derivative plasmids containing the Rev NES (positive control) or each of the candidate export sequences. At 48 h post-transfection, half of the cell samples were treated for 3 h with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, which prevents nucleolar association and nuclear import of Rev by a mechanism yet to be defined. This treatment allows the detection of those weaker NESs that are normally unable to over-ride the Rev NLS-mediated nuclear import and thus would go undetected in the presence of an active Rev import pathway. At the same time, all cell samples were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide to ensure that cytoplasmic GFP fusion proteins arise from nuclear export and not from new protein synthesis. Samples were then processed for fluorescence microscopy analysis, and the subcellular localization of the GFP fusion proteins was determined in at least 200 cells per sample. A scoring system based on the proportion of cells showing nuclear, nuclear/cytoplasmic, or cytoplasmic GFP was used to rate the activity of the functional NESs as detailed elsewhere (22Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Cells expressing YFP- or GFP-tagged proteins were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed, and mounted for direct detection of the autofluorescent proteins. Untagged ectopic BRCA1 was detected by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies Ab1 (Oncogene Research) or D9 (Santa Cruz), which recognize an amino- or carboxyl-terminal epitope of BRCA1, respectively. The immunostaining procedure was carried out at room temperature. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton in PBS for 10 min, and washed with PBS again. Following a blocking step with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 45 min, the primary antibody was diluted 1:100 in blocking solution and applied for 50 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) for 45 min. Finally, the coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and mounted onto microscope slides with Vectashield (Vector). Endogenous BRCA1 was detected with monoclonal antibodies Ab-1 and Ab-4 (Oncogene Research) diluted 1:100. p53 and c-Myc were detected with antibodies DO1 (Oncogene Research) diluted 1:300 and C19 (Santa Cruz) diluted 1:150 in blocking solution. The immunostaining procedure was as described for ectopic BRCA1 except that the incubation with the primary antibody was carried out overnight at 4 °C, and the detection of the bound antibody was accomplished with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) and Texas Red-avidin D (Vector). The chromosome stains 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and Hoechst 33285 (Sigma) were used to counterstain the cell nuclei. Slides were examined under UV light on an Olympus epifluorescence microscope, and the subcellular localization of the ectopic or endogenous proteins was determined. To ensure unbiased results, the slides were coded prior to examination. The best characterized pathway for the nuclear export of proteins involves the nuclear export receptor CRM1 (23Fornerod M.

Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). CRM1 binds directly to specific NESs to translocate proteins through the nuclear pores to the cytoplasm (28Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). This process is specifically inhibited by the antifungal compound LMB, which prevents the CRM1-NES interaction (29Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Thus, LMB treatment results in the nuclear accumulation of those shuttling proteins that exit the nucleus via the CRM1-dependent export pathway. To test whether BRCA1 exits the nucleus by a CRM1-dependent mechanism, we first determined the effect of LMB on the subcellular distribution of ectopically expressed full-length BRCA1. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding BRCA1, either untagged or as a fusion with YFP. As a positive control, cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the HIV Rev protein tagged with GFP (Rev-GFP), whose ability to shuttle has been previously characterized (22Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 30Stauber R. Gaitanaris G. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ectopic BRCA1 was detected by fluorescence microscopy in the nucleus (excluded from the nucleolus) of most transfected cells (Fig. 1 A), but variable degrees of cytoplasmic BRCA1 were also observed, including exclusive cytoplasmic accumulation in a minority of cells. A detailed quantitation of the cells expressing ectopic BRCA1 (Fig. 1 B) showed that treatment with LMB significantly increased the proportion of cells with nuclear BRCA1 (either untagged or YFP-tagged) and decreased the proportion of cells with cytoplasmic BRCA1. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the relocation of BRCA1 to the nucleus induced by LMB was already evident at the shortest incubation period tested (4 h) and reached its maximum at 8 h. The kinetics of this LMB response is comparable with that observed for other nuclear shuttling proteins, such as c-ABL (20Taagepera S. McDonald D. Loeb J.E. Whitaker L.L. McElroy A.K. Wang J.Y. Hope T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and indicate that LMB has a direct effect on BRCA1 localization. In line with previous observations (11Wilson C.A. Payton M.N. Elliott G.S. Buaas F.W. Cajulis E.E. Grosshans D. Ramos L. Reese D.M. Slamon D.J. Calzone F.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Thakur S. Zhang H.B. Peng Y. Le H. Carroll B. Ward T. Yao J. Farid L.M. Couch F.J. Wilson B. Weber B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), a BRCA1 deletion mutant lacking the NLSs (YFP-BRCA1Δ306–1312) was exclusively cytoplasmic in MCF-7 cells, and, in contrast to the full-length protein, its localization was not affected by LMB (data not shown). The fact that full-length BRCA1 accumulates in the cell nucleus upon treatment with the export inhibitor LMB suggests that BRCA1 is able to exit the nucleus via the CRM1-mediated pathway in MCF-7 cells. We next compared the LMB response of Rev-GFP and YFP-BRCA1 in different cell lines (Table II). As expected, LMB treatment had a dramatic effect on the subcellular distribution of Rev-GFP. In comparison, the effect of the export inhibitor was less pronounced on YFP-BRCA1 localization, which may reflect a lower shuttling (import or export) rate for BRCA1. Importantly, the cellular distribution of YFP alone did not change with LMB treatment (not shown). It is interesting to note that the LMB effect on GFP-Rev was similar in every cell line tested but that the degree of LMB-induced nuclear accumulation of BRCA1 varied among different cell lines, suggesting that the shuttling activity of BRCA1 may be regulated in a cell line-specific fashion.Table IIComparison of the effect of LMB treatment on the localization of Rev-GFP and YFP-BRCA1 in different cell linesCell lineLMB effect 2-aThe degree of nuclear accumulation of Rev-GFP or YFP-BRCA1 after 16 h of LMB treatment (LMB effect) is expressed as a value calculated according to the following formula: LMB effect = (N+LMB −N−LMB + C−LMB −C+LMB), where N and Crepresent the percentage of nuclear or cytoplasmic cellular localization, respectively, in the presence or absence of LMB.

The maximal LMB effect value is 200. Open table in a new tab It is conceivable that the high levels of BRCA1 achieved in transient transfection experiments might influence its subcellular distribution. Therefore, we designed a complementary strategy in which we tested whether overexpressing the CRM1 export receptor could alter the localization of endogenous BRCA1. This approach was previously used to assess the role of CRM1 in nuclear export of the shuttling transcription factor NF-AT4 (31Zhu J. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). T47D breast cancer cells were transfected with plasmids encoding YFP or YFP-CRM1, and cells were immunostained with antibodies against BRCA1, p53, or c-Myc (see Fig. 2). In line with previous observations (32Kudo N. Khochbin S. Nishi K. Kitano K. Yanagida M. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29742-29751Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), YFP-tagged CRM1 stained both the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected cells, with frequent concentration at the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2). YFP alone was diffusely distributed throughout the cell. The anti-BRCA1 monoclonal antibodies Ab-1 (MS110) and Ab-4 (SD118) recognize different BRCA1 epitopes and were recently found to be highly suited for immunocytochemical detection of cellular BRCA1 (15Wilson C.A. Ramos L. Villaseñor M.R. Anders K.H. Press M.F. Clarke K. Karlan B. Chen J.-J. Scully R. Livingston D. Zuch R.H. Kanter M.H. Cohen S. Calzone F.J. Slamon D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A characteristic BRCA1 staining pattern with “nuclear dots” was observed in untransfected T47D cells with Ab-1 (Fig. 2) and Ab-4 (not shown). This pattern did not change following the transient expression of YFP (see Fig. 2 and TableIII). In striking contrast, however, cells transfected with YFP-CRM1 showed a consistent decrease in BRCA1 nuclear staining and a corresponding increase in cytoplasmic signal (see Fig. 2 and Table III), highly consistent with nuclear export.Table IIISubcellular distribution of endogenous BRCA1, p53, and c-Myc in T47D breast cancer cells expressing YFP or YFP-CRM1EndogenousEctopicn 3-bTotal number of transfected cells scored for the subcellular localization of each endogenous protein.

Open table in a new tab As a positive control, we analyzed the effect of CRM1 overexpression on the localization of p53, a tumor suppressor protein known to undergo CRM1-mediated nuclear export (19Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Endogenous p53 was detected exclusively within the nucleus in more than 85% of cells expressing YFP alone, whereas most YFP-CRM1-expressing cells displayed a partial shift of p53 to the cytoplasm (see Fig. 2, graphs and TableIII). c-Myc provided a negative control as it did not respond to LMB treatment in these cells (data not shown). Indeed, unlike p53 and BRCA1, c-Myc was not affected by CRM1 overexpression and exhibited an even nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution in ∼80% of cells expressing either YFP or YFP-CRM1 (Fig. 2). These findings demonstrate that BRCA1 subcellular localization is regulated by the CRM1 nuclear export receptor. The above results showed that when CRM1 activity is inhibited by LMB or increased by overexpression the BRCA1 subcellular distribution shifted in a manner consistent with nuclear export. This prompted us to search for potential BRCA1 NESs such as that first identified in HIV Rev (33Fisher U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R.

Antiestrogen-mediated G0/G1 arrest is associated with decreased cyclin D1 gene expression, inactivation of cyclin D1-cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 complexes, and decreased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). We now show that treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182780 results in inhibition of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity prior to a decrease in the G1 to S phase transition. This decrease was dependent on p21WAF1/Cip1 since treatment with antisense oligonucleotides to p21 attenuated the effect. Recruitment of p21 to cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes was in turn dependent on decreased cyclin D1 expression since it was apparent following treatment with antisense cyclin D1 oligonucleotides. To define where within the G0to S phase continuum antiestrogen-treated cells arrested, we assessed the relative abundance and phosphorylation state of pocket protein-E2F complexes. While both pRb and p107 levels were significantly decreased, p130 was increased 4-fold and was accompanied by the formation of p130·E2F4 complexes and the accumulation of hyperphophorylated E2F4, putative markers of cellular quiescence. Thus, ICI 182780 inhibits both cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, resulting in the arrest of MCF-7 cells in a state with characteristics of quiescence (G0), as opposed to G1 arrest.

Tamoxifen, the current endocrine therapy of choice in early and advanced breast cancer, leads to highly significant decreases in the rates of both disease recurrence and death (1Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative GroupLancet. 1998; 351: 1451-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 2Stein R.C. Coombes R.C. Howell A. Peckham M. Pinedo H. Veronesi U. Oxford Textbook of Oncology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 629-648Google Scholar), but tamoxifen therapy is limited by the inevitable development of cellular resistance (3Osborne C.K. Coronado E.B. Hilsenbeck S.G.

Since synthetic non-steroidal antiestrogens like tamoxifen possess both estrogen agonist and antagonist activity (5MacGregor J.I. Jordan V.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 151-196PubMed Google Scholar) more selective steroidal estrogen antagonists have been developed (6Wakeling A.E. Dukes M. Bowler J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3867-3873PubMed Google Scholar). One such compound, the pure steroidal antiestrogen ICI 182780, is currently being used in trials in the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancers (7Howell A. DeFriend D. Robertson J. Blamey R. Walton P. Lancet. 1995; 345: 29-30Abstract PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8DeFriend D.J. Howell A. Nicholson R.I. Anderson E. Dowsett M. Mansel R.E. Blamey R.W. Bundred N.J. Robertson J.F. Saunders C. Baum M. Walton P. Sutcliffe F. Wakeling A.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 408-414PubMed Google Scholar). Both tamoxifen and ICI 182780 bind to the estrogen receptor (ER),1 a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors (9Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 10Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). Like other members of this superfamily, the ER activates transcription via two transactivation function domains, located in the N-terminal (AF-1) and C-terminal ligand-binding region (AF-2). Steroidal and nonsteroidal antiestrogens induce different conformational changes in the ER resulting in the recruitment of distinct subsets of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors (11McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). It is the differential association of these co-activators and co-repressors that is thought to contribute to the inhibition of only AF-2 by tamoxifen and inhibition of both AF-1 and AF-2 by ICI 182780 (13Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giquere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Presumably as a consequence of the inhibition of ER-mediated gene transcription, antiestrogen treatment of proliferating ER-positive breast cancer cells arrests cell cycle progression with accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (14Sutherland R.L. Hall R.E. Taylor I.W. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3998-4006PubMed Google Scholar, 15Taylor I.W. Hodson P.J. Green M.D. Sutherland R.L. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4007-4010PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wakeling A.E.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2398-2404PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular proliferation is mediated by the action of a family of serine/threonine kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which in conjunction with their regulatory partners, cyclins, phosphorylate pRb and other members of the pocket protein family, p107 and p130 (18Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 19Jacks T. Weinberg R.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1035-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of pRb during G1phase is mediated via two temporally distinct stages, in which initial phosphorylation by cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 is followed by cyclin E-Cdk2 phosphorylation to complete inactivation of pRb (20Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 21Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). A major level of cyclin-CDK regulation is from two families of specific inhibitors. The INK4 inhibitors, p16INK4a , p15INK4b , p18INK4c , and p19INK4d , have as primary targets Cdk4 and Cdk6 (22Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Members of the second family, which includes p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 , have a dual function: inhibition of CDKs including cyclin E-Cdk2 as well as facilitation of the assembly of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes (22Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). The association of the pocket proteins with members of the E2F family of transcription regulators is responsible for a major part of their growth inhibitory actions. Phosphorylation and hence, inactivation, of the pocket proteins results in dissociation of E2F, allowing subsequent transcription of genes required for progression through late G1 and S phase (23Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 24Mayol X. Graña X. Meijer L. Guidet S. Philippe M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. Plenum Press, New York1997: 157-169Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). While the availability of “free” E2F is an important determinant of transcriptional activity, it is also apparent that pocket protein-E2F complexes can actively repress transcription of target genes, in addition to simply blocking the action of E2F (23Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 24Mayol X. Graña X. Meijer L. Guidet S. Philippe M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. Plenum Press, New York1997: 157-169Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). Specific complexes between different E2F family members and pocket proteins are characteristic of particular stages of the cell cycle. During G1 phase, pRb preferentially complexes with E2Fs 1–3, although pRb-E2F4 complexes are present in some cells. p107 is not abundant or active until late G1, where it negatively regulates E2F4 and E2F5 at the G1 to S phase boundary (23Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 24Mayol X. Graña X. Meijer L. Guidet S. Philippe M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. Plenum Press, New York1997: 157-169Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). p130 is the predominant pocket protein in quiescent (G0) and differentiated cells and interacts with E2F4 in these cells (23Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 24Mayol X. Graña X. Meijer L. Guidet S. Philippe M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. Plenum Press, New York1997: 157-169Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). The abundance of these complexes is regulated not only by the phosphorylation of the pocket proteins, but also by the levels of both component proteins. p107 and p130 are often reciprocally regulated, contributing to the shift of E2F4 from p130 to p107 during exit from quiescence (26Graña X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). E2Fs 1–3 are induced during passage through G1 and thus are available to bind pRb and p107 (26Graña X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our previous work on the mechanisms of antiestrogen-induced cell cycle arrest in hormone-responsive breast cancer cells focused on the role of cyclin D1-Cdk4 and showed a 40% decrease in cyclin D1 protein levels within 6 h following treatment of MCF-7 cells with the steroidal antiestrogen ICI 182780 (27Watts C.K.W. Brady A. Sarcevic B. deFazio A. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1804-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The rapid loss of cyclin D1 protein occurred as a result of transcriptional repression, by an as yet unidentified mechanism. A loss in enzymatic activity of cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes resulted, which preceded the decline in the proportion of actively cycling cells. The ultimate result was the accumulation of hypophosphorylated (functionally active) pRb prior to cells exiting the cell cycle (27Watts C.K.W. Brady A. Sarcevic B. deFazio A. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1804-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, a number of other inhibitory agents such as transforming growth factor-β (28Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), interferon-α (29Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Einhorn S. Grander D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and progestins (30Musgrove E.A. Swarbrick A. Lee C.S. Cornish A.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1812-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) act on both cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes. Also, cyclin E-Cdk2 has recently been shown to replace cyclin D1-Cdk4 in murine mammary gland development (31Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H. Li T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), suggesting that both cyclin-CDK complexes play a role in normal cellular proliferation in mammary epithelium. The molecular mechanisms underpinning antiestrogen-induced cell cycle arrest are not fully elucidated nor has the physiological state in which the cells arrest been addressed. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of antiestrogen action in breast cancer is essential to defining differences in potency and efficacy between various antiestrogens, identifying more efficacious compounds and providing deeper insight into the mechanisms of antiestrogen resistance. This article addresses two primary questions that arise from the current level of knowledge on antiestrogen action on cell cycle progression, the first being the effects of a pure estrogen antagonist, ICI 182780, on the activity and function of cyclin E-Cdk2. The second objective was to identify changes in pocket protein abundance and E2F complex formation that accompany antiestrogen-mediated growth arrest in order to provide further insight into the particular growth arrest state induced by pure estrogen antagonists. Stock solutions of 7α- [9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluropentylsulfinyl)nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol (ICI 182780) were prepared as follows: ICI 182780 (a kind gift from Dr Alan Wakeling, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Alderley Park, Cheshire, United Kingdom) was dissolved in ethanol to 10−2mand a working dilution of 10−5m in RPMI 1640 medium was prepared from this stock immediately prior to each experiment. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit, MI) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, insulin (10 μg/ml), and gentamycin (10 μg/ml). For experiments investigating the effects of ICI 182780 150-cm2 flasks were seeded with 1 × 106cells. Cells were allowed to proliferate for 2 days until they reached approximately 50% confluence, after which ICI 182780 or vehicle was added directly to the medium. The final concentration of ethanol in the tissue culture medium was less than 0.06% and had no effect on the rate of cell proliferation. At the completion of experiments cells were harvested by brief incubation with trypsin (0.05% w/v)/EDTA (0.02% w/v) as described previously (14Sutherland R.L. Hall R.E. Taylor I.W. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3998-4006PubMed Google Scholar) or as described below. Cell cycle phase distribution was determined by analytical DNA flow cytometry as described previously (32Prall O.W.J. Rogan E.M. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed as follows: MCF-7 cell monolayers were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline then scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmpyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The lysates were incubated for 5 min on ice and the cellular debris cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Equal amounts of total protein (20–40 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE then transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Australia) after incubation (2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C) with the following primary antibodies: cyclin E (C-19), p130 (C-20), p107 (C-18), E2F4 (C-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; cyclin D1 (DCS-6) from Novacastra Laboratories Ltd., Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK; p21 (catalog numberC24420), Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; p27 (catalog numberK25020) Transduction Laboratories; or pRb (G3–245) from PharMingen, San Diego, CA. Protein abundance was quantitated by analysis of autoradiographs using densitometry (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Quantitation of protein levels by this method was linear over the range of protein concentrations and exposure times employed in these studies. For assessment of cyclin E-associated kinase activity, MCF-7 cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline then scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. The lysate was placed on ice and vortexed vigorously at intervals for 60 min then centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant stored at −80 °C. Cyclin E complexes were immunoprecipitated from equivalent amounts of protein with rabbit polyclonal anti-human cyclin E antiserum conjugated to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C (catalog number 14936E, PharMingen). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl, again with ice-cold lysis buffer and then twice with ice-cold 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reactions were initiated by resuspending the beads in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing 10 μg of histone H1 as a substrate. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C the reactions were terminated by the addition of 15 μl of 3 × SDS sample buffer (187 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 6% SDS, 15% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). The samples were then incubated at 95 °C for 2 min, separated using 10% SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel exposed to x-ray film. Relative band intensities were quantitated by densitometric analysis as described above. Immunoprecipitation of p21, p27, and p130 was performed using the method described above (for immunoprecipitating cyclin E for kinase activity assays), except that the antibodies were chemically cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose to reduce background (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., C-19), human p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., C-19) and human p130 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., C-20). The immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in 1 × SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the proteins detected using the antibodies described for Western blotting above. Confirmation of binding specificity was performed using corresponding immunogenic peptides. p21 and p27 depletion experiments followed the same protocol as in the immunoprecipitation method, except three rounds of immunoprecipitation were completed and the remaining supernatant was retained for analysis. Following three rounds of depletion, 30 μg of supernatant protein was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for cyclin E or cyclin D1 as described above. The depleted lysate was assayed for p21 and p27 to ensure that greater than 90% was removed. A 20-mer p21 antisense oligonucleotide (TCCCCAGCCGGTTCTGACAT) (34Barboule N. Chadebech P. Baldin V. Vidal S. Valette A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was synthesized (Geneworks, Australia) with phosphorothioate residues at the 5′ and 3′ terminal nucleotides to minimize exonucleolytic cleavage (35Stein C.A. Subasinghe C. Shinokusa K. Cohen J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3209-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). As controls, complementary (sense) and scrambled (ACGCGTTCACTGCCTACGTC) oligonucleotides were manufactured. MCF-7 cells were harvested, gently syringed 4 times to minimize clumps, and 5 × 105cells were grown in 50-cm2 dishes overnight. ICI 182780 was added to a final concentration of 10 nm to the antiestrogen-treated control dishes for 2–3 h. Eight μl of Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligonucleotide (800 nm) were incubated in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 for 15 min and subsequently added to the monolayer with 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The dishes were placed in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 90 min with intermittent mixing. The oligonucleotide/Cellfectin solution was then decanted and the monolayer washed once with RPMI 1640 (5% fetal calf serum). Ten ml of RPMI 1640 (5% fetal calf serum) was then added to each dish along with ICI 182780 at a final concentration of 10 nm to the antiestrogen-arrested control dishes. Cells were harvested for lysate and flow cytometry as described above. A 20-mer cyclin D1 antisense oligonucleotide was designed to complement nucleotides −11 to +9 of the translation initiation codon region of the human cyclin D1 mRNA (GCTGGTGTTCCATGGCTGGG) (36Ko T.C., Yu, W. Sakai T. Sheng H. Shao J. Beauchamp R.D. Thompson E.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3445-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Geneworks, Australia). Phosphorothioates were incorporated at both the 5′ and 3′ terminal nucleotides. As controls, sense and scrambled (CGGTCGGATTCGGCGTGTTG) oligonucleotides were included in all experiments. MCF-7 cells were set up as above, except 4 μl of Cellfectin was added to each dish and the final concentration of oligonucleotide was 400 nm.

The presence of 10% untreated fetal bovine serum, containing endogenous steroids and growth factors, plus supplementation with 10 μg/ml insulin typifies a complex, mitogen-rich growth environment and ensures maximal exponential growth rates which enhance sensitivity to growth inhibitory agents. Our previous work on the mechanisms of antiestrogen inhibition of cell cycle progression has shown that the pure antiestrogen ICI 182780 induces growth arrest in the presence of this complex medium (27Watts C.K.W. Brady A. Sarcevic B. deFazio A. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1804-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and that subsequent addition of estradiol can reverse these growth inhibitory effects (37Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B.

Thus the model reproduces the hormonal responses typical of hormone-responsive breast cancer. Previously published data specifically identified a rapid decrease in cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels as early events in the action of ICI 182780 (27Watts C.K.W. Brady A. Sarcevic B. deFazio A.

Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3577-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A consequent decrease in cyclin D1-Cdk4 enzymatic activity preceded the decline in the proportion of S phase cells and was concluded to contribute to the inhibition of MCF-7 proliferation (27Watts C.K.W. Brady A. Sarcevic B. deFazio A. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1804-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The potential role of cyclin E-Cdk2 was not specifically addressed. However, total Cdk2 activity, comprising both cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes, decreased but not until a majority of cells had arrested in G0/G1 (27Watts C.K.W. Brady A. Sarcevic B. deFazio A. Musgrove E.A. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1804-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, to specifically assess the effects of ICI 182780 on cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, we extracted lysates from MCF-7 cells that had been treated with the drug or vehicle for various times, immunoprecipitated cyclin E and assayed in vitro kinase activity, using histone H1 as a substrate. As seen in Fig. 1, cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity decreased by 8 h and declined to a minimum of approximately 25% of control levels by 24 h. The decline in cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase activity preceded the reduction in the proportion of S phase cells and therefore, in conjunction with inhibition of cyclin D1-Cdk4, likely contributed to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The level of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes following antiestrogen treatment of MCF-7 cells was next investigated in order to assess whether the levels of these complexes contribute to the loss of total enzymatic activity. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated an increase in the total number of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes following antiestrogen treatment presumably as a result of the previously documented accumulation of cyclin E following antiestrogen treatment (37Prall O.W.J.

In an attempt to account for the rapid reduction in cyclin E-associated kinase activity while cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes increased, immunoblot analyses of the two predominant CDK inhibitors in this cell line, p21 and p27, were performed. As seen in Fig. 2 A, p21 protein levels increased at 16 h and reached maximal 4-fold levels at 48 h. p27 protein levels increased by 12 h and were about 2-fold above control at 48 h. Thus, although the total cellular levels of both inhibitors increased following ICI 182780 treatment, increases occurred several hours after the decline in the enzymatic activity of cyclin E-Cdk2 (Figs. 1 and 2), indicating that these changes in inhibitor abundance were not causative of cyclin E-Cdk2 inhibition.Figure 2Cyclin E-Cdk2-associated p21 increases prior to a change in enzymatic activity and an increase in total p21 protein levels. The experimental design is as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, protein levels of p21 and p27 in MCF-7 cell lysates following treatment with ICI 182780 (10 nm). Total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to p21 and p27. Protein levels were determined using densitometry as described under “Materials and Methods” and plotted (B) p27 or p21 immunoprecipitates from the same lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for cyclin E. The levels of cyclin E in the immunoprecipitation were determined by densitometry as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess whether there was an increase in cyclin E-Cdk2-associated p21 or p27 prior to the decline in kinase activity, we performed a series of immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation of p21 and p27 followed by immunoblotting for cyclin E demonstrated a substantial increase in the amount of cyclin E-Cdk2-associated p21 and p27 (Fig. 2 B). A reproducible increase in p21-associated cyclin E of 30% was detectable at 6 h and reached 4-fold by 48 h (Fig. 2 B). An increase of 5-fold was seen by 48 h for p27, with the initial changes first observable at 12 h (Fig. 2 B). It therefore appeared that p21-associated cyclin E-Cdk2 increased prior to a decline in kinase activity while p27-associated cyclin E-Cdk2 only increased after cyclin E-Cdk2 activity began to decrease (Figs. 1 B and 2 B). Further analysis of the interaction between p21, p27, and cyclin E-Cdk2 was conducted using"

To gain insight into the mechanism of degradation, we examined how RNA interference is affected by mutations in the smg genes, which are required for nonsense-mediated decay. For three of six smg genes tested, mutations resulted in animals that were initially silenced by dsRNA but then recovered; wild-type animals remained silenced. The levels of target messenger RNAs were restored during recovery, and RNA editing and degradation of the dsRNA were identical to those of the wild type. We suggest that persistence of RNA interference relies on a subset of smg genes."

It is shown here that caspase-8 is activated early in cells undergoing p53-mediated apoptosis and in S100 cell-free extracts that recapitulate transcription-independent apoptosis. Depletion or inactivation of caspase-8 either in cells or cell-free extracts completely prevents this transcription-independent apoptosis and significantly attenuates overall death induced by wild-type p53. Importantly, caspase-8 activation appears to be independent of FADD, and caspase-8 is found in a novel 600-kDa complex following p53 activation. These findings highlight the roles of both transcription-dependent and -independent apoptosis by p53 and identify an essential role for caspase-8 in the transcription-independent pathway."

An original feature of these receptors is that their ligand-binding site is located within their large extracellular N-terminal domain structurally independent from the transmembrane heptahelix core region (8Okamoto T.

It is currently not known how the agonist binding within this extracellular domain leads to the conformational changes of the heptahelical core region required for G-protein activation (11Pin J.-P. De Colle C. Bessis A.-S. Acher F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Answering this question will give insights into the specific functional properties of these family 3 receptors. As a first step, it is important to get information on the structural features of their ligand binding domain. It has previously been proposed that the ligand binding domain of family 3 heptahelix receptors displays a three-dimensional structure similar to that of bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBP) such as the leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP) (12Costantino G.

These PBPs are part of a family of structurally related proteins that also includes AmiC, a cytoplasmic amide-binding protein involved in the control of the amidase operon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16Pearl L. O'Hara B. Drew R. Wilson S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins consist of two distinct globular lobes interconnected by three linkers (16Pearl L. O'Hara B. Drew R. Wilson S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19Quiocho F.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 341-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous structural studies have revealed that these PBPs adopt at least two stabilized conformations as follows: an “open,” usually unbound form, and a “closed” form stabilized by the bound ligand (19Quiocho F.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 341-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the closed conformation, the ligand is trapped between the two lobes. Accordingly it has been proposed that agonist binding at family 3 receptors stabilizes an active (closed) conformation of their binding domain that in turn activates the heptahelix core region (11Pin J.-P. De Colle C. Bessis A.-S. Acher F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In agreement with the above described hypothesis, the ligand binding domains of mGlu1 (8Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), mGlu4 (9Han G. Hampson D.R. J. Biol.

Moreover, molecular modeling and mutagenesis studies have further confirmed the similarity between the ligand-binding sites of PBPs such as LIVBP and that of family 3 receptors (13O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

Up to now, only residues within one lobe (lobe I) have been identified as being important for agonist binding on family 3 receptors (mGlu1, mGlu4 and Ca2+-sensing receptors) (13O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thøgersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R.

Therefore the importance of the second lobe (lobe II) for ligand binding and receptor activation remains to be elucidated. Another feature of family 3 heptahelix receptors is that they are found mostly as dimers (21Bai M. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Within this receptor family, the GABAB receptor constitutes an excellent model for the study of the activation mechanism of these receptors. Indeed, this receptor is a heterodimer constituted of two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, both necessary for a fully functional receptor (23Jones K.A. Borowsky B. Tamm J.A. Craig D.A. Durkin M.M. Dai M.

In a previous study, we provided evidence supporting a similar three-dimensional structure for LIVBP and the binding domain of GABAB1 subunit, the only subunit able to bind the high affinity GABAB receptor radioligands (24Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B.

In the present study, we have identified residues in the lobe I of the GABAB1 subunit critical for agonist binding and activation of the heteromeric receptor. Moreover, we show that the mutation of a residue in lobe II of the GABAB1 subunit converts the specific heteromeric GABAB receptor agonist baclofen into an antagonist. In addition to demonstrating the requirement of GABA binding on GABAB1 subunit for the activation of the GABABheteromeric receptor, our data are consistent with the idea that a closed form of the binding domain of family 3 receptors is required for their activation. GABA was obtained from Sigma (L'Isle d'Abeau, France). 125I-CGP64213 was synthesized as described elsewhere (29Kaupmann, K., Bettler, B., Bettiger, H., Froestl, W., and Mickel, S. J.

For each mutagenesis, two complementary 30-mer oligonucleotides (sense and antisense; Genaxis Biotechnologie, Nimes, France) were designed to contain the desired mutation in their center. To allow a rapid screening of the mutated clones, the primers carried an additional silent mutation introducing (or removing) a restriction site. The presence of each mutation of interest and the absence of undesired ones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subsequently, a short fragment surrounding the mutation was subcloned in place of the corresponding wild-type fragment of pRKBR1a (15Galvez T. Parmentier M.-L. Joly C. Malitschek B. Kaupmann K.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.

For ligand competition assays, thawed membranes (10 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-CGP64213 in the presence of unlabeled ligands at the indicated concentration. The incubation was terminated by filtration through GF/C Whatman glass fiber filters (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK). The concentration of 125I-CGP64213 used in displacement experiments (0.1 nm) is approximately 10 times lower than the affinity of this radioligand on the native or GABABR1 receptor, such that the IC50 values measured for all unlabeled compounds are not significantly different from their affinity. Nonspecific binding was determined with 10 mmGABA. Displacement curves were fitted with the Kaleidagraph software (Abelbeck Software) using the equation y = ((ymax − ymin)/(1 + (x/IC50)n H)) +ymin where IC50 is the concentration of cold drug necessary to displace half of the specifically bound125I-CGP64213, and nH is the Hill number. HEK 293 cells were transfected as described above with either wild-type or mutated GABAB1a receptor expressing plasmids (pRKBR1a, 2 μg), GABAB2 receptor (pCI-Neo-BR2, 2 μg) (25Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P. Mosbacher J. Bischoff S. Kulik A. Shigemoto R. Karschin A. Bettler B. Nature. 1998; 396: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), Gqi9 (2 μg) (32Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and carrier DNA (4 μg). Determination of IP accumulation in transfected cells was performed 15 h after transfection and after overnight metabolic labeling of transfected cells with [3H]myoinositol (23.4 Ci/mol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After three washes with Krebs buffer (NaCl 146 mm, KCl 4.2 mm, MgCl2 0.5 mm, glucose 0.1%, Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.4), the stimulation was conducted for 30 min in Krebs buffer containing 10 mm LiCl and the indicated concentration of agonist. The stimulation was stopped by replacement of the incubation medium with perchloric acid (5%) on ice, and the IPs were purified on Dowex AG 1-X8 (Bio-Rad) columns. Results are expressed as the amount of IP produced over the radioactivity present in the membranes. Concentration-response curves were fitted as described for the binding assay using the equation y = ((ymax − ymin)/(1 + (x/EC50)n H))+ymin where EC50 is the agonist concentration necessary to produce half of the maximal response. Cell surface proteins of transfected HEK 293 cells were labeled with the membrane impermeant reagent Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce). Briefly, adherent cells were washed 3 times on ice with borate buffer (10 mm H3BO3, pH 8.8, 140 mm NaCl) and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin in borate buffer for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by washing followed by incubation in borate buffer with 100 mmNH4Cl for 10 min on ice. The cells were scraped in lysis buffer (Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.4, NaCl 100 mm, EDTA 5 mm), and the membranes were pelleted and solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-0, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. The lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The soluble fraction was incubated with streptavidin-coated agarose beads, overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were analyzed using Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using the polyclonal anti-GABAB1 receptor antibody (33Malitschek B. Ruegg D. Heid J. Kaupmann K. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Kuhn R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 12: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and an ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Analysis of wild-type or mutant receptor expression was conducted according to the same protocol. To generate the open form model of the GABAB1 receptor extracellular domain, we modified the multiple alignment proposed in previous work (15Galvez T. Parmentier M.-L. Joly C. Malitschek B. Kaupmann K. Kuhn R. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13362-13369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) in order to take into account the secondary structure prediction of the GABAB1 receptor extracellular domain, as determined using the PHD program, and the sequence of the recently cloned GABAB2 receptor. Compared with our previous alignment, this resulted in a change from residue 467 to 486 containing helix αIX of LBP/LIVBP (18Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The alignment of AmiC with LIVBP and LBP was deduced from the structural superposition of each lobe of the closed form of AmiC on the corresponding lobe of the open form of LIVBP (16Pearl L. O'Hara B. Drew R. Wilson S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5810-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The open form model of the GABAB1 receptor extracellular domain was generated by the automated homology modeling tool MODELER 5.00 (InsightII version 980, MSI) (34Sali A. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) as described previously (15Galvez T. Parmentier M.-L. Joly C. Malitschek B. Kaupmann K. Kuhn R. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13362-13369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The closed form model was constructed using the coordinates of the two lobes of LBP (Protein Data Bank code 2lbp: lobe I, Glu1–Arg116 and Pro256–Asp330; lobe II, Ser122–Thr247) and LIVBP (Protein Data Bank code 2liv: lobe I, Glu1–Arg116 and Pro256–Asp323; lobe II, Ser122–Thr247) crystalline open forms, the coordinates of the two lobes of the open form model of GABAB1 receptor extracellular domain (lobe I, Ser164–Arg284 and Met277–Ser368; lobe II, Thr127–Thr261), and the coordinates of the LIVBP closed form model (generous gift from Drs. F. Quiocho and P. O'Hara) as a template for the linkers of the hinge region. Similarly, AmiC crystalline closed form (Protein Data Bank code 1pea) was used as a template. The resulting closed form model of GABAB1 receptor was comparable to that obtained with the closed form model of LIVBP. Only the latter has been used for the modeling experiments shown in this paper. The three-dimensional/one-dimensional compatibility scores for these models (35Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar), as determined using the Profiles three-dimensional algorithm using a sequence window of 21 amino acids (InsightII version 980, MSI), is always positive and similar to that previously published (15Galvez T. Parmentier M.-L. Joly C. Malitschek B. Kaupmann K. Kuhn R. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Pin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13362-13369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The global score is in the range of those determined for the refined three-dimensional structures of LIVBP, LBP, or AmiC determined from x-ray (data not shown). Most residues of our models were in allowed regions of the Ramachandran's map. For “docking” experiments, baclofen was designed with a deprotonated carboxylic group and a protonated amino group. Initially, baclofen (R-enantiomer) was manually docked in the closed form model of GABAB1 receptor, the carboxylate moiety closed to the side chain of Ser246 and its γ-amino group facing the side chain of Asp471. In this position, the chlorophenyl group is pointing toward lobe II and is in the proximity of Tyr366. In order to suppress the steric hindrances and geometric inconsistencies, the ligand-protein complex was submitted to molecular mechanics calculations using the Discover 3.00 calculation engine with the CFF force field (Insight II version 980, MSI). The non-bond cut-off method and the dielectric constant were respectively set up as cell multipole and distance-dependent (ε =r). Initially, energy minimization were performed using a Steepest Descent algorithm (until the maximum derivative was less than 2 kcal/mol/Å) followed by a conjugated gradient algorithm (until the maximum derivative was less than 0.01 kcal/mol/Å), whereas the Cα trace was tethered with a quadratic potential. Then molecular dynamics was applied to the minimized system at constant volume and temperature (298 K). The integration time step was set up to 1 fs. During the dynamics, the force constant value of the quadratic potential was reduced from 100 to 60, 30, 20, 10, and 0 every 40 ps. A snapshot of the system was saved every 400 fs. Once the system was equilibrated, the coordinates of 20 snapshots were averaged and resubmitted to the previously described minimization protocol with no Cα restraints. Contacts between the ligand and the protein were subsequently analyzed using the web interface of the WHATIF program. Several splice variants have been identified for the GABAB1 receptor which all possess an identical ligand binding domain but differ in their extreme N-terminal sequence (24Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar) or in their heptahelix regions (36Isomoto S. Kaibara M. Sakurai-Yamashita Y. Nagayama Y. Uezono Y. Yano K. Taniyama K. Biochem.

Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2874-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All our studies have been performed with the rat GABAB1a receptor (the first Met being residue number 1). A three-dimensional model of the GABAB1 binding domain has been constructed based on the structure of the open forms of LBP and LIVBP (Fig. 1 a). According to this three-dimensional model and the known structural elements involved in leucine binding in LIVBP, and in amide binding in AmiC (see Fig. 1), the GABA-binding site would be formed by the following: (a) the loop between strand βC and helix αIII (loop βC-αIII according to the nomenclature of the secondary structural elements of LIVBP proposed by Sack et al. (18Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), residues 243–250), (b) the N-terminal portion of the loop βD–βE (residues 266–272), and (c) the N termini of helices αI (residues 184–192) and αIX (residues 463–473) (Fig. 1). We therefore undertook a systematic analysis, by site-directed mutagenesis, of all residues that can interact with ligands within these regions (see Fig. 1 b). Each mutant was analyzed for its ability to bind125I-CGP64213 and to be activated by the agonists GABA and baclofen (Fig. 2).Figure 2Structure of the GABAB ligands used in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously reported that several mutations of the GABAB1 subunit either increase or decrease the potency of GABA and baclofen in displacing 125I-CGP64213 bound to the GABAB1 subunit expressed alone (see TableI). The effect of these mutations, as well as additional ones generated during this study, on the potency of GABA and baclofen at the heteromeric GABAB receptor was analyzed after co-expression of the different GABAB1 mutants with the wild-type GABAB2 subunit in HEK 293 cells. The activation of the GABAB heteromeric receptor was analyzed by measuring the stimulation of phospholipase C via the chimeric G-protein Gqi9 (32Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 38Franek M. Pagano A. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Pin J.-P. Blahos J., II Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The potencies (EC50 values) of both GABA and baclofen were measured on the different heteromers and compared with the binding affinity (IC50 values which, under our experimental conditions, are similar to Ki) of both GABA and baclofen as determined by displacement of bound 125I-CGP64213 (see Table I) on GABAB1 mutants expressed alone. A good correlation was found between GABA (Fig. 3) and baclofen (data not shown) binding affinity values (IC50) on most GABAB1 mutants, and the EC50 values were measured with our functional assay on the mutant heteromeric receptors. These data show that agonist binding at the GABAB1 receptor is critical for the activation of the heteromeric GABAB receptor and validates the use of such a functional assay to further analyze the molecular determinants of agonist binding at the GABAB1 receptor for which no 125I-CGP64213 binding could be measured.Table IEffect of various mutations in GABAB1 receptor on the affinity of both GABA and baclofen as determined by displacement of125 I-CGP64213 binding (IC50 in μm) and receptor activation (EC50 in μm)Mutation, WTGABABaclofenCGP binding IC50 (μm)IP assay EC50 (μm)CGP binding IC50 (μm)IP assay EC50(μm)22.3 ± 1.92.9 ± 0.630 ± 25.0 ± 1.3Lobe-I Loops βC-αIII and βD-βES246ANB 1-aValues are from Ref. 15.>1000NB>1000S246PNBNENBNES246TNB>1000NBS246NNBNENBNES247A5.32 ± 0.88 1-aValues are from Ref. 15.0.37 ± 0.09 1-bValues are from"

Immunophilins bind to and mediate the effects of immunosuppressant drugs (1Armistead D.M. Harding M.W. Annu. Rep. Med.

The immunophilin homolog hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 (XAP2)1 also ARA9 or AIP, does not appear to bind immunosuppressant drugs (4Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E.

It does, however, share significant homology with immunophilins, particularly FKBP12 and FKBP52 (5Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

XAP2 is a core component of the inactive, cytosolic, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) complex, together with the AhR (ligand-binding subunit), and a dimer of hsp90 (5Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J.

The AhR is a ligand-activated member of the bHLH-PAS (basic helix-loop-helix Per-Arnt-Sim) transcription factor family (8Gu Y-Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In response to ligand binding, the AhR translocates to the nucleus. Two views exist as to the path taken at this stage. (i) The AhR complex may dissociate in the cytoplasm with free AhR translocating to the nucleus and heterodimerizing with ARNT (AhR nuclear translocator), or (ii) ligand binding may initiate nuclear translocation of the intact complex where hsp90 and XAP2 dissociate prior to, or in concert with, dimerization with ARNT. The AhR/ARNT heterodimer binds to dioxin responsive elements (DRE) in the enhancer regions of genes such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase and mediates transcriptional up-regulation (9Denison M.S. Phelan D. Elferink C.J. Denison M.S. Helferich W.G. Toxicant-Receptor Interactions. Taylor and Francis, Philadelphia, PA1998: 3-33Google Scholar, 10Dogra S.C. Whitelaw M.L. May B.K. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1998; 25: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In cells, XAP2 appears to be largely bound to hsp90 and thus may act as a chaperone complex for a variety of proteins. XAP2 overexpression in cells has been shown to enhance cytoplasmic AhR levels, suggesting that the amount of XAP2 available to interact with the AhR may limit AhR steady-state levels (11Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

In this report, the role of XAP2 levels in modulating the subcellular localization of the AhR was examined. The presence of a sufficient pool of XAP2 in the cell is necessary to maintain the AhR in the cytoplasm, which appears to require the presence of XAP2 in the AhR core complex. TCDD treatment does not affect AhR·XAP2 core complex ratios under conditions that result in near complete nuclear translocation, strongly suggesting that XAP2 does not dissociate from the AhR in the cytoplasm following ligand binding. Examination of endogenous AhR core complex ratios, sedimentation profile, and subcellular localization in Hepa-1 cells strongly supports the hypotheses that XAP2 mediates cytoplasmic localization of the AhR and that the liganded complex undergoes nuclear translocation prior to dissociation and heterodimerization with ARNT. pcDNA3-βmAhR was used for expression of the AhR (13Fukanaga B.N. Hankinson O. J. Biol.

The NLS mutants (K13A) of the mAhR and AhR·YFP were generated using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with HPLC purified primers (Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, CA). Cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C in 94% air, 6% CO2. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG monoclonal Ab M2 affinity gel (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

Primary antibodies were detected with either peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM-P) or donkey anti-rabbit polyclonal Abs (DAR-P) (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) and visualized using the Vector VIP substrate kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). COS-1 cells grown in 6-well culture dishes were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Manassas, VA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection included 200 ng of DRE-driven luciferase reporter construct pGudLuc 6.1, 100 ng of AhR construct (or control), and control vector (pcDNA3), for a total of 2 μg of DNA per well. The day following transfection, cells were treated with 10 nmTCDD or Me2SO (vehicle) for 6 h, and luciferase activity was assayed using a Turner TD-20e luminometer with a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells grown on glass coverslips in 6-well culture dishes were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (for NIH-3T3 cells, transfection mixtures were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum after 1 h, and cells were incubated in this mixture for an additional 5 h). Before visualization, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min in 4% formaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and inverted coverslips mounted onto microscope slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence micrographs were obtained with a SPOT SP100 cooled CCD camera fitted to a Nikon Optiphot-2 upright microscope with EFD-3 episcopic fluorescence attachment using a Nikon Pan Fluor × 100 oil immersion objective. Indirect immunofluoresence microscopy of Hepa-1 cells was performed using anti-AhR MAb RPT9 as described previously (18Singh S.S. Hord N.G. Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem.

AhR·FLAG and XAP2 were in vitrotranslated together with [35S]methionine using the TNT kit (Promega). The translation mixture (5 μl) was resolved by TSDS-PAGE and blotted to PVDF membrane as described previously (15Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H.

AhR and XAP2 bands were quantitated by phosphorimage analysis, and the signals were corrected for the abundance of methionine molecules in each to give a measure of their relative amounts. The membrane was then analyzed by Western blot with RPT1 (anti-AhR MAb) and anti-ARA9 (anti-XAP2 MAb; Novus Biologicals) primary antibodies, and125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) secondary Ab. Bands were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and quantitated by γ-counting. The signal was corrected for the relative amount of each protein giving a measure of the relative sensitivity of each MAb. COS-1 cells grown in 100-mm culture dishes were transfected at ∼70% confluence with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instructions (Me2SO/TCDD treatments were for 1 h prior to harvest). Cell cytosol was prepared as described previously (15Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For each immunoprecipitation, 400 μg of cytosolic protein was incubated for 1 h on ice with 35 μl of packed M2 anti-FLAG affinity resin (RPT9 conjugated to protein G-Sepharose for Hepa-1 AhR) in IP buffer (MENG + 20 mm Na2MoO4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mg/ml BSA, 2 mg/ml ovalbumin). Immunoprecipitates were washed 3X with IP buffer and 2X with MENG (+ 20 mm NaMoO4, 100 mm NaCl). Samples were heated with equal volumes of 2X TSB buffer and resolved by TSDS-PAGE, blotted to PVDF membrane, and analyzed by Western blot as described above. Bands were quantitated by both phosphor image analysis, and γ-counting (results were comparable), and relative ratios of AhR and XAP2 were determined. TCDD treated Hepa-1 cytosolic extracts were prepared and analyzed by SDGC as described previously (19Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For protein levels, fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to PVDF membrane, and bands visualized by Western blot using RPT1/biotin-goat anti-mouse IgG/[125I]-streptavidin system. To confirm that the AhR·YFP fusion and AhR-K13A·FLAG point mutation resulted in no loss of function, each was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Cytosol was isolated and incubated with anti-AhR MAb RPT9 bound to protein G-Sepharose (AhR·YFP), or anti-FLAG M2 MAb affinity gel (AhR-K13A·FLAG). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by TSDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto PVDF membrane and visualized by Western blot (Fig.1, A and B). The AhR, AhR·YFP, AhR·FLAG, and AhR-K13A·FLAG each co-immunoprecipitated hsp90 and XAP2 indicating their competence to assemble into a core complex analogous to that of the AhR. Further confirmation of the functionality of AhR·YFP was obtained by examining its ability to activate a DRE-driven luciferase reporter plasmid. COS-1 cells grown in 6-well culture dishes were transfected with pGudLuc 6.1 (DRE-driven luciferase reporter construct) and either pcDNA3 (control), pcDNA3-βmAhR, or pEYFP·AhR. Cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD or Me2SO (vehicle) for 6 h, followed by an assay for luciferase activity (Fig.1 C). AhR·YFP demonstrated activation of the luciferase reporter construct similar to the AhR. NIH-3T3 and COS-1 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with pEYFP·AhR. AhR·YFP alone consistently localized to the nuclei of transfected cells in the presence and absence of TCDD (Fig. 2). Co-expression of AhR·YFP and XAP2 resulted in distinct cytoplasmic localization of AhR·YFP with near complete nuclear translocation occurring upon a 1-h treatment with 10 nm TCDD. To examine the specificity of the effect of XAP2 on AhR·YFP localization, cells were co-transfected with pEYFP·AhR and pCI-FKBP52 or pCI-XAP2-G272D·FLAG, which contains a point mutation in the C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and has previously been shown to be incapable of assembling into the AhR core complex (15Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Neither protein had an effect on the subcellular localization of AhR·YFP, suggesting that the altered localization of AhR·YFP is specifically because of assembly of exogenous XAP2 into the AhR·hsp90 complex. COS-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with either pEYFP or pEYFP-Nuc (containing three tandem repeats of the nuclear localization signal of the simian virus 40 large T-antigen fused to its C terminus) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). YFP localized throughout cells, whereas YFP-Nuc was visible only in nuclei (Fig.3 A). The localization of YFP and YFP-Nuc was unaffected by treatment with 10 nm TCDD for 1 h. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with either pEYFP or pEYFP-Nuc and pCI-XAP2 or pCI (control) (Fig. 3 B). In both cases, XAP2 had no effect on localization, further demonstrating that the effect of XAP2 on AhR localization is specific and is not an artifact of altered nuclear import. To determine whether the subcellular localization of AhR·YFP was mediated by the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the AhR, a point mutation was made in the NLS, to yield AhR-K13A·YFP, which has been previously shown to abolish nuclear translocation (20Ikuta T. Eguchi H. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Kawajiri K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2895-2904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In both NIH-3T3 (Fig.3 C) and COS-1 cells (Fig. 3 D), AhR-K13A·YFP localized to cytoplasm and did not undergo detectable nuclear translocation following treatment with 10 nm TCDD for 1 h, confirming that AhR·YFP localization in both COS-1 and NIH-3T3 cells is mediated by the NLS of the AhR. The stoichiometry of the interaction of the AhR with XAP2 was examined by first calibrating the relative sensitivities of MAbs to each protein (Fig. 4). The anti-ARA9 MAb was determined to have a sensitivity of 0.95 relative to the anti-AhR MAb RPT1. COS-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3/pCI (control), pCI-XAP2 alone (control), pcDNA3-βmAhR·FLAG alone, and pCI-XAP2 + pcDNA3-βmAhR·FLAG. Cytosol was prepared, immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG resin, resolved by TSDS-PAGE, and blotted to PVDF membrane. AhR and XAP2 bands were visualized by Western blot with the appropriate primary and 125I-labeled secondary antibodies and quantitated by γ-counting (Fig.4 B). Values were corrected for nonspecific association with the affinity resin and the sensitivity correction factor to determine the ratio of XAP2 to AhR (Fig. 4 C). Transient expression of AhR alone resulted in an AhR/XAP2 ratio of 4:1, whereas co-expression of AhR with XAP2 resulted in a ratio of 1:1. Hepa-1 cells, fixed with paraformaldehyde, were incubated with affinity purified anti-AhR MAb RPT9 (500 μg/ml) and subsequently with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to lissamine-rhodamine sulfonyl chloride (LSRC). The AhR localized throughout cytoplasm and nuclei, and demonstrated near complete nuclear localization following treatment with TCDD (Fig.5 A). Fractionation of cells treated with TCDD revealed that the majority of liganded AhR was present in the cytosolic fraction, an apparent artifact of leaching during fractionation, as immunofluorescence microscopy revealed near complete nuclear localization (Fig. 5 B). SDGC analysis revealed the liganded AhR to be exclusively in the 9 S, oligomeric form (Fig. 5 C), demonstrating the presence of intact AhR complex in Hepa-1 nuclei following TCDD treatment. Analysis of total cytosolic levels and AhR·XAP2 core complex ratios demonstrated a 1.5-fold excess of AhR over XAP2 in Hepa-1 cytosol and the presence of XAP2 in ∼40% of the immunoprecipitated AhR complexes. An AhR·YFP fusion protein was constructed and biochemically characterized to demonstrate the validity of using it to model the AhR (Fig. 1, A and C). Transient expression of AhR·YFP in NIH-3T3 and COS-1 cells (Fig. 2) resulted in nuclear localization of AhR·YFP, in the presence and absence of TCDD. One hypothesis to explain our observations is that transiently expressed AhR·YFP may overwhelm endogenous levels of a factor required for cytoplasmic localization. Two obvious candidates for this factor were hsp90 and XAP2. Co-expression of AhR·YFP with hsp90 had no effect (data not shown), however XAP2 co-expression resulted in a clear redistribution of AhR·YFP to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). The relocalized, cytoplasmic AhR·YFP was responsive to TCDD, undergoing near complete nuclear translocation following treatment for 1 h. These data suggest that XAP2 modulates the subcellular localization of AhR·YFP and that transiently expressed AhR appears to be functionally distinct from endogenous AhR. Localization of transiently expressed AhR to the nucleus (and restoration of cytoplasmic localization by co-expression of XAP2) has been previously observed in COS-1 cells by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (12LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Histochemical studies of AhR localization in tissue slices have shown time and tissue specific nuclear, perinuclear, and cytoplasmic staining (16Perdew G.H. Abbott B. Stanker L.H. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Abbott B.D. Birnbaum L.S. Perdew G.H. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), suggesting that AhR localization may be regulated in a tissue-specific manner, possibly through regulation of XAP2 expression. The specificity of the effect of XAP2 on AhR·YFP localization was confirmed by co-expression with the immunophilin FKBP52, and XAP2-G272D·FLAG. No effect was seen in either case, demonstrating the specific requirement for functional XAP2. The effects of TCDD treatment and transient XAP2 expression on NLS-mediated nuclear uptake were examined by transiently expressing YFP and YFP-Nuc in COS-1 cells. YFP localized diffusely throughout cytoplasm and nuclei, whereas YFP-Nuc localized exclusively to nuclei (Fig. 3). TCDD treatment did not alter localization of either protein. To examine for a possible modulation of NLS-mediated nuclear import by XAP2, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with either pEYFP or pEYFP-Nuc and pCI-XAP2. XAP2 did not alter localization in the presence or absence of TCDD (Fig. 3 B), demonstrating that neither XAP2 nor TCDD appear to modulate nuclear import pathways in our system. The possibility that transiently expressed AhR·YFP may bypass NLS-mediated nuclear uptake pathways was examined using pEYFP·AhR-K13A. AhR-K13A·YFP localized exclusively to the cytoplasm of both NIH-3T3 and COS-1 cells in the presence and absence of TCDD (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that acquisition of nuclear AhR·YFP through a mechanism other than NLS-mediated import is unlikely, thus localization of AhR·YFP is mediated through the NLS of the AhR and is modulated by XAP2. Modulation of AhR·YFP localization by XAP2 was further explored by determination of ratios of AhR/XAP2 in the AhR core complex. AhR and XAP2 MAbs were calibrated to determine their relative sensitivities to quantitatively determine the ratio of XAP2 to AhR in the AhR core complex (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis revealed that only 25% of transiently expressed AhR in COS-1 cells was associated with XAP2, in contrast with ∼100% association when the AhR was co-expressed with XAP2. Strikingly, TCDD had no detectable effect on AhR/XAP2 ratios, lending strong support to the hypothesis that ligand binding initiates nuclear translocation of the intact AhR core complex prior to complex dissociation and dimerization with ARNT. In terms of the role of XAP2 in the subcellular localization of the AhR, transient expression of the AhR appears to overwhelm the limited pool of XAP2 that is in equilibrium with the AhR. In vitro translated AhR complexes that lack XAP2 are functional (22Dolwick K.M. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8566-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), however, in cells XAP2 appears to mediate the subcellular localization of the unliganded AhR. To complement these studies, localization and XAP2 stoichiometry were examined for endogenously expressed AhR in Hepa-1 cells. Indirect immunofluorescence/laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed the AhR in Hepa-1 cells to be localized throughout cytoplasm and nuclei, with near complete nuclear localization observed following TCDD treatment (Fig. 5 A). These data contradict an earlier report showing predominantly cytosolic localization of unliganded AhR in Hepa-1 cells (23Pollenz R.S. Sattler C.A. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 428-438PubMed Google Scholar). Stoichiometric analysis found ∼40% of the AhR in Hepa-1 cells complexed with XAP2 (Fig. 5D), supporting localization data and the hypothesis that XAP2 inclusion in the core complex is required for cytoplasmic localization of the AhR. In addition, fractionation of TCDD treated Hepa-1 cells followed by SDGC analysis further supports the hypothesis that the liganded AhR translocates to the nucleus intact. The majority of AhR in TCDD treated Hepa-1 cells is nuclear, but is found in the cytosolic fraction after cell disruption and is still in the 9 S core complex. Together, the results suggest that an important role of XAP2 in the AhR core complex is to maintain the receptor in the cell cytoplasm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a distinct function of a receptor-associated immunophilin-like protein. The data also suggest that XAP2 incorporation into the AhR core complex, although resulting in apparently increased levels of the AhR complex, is not necessary for significant expression of the AhR, and the lack of stoichiometric amounts of XAP2 does not result in rapid degradation as is seen with disruption of functional hsp90 (24Chen H-S. Singh S.S. Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The AhR appears to exist in two distinct forms in cells, one containing and one lacking XAP2. It is possible that these two forms are functionally unique, and the presence or absence of XAP2 in the AhR core complex may help explain tissue-specific AhR differences. The finding that TCDD does not alter AhR/XAP2 ratios, combined with cytochemistry data, demonstrates that essentially all of the AhR translocates to the nucleus upon TCDD treatment, strongly suggesting that the AhR core complex translocates to the nucleus intact. Furthermore, these data indicate that, whereas TCDD invokes a rapid accumulation of AhR core complex in the nucleus, TCDD binding appears to be insufficient to induce hsp90/XAP2 dissociation. Ligand-induced translocation of the AhR core complex prior to dissociation has been previously addressed and evidence utilizing different approaches has consistently supported the data reported here (19Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Wilhelmsson A. Cuthill S. Denis M. Wikström A-C. Gustafsson J-Å. Poellinger L.

Swanson H.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 82-92PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the rate-limiting step in dissociation of hsp90/XAP2 and subsequent heterodimerization with ARNT is not known. Modulation of the localization of the AhR by XAP2 is not a relationship that is without precedent. The family of small acidic proteins designated as 14-3-3 (see Ref. 28Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar for review) have been shown to have similar activities. Phosphorylated Cdc25 binds to 14-3-3 proteins, which appear to function to sequester Cdc25 in cytoplasm, resulting in functional inhibition (29Yang J. Winkler K. Yoshida M. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which XAP2 modulates the subcellular localization of the AhR is unknown, but may result from a number of possible scenarios. These include the following. 1) XAP2 may physically mask the NLS of the AhR, thereby inhibiting nuclear translocation pending a ligand-induced conformational change that results in exposure of the NLS and subsequent binding of the appropriate NLS recognition molecules. 2) XAP2 may mediate sequestration of the AhR in the cytoplasm by an unknown mechanism. 3) XAP2 may inhibit nuclear retention of the AhR, and 4) XAP2 may enhance the nuclear export of the AhR, leading to apparent cytoplasmic localization. Several of these possibilities are currently under investigation to fully elucidate the mechanism by which XAP2 modulates the subcellular localization of the AhR.

Numerous reports now conclusively show that the βγ heterodimer can regulate a diverse array of effector molecules such as inwardly rectifying potassium channels, G protein-coupled receptor kinases, certain isoforms of adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C-β, and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K),1 and other as yet unidentified upstream targets in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways (2Clapham D.E.

Studies have shown that the effector interaction sites on the βγ dimer partially overlap one another as well as with the Gα-binding site, and hence could explain GDP-bound Gα's ability to blunt βγ signaling potential (4Ford C.E.

Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Since Akt shares sequence similarity with protein kinase A and protein kinase C it is also known as protein kinase B or PKB (8Coffer P.J. Woodgett J.R. Eur. J.

Structurally, Akt contains a pleckstrin homology domain at its amino-terminal end, a kinase domain in the central region and a carboxyl-terminal tail region. The pleckstrin homology domain of Akt has been shown to bind phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate (11James S.R. Downes C.P. Gigg R. Grove S.J.

Two key regulatory residues, threonine 308 and serine 473, are located in the kinase and the carboxyl-terminal tail region, respectively (see below).

PI3K-generated phospholipids phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt and lead to the translocation of the kinase to the plasma membrane (18Andjelkovic M.

Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Class IA PI3K are heterodimers consisting of a catalytic subunit (α, β, or δ isoforms) bound to a p85 or analogous adapter molecule and mediate tyrosine kinase receptor pathways connecting to Akt. Class IB PI3K contain the γ catalytic isoform, does not bind p85 (or analogous adapter molecules), and is stimulated by G protein βγ subunits (25Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nürnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R.

Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although both classes of PI3K contain a Ras-binding domain in their amino-terminal region and bind Ras-GTP, only class IA isoforms are effectively stimulated by Ras (28Rubio I. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Downward J. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). While class IA PI3K is stimulated by tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, class IB subclass is not stimulated by such peptides. There is no evidence to suggest that the PI3Kγ participate in the tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated pathways. On the contrary, recent reports indicate that βγ subunits may interact with both class IA and IB isoforms of PI3K (29Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem.

Initial studies done in rat-1 fibroblasts reported that the mitogen lysophosphatidic acid which binds to a Gi/Gq-coupled GPCR did not activate Akt (15Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). However, recent data indicate that Akt can be transiently activated in a variety of cells in response to GPCR ligands such as thrombin (14Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A.

Furthermore, forskolin, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase and thus increases cyclic AMP, as well as the non-hydrolyzable analogs of cAMP have also been shown to activate Akt (21Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).

To better understand the immediate downstream partners involved in GPCR-mediated activation of Akt we focused our attention on the G protein subunits α and βγ. We demonstrate here that in HEK-293 cells, isoproterenol acting through β2-adrenergic receptors can induce phosphorylation of Akt, an effect blocked by inhibitors of PI3K, but not duplicated by mutationally activated Gαs. We further show that only βγ, not Gα are capable of activating an epitope-tagged transiently transfected Akt. We present additional evidence that c-Akt can be dually regulated by G proteins in a highly specific fashion in as much as constitutively active Gαi and Gαq interfere with Akt activation at a step downstream from βγ-effector interactions. This sets the stage for exploration of possible downstream effects of GPCR, mediated by Akt, such as attenuation in programmed cell death or metabolic or gene regulating effects mediated by GSK3β. Expression plasmid pAU5 was generated by modification of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Between theHindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA3, complementary synthetic oligonucleotides were ligated encoding a nonapeptide of the sequence MATDFYLKGS, in which the starting Met is in a context favorable for translation initiation (42Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and the Gly and Ser codons comprise a BamHI site GGATTC, followed byXhoI and EcoRI restriction sites. The peptide sequence TDFYLK is the target of the monoclonal antibody AU5 (BabCo). The full-length coding region of murine Akt-1 (GenBankTMaccession number X65687) was obtained by amplification of mouse brain cDNA (CLONTECH) with specific primers (sequences of primers employed available upon request) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR reactions employedPyrococcus woesei (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) thermostable DNA polymerase. Sequences encoding the restriction endonuclease sites for BamHI and EcoRI were designed into the 5′-sense and 3′-antisense primers, respectively. The PCR-amplified product corresponding to codons 2 to 481 of wild-type Akt-1 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, then subcloned in-frame into the corresponding restriction sites of the pAU5 vector. Seven silent mutations were noted relative to the GenBankTM sequence corresponding to the wild-type codons as follows: Ala107-GCa, Lys154-AAg, Lys163-AAg, Arg243-CGt, Asp302-GAc, Tyr340-TAc, Ser396-TCc. Constructs in pcDNA3 encoding Gβ1, −Gβ2, -Gβ5, -Gγ1, -Gγ2, -Gγ2* (C68S) were described previously (43Simonds W.F. Butrynski J.E. Gautam N. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol.

J. Gutkind. The coding regions of the latter two constructs were subcloned between the BamHI andNotI sites in pcDNA3. The constructs pCDNA1.1-Gαs and -Gαs-Q227L were purchased from American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC). pCIS2-H-Ras-Q61L, a constitutively active form of human H-Ras, was a kind gift of Dr. Michael Quon (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health). cDNAs encoding the human m1 mAchR, m2 mAchR, and β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) in pCD-PS were kindly provided by Dr. Jurgen Wess (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). Constructs were amplified in Escherichia coliXL1Blue (Stratagene) and purified using either a plasmid DNA isolation kit (Qiagen Maxi Prep) or by equilibrium sedimentation in a cesium chloride density gradient. The DNA sequence of all inserts generated or modified by PCR was verified by the dideoxy chain termination employing ABI Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) and COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (termed “complete medium”) and were passaged every 2–3 days. Purified plasmids were introduced into the cells (70–80% confluent) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) or Superfect (Qiagen) reagent according to manufacturer's recommendations. Typical transfection reactions consisted of a total of 16 μg of DNA per 75-cm2 flask and 40 μl of the transfection reagent. The negative control flasks were transfected with the equivalent amount of vector DNA. 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum starved for 16 h before harvesting. Isoproterenol and carbachol (without or with atropine at 100 nm) treatments were performed by the addition of prewarmed, drug-containing serum-free medium to the adherent cells and incubating them at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator for 30 or 10 min, respectively. IGF stimulation was performed by adding serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and IGF-1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at the concentration indicated in the figure legends to the adherent cells and incubating them at 37 °C for 5–10 min. Pretreatment of cells with LY294002 or wortmannin was done by incubating the adherent cells at 37 °C for 1 h in serum-free medium containing 10 μm LY294002 (Sigma, in ethanol) or 100 nm wortmannin (Sigma) prior to stimulation. The inhibitor was included during the stimulation step. Phosphorylation of Akt was estimated by subjecting the cell lysates (see below) to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotting using phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody (1:1000 dilution) (New England Biolabs), which detects Akt only when phosphorylated at serine 473. In addition, anti-Akt polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs), which recognizes Akt-1 irrespective of its activation state, was used to evaluate the expression of Akt under various transfection conditions. The mouse monoclonal antibody AU5 in ascites fluid (BabCo) was employed for blotting of AU5 epitope-tagged Akt. Expression of Gαq, Gβ1, and H-Ras was estimated in immunoblots employing antibodies anti-Gq/11α C-19 (Santa Cruz), RA (47Murakami T. Simonds W.F. Spiegel A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and anti-Ras (Transduction Laboratories), respectively. The bound primary antibodies were visualized either by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL) method with appropriate secondary antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or by incubation with125I-labeled Protein A (DuPont) and autoradiography on a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) when quantitation was desired. The cells were scraped off the flask using 1 ml of lysis buffer per 75-cm2 flask. Lysis buffer consists of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1.0 mm sodium vanadate, 100 nm okadaic acid, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.0 mm Pefablock (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 oC and 800 μl of the clear supernatant was incubated for 2 h with 3 μl of AU5 monoclonal antibody. At the end of the incubation 30 μl of GammaBindTM G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads (50% slurry) were added and incubated on a rocking platform at 4 oC for a further 30–60 min. The beads were sequentially washed with ice-cold lysis buffer, water, and kinase buffer for a total of 5 times. The washed immunoprecipitates were then incubated with 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, 100 μm ATP, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 30 μm cross-tide peptide (32Cross D.A.

Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar) (Upstate Biotechnology) or histone H2B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-33P]ATP (DuPont), at 30 °C for 15 min. At the end of the kinase reaction, 15 μl of the reaction solution was spotted on to a phosphocellulose SpinZyme tube (Pierce). The filter was washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid solution, air-dried, and the peptide specific radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. The agonist isoproterenol acting through β3-adrenergic GPCR has been shown to activate Akt and thereby inactivate GSK3 in rat epididymal fat cells (22Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether signals generated by activated Gαs or freed Gβγ subunits or both are involved. This same group showed that forskolin, a direct activator of the Gsα-effector adenylyl cyclase, was unable to inhibit GSK3 activity (22Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), implying that forskolin did not activate Akt. On the contrary, the eicosanoid prostaglandin E1, which binds to and activates a Gs-coupled GPCR, as well as forskolin have been shown to activate Akt in HEK-293-EBNA cells (21Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, wortmannin, a fungal metabolite and a known inhibitor of PI3K had no effect on the activation of Akt in either of these studies. In order to address the question of which G protein subunits participate in Akt activation we used a transient transfection assay system where we tested the ability of overexpressed signaling proteins to regulate Akt activation. Stimulation of cells transfected with β2-adrenergic receptor with 200 μm isoproterenol markedly increased the phosphorylation of a key regulatory serine residue in the carboxyl-terminal tail of endogenous Akt in HEK-293 cells, as evidenced by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody (Fig. 1, panels A-C, lane 3). Prior incubation of cells with the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol completely abolished the isoproterenol-induced Akt phosphorylation (not shown). A positive control, mutationally activated H-Ras (RasQL) known to activate endogenous PI3K, also induced Akt phosphorylation. The extent of β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Akt is comparable to that of Ras-QL (Fig. 1, panels A-C, cf. lanes 3 and 7). The compound LY294002, a reversible inhibitor of PI3K, which does not discriminate among the PI3K isoforms, completely inhibited isoproterenol-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1, panels A-C, lane 4). Our results are consistent with the published reports in which wortmannin or LY294002 inhibited Akt activation (12Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 40Tilton B. Andjelkovic M. Didichenko S.A. Hemmings B.A. Thelen M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and we conclude that isoproterenol-mediated Akt phosphorylation in transfected HEK-293 cells, and by extension activation, involves PI3K. Mutant Gα subunits, in which a conserved glutamine residue (Gln227 in the long form of Gαs) is mutated to leucine, lack GTPase activity, and are hence persistently active (48Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of mutationally activated Gαs, Gs-QL, did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1,panels A-C, lane 6), suggesting that β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated Akt signaling does not involve Gαs subunit. HEK-293 cells transfected with both β2-adrenergic receptor and wild-type Gαi1(Gαi) did not respond to isoproterenol (Fig. 1,panels A-C, lane 5). Since wild-type Gαi1 acts as one of the natural binding partners of Gβγ subunits, it is possible that the transfected Gαi was able to sequester free βγ complex that is released upon β2-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Overexpression of these signaling molecules did not alter the steady-state expression of endogenous Akt (Fig. 1,panel B). Taken together, these results lead to the hypothesis that β2-adrenergic receptor mediated activation of Akt"

The culture medium of human prostate carcinoma cells, when incubated with plasminogen at a variety of pH values, generated angiostatic peptides and miniplasminogen. The enzyme(s) responsible for this reaction was purified and identified as procathepsin D. The purified procathepsin D, as well as cathepsin D, generated two angiostatic peptides having the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequences and comprising kringles 1–4 of plasminogen in the pH range of 3.0–6.8, most strongly at pH 4.0 in vitro. This reaction required the concomitant conversion of procathepsin D to catalytically active pseudocathepsin D. The conversion of pseudocathepsin D to the mature cathepsin D was not observed by the prolonged incubation. The affinity-purified angiostatic peptides inhibited angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, procathepsin D secreted by human breast carcinoma cells showed a significantly lower angiostatin-generating activity than that by human prostate carcinoma cells. Since deglycosylated procathepsin D from both prostate and breast carcinoma cells exhibited a similar low angiostatin-generating activity, this discrepancy appeared to be attributed to the difference in carbohydrate structures of procathepsin D molecules between the two cell types. The seminal vesicle fluid from patients with prostate carcinoma contained the mature cathepsin D and procathepsin D, but not pseudocathepsin D, suggesting that pseudocathepsin D is not a normal intermediate of procathepsin D processing in vivo.

Because angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastases, the discovery of angiogenesis inhibitors is considered to represent a potential approach to treat cancer. It has so far been suggested that the metastatic growth of carcinoma cells is associated with induced angiogenesis and that the rate of tumor growth correlates with the formation of new blood vessels (1Folkman J. Merler E. Abernathy C. Williams G. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 133: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). Higher vascular tumors can be stimulated by angiogenic growth factors released by tumors and host tissues, thereby producing metastases at a higher rate than less angiogenic tumors. On the other hand, it has been known that certain types of primary tumors, such as murine Lewis lung carcinoma and human prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC-3), can produce angiogenic inhibitors in order to suppress the tumor growth at metastatic sites, besides angiogenic growth factors (2O'Reilly M.S.

Therefore, the growth rate of a tumor may be the result of the balance between positive and negative angiogenic effects. Angiostatin and endostatin are endogenous angiogenic inhibitors produced by proteolysis of plasminogen and collagen XVIII, respectively (1Folkman J. Merler E. Abernathy C. Williams G. J. Exp.

Recently, human prostate carcinoma cells (PC-3) have been shown to express an enzymatic activity in the serum-free conditioned medium that can generate bioactive angiostatin from plasminogen (12Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The importance of plasmin in cancer-mediated conversion of plasminogen to angiostatin was also described in human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) (14Stathakis P. Lay A.J. Fitzgerald M. Schlieker C. Matthias L.J Hogg P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8910-8916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether angiostatin production by prostate carcinoma cells is totally dependent on the plasmin action. Here we report that procathepsin D produced directly by human prostate carcinoma cells is responsible for the generation of angiostatic peptides comprising kringle domains 1–4 of plasminogen and that the isolated angiostatic peptides can inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and bFGF-induced angiogenesisin vivo. In addition, we address the question about the difference of procathepsin D molecules between human prostate and breast carcinoma cells in the ability of angiostatin generation. Human cathepsin D and pepsin were purchased from Sigma. Porcine pancreatic elastase was from Elastin Products Company, Inc. A chromogenic peptide substrate (S-2251) was from Chromogenix AB, Sweden. Lysine-Sepharose 4B, Sephadex G-75, Superdex G-200, Phenyl-Sepharose HP, and hydroxyapatite were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Angiostatin consisting of the first three kringles of plasminogen was from TechnoClone GmbH (Vienna, Austria). Human cathepsin E was prepared from human erythrocyte membranes as described previously (15Yamamoto K. Marchesi V.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 208-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against human cathepsin D and human plasminogen were from Calbiochem and Dako Chemical Co., respectively. The monoclonal antibody against human miniplasminogen was from American Diagnostica Inc. Human prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cells and human breast carcinoma (MCF7) cells were obtained from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo). Human umbilical endothelial cells were from Clonetic Co. Seminal vesicle fluid was obtained from two patients with prostate carcinoma in the Department of Urology, Kyushu University Hospital (Fukuoka, Japan), under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol with subjects providing informed consent. PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). MCF7 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and the antibiotics. Human omental microvascular endothelial cells that were isolated from normal omental tissue removed during surgery as described previously (16Mawatari M. Kohno K. Mizoguchi H. Matsuda T. Asoh K. Van Damme J. Welgus H.G. Kuwano M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1619-1627PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in M-199 medium containing 10% FCS. Human umbilical endothelial cells were cultured as recommended by the suppliers. All cell cultures were performed at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Culture media were prepared from cultures of various cells. Confluent cell monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured in each culture medium for 18 h. The culture media were collected and filtrated through a 0.45-μm pore size membrane (Millipore Corp.). Human plasminogen was purified from the pooled human plasma in the presence of 3 mm benzamidine-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, aprotinin (100 units/ml), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml). The pooled plasma was first subjected to affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose 4B in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mm EDTA as described (17Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1995-1996Crossref Scopus (1672) Google Scholar), followed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. The fragment of the lysine binding site I (LBS I) including kringles 1–3 was purified from human plasminogen according to the method of Sottrup-Jensen et al. (18Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Zajdel M. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Prog. Chem. Fibrinolysis Thrombolysis. 1978; 3: 191-209Google Scholar). The monospecific antibody for LBS I was prepared from the antisera raised in rabbits by affinity chromatography on a protein A-Sepharose column followed by an LBS I-conjugated Sepharose 4B column. The culture medium from PC-3 cells was subjected to a CM-Sepharose column (2.5 × 30 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 25 mm NaCl (buffer A). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the nonadsorbed fraction to give a final concentration of 1.0m. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to a phenyl-Sepharose 4B column (5.0 × 10 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 1.0 m ammonium sulfate. After washing with the same buffer, proteins bound to the column were eluted by the linear gradient of ammonium sulfate ranging from 1.0 to 0 m. The angiostatin-generating activity was eluted at a concentration of 5 mm ammonium sulfate. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A. The dialysate was concentrated by ultrafiltration on an Amicon Diaflo YM10 membrane and then subjected to Superdex G-200 (1.0 × 60 cm) chromatography equilibrated with buffer A. The activity was eluted at the position corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 50–60 kDa. After concentration and dialysis against buffer A, the active fraction was subjected to a Q-Sepharose HP column (0.5 × 6.5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme activity was eluted by the gradient of NaCl ranging from 0 to 1.0m. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and then subjected to a hydroxyapatite column (1.0 × 10 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The activity was eluted by the gradient of sodium phosphate ranging from 20 to 200 mm. The enzyme responsible for the generation of angiostatin was eluted at a concentration of about 50 mm sodium phosphate. The angiostatic peptides were purified from human plasminogen fragments hydrolyzed by the culture medium of PC-3 cells. Human plasminogen (10 mg) was incubated with the culture medium from PC-3 cells (0.8 mg) in 100 ml of citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, at 37 °C overnight. Then the mixture was subjected to affinity chromatography on a lysine-Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mm EDTA. Angiostatic peptides consisting of the first four kringle domains of plasminogen were eluted with 0.1 m ε-aminocaproic acid in the same buffer. The peptides were further purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column. The main peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against PBS, and stored at −80 °C until use. The angiostatin-generating activity was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with two types of antibodies against human plasminogen: the antibodies to human plasminogen and the monospecific antibodies to LBS I. Angiostatin-generating activity was evaluated by assaying remaining plasminogen molecules after incubation between a known amount of plasminogen and a fraction containing the angiostatin-generating activity for a certain period. Microtiter wells were coated with 150 μl of 50 mm carbonate-buffer, pH 9.6, containing the monoclonal antibody to miniplasminogen (5 mg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. Unbound antibody was drained off, and the wells were blocked by 300 μl of bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) in the coating buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Meanwhile, samples (50 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of plasminogen (1.0 mg/ml), 100 μl of citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then diluted 2500-fold with PBS containing aprotinin (10 units/ml), l% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20. The diluted sample (100 μl) was added to the coated wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human LBS I antibody (20 ng/ml) was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, 100 μl of freshly prepared o-phenylendiamine solution was added and allowed to stand in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 n sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 490 nm was determined promptly. 1 unit was defined as the enzyme activity that degrades 20 μg of plasminogen for 1 h at 37 °C. Plasmin activity was assayed by the method of Friberger et al. (19Friberger P. Knos M. Gustavsson S. Aurell L. Glaeson G. Haemostasis. 1978; 2: 138-145Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were mixed with 50 μl of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (20 units/ml) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm NaCl. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, 50 μl of the chromogenic peptide substrate S-2251 was added to the mixture and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2% citric acid solution. The liberated p-nitroaniline was determined at 405 nm promptly. Proteins were electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride filters. After blocking in 4% skim milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl at pH 7.4 containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl-saline, pH 7.4, containing the first antibodies (10 μg/ml). After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the second antibody solution containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (diluted 1:1000–1:4000). Enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for visualization. Plasminogen (250 μg/ml) was treated with procathepsin D (5 μg/ml), cathepsin D (5 μg/ml), pepsin (5 μg/ml), or cathepsin E (5 μg/ml) in citrate/phosphate buffer at pH 4.0. Each digest was sampled at appropriate time intervals and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (12.5% polyacrylamide, and 2.5 μg of protein/lane). The proteins that had been separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred from the gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The protein bands on the membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, excised, and subjected to the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis by an automatic protein/peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 477A). The proliferation assay of human omentum microvascular endothelial cells was performed by the method of O'Reilly et al. (2O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing U. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Briefly, the cells (5000 cells) were plated onto gelatinized culture plates (24 wells) and incubated in M199 containing 10% FCS, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h in 5% CO2. The medium was replaced with 0.25 ml of serum-free medium, and further incubated overnight. Then, the samples were added to the wells. After a 20-min incubation, the culture medium containing 10% FCS (0.25 ml) was added to the wells and incubated for 72 h. After treatment with trypsin-EDTA, the dispersed cells were counted using a Coulter counter. Cornea angiogenesis assay was performed using 6-week-old male BALB/c mice, as described previously (2O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing U. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (2.0 mg/ml) and bFGF (1.0 mg/ml, Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) were mixed with an equal volume of 12% poly-2-hydroxylethylmethacrylate polymer (Hydron, Interferon Sciences, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). 1 μl of the mixture was pipetted twice onto Teflon sheets. Pellets were air-dried for 1–2 h in a laminar flow hood, cut into nine pellets, and stored overnight at 4 °C. A pocket was made within the cornea stroma, and pellets were positioned 1.0–1.2 mm from the limbs. Corneas were examined for 6 days after implantation, and the angiogenic response was quantitated using the method of Chen et al. (20Chen C. Parangi S. Tolentino M.J. Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4230-4242PubMed Google Scholar). The culture medium of human prostate carcinoma cells (PC-3) was incubated with human plasminogen at various pH values at 37 °C overnight. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and immunoblotting (Fig. 1). The maximal degradation was observed at pH 4.0–5.0, where three protein bands with apparent molecular masses of 35, 42, and 45 kDa were observed (Fig. 1 A). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the 42- and 45-kDa peptides immunoreacted with the antibodies to an elastase-derived fragment (LBS I) comprising kringles 1–3 of plasminogen, whereas the 35-kDa peptide immunoreacted with the monoclonal antibody to miniplasminogen (including the kringle 5 and serine protease domains of plasminogen) (Fig. 1 B). Plasminogen was also degraded by the medium at pH values of 6.0–8.0, but electrophoretic mobilities of the generated peptides were slightly different from those observed at acidic pH. In addition, the extent of the generation of angiostatic peptides at pH 6.0–8.0 was less than 10% relative to that at pH 4.0–5.0. The generation of angiostatic peptides at acidic pH was strongly inhibited by pepstatin A (1 μm) but not by other protease inhibitors (Table I). These results indicate that the proteolytic activity responsible for the generation of angiostatic peptides by the culture medium of PC-3 cells at acidic pH is attributable to the aspartic proteinase family and that the 42- and 45-kDa angiostatic peptides and the 35-kDa miniplasminogen are generated by its enzymatic action.Table IEffect of protease inhibitors on the acidic angiostatin-generating activity found in the culture medium of PC-3 cellsInhibitorConcentrationClassActivity remaining%None100E-6410 μmCysteine proteinases100EDTA1 mmMetalloproteinases98Pepstatin A1 μmAspartic proteinases0Elastatinal50 μmElastase97Benzamidine10 mmSerine proteinases98Aprotinin1 mmSerine proteinases100The culture medium from PC-3 cells was incubated with plasminogen at pH 4.0 and 37 °C overnight in the presence of various protease inhibitors.

E-64,l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane. To characterize the enzyme activity responsible for the generation of angiostatic peptides, the corresponding enzyme was purified from the culture medium of PC-3 cells (Table II). Phenyl-Sepharose chromatography provided a rapid and efficient method for removing significant amounts of contaminating proteins. About 850-fold purification over the culture medium was accomplished by this step. The complete elimination of contaminating proteins was accomplished by hydroxyapatite chromatography. The final preparation gave single protein bands with an apparent molecular mass of about 44 kDa when examined by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2 A). Immunoblot analysis revealed that these bands were immunoreactive with antibodies to human cathepsin D (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and2). In addition, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this protein was found to be LVRIPL, which was consistent with the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of procathepsin D starting with the residue Leu21 of the predicted amino acid sequence of preprocathepsin D (21Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Chirgwin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4910-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Human mature cathepsin D had an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa in SDS gels (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4), and its NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was found to be GPIPEVL, which corresponded to the amino acid sequence starting at the 65th Thr residue of the predicted amino acid sequence of procathepsin D. These data indicate that the enzyme responsible for the generation of angiostatic peptides released by PC-3 cells is procathepsin D.Table IIPurification of the angiostatin-generating enzyme from the culture medium of PC-3Purification stepTotal proteinTotalSpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgunitsunits/mg-fold%Culture medium472526400.561100CM-Sepharose330824150.731.392Phenyl-Sepharose3.78178847384768Superdex G-2000.5411262086373843Q-Sepharose0.1736153555637124Hydroxyapatite0.1244994024720819The angiostatin-generating activity was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 1 unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to degrade 20 μg of plasminogen at 37 °C for 1 h. Open table in a new tab The angiostatin-generating activity was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 1 unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to degrade 20 μg of plasminogen at 37 °C for 1 h. To determine whether the purified enzyme can actually generate the angiostatic fragments from plasminogen and also to compare its angiostatin-generating activity with that of mature cathepsin D, both procathepsin D and cathepsin D were incubated with plasminogen (enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100) at 37 °C and pH 4.0 overnight. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Not only cathepsin D but also procathepsin D could generate the 45- and 42-kDa angiostatic peptides and the 35-kDa miniplasminogen, which corresponded to the 55- and 52-kDa angiostatic peptides and the 32-kDa miniplasminogen under reducing conditions, respectively (Fig. 2 C). Angiostatic peptides and miniplasminogen were generated time-dependently by incubation of plasminogen with procathepsin D at pH 4.0 and 37 °C for up to 1 h (Fig. 3 B). The 45-, 42-, and 35-kDa peptides all were resistant to further degradation by prolonged incubation up to 4 h (not shown). These results were consistent with those obtained with the culture medium of PC-3 cells. The generation of these peptides was in fair agreement with the conversion of procathepsin D to the 41-kDa form (Fig. 3 A). Within a 15-min incubation, about 50% of procathepsin D was converted to the 41-kDa form. The complete conversion was accomplished within a 30-min incubation. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 41-kDa protein was found to be IAKGP, which corresponded to the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of pseudocathepsin D starting with the 47th Ile in the predicted amino acid sequence of preprocathepsin D. This conversion was accelerated as the procathepsin D concentration was increased and was inhibited by pepstatin A. These results indicated that the 41-kDa protein was generated by a proteolytic cleavage between Leu46 and Ile47 in the propart, predominantly through intermolecular reaction. No prote"

These toxins have been classified into several families based on their disulfide pattern and biological properties. Here, we report a new family ofConus peptides, which have a novel cysteine motif. Three peptides of this family (CMrVIA, CMrVIB, and CMrX) have been purified from Conus marmoreus venom, and their structures have been determined. Their amino acid sequences are VCCGYK-LCHOC (CMrVIA), NGVCCGYKLCHOC (CMrVIB), and GICCGVSFCYOC (CMrX), where O represents 4-trans-hydroxyproline. Two of these peptides (CMrVIA and CMrX) have been chemically synthesized. Using a selective protection and deprotection strategy during disulfide bond formation, peptides with both feasible cysteine-pairing combinations were generated. The disulfide pattern (C1-C4, C2-C3) in native toxins was identified by their co-elution with the synthetic disulfide-isomeric peptides on reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Although cysteine residues were found in comparable positions with those of α-conotoxins, these toxins exhibited a distinctly different disulfide bonding pattern; we have named this new family “λ -conotoxins.” CMrVIA and CMrX induced different biological effects when injected intra-cerebroventricularly in mice; CMrVIA induces seizures, whereas CMrX induces flaccid paralysis. The synthetic peptide with λ-conotoxin folding is about 1150-fold more potent in inducing seizures than the mispaired isomer with α-conotoxin folding. Thus it appears that the unique disulfide pattern, and hence the “ribbon” conformation, in λ-conotoxins is important for their biological activity.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Some of these conotoxins are used as tools in investigating receptor structure and function (2McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 605-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and ion channel geometry (7Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 571-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The structurally constrained scaffolds of conotoxins are utilized as a template for protein engineering to create chimeric proteins (8Mezo G. Drakopoulou E. Paál V. Rajnavölgyi É. Vita C.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6820-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The specificity of conotoxins is due to their disulfide bonding framework and specific amino acids in inter-cysteine loops. The high density of disulfides in conotoxins plays a vital role in their stability and imposes a distinct protein folding with a specific orientation of hypervariable loop regions. The diversity in conotoxins is also achieved through disulfide pairings (see “Discussion”).The conotoxins with two disulfide bonds can have three possible monomeric conformations: “globular” having a Greek “ω”-like conformation formed by interlocking disulfide bridges between C 1Cm -Cn , cysteine pairing, where C is the single amino acid code for cysteine, and m and n indicate the cysteine number in the sequence.1Cm -Cn , cysteine pairing, where C is the single amino acid code for cysteine, and m and n indicate the cysteine number in the sequence.-C3 and C2-C4,1“string of independent bead” conformation with C1-C2 and C3-C4, or a “ribbon topology” with C1-C4 and C2-C3 bond formation (11Zhang R. Snyder G.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11343-11348Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Native α- and τ-conotoxins, however, possess an identical disulfide bonding pattern (C1-C3, C2-C4) and globular conformation (12Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M.

All three disulfide isomers of α-conotoxin (GI from Conus geographus venom) have been synthesized, and the native structure corresponded to the most stable isomer with C1-C3 and C2-C4 pairing (14Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Two other isomers are relatively unstable. In addition, the C1-C4, C2-C3 isomer rearranges more readily than does the C1-C2, C3-C4 isomer to the native C1-C3, C2-C4 isomer in various buffers containing shuffling reagent (15Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the isomer with C1-C3 and C2-C4disulfide pairing is at least 10 times more potent than the other disulfide isomers (14Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies indicate that the C1-C4, C2-C3 isomer is the least active and unstable among two-disulfide conotoxins.In this study, we report the members of a novel family of conotoxins, which we have named “λ -conotoxins.” Their unique disulfide pattern (C1-C4, C2-C3) leads to a new native protein fold with ribbon topology in conotoxins, exposing different peptide interaction surfaces (15Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Here we describe the purification and characterization of three conotoxins of this new family. Their disulfide bond pattern was established by specific chemical synthesis and co-elution. The synthetic peptides with native conformation in this family exhibit different biological activities. The critical nature of the ribbon topology in native λ-conotoxins is substantiated by their potent biological activity.DISCUSSIONThe venoms of Conus snails are a complex mixture of pharmacologically active peptides. These disulfide-rich, compact peptides called conotoxins are classified into several different families based on their structure and biological activity (Fig. 6). Structurally, the disulfide bonds are intrinsic to the stable three-dimensional conformation and play an important role in their function. Hence, a change in the disulfide bonding pattern leads to a significant change in the overall conformation and function of the toxin. For example, in the case of conotoxins with three-disulfide bonds at least five structural families (or templates) with at least two distinct disulfide pairings have been documented (Fig. 6). These structural changes contribute to the difference in their folding and biological functions (for review see Ref. 1Jones R.M. Bulaj G. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2000; 3: 141-154PubMed Google Scholar).So far two families of toxins (α and τ) have been identified in conotoxins with two-disulfide bonds (Fig. 6). They share a similar disulfide pairing, i.e. C1-C3 and C2-C4, and have a globular structure. The alternative disulfide bonding pattern and protein folds are considered unstable and physiologically irrelevant (15Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the first members of a new family of conotoxins, which we have named λ-conotoxins, with a different disulfide pairing (C1-C4 and C2-C3), hitherto not reported in native conotoxins.λ-conotoxins share some features with α-conotoxins; (a) they are smaller in size and have 11–16 amino acid residues (Fig. 6), (b) they have four cysteines in comparable positions, and (c) they have two disulfide bonds forming two loops. However, they have several characteristic features that differ from α-conotoxins. First, λ-conotoxins differ from α-conotoxins in their disulfide bonding patterns. α-Conotoxins have C1-C3 and C2-C4pairing, whereas λ-conotoxins have C1-C4 and C2-C3 pairing (Fig. 4). Second, they differ in their loop sizes. The second loop in α-conotoxins is larger than the first loop (except for ImI); in contrast, the second loop is smaller in λ-conotoxins (Fig. 4 A). Third, they differ in the positions of conformation-constraining residues. α-Conotoxins have a proline in the first loop, whereas λ-conotoxins have a hydroxyproline in the second loop. In α-conotoxins the second loop is more flexible, whereas in λ-conotoxins the first loop is more flexible. Fourth, they differ in carboxyl-terminal amidation. Carboxyl-terminal residues of all but one α-conotoxin (AuIC) are amidated; on the other hand, carboxyl-terminal residues of λ-conotoxins are not amidated. Fifth, they differ in their overall conformation. α-Conotoxins have a globular conformation that is crucial for proper molecular recognition (15, Fig. 4 B). In contrast, λ-conotoxins have a flat ribbon-like conformation (Fig. 4 B). This native conformation appears to be important for the biological activity of λ-conotoxins. CMrVIA with the native conformation (isomer B) is about 1150-fold more potent in inducing seizures than the one with α-conotoxin fold (isomer A) (Fig. 5). This alternative cystine pairing and ribbon conformation found in natural toxins may be useful as a template in developing a new family of lead compounds in the drug discovery process.Conus venoms are a natural pharmacopoeia of toxins that can bind to and discriminate closely related receptors and ion channels. They have evolved as a diverse group of toxin peptides in several ways. First, they have evolved by varying their loop structures. Like any other key physiological proteins, the loop regions within conotoxins are essential for biological specificity. The divergence is achieved through a change in loop size, number of loops/interacting surfaces, and loop composition through hyper-mutation. Second, they have evolved by adopting post-translational modifications. Several post-translational modifications occur in conotoxins, which also increase the complexity. These modifications help either in protein-protein interaction or in modifying the physiochemical properties (1Jones R.M. Bulaj G. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2000; 3: 141-154PubMed Google Scholar). Third, they have evolved by differential disulfide formation. In conotoxins with three disulfides, different disulfide pairings alter the protein folding, conformation, and function. As shown here, the two-disulfide conotoxins also have alternate disulfide pairing. In both α- and λ-conotoxins, the native cysteine pairing, and hence the conformation, is critical for their biological activity. Thus, alternative disulfide pairings also contribute to structural and functional diversity in conotoxins.In summary, λ-conotoxins are a novel family of conotoxins differing from α-conotoxins in several structural and functional characteristics. We have isolated and characterized three λ-conotoxins from C. marmoreus venom. Structural studies of this family could provide better insight into the usefulness of this new scaffold in molecular engineering, the development of peptide libraries, and the design of potential drug prototypes. Conotoxins are biologically active peptide toxins isolated from venomous marine cone snails. They are typically small disulfide-rich peptides containing 11–30 amino acid residues. Conotoxins can be classified into several families based on the number and pattern of disulfide bonds and biological activities (1Jones R.M. Bulaj G. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2000; 3: 141-154PubMed Google Scholar, 2McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 605-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Members of a single family of conotoxins share similar protein folding but in some cases exhibit different biological activities (3Fainzilber M. Gordon D. Hasson A. Spira M.E. Zlotkin E. Eur. J.

Furthermore, the isomer with C1-C3 and C2-C4disulfide pairing is at least 10 times more potent than the other disulfide isomers (14Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S.

The two kinases, CMKB and CMKC, possess high sequence identity with mammalian CaM kinases (CaMKs) I/IV and CaMKKα/β, respectively. In vitro CMKC phosphorylates and increases the activity of CMKB, indicating they are biochemical homologues of CaMKKα/β and CaMKI/IV. The disruption of CMKB is lethal; however, when protein expression is postponed, the spores germinate with delayed kinetics. The observed lag corresponds to a delay in the G1-phase activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase NIMXcdc2 . Disruption ofcmkC is not lethal, but spores lacking CMKC also germinate with delayed kinetics and a lag in the activation of NIMXcdc2 . Analysis of ΔcmkC suggests a role for CMKC in regulating the first and subsequent nuclear division cycles. We conclude that both CMKB and CMKC are required for the proper temporal activation of NIMXcdc2 as spores enter the cell cycle from quiescence and suggest that this relationship exists during the G1/S transition of subsequent cell divisions.

Kahl C.R. Crenshaw D.G. Dayton J.S. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 512-528Google Scholar). Similar to mammalian cells, CaM is required during both G1and G2 in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans (2Lu K.P. Osmani S.A. Osmani A.H. Means A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Dayton J.S. Sumi M. Nanthakumar N.N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3223-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To date two Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes have been identified in A. nidulans, a Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphatase (CnA) and a Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (ACMK or CMKA). Similar to CaM, both of these enzymes are required at similar cell cycle transitions as their mammalian homologues, namely CnA is required for G1 progression, and CMKA is essential during G2 (4Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Dayton J.S. Means A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Disruption of cmkA is lethal; however the fungus is viable when the gene is placed under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase (alcA) promoter (5Dayton J.S. Means A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When the alcA-mediated CMKA expression is repressed, the strain grows dramatically slower than control strains, and CMKA mRNA and protein are undetectable by Northern and Western analysis, respectively. However, CaM affinity chromatography yielded CaMK activity that represented about 10 percent that present in the wild-type strain. These results suggested that either CMKA repression was not absolute or that A. nidulanscontains an unidentified additional CaMK. Pharmacological evidence exists that CaMKs may function not only in G2 but also in the G1 phase of the cell cycle of metazoans. Specifically, the selective CaMK inhibitor, KN-93, has been shown to arrest cells in G1. Although these pharmacological studies have been interpreted as indicating CaMKII activity is required for G1 progression, KN-93 inhibits all three multifunctional CaMKs, CaMKI, II, and IV (6Hidaka H. Yokokuua H. Hidaka H. Narin A.C. Intracellular Signal Transduction, Advances in Pharmacology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 193-219Google Scholar), and therefore inhibition of any of these enzymes could be responsible for the G1 arrest. Additionally, the nature of the KN-93-induced G1 arrest depends upon the cell line and the experimental protocol. The drug arrests HeLa cells in G1 with high histone H1 kinase activity, indicating that the arrest is at the G1/S boundary (7Rasmussen G. Rasmussen C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, NIH-3T3 cells arrest earlier in G1 with low levels of cyclinD1 and an enhanced association of p27kip1 with Cdk2 (8Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar, 9Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R.J. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the conflicting results are due to cell line differences or represent two independent points at which a CaMK activity is required. Therefore, the putative CaMKs and their role(s) in the G1 phase of the cell cycle have yet to be defined. Since many Ca2+/CaM-signaling pathways appear to be functionally conserved between A. nidulans and mammalian cells, we have used the filamentous fungus to further our understanding of the essential roles of CaMKs. In the current study we present the characterization of two novel Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases in A. nidulans, CMKB and CMKC. In vitro, the two fungal kinases, CMKB and CMKC, function analogously to the mammalian CaMK cascade members: CaMKI/IV and CaMKKα/β. Disruption ofcmkB is lethal, indicating CMKB is required for A. nidulans growth. Both retarded expression of CMKB and disruption of cmkC severely delay the nuclear division cycle before the initiation of NIMXcdc2 kinase activity. We propose that both CMKB and CMKC are required for the proper temporal activation of NIMXcdc2 upon re-entry into the cell cycle from a quiescent state and during the G1/S transition of subsequent nuclear division cycles. The A. nidulans strains used in this study are: GR5 (A773;pyrG89; wA2; pyroA4), pAL5#10 (A773;wA2; pyroA4), JJ25 (A773; ΔcmkB;wA2; pyroA4), JJ26 (A773; ΔcmkC;wA2; pyroA4), JJ27 (A773;dcmkB; wA2; pyroA4). All strains were grown in minimal medium containing 50 mm glucose at a temperature of 37 °C as described by Lu and Means (10Lu K.P. Means A.R. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 255-275Google Scholar). To grow strains of the pyrG89 or pyroA4 genotype, the media was supplemented with 5 mm uridine and 10 mm uracil or 2 μg/liter pyridoxine hydrochloride, respectively. CMKB and CMKC cDNAs were isolated by screening an A. nidulans λgt11 cDNA expression library (a gift of Dr. Greg May) with a protein A-Aspergillus CaM fusion protein, as described by Stirlinget al. (11Stirling D.A. Petrie A. Pulford D.J. Paterson D.T. Stark M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The protein A-CaM fusion protein was generated by subcloning a hemagglutinin-tagged CaM as a bluntedAflIII/BamHI fragment into the bluntedEcoRI and BamHI sites of pALP1 (a gift of Dr. Michael Stark), thereby creating pALP-ACaM. The protein A-CaM fusion protein was purified from cultures grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertoni (LB) to an A600 nm of 1.0 by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, following the protocol for purification of bacterially expressed A. nidulans CaM (12Rasmussen C.D. Means R.L. Lu K.P. May G.S. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13767-13775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 4 × 105 plaques were screened. Of the approximately 150 positive plaques identified, 40 were randomly chosen for purification. As a secondary screen, these 40 plaques were hybridized with random-primed cDNA probes of A. nidulans CMKA and CnA. Clones negative for CMKA and CnA were plaque-purified, and the plasmids were excised as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The inserts were then sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide termination reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both protein kinases were expressed as hexa-histidine-tagged fusion proteins.BamHI and EcoRI sites were added to the CMKB cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the resulting product was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pTrcHisB (Invitrogen), generating pTrcCMKB. SacI and KpnI restriction sites were generated on the 5′ and 3′ end of the CMKC cDNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the product was ligated into the corresponding sites of pGEM-7Zf(−) (Promega). The cDNA was subsequently subcloned as a SacI/XhoI fragment into pET30b (Novagen), thus creating pETCMKC. The sequence of both expression vectors was confirmed by sequencing. BLR(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) bacteria were transformed with the expression plasmids, and several colonies were used to inoculate 100 ml of LB and grown overnight at 30 °C. 20 ml of the overnight culture was used to seed 1 liter of LB medium, and the culture was grown at 37 °C to anA600 nm of 0.6; protein expression was then induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl B-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h. After induction, the culture was pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmKCl, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The bacterial pellet was lysed by mild sonication and clarified by centrifugation at 16000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with 0.5 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) with rocking for 1 h at 4 °C. The bound resin was loaded onto a column and washed with 10 ml of lysis buffer followed by 10 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with 50 mm imidazol. The bound protein was eluted in lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazol. The purified enzymes were stored in 40% glycerol at −80 °C. All point mutations of CMKB were generated by the mega-primer mutagenesis technique and confirmed by sequencing (13Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase-CaMKI and maltose-binding protein-CaMKKβ were bacterially expressed and purified as described previously (14Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D.

Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All CaM kinases were assayed at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 0.2 μl/reaction [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μm A. nidulans CaM, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20. The kinases were assayed using the following concentrations: 100 ng/reaction CMKB, 5 ng/reaction CaMKI, 500 ng/reaction CMKC and CaMKKβ and 1 μg/reaction crude protein extracts. CMKB was assayed using 100 μm ADR1G (LKKLTRRASFSGQ) as a peptide substrate; 100 μm synapsin site 1 (LRRRLSDANF) was used for CaMKI. The reactions were performed in a 30-μl final reaction volume for 5 min. The kinase reactions were terminated by spotting 20 μl of the reaction onto p81 phosphocellulose filters followed by extensive washing in 75 mm phosphoric acid. The specific activity was determined after liquid scintillation counting of the dried filters. To assay the ability of CMKC and CaMKKβ to activate the downstream kinases, a 25 μl reaction including both activating and target kinases but without the peptide substrate and [γ-32P]ATP was preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The peptide assay was then initiated by the addition of the substrate and [γ-32P]ATP. Screening the A. nidulans chromosome specific library from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center with cDNA probes of both kinases identified cosmids containing the genomic sequences. The genomic clones of CMKB and CMKC were isolated by polymerase chain reaction of cosmids W4E06 and L4O01, respectively, taking advantage of the same oligonucleotide primers used to isolate the cDNAs. The genomic clones were subcloned into pGEM-7Zf(−) (Promega). To generate the disruption plasmid forcmkB, an approximately 600-bpClaI/ScaI fragment of the cmkB was isolated, blunted, and subcloned into the SmaI site of pRG1 (17Waring R.B. May G.S. Gene. 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), thereby generating pCMKBdis. Ligation of an approximately 700 bp of blunted HindIII/SacII fragment ofcmkC into pRGI generated pCMKCdis. A. nidulansGR5 conidia were transformed with pCMKBdis and pCMKCdis by electroporation as described by Sanchez and Aguirre (18Sanchez O. Aguirre J. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1996; 43: 48-51Google Scholar). The positive transformants were selected by growth on minimal medium in the absence of uridine and uracil to select for the presence of the pyr4 nutritional marker. Transformants of pCMKBdis were maintained as heterokaryon-generating cultures by transfer of mycelia instead of spores. Southern analysis was performed using the vegetatively growing mycelia as described by Rasmussen et al. (12Rasmussen C.D. Means R.L. Lu K.P. May G.S. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13767-13775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants of pCMKCdis were streaked three times to ensure strain purity followed by Southern analysis. pCMKB5′ was generated by blunt end ligation of theBamHI/ScaI fragment of cmkB into theSmaI site of pRG1. A. nidulans GR5 germlings were transformed with the disruption plasmid and selected according to the protocol followed for disruption of cmkC. The nuclear number was determined by growing spores in liquid minimal medium on glass coverslips at a spore concentration of 1 × 104 spores/ml. Germlings were collected by removing coverslips at various times followed by fixing and staining with the fluorescent dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as described by Harris et al. (19Harris S.D. Morrell J.L. Hamer J.E. Genetics. 1994; 136: 517-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-CMKB polyclonal antibodies were generated using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled hexa-histidine-tagged CMKB as the antigen. The coupled protein was injected into rabbits, and antiserum was harvested by standard techniques (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 92-137Google Scholar). Western blots were performed using a 1:3000 dilution of the anti-CMKB antibody and a similar dilution of IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Relative CMKB expression was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager equipped with a densitometer. Extracts for histone H1 kinase assays were prepared as described by Dayton et al. (3Dayton J.S. Sumi M. Nanthakumar N.N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3223-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Histone H1 kinase activity was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of the reactions. To identify novel CaM-binding proteins in A. nidulans, we used an expression-cloning strategy similar to the modified far-Western technique described by Stirling et al. (11Stirling D.A. Petrie A. Pulford D.J. Paterson D.T. Stark M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A primary screen of 4 × 105 phage plaques yielded more than 150 positives, 40 of which were chosen randomly for further characterization. To eliminate the cloning of known A. nidulansCa2+/CaM-binding proteins and to validate the primary screen, a secondary hybridization screen was performed using the cDNAs of both the known Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CMKA) and calcineurin (CnA). In this manner, 23 of the 40 positive clones were identified as CMKA or CnA. Of the remaining 17 plaques, 11 were predicted to encode three independent proteins, two protein kinases and a large coil/coil protein. The six remaining plaques either contained short or unique inserts. The two protein kinases identified (CMKB and CMKC) share homology with the protein kinases of the mammalian CaM kinase cascade. The sequence data for both CMKB and CMKC have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM data bases. The CMKB cDNA is predicted to encode a 404-amino acid protein. As shown in Fig. 1 A, CMKB maintains 67% amino acid identity with a predicted CaM kinase from the plant pathogenic fungusColletotrichum gloeosporioides (CMK) and 43% identity with CMKI of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. CMKB also shares appreciable identity with mammalian kinases, rat CaMKIV (34%) and rat CaMKI (35%). CMKB possesses a Thr residue at the identical position within the activation loop of the catalytic domain that is the site of the activating phosphorylation in mammalian CaMKs I and IV. Thus, based on the primary sequence, CMKB is an A. nidulans homologue of mammalian CaMKI and IV. The CMKC cDNA is predicted to encode a protein of 518 amino acids. CMKC is most homologous to the family of CaM kinase kinases, sharing 30 and 26% identity with rat CaMKKα and CaMKKβ, respectively. CMKC also retains high sequence homology with Caenorhabditis elegans CeCaMKK (24%) and S. pombe SspI (21%). Thus, based on primary sequence homology, CMKC is a member of a growing family of CaMKKs. Mammalian CaMKα/β activates CaMKI/IV by phosphorylation of a critical activation loop Thr (14Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Snyderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 15Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine whether CMKB and CMKC are biochemical homologues of CaMKI/IV and CaMKα/β, we analyzed bacterially expressed and purified CMKB and CMKC. As shown in Fig. 2 A, recombinant CMKB is dependent upon Ca2+/CaM for enzymatic activity. In the presence of Ca2+/CaM, the activity of CMKB is approximately 15 nmol/min/mg using ADR1G as a peptide substrate. Preincubation of CMKB with CMKC results in a 73-fold increase in the specific activity of CMKB (Fig. 2 B). The increase in protein kinase activity correlates with an increase in the phosphorylation state of CMKB (data not shown). Similar to CaMKs I and IV, mutation of the CMKB activation loop Thr to Ala (T179A) completely abrogates the ability of CMKC to activate CMKB (Fig. 2 B) and prevents CMKC-dependent phosphorylation (data not shown). Furthermore, the T179D mutation partially mimics T179 phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, like mammalian CaMKI and IV, CMKB requires both Ca2+/CaM and activation loop phosphorylation for maximal activity. To assess whether CMKB and CMKC are functionally interchangeable with the mammalian kinases in vitro, we measured the ability of the A. nidulans kinases to activate and be activated by the mammalian cascade members CaMKI and CaMKKβ. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 A, recombinant human CaMKI is activated approximately 17-fold by preincubation in the presence of rat CaMKKβ, Ca2+/CaM, and ATP. CMKC can functionally mimic CaMKKβ in activating CaMKI 8-fold compared with the unactivated kinase. Reciprocally, rat CaMKKβ weakly activates A. nidulans CMKB (Fig. 3 B). Collectively our in vitro biochemical analyses indicate CMKB and CMKC are A. nidulans homologues of the mammalian CaM kinase cascade members CaMKI/IV and CaMKKα/β, respectively. To assess the physiological role ofcmkB, we disrupted the gene by homologous recombination. The homologous integration of the cmkB disruption vector is diagramed in Fig. 4 A. We were unable to isolate any disruption strains despite screening more than 100 transformants (data not shown). Since A. nidulansnormally grows as a haploid organism, the disruption of an essential gene results in a non-viable spore; thus, if cmkB is required for proliferation, no viable homologous recombinants would be identified by this method. Because we could not generate a viable haploid ΔcmkB strain, we surmised that cmkB is essential for A. nidulans growth and attempted to disrupt cmkB in a heterokaryon. As diagrammed in Fig. 4 B, heterokaryons are generated by transforming conidia after the first DNA synthesis or by fusion of two non-viable germinating spores, and the subsequent transformants are maintained as multinucleate mycelia. Strains in which an essential gene is disrupted are forced to grow as heterokaryons because the wild-type nucleus maintains a copy of the essential gene, whereas the disrupted nucleus provides the selectable nutritional marker (absent in wild type). Southern analysis of greater than 75 transformed strains maintained as heterokaryons revealed 3 strains (one of which is depicted in Fig. 4 C) that yielded the expected Southern pattern representing both the wild-type cmkB locus and a cmkB locus disrupted by homologous integration of pCMKBdis. As depicted in Fig. 4 B, when ΔcmkB undergoes asexual reproduction, the resulting spores will each possess a single haploid nucleus with the following genotypes:pyr4+ cmkB− orpyr4− cmkB+. In the absence of uridine and uracil, fewer than 1% of the spores underwent nuclear division, whereas in the presence of these nutritional supplements, 48% of the spores germinated. These data indicatecmkB is essential in A. nidulans, since the only viable spores are those that contain wild-type cmkB grown under conditions in which the pyr4− genotype is not lethal. The presence of the wild-type cmkB locus and absence of the integrated pCMKBdis plasmid in these viable mycelia was confirmed by Southern blot (data not shown). Since CMKB appears to be essential, we generated an A. nidulans strain in which CMKB expression was slightly delayed due to the disruption of the endogenouscmkB promoter (dcmkB) (Fig. 5, A and B). As demonstrated in Fig. 5 C, the level of CMKB in the control strain (pAL5#10) is low at germination but after 1 h, CMKB begins to accumulate and continues to increase linearly up to 5 h, at which time a peak 5-fold increase in protein level is observed. However, CMKB expression is delayed in dcmkB relative to control by approximately 1 h. Once CMKB begins to accumulate, it does so linearly and reaches a comparable plateau after 6 h of growth. Presumably the CMKB expression in dcmkB is the result of read-through from an upstream promoter. Using dcmkB, we next examined the physiological consequences of delayed CMKB expression. To determine the effects of altered CMKB expression on the nuclear division cycle of A. nidulans, the number of germlings with two or more nuclei was determined for dcmkB and a nutritionally complemented control (pAL5#10) as a function of time after germination. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 A, pAL5#10 begins to undergo the first nuclear division before 6 h, and by 8 h after inoculation, nearly 100% of the control conidia have at least 2 nuclei. In contrast, dcmkB conidia are delayed approximately 2 h in the executing the first nuclear division. Thus, CMKB is required for the proper timing of the initial nuclear division after germination. To determine whether the delayed expression of CMKB affected only the first nuclear division or also subsequent divisions, we examined the ability of dcmkB to continue with the second nuclear division by scoring the percent germlings that, having undergone one nuclear division, proceed to accomplish subsequent divisions as indicated by the presence of four or more nuclei. As seen in Fig. 6 B, by 10 h of growth, all of the pAL5#10 spores have generated germlings with 4 or more nuclei. The absolute timing of initiation of the second nuclear division in dcmkB is delayed approximately 2 h in comparison with the controls, but the rate at which the germlings proceed with the second nuclear division is similar to that of the control. Thus, retarded CMKB expression upon germination affects only the rate of the first nuclear division cycle, not subsequent mitoses. To more finely probe CMKB function during germination, we investigated whether the lag in dcmkB germination is before activation of NIMXcdc2 . After germination the initiation of S-phase is dependent upon and indicated by the activation of theA. nidulans single cyclin-dependent kinase, NIMXcdc2 (21Osmani A.H. Peij N. Mischke M. O'Connell M.J. Osmani S.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1519-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Dayton J.S. Sumi M. Nanthakumar N.N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3223-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We assayed NIMXcdc2 activity during germination by precipitating the kinase with p13-agarose and measuring the ability of the complex to phosphorylate histone H1 in vitro. As demonstrated in Fig. 7, activity of NIMXcdc2 in the control strain is first evident after 5 h of growth and increases linearly through 7 h. However, when cmkB expression is delayed in dcmkB, NIMXcdc2 activation is also postponed. Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that cmkB plays an important role elsewhere in the nuclear division cycle, we conclude that CMKB is required for the normal temporal regulation of NIMXcdc2 activity before S-phase in A. nidulans. The disruption scheme for cmkC was similar to the original approach utilized for CMKB. In contrast to the pCMKBdis transformation, several strains were identified from the initial transformation of GR5 with pCMKCdis that yielded the Southern banding pattern predicted for homologous recombination. Fig. 8 Ashows a representative Southern blot of a single strain in which thecmkC locus has been disrupted. These results indicatecmkC is not required for the viability of A. nidulans. Since cmkC is not essential for growth of A. nidulans, we first sought to determine whether, in the absence of CMKC, we could detect the activity of other activating kinases in crude protein extract that might functionally complement the loss ofcmkC. Fig. 8 B demonstrates that crude protein extract from the parental GR5 strain can activate CMKB in vitro, whereas crude protein extract from ΔcmkC cannot. Although we cannot rule out the presence of an insoluble or developmentally regulated activating protein kinase, these results suggest cmkC is the predominant activating kinase of CMKB inA. nidulans. To assess the requirements for CMKC in the nuclear division cycle, we performed the same experiments as described for dcmkB. As demonstrated in Fig. 6 A, the timing of first nuclear division is dramatically delayed in the absence of CMKC as compared with the control. Surprisingly, approximately 30% of the germlings fail to undergo a single nuclear division within 20 h post-inoculation. Thus, like CMKB, CMKC is important for proper timing of the first nuclear division after germination. cmkC disruption alters not only the kinetics of the first nuclear division but also subsequent divisions (Fig. 6 B). The lag of the second nuclear division is observed by the reduced rate at which ΔcmkC germlings containing two nuclei accumulate four nuclei in comparison with the control. The extended duration of the second nuclear division in the absence of CMKC indicates thatcmkC is required for the proper temporal regulation of not only the first but also the subsequent nuclear divisions. To determine whether, similar to cmkB, cmkC function is required for the proper timing of DNA synthesis, we followed NIMXcdc2 activation upon germination. Fig. 7demonstrates that disruption of cmkC severely retards NIMXcdc2 activation by both delaying the onset of activation and dampening its maximal activity. The impaired activation of histone H1 kinase activity correlates with the severe delay in both the initiation of nuclear division and subsequent exponential growth. Thus, we conclude that CMKC plays a non-essential but important role during G1 after germination. Using an expression cloning strategy, we identified two novel Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases in A. nidulans. CMKB and CMKC are homologues of the mammalian CaMK cascade members, CaMKI/IV and CaMKKα/β, respectively. Although closely related to CaMKI and IV, CMKB shares highest identity with Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases of S. pombe (cmk1) and C. gloeosporioides (CMK), and each of these homologues possesses a Thr within its activation loop at the identical position as CMKB Thr-179, indicating they may also be subject to activating phosphorylation. The closest homologue of CMKC in lower eukaryotes is S. pombe ssp1. The identification of CMKB and CMKC and their predicted homologues in other fungal species suggest, similar to other signal transduction systems, the CaMK cascade is evolutionarily conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals. cmkB is the second essential CaMK identified in any system. The terminal phenotype of ΔcmkB spores indicates CMKB is required for an early step in the nuclear division cycle. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CMKB functions before the S-phase activation of NIMXcdc2 , after germination. A. nidulans CMKA, the other essential CaMK, is required for G2 progression (5Dayton J.S. Means A.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1511-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, two distinct CaMKs are essential for progression through G1 and G2 in A. nidulans. The requirement of CMKB in G1 is consistent with previous studies of CaM and CaMKs in other systems. The CaM inhibitor W-13 arrests mammalian cell cycle progression in at least two points during re-entry from G0 (22Chafouleas J.G. Lagace L. Bolton W.E. Boyd A.E. Means A.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the general CaMK inhibitor, KN-93, blocks cell proliferation before S phase in both cycling cells and those stimulated to enter the cell cycle from G0 (7Rasmussen G. Rasmussen C.

Our experiments in Aspergillus, which demonstrate that disabling CMKB disrupts entry into the cell cycle, attribute to CMKB, among the CaM kinases, an essential role in the transition of spores from quiescence into S-phase. Experiments are ongoing to determine whether the homologues of CMKB, CaMKs I/IV, are essential targets of CaM during G1 in mammalian cells. Although CMKC is not essential for proliferation, it does perform an important role in G1 progression after germination. However, if CMKB and CMKC comprise a linear kinase cascadein vivo, as suggested both by our in vitrobiochemical data and by the role of the two kinases at similar points in the cell cycle, it would be predicted that CMKC should also be essential for the nuclear division cycle. There are multiple explanations for this conundrum. The simplest explanation is that other protein kinases can perform the predicted function of CMKC in its absence. Although disruption of CMKC eliminates all activating activity in crude A. nidulans extract, we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that other kinases or CMKC isoforms capable of phosphorylating and activating CMKB are present in the fungus. Another possibility is that CMKB is not the relevant substrate for CMKCin vivo. The mammalian CaMKKs have been demonstrated to phosphorylate and activate both protein kinase B and AMP-activated protein kinase (23Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 24Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that in vivoCMKC possesses substrates other than CMKB that are important, but not essential, for G1 progression. Alternatively, activation loop phosphorylation of CMKB may not be required for CMKB functionin vivo. In vitro, bacterially expressed CaMKI, CaMKIV, and CMKB all possess significant kinase activity that is dramatically enhanced upon activation loop phosphorylation (25Picciotto M.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26512-26521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of CMKC, it is possible that the reduced but not abolished CMKB activity is sufficient to slowly drive the nuclear division cycle through the G1 in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation. Finally, Hook et al. (26Hook S.S. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20215-20222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have recently provided evidence that activation loop phosphorylation may not be required for CaMKI and IV activation but may instead alter their substrate specificity. If this is the case in vivo, the two kinases may form a cascade, but CMKC would not necessarily be essential for proliferation. For example, CMKB may possess an activation-independent substrate essential for G1progression and an activation-dependent substrate whose phosphorylation is not strictly required for G1 progression but that affects the kinetics of this cell cycle phase. Thus, the fact that CMKC is not essential for the nuclear division cycle in A. nidulans does not eliminate the possibility that CMKB and CMKC form a functional CaMK cascade in vivo. To investigate if CMKB and CMKC are epistatic, we attempted to functionally complement the absence of CMKC by ectopically expressing CMKB or CMKB T179D in ΔcmkC. CMKB T179D partially mimics T179 phosphorylation; therefore if CMKB and CMKC are members of a kinase cascade, we predicted that overexpression of wild-type CMKB or T179D would rescue the growth delay of ΔcmkC. However, neither enzyme complements the loss of CMKC in ΔcmkC. Furthermore, similar to S. pombe cmk1 (27Rasmussen C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 685-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), ectopic T179D expression lengthens the nuclear division cycle in both wild-type and ΔcmkC strains. Although these experiments failed to make clear whether CMKB and CMKC are components of a linear cascade in vivo, they do demonstrate the importance of the multiple modes of regulation of CMKB. Finally, overexpression of the wild-type enzyme has no effect on the nuclear division cycle, whereas expression of the artificially activated full-length protein is detrimental to growth. Consistent with our observations in A. nidulans, pharmacological inhibitors of both CaM and CaMK arrest mammalian cells in G1 before cdk activation. KN-93 arrests NIH 3T3 cells with reduced cdk4 and cdk2 activities attributed to a reduction in cyclinD1 levels and an increased association of p27kip with cdk2/cyclinE (9Morris T.A. DeLorenzo R.J. Tombes R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The CaM antagonist W13 also inhibits G1progression in normal rat kidney cells before cdk4 and cdk2 activation, but this CaM inhibition does not appear to affect cyclinD or -E protein levels. Instead Taules et al. (28Taules M. Rius E. Talaya D. Lopez-Girona A. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) demonstrate that in the presence of W13, cdk4/cyclinD1 is exclusively cytoplasmic rather than nuclear. Thus, the authors suggest that CaM directly or indirectly modulates cdk4 activity by regulating its nuclear localization. InAspergillus, W7 blocks germination before the activation of the S-phase cdk/cyclin complex, NIMXcdc2 /NIMEcyclinB (3Dayton J.S. Sumi M. Nanthakumar N.N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3223-3230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, NIMEcyclinB synthesis and/or the subcellular localization of NIMXcdc2 /NIMEcyclinB represent attractive targets of the CMKB and CMKC cascade in A. nidulans. We thank C. R. Kahl, K. E.

In HeLa cells synchronized by mitotic shake-off, Topo II mRNA levels increased 16-fold in late S to G2/M phases (14–18 h after plating) relative to G1 (6Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in Topo II mRNA level was associated with a significant increase in Topo II mRNA stability, but with only marginal changes in the transcription rate. The regulation of mRNA stability has emerged as an important control mechanism of gene expression. Although the mechanisms that alter mRNA stability of different genes have unique features, in general, sequences located in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and their interactions with specific proteins regulate mRNA stability (14Beelman C.A.

These observations suggest that ARE elements can be both positive and negative regulators of mRNA stability, depending on the sequence context in which the sequence elements are located and the precise protein composition of the RNA-protein complex. In addition, posttranslational modifications involving oxidation/reduction as well as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of AU-binding proteins have also been shown to affect ARE binding (23Zhang W.

Binding to cytokine and lymphokine mRNAs can be reversibly blocked by the thiol-oxidizing agent diamide but irreversibly inhibited by the thiol-alkylating agentN-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and enhanced by the thiol-reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) (31Malter J.S.

Thus, it is possible that subtle changes in redox potential during cell growth or in response to environmental stimuli may influence ARE-AU-binding protein binding and alter the stability of ARE-containing mRNA. We showed earlier that the cell cycle-coupled accumulation of Topo II mRNA levels is regulated by changes in mRNA stability (6Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study was designed to test the idea that Topo II gene expression during the cell cycle is regulated by 3′-UTR via interactions with redox-sensitive protein complexes. HeLa cell cultures, synchronization by selective detachment of mitotic cells, and flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle positions were performed following previously described procedures (6Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. Exponentially growing cells were synchronized by replacing the growth medium with medium containing 0.5% serum and serum-stimulated to reenter the cell cycle. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared following the method described by Konarska and Sharp (33Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In selected experiments, dithiothreitol (DTT) was omitted during the preparation of cytoplasmic extracts. For determining redox sensitivity in RNA-protein binding, protein extracts were treated with DTT, 2-ME, NEM, or diamide for 10 min at 25 °C prior to RNA-protein gel shift analysis. Three reporter constructs, (a) HΔTopo2, a truncated form of Topo II cDNA with the entire 3′-UTR (base pairs 1–3013 deleted), (b) HβgalSV40, β-galactosidase reporter gene fused with the SV40 3′-UTR at its 3′-end, and (c) HβgalTopo, β-galactosidase reporter fused with Topo II 3′-UTR at its 3′-end, were engineered. All three constructs were fused at the 5′-end with a 1.6-kb fragment containing 650 nucleotides (nt) of the Topo II promoter, first exon (21 nt), intron (860 nt), and the second exon (150 nt) (34Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.6-kb fragment was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from human genomic DNA (CLONTECH) using primer pairs 5′-−562GGGGCGGGGTTGAGGCAGATGCCAGAATCT−532-3′ and 5′-+150AGGTGTCTGGGCGGAGCAAAATATGTTCC+121-3′ (34Hochhauser D.

Plasmid HΔTopo2 when expressed will represent approximately a 2.2-kb Topo II reporter mRNA containing Topo II 3′-UTR at its 3′-end. For the HβgalSV40 plasmid, the TA-cloning vector containing the 650-nt Topo II promoter, first exon, intron, and the second exon was digested with SpeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and directionally cloned into a SmaI- andXhoI-digested pNASSβ reporter vector (CLONTECH). The plasmid DNA pNASSβ lacks eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences and contains E. coli β-galactosidase as the reporter. The resulting reporter construct when expressed will transcribe approximately a 3-kb β-galactosidase reporter mRNA with the SV40 3′-UTR at its 3′-end. In the third reporter construct HβgalTopo, the SV40 3′-UTR in HβgalSV40 plasmid DNA was removed by SalI andBamHI restriction enzyme digestion and replaced with aXhoI- and BamHI-digested Topo II 3′-UTR from the HΔTopo2 plasmid. The resulting reporter construct when expressed will represent approximately a 4-kb β-galactosidase reporter mRNA with Topo II 3′-UTR at its 3′-end. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells were stably transfected with plasmid DNAs pSVneo (CLONTECH) and HΔTopo2, HβgalTopo, or HβgalSV40 using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following a manufacturer-supplied protocol. Geneticin-resistant colonies were pooled and cultured in G418-containing medium. cDNA sequences representing various regions of Topo II 3′-UTR were amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction techniques from a plasmid containing the entire Topo II 3′-UTR (pTopUTR). Polymerase chain reaction products representing the proximal (nt 4495–4948), middle (nt 4772–5298), distal (nt 5093–5595), and overlapping (nt 4772–4948) regions of Topo II 3′-UTR (Fig. 2) were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into pGEM-T plasmid DNA (Promega). The fos-ARE plasmid (pfosARE) containing both AU-rich domains I and II was constructed by subcloning the fos 3′-UTR from the pBBB plasmid (20Chen C.Y.A. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) into pBS II SK(+). The plasmid containing the nonspecific β-galactosidase competitor was constructed by subcloning the coding sequence within theHpaI and ClaI restriction sites in pCMV plasmid (CLONTECH) into pBS II SK(+). Orientation and sequence of inserts were verified by dideoxy sequencing of both strands of DNA in each plasmid construct.Figure 2Several AU-rich elements are present in Topo II 3′-UTR.

Labeled riboprobes were transcribed by inclusion of [α-32P]-UTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the transcription reaction. RNA-protein gel mobility shift assay was performed following previously published methods (36Ross J. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. RNA-processing: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, London1994: 107-133Google Scholar). Briefly, protein extracts (15 μg) were incubated with radiolabeled riboprobes (1 × 105 cpm; approximately 1 ng of RNA) in 12 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 15 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT (unless specified otherwise), 1 μg/μl tRNA, 1 μg/μl heparin, 1 unit/μl RNasin, and 10% glycerol in a total volume of 20 μl for 20 min at 25 °C. For competition experiments, the protein extract was first incubated for 10 min at 25 °C with unlabeled competitor RNA (specific or nonspecific) or RNA homopolymers (poly(A), poly(C), poly(G), and poly(U)) prior to the addition of the radiolabeled transcript. Control reactions without competitors were sham-treated under identical conditions. For immunodepletion of AUF1, protein extracts were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with or without polyclonal antibody to AUF1 (23Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K.A. Schaefer W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and immune complexes were separated by protein A-Sepharose. An immunoblotting of the supernatants showed that, while AUF1 is present in the supernatant from the control reaction, it was absent in the immunodepleted supernatant (data not shown). Supernatants from control and immunodepleted extracts were used for RNA-protein gel mobility shift assay. RNA-protein binding reactions were treated with RNase T1 (5 units/reaction) and separated by electrophoresis on 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1.2 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.4. The RNA-protein complexes were analyzed by a PhosphorImager (STORM 840, Molecular Dynamics). RNA-protein binding reactions as described above were UV-irradiated (2500 μJ for 3 min) and incubated with RNase A (0.2 μg/μl) and RNase T1 (10 units) at 37 °C for 20 min. Protein samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel along with prestained protein molecular size markers (Life Technologies) and visualized by exposing the dried gel to a PhosphorImager screen.

Intracellular reduced and oxidized glutathione as well asN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) levels were assayed following previously published protocols (39Blackburn R.V. Spitz D.R. Liu X. Galoforo S.S.

Cell pellets were homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1.34 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. Total glutathione content was determined by the method of Anderson (41Anderson M.E. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research.

Reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were distinguished by the addition of 2 μl of a 1:1 mixture of 2-vinylpyridine and ethanol per 30 μl of sample. NAC levels in cells were measured following derivatization with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide using a 15-cm C18 Reliasil column (Column Engineering, Ontario, CA) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescent detection (40Ridnour L.A. Winters R.A. Ercal N. Spitz D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All biochemical determinations were normalized to the protein content of whole cell homogenates using the method of Lowry et al. (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells synchronized by mitotic shake-off were replated and harvested at representative times for measurement of prooxidant production (39Blackburn R.V. Spitz D.R. Liu X. Galoforo S.S. Sim J.E.

Cells were spun down, and the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose at 37 °C. Samples were labeled with 10 μl of 1 mg/ml C-400, an oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and then placed on ice immediately. Labeled samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (excitation at 488 nm, emission at 535 ± 10 nm); 20,000 cells from each sample were analyzed to obtain mean fluorescence intensity and corrected for autofluorescence obtained from samples of unlabeled cells. The variations in mean fluorescence intensity during the cell cycle were calculated relative to early G1 cells (2 h after mitotic shake-off). To determine if the 3′-UTR of Topo II mRNA has a role in cell cycle-specific increase in Topo II mRNA levels, reporter assays in stably transfected 3T3 cells were performed. Stably transfected cells containing HΔTopo2, HβgalTopo, or HβgalSV40 reporter constructs were synchronized by serum starvation and serum stimulation to reenter the cell cycle. Cells were harvested at various times for analysis of cell cycle position and reporter mRNA levels. Representative univariant flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle positions in HΔTopo2 transfected cells are presented in Table I. Results presented in Table Iindicate that the majority of the cells were in G1 (80%) at the time of serum stimulation (0 h), and 58% of cells were in S phase at 16 h after serum stimulation. The fraction of cells in S phase increased to 76% by 20 h, and approximately 20–30% of the cells entered G2/M at 24 h after serum stimulation. Similar results were obtained for HβgalTopo- or HβgalSV40-transfected cells and were comparable with untransfected control cells (data not shown), demonstrating that expression of the reporter constructs did not affect cell cycle transit. When the total cellular RNA from the HΔTopo2-transfected cell populations was analyzed by Northern blotting, an mRNA band of approximately 2.2 kb, representing the HΔTopo2 reporter construct, was detected with a radiolabeled probe specific for the human Topo II cDNA (Fig. 1 A). HΔTopo2 reporter mRNA levels were low in G1 (0–12 h poststimulation) and increased 12–16-fold at mid-S to G2 phases (16–24 h poststimulation). These results were comparable with our previously published results obtained with mitotically selected HeLa cells (6Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and indicated that the truncated Topo II cDNA reporter construct contains sequence element(s) regulating Topo II mRNA levels. Since the HβgalTopo reporter mRNA levels (Fig. 1 C) also showed similar cell cycle-coupled variations (as compared with HΔTopo2), we concluded that sequences within the open reading frame of Topo II are not involved in the regulation of mRNA levels. Therefore, the increase in HΔTopo2 and HβgalTopo reporter mRNA levels might be regulated either by changes in the Topo II promoter activity or by a combination of promoter activity and posttranscriptional regulation governed by the Topo II 3′-UTR. Results from the HβgalSV40 reporter construct (Fig. 1 C), which contains the Topo II promoter but not the 3′-UTR, showed a 6–8-fold decrease in HβgalSV40 mRNA levels compared with HβgalTopo mRNA levels during 20–24 h poststimulation. The low level of HβgalSV40 mRNA during 20–24 h poststimulation can be attributed to the 2-fold increase in Topo II transcription that has been reported previously to occur during late S phase by us (6Goswami P.C. Roti Roti J.L. Hunt C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1500-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other investigators (34Hochhauser D. Stanway C.A. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

Results from a representative Northern blot measuring the variations in endogenous Topo II mRNA levels are shown in Fig. 1 B. The kinetics of endogenous Topo II mRNA accumulation was comparable to reporter mRNA levels during the cell cycle. Overall, these results demonstrate that Topo II 3′-UTR has a regulatory role in accumulation of Topo II mRNA levels during the mammalian cell cycle.Table ICell cycle phase distribution in HΔTopo2-transfected NIH 3T3 cells synchronized by serum starvation and serum-stimulated to reenter the cell cyclePhaseCells in each phase of the cell cycle0 h6 h16 h20 h24 h%%%%%G18082351428S87587643G2 + M121171029 Open table in a new tab A complete sequence analysis of the Topo II 3′-UTR was performed to determine if sequences known to regulate mRNA levels are present in the 3′-UTR. The hTopo2 plasmid (35Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Liu L.F. Liu A.A. Tewey K.M. Whang-Peng J. Knutsen T. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence analysis showed that the Topo II mRNA has a long (∼1.1-kb) 3′-UTR with several ARE motifs (four AUUUA, one AUUUUA, and one AUUUUUA; Fig. 2) present throughout the 3′-UTR. These results suggest that AREs in Topo II 3′-UTR could participate in the regulation of Topo II mRNA levels during the cell cycle. Because protein binding to 3′-UTR has been shown to regulate mRNA levels (23Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K.A. Schaefer W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), an in vitroRNA-protein binding assay was performed to determine if cellular proteins bind to the Topo II 3′-UTR. A series of overlapping [32P]UTP-labeled riboprobes representing the proximal, middle, and distal regions of Topo II 3′-UTR mRNA were transcribedin vitro and incubated with cellular protein extracts prepared from asynchronously growing HeLa cells. RNA-protein complex formation was analyzed by gel mobility shift assay. Results presented in Fig. 3 show that the mobility of all three transcripts was retarded in their migration when compared with the control reaction that did not contain the protein extract (comparelane 1 with lane 2,lane 6 with lane 7, andlane 12 with lane 13). The retardation in mobility was due to an RNA-protein interaction because proteinase K treatment of cellular extracts prior to the binding assay abolished the retardation (lane 11). To analyze the specificity of the RNA-protein complex, competition experiments were performed. The RNA-protein binding assay was carried out in the presence of an unlabeled specific competitor or a nonspecific competitor RNA (β-galactosidase). The addition of a 1-fold excess of specific unlabeled competitor RNA had a minimal effect on RNA-protein complex formation (lanes 3, 8, and14). However, a 10-fold excess of specific unlabeled proximal and middle transcripts decreased the RNA-protein complex formation by more than 90% (lanes 4 and9). In contrast, a similar 10-fold excess of the unlabeled distal transcript did not compete with the labeled distal transcript for complex formation. A 10-fold excess of the nonspecific competitor RNA (β-galactosidase) caused no change in complex formation (lanes 5, 10, and 16). These results demonstrate that protein binding to both the proximal and middle portions of the Topo II 3′-UTR is specific in contrast to nonspecific binding to the distal region. Alternatively, the protein(s) bound to the distal region could be highly abundant and therefore might not be competed away under these conditions. To further localize the sequence region involved in Topo II 3′-UTR RNA-protein complex formation, cross-competition assays were performed in the presence of unlabeled transcripts from the proximal or the middle region. Cellular proteins bound to labeled proximal transcript could be competed more than 90"

We report here the identification of an additional GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase that is homolgous to HNK-1 ST and to the chondroitin 4-sulfotransferases.

These structures play a critical role in the biology of LH because they are recognized by a specific receptor, the Man/GalNAc-4-SO4 receptor located in hepatic endothelial cells (11Fiete D. Srivastava V. Hindsgaul O. Baenziger J.U. Cell. 1991; 67: 1103-1110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) that regulates the circulatory half-life of LH (10Baenziger J.U. Kumar S. Brodbeck R.M. Smith P.L. Beranek M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In conjunction with the stimulated release from dense core storage granules in gonadotrophs, the short half-life accounts for the episodic rise and fall in circulating LH levels. This is essential for activation of the LH receptor because of rapid down-regulation of the activated receptor by β-arrestin (14Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V. Benovic J.L. Banga J.P. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An indication of the importance of these structures is their presence on glycoprotein hormones of all vertebrate species from fish to man (20Manzella S.M. Dharmesh S.M. Beranek M.C. Swanson P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21665-21671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For this to occur, key features of the GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase as well as the hormone-specific GalNAc-transferase and the recognition determinant utilized by the GalNAc-transferase all had to be conserved throughout vertebrate evolution.Even though GalNAc-4-ST1, C4ST-1, C4ST-2, and HNK-1 ST are structurally related, there are numerous differences in their amino acid sequences. GalNAc-4-ST1 has a higher percentage of identical residues to C4ST-1 (28% identical) and C4ST-2 (26% identical) than to HNK-1 ST (23% identical) based on the alignment shown in Fig. 2. Thus, GalNAc-4-ST1 is structurally more closely related to C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 than to HNK-1 ST. These structural relationships are reflected in the respective functional activities of these sulfotransferases. GalNAc-4-ST1, C4ST-1, and C4ST-1 transfer sulfate to the 4 position of β1,4-linked GalNAc but are not able to transfer sulfate to β1,3-linked GlcA. Conversely, HNK-1 ST transfers sulfate to the 3 position of β1,3-linked GlcA but not to β1,4-linked GalNAc. The structural relationship of GalNAc-4-ST1, C4ST-1, and C4ST-2 to HNK-1 ST is surprising in light of the marked differences in their specificities. Understanding the structural basis for these differences will clearly be of interest.GalNAc-4-ST1 can account for the addition of sulfate to the terminal GalNAc on glycoprotein hormone N-linked oligosaccharides. Even though GalNAc-4-ST1 is homologous to C4ST-1, GalNAc-4-ST1 in cell extracts shows exclusive specificity for GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα-MCO. In contrast, truncated forms of GalNAc-4-ST1 transfer sulfate to chondroitin as well as to GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα-MCO. This indicates that the amino-terminal 118 amino acids dictate the specificity of GalNAc-4-ST1 for GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα-MCO. We are currently examining the sulfated chondroitin products obtained with truncated forms of GalNAc-4-ST1 to determine if sulfate is transferred to terminal or internal GalNAc residues or to both. Transfer to GalNAcβ1,4GlcAβ, located at the non-reducing terminus of chondroitin, would suggest that the first 118 amino acids allow GalNAc-4-ST1 to discriminate between an underlying GlcNAc and GlcA residue. Transfer to internal GalNAc residues in chondroitin would suggest the first 118 amino acids prevent recognition of GalNAc that is not located at a non-reducing terminus.GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase activity has been detected in the pituitaries of all vertebrate species examined to date (20Manzella S.M. Dharmesh S.M. Beranek M.C. Swanson P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21665-21671Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as would be required by the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence SO4-4-GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα on their glycoprotein hormones. We have identified a homologous sequence that is 78% identical to human GalNAc-4-ST1 over a 198-amino acid sequence in a 592 bp cDNA obtained from a Xenopus egg library (GenBankTM accession number AW641290), suggesting that a transferase with the same activity and specificity as human GalNAc-4-ST1 is indeed expressed by amphibians. This would support our hypothesis that the sulfated oligosaccharides on Xenopusglycoprotein hormones also serve to regulate their circulatory half-life. If this is the case, the hormone-specific β1,4-GalNAc-transferase and the GalNAc-4-SO4-specific receptor should also be present in Xenopus.GalNAc-4-ST1 is expressed in multiple regions of the brain. The highest level of expression is in the pituitary, where at least three glycoproteins are known to bear oligosaccharides with terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4: LH, thyrotropin, and pro-opiomelanocortin. Since these glycoproteins are major synthetic products of gonadotroph, thyrotroph, and corticotroph cells, the three major cell types in the anterior pituitary, high levels of GalNAc-4-ST1 are expected in the pituitary. The amount of LH synthesized changes in gonadotrophs in response to estrogen during the ovulatory cycle in mammals. The levels of hormone-specific GalNAc-transferase changes in parallel to those of LH (56Dharmesh S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11127-11131Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Since the terminal GalNAc on theN-linked oligosaccharides of LH and other glycoproteins can also be modified with terminal α2,6-linked sialic acid (3Stockell Hartree A. Renwick A.G.C. Biochem.

Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the levels of GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase as well as α2,6-sialyltransferase may determine which structure is ultimately present on LH and other glycoproteins bearing such oligosaccharides. This would have a profound impact on both the rate and the site of clearance for LH. As a result, understanding the regulation of GalNAc-4-ST1 expression within the three types of anterior pituitary cells will be of considerable importance.We have previously shown that expression of the hormone-specific β1,4-GalNAc-transferase is highly regulated in vivo. Expression of the β1,4-GalNAc-transferase is hormonally regulated in the pituitary (56Dharmesh S.M. Baenziger J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11127-11131Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and developmentally regulated in the rat placenta (57Manzella S.M. Dharmesh S.M. Cohick C.B. Soares M.J. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In each instance that high levels of β1,4-GalNAc-transferase have been detected, specific glycoproteins bearing a recognition determinant and β1,4-linked GalNAc have been identified. Co-ordinate expression of the protein-specific β1,4-GalNAc-transferase and GalNAc-4-ST1 will result in the specific modification of those glycoproteins that bear a peptide sequence recognized by the β1,4-GalNAc-transferase. We have previously determined that glycoprotein hormone-specific β1,4-GalNAc-transferase activity and GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase activity are present in regions of the brain other than the pituitary (21Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17096-17102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of GalNAc-4-ST1 message in both fetal brain and in various regions of the central nervous system suggests that N-linked structures terminating with β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 will be present on specific glycoproteins. Like HNK-1, structures terminating with β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 may play a role in development of the nervous system and processes requiring specific recognition in the adult brain. The expression of GalNAc-4-ST1 in a number of tissues as well as in fetal brain strongly supports our proposal that the tightly regulated synthesis of structures with terminal β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4 in a number of different settings will be utilized for diverse biologic functions requiring recognition. The pituitary hormones LH,1 thyrotropin, and pro-opiomelanocortin bear unique N-linked oligosaccharides that terminate with the sequence SO4-4-GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα (1Baenziger J.U. Green E.D.

Three key functions have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution: 1) the peptide recognition determinant utilized by the GalNAc-transferase, 2) the GalNAc-transferase itself, and 3) the GalNAc-4-sulfotransferase.

Using a combined cDNA and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction cloning strategy, we have isolated from Jurkat T cells a 2.5-kilobase cDNA, hSK2, encoding the human isoform of SK2 channels. Northern blot analysis reveals the presence of a 2.5-kilobase hSK2 transcript in Jurkat T cells. While present in various human tissues, including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver, no hSK2 mRNA could be detected in resting and activated normal human T cells. ThehSK2 gene is encoded by 8 exons and could be assigned to chromosome 5 (q21.2-q22.1). The protein encoded by hSK2 is 579 amino acids long and exhibits 97% identity with its rat counterpart rSK2. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells,hSK2 produces Ca2+-activated K+currents with a unitary conductance of 9.5 pS and aK0.5 for calcium of 0.7 μm; hSK2 currents are inhibited by apamin, scyllatoxin, andd-tubocurarine. Overexpression of the Src family tyrosine kinase p56lck in Jurkat cells, up-regulates SK2 currents by 3-fold. While IKCa channels are transcriptionally induced upon activation of normal human T cells, our results show that in Jurkat cells SK2 channels are constitutively expressed and down-regulated following mitogenic stimulation.

SK channels are also expressed in a wide variety of peripheral tissues including adrenal cortex, liver, skeletal, and smooth muscles as well as leukemic Jurkat T cells (8–19). Human T lymphocytes are endowed with at least two different types of K+ channels, voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv) and KCa channels (for review, see Ref. 20Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev.

The prominent KCa channel expressed in the human leukemic Jurkat T cell line corresponds to an apamin-sensitive, small-conductance channel (4–7 pS) (16Grissmer S. Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Hanselmann C. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recent work (29Jager H. Adelman J.P. Grissmer S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that SK2 encodes this KCa current based on the PCR amplification of a partial Jurkat SK2 cDNA fragment. Three genes encoding SK channel family members have been cloned from human (hSK1) and rat brains (rSK2 andrSK3) (30Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). These different isoforms encode the pore-forming α subunit of SK channels and exhibit a high degree of sequence identity with 70–80% amino acid sequence identity.

Some cloned isoforms of SK channels are blocked by apamin and by d-tubocurarine (dTC), a plant alkaloid (29Jager H. Adelman J.P. Grissmer S.

The residues Asp341 and Asn368 on either side of the deep pore of the α subunit were shown to be the primary determinants of apamin and dTC sensitivity (35Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol.

In this study, we cloned from human Jurkat T cells a 2.5-kb full-length cDNA, hSK2, encoding the human isoform of SK2 channels. While hSK2 transcripts are found in various human tissues, including brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver, nohSK2 mRNA could be detected in normal human T cells. Based on high-throughput genome sequence analysis (HTGS), we show that the hSK2 gene is encoded by 8 exons and could be assigned to human chromosome 5 (q21.2-q22.1). Similar to native Jurkat KCa currents, hSK2 produces in transfected mammalian cells a time- and voltage-independent Ca2+-activated K+current which is inhibited by apamin, scyllatoxin, and dTC. In Jurkat cells overexpressing the Src family tyrosine kinase p56lck (LCK+), the SK2 channel activity increases by more than 3-fold. In contrast to IKCa channels which are transcriptionally induced upon activation of normal human T cells, our data show that in Jurkat cells, SK2 channels are constitutively expressed and are down-regulated following mitogenic stimulation. Human leukemic Jurkat T cells and the p56lck -deficient Jurkat cells (LCK−) were maintained in RPMI culture medium supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The p56lck -overexpressing Jurkat cells (LCK+) were generated from LCK− cells which were re-transfected with p56lck tyrosine kinase and were maintained in the above medium supplemented with hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 100 μg/ml). Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mmglutamine, 8% horse serum, 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. HEK 293 and CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Human leukemic T cell line Jurkat, LCK−, LCK+, hSK2-transfected CHO and HEK 293 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips settled on a 1.5-ml chamber, mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 35 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss). Recordings were made at 22 ± 1 °C, using patch pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (fiber filled) with resistance of 4–8 mΩ. Patch clamp recordings were performed using standard techniques (38Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). For whole cell patch clamp recordings, two different solutions were used, external high [K+] and physiological solutions. In the external high K+ solutions, the patch pipette contained (in mm): 135 K aspartate, 40 KOH, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, and 8.7 CaCl2 (1 μm free Ca2+) adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH, while the bath solution contained (in mm): 165 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. For the physiological solutions, the patch pipette contained (in mm): 110 K gluconate, 20 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 KATP, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, and 4.7 CaCl2 (1 μm free Ca2+) adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH, while the bath solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 11 glucose, and 5.5 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. For inside-out patch clamp recording, the pipette solution (out) contained (in mm): 144 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH and 2 mm sucrose; the bath solution (in) contained (in mm): 150 KCl, 40 KOH, 1 MgCl2, 8.2 CaCl2 (0.77 μm free Ca2+), 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. Solutions were adjusted with sucrose at ∼300–315 mosmol liter−. Series resistance were compensated by 85–95%. Signals were amplified using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) and filtered at 1–2 KHz, via a 4-pole Bessel filter. Data were sampled at 2.5–10 KHz and analyzed using pClamp 6.0.2 software (Axon Instruments) on an IBM-compatible 486 computer interfaced with DigiData 1200 (Axon Instruments). Further data analysis was done using Axograph 3.0 software (Axon Instruments) and Excel 5.0 (MicroSoft) on an Apple MacIntosh computer. Cells were harvested and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and were then resuspended (1.5 × 107 cells/ml) in cold homogeneization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were homogenized with a Teflon glass homogenizer and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min (at 4 °C) to remove large cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min (at 4 °C) and the membrane pellet (crude membrane fraction) was resuspended in cold homogeneization buffer and sonicated for 30 s. The membrane homogenates were then aliquoted, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until use. Western blots were performed as described (39Sobko A. Peretz A. Attali B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4723-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-rat SK2 antibodies and anti-human Kv1.3 antibodies (Alomone labs) were used at 1.5 μg/ml. For electrophysiological recording, CHO and HEK 293 cells were transfected with hSK2 subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded (5.104cells/well) on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 24-multiwell plates. Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE and 0.25 μg of hSK2-pCDNA3 together with 0.5 μg of pIRES-CD8 (kindly provided by Drs. J. Barhanin and A. Patel, CNRS, Sophia Antipolis, France), as a marker for transfection. Transfected cells were visualized 48 h following transfection, using the anti-CD8 (Dynal) antibody-coated beads method (40Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from Jurkat T cells was isolated as described (41Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) and poly(A+) RNA was isolated using oligo(dT)-Sepharose (Collaborative Research). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA or 250 ng of poly(A+) RNA using 200 units of Superscript IITM RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was primed either with the tagged oligo(dT) primer 5′-CCAGTGAGCAGAGTGACGAGGACTCGAGCTCAAGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′ or with random primers. The single-stranded cDNA was used as a template for PCR. Degenerate primers were designed on the basis of the homology between the different SK channel isoforms: rSK1, rSK2, rSK3, and hSK1. The primers 5′-ATHTTYGGNATGTTYGGNA-3′ (primer A) and 5′-CCACATNGCNCCNARRAARTT-3′ (primer B), were used to PCR amplify from Jurkat T cells the initial 633-bp fragment ofhSK2. All PCR reactions were performed using the proof reading Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). The sequence was further extended by a 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR cloning strategy (42Frohman M.A. Dieffenbach C.W. Dreksler G.S. PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 381-409Google Scholar) and a poly(A)-tailed cDNA fragment of 2166 bp length was obtained. A blastn search of the GenBankTM data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information was performed. Human expressed sequence tags overlapping the 5′ (EST: AI339865 and AI271784) and 3′ (EST: AI700829and AI680869) untranslated regions of our 2166-bp cDNA were found. The EST AI339865 further extended the 5′-UTR sequence by 343 bp. The whole cDNA sequence of 2509 bp was amplified by RT-PCR from Jurkat mRNA confirming the co-linearity of the overlapping cDNA fragments. Human 12-lane multiple tissue and Human Cancer Cell Line MTNTM blots (CLONTECH) were used. For Jurkat cells, 5 μg of mRNA were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1 mformaldehyde, 1% agarose gel and then blotted overnight onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham) in 20 × SSC (3 m sodium chloride, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0). The Northern blots were probed with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 660-bp DNA probe spanning the extreme C-terminal region (including the 3′-UTR) of thehSK2 cDNA. Another 5′ specific hSK2 probe which consisted in the whole 456-bp 5′-UTR, was used to check the specificity of the Northern signals. Hybridization was carried out at 68 °C for 1 h using the solutions (CLONTECH) and according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). Signal was visualized with a PhosphorImager 445 SI, after 16–23 h exposure. Jurkat T cells are known to express both Kv and SK currents (16Grissmer S. Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Hanselmann C. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To identify SK currents, we used the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. SK channels were activated by employing a high capacity Ca2+-buffered pipette solution at free [Ca2+]i of 1 μm. Currents were recorded in external high K+ solutions (165 mm K+, see “Experimental Procedures”), using voltage ramps of 400 ms from −160 to +40 mV, to identify both Kv and SK currents (Fig. 1, A andB). Under these experimental conditions, Kv currents activated at potentials positive to −40 mV leading to inward currents below and outward currents above 0 mV. SK currents were clearly identified at potentials below −50 mV, as the SK channel slope conductance increased at negative potentials, while that of Kv is minimal. Similar Kv and SK current components were previously described using the same recording solutions (16Grissmer S. Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Hanselmann C. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 D shows the same SK current recorded, using a different protocol in which cells were stepped from −120 to −10 mV from a 0-mV holding potential. Note that at very negative potentials, the SK current is partially contaminated by the deactivating tail of the Kv1.3 current which does not totally inactivate at a holding potential of 0 mV. In agreement with previous work (17Hanselmann C. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we found that apamin (5 nm) and dTC (10 μm) inhibit Jurkat SK currents by 70% (Fig. 1,A-C). In contrast, this current is insensitive to 100 nm CTX and 100 nm DTX (data not shown).Figure 1Pharmacology of SK currents in Jurkat cells. A and B, ramp currents before and after 5 nm apamin (A) and 10 μmdTC (B). From a holding potential of 0 mV, cells were subjected to a ramp of 400 ms from −160 to +40 mV. The dotted line represents the zero current level. C, current amplitude as measured at −140 mV (pA ± S.E.) in cells before (control, n = 22) and after exposure to apamin (5 nm, n = 13) and dTC (10 μm,n = 10). Results are statistically significant (*p < 0.01). D, from a holding potential of 0 mV, cells were stepped for 100 ms from −120 to −10 mV in 10-mV increments. SK currents were recorded in external high K+solutions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify unambiguously the molecular isoform encoding the Jurkat SK channel, degenerate primers were designed based on the homology existing between the previously cloned SK channels rSK1, rSK2, rSK3, andhSK1 (30Kohler M. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T. Kinzie J.M. Marrion N.V. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) and an RT-PCR was performed. The primers spanning the middle of the S1 segment (primer A) and the N-terminal boundary of the pore domain (primer B, see Fig. 2 and “Experimental Procedures”) amplified an initial cDNA fragment of 633 bp, which was highly homologous to rSK2. The sequence was further extended by a 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR cloning strategy (42Frohman M.A. Dieffenbach C.W. Dreksler G.S. PCR Primer, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 381-409Google Scholar) and a poly(A)-tailed cDNA fragment of 2166 bp length was obtained. A blastn search of the GenBankTM data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information was performed. A human expressed sequence tag (EST AI339865) overlapping the 5′-untranslated region of our 2166-bp cDNA was found. This EST further extended the 5′-UTR sequence by 343 bp. The whole cDNA sequence of 2509 bp was amplified by RT-PCR from Jurkat mRNA and sequenced, confirming the co-linearity of the overlapping cDNA fragments. Thus, the whole cDNA obtained (2509 bp) probably corresponds to the full-length mRNA in Jurkat T cells since in Northern blots, a 2.5-kb transcript was detected (Fig. 3 A). Neither SK1 nor SK3 could be amplified from Jurkat cDNA (Ref. 29Jager H. Adelman J.P. Grissmer S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, and not shown).Figure 3Northern blot analysis of hSK2transcripts. A, a 5′ specific hSK2probe which consisted in the whole 456-bp 5′-UTR was used for the Northern blot analysis in different human tissues (left panel), in Jurkat T cells (middle panel), and different tumorigenic cell lines (right panel). B, a human β-actin probe was used as a standard positive control to re-probe the blots after stripping for input mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Jurkat cDNA which we termed hSK2, corresponds to the human isoform of the rat rSK2 sequence. It comprises an open reading frame of 1737 bp (nucleotide position 457–2193), a 456-bp 5′-UTR and a 333-bp 3′-UTR ended with a polyadenylation signal and a poly(A+) tail. The putative initiation codon has a Kozak consensus sequence GCCATGA (43Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar), although we did not detect an in-frame stop codon upstream the initiator ATG (nucleotide position 457). The protein encoded by hSK2 is 579 amino acids long and exhibits 97% identity with its rat protein counterpartrSK2 (Fig. 2). Except for the N terminus which exhibits minor differences between hSK2 and rSK2 (amino acids 51–54 and 99–102), the protein sequences are virtually identical for both species (Fig. 2). The predicted hSK2 protein contains several consensus cAMP-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase II and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at the N and C termini. Like rSK2, hSK2 does not possessN-glycosylation sites at predicted extracellular locations. Northern blot analysis performed in various human tissues reveals a major 2.5-kb hSK2 transcript in Jurkat T cells, liver, kidney, and brain with the strongest signals in liver and brain (Fig. 3 A). Higher molecular weight transcripts (4.4 kb) were found in heart and skeletal muscle, while a lower mRNA species (1.3 kb) was also observed in brain and liver (Fig. 3 A). The 4.4-kb transcript may represent a cross-reactive mRNA species from the SK channel family although a 5′ specifichSK2 probe which consisted in the whole 456-bp 5′-UTR, was used to check the specificity of the Northern signals (Fig. 3 A). No detectable transcripts were observed in small intestine, placenta, lung, thymus, spleen, and normal peripheral T cells (Fig. 3 A and see also, Fig. 7 C). Interestingly, hSK2 is expressed in melanocytes (ESTAA418096) and fetal heart (EST AA418000). Since hSK2 is not expressed in normal spleen, thymus, and peripheral T cells, we checked for the presence of hSK2 mRNA in some human tumor cell lines to test whether the expression of SK2 is a marker of certain T-cell malignancies. No hSK2 transcript was detected in promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, HeLa S3, chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562, lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4, Burkitt's lymphoma Raji, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung carcinoma A549, and melanoma G-361 cells (Fig. 3 A). A recent study showed that these tumorigenic cell lines express hIKCa1 channel mRNA (44Ghanshani S. Wulff H. Miller M.J. Rohm H. Neben A. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37137-37149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of hSK2 seems to be specific to the leukemic Jurkat T cells. The phylogenetic relationships of 23 different SK and IK channel GenBankTM entries and of hSK2 were examined (Fig. 4 A). The amino acid sequence alignment of the complete open reading frames of all 23 genes was performed using the software ClustalX. The unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method after exclusion of gaps. The tree file was plotted using the software NJplot. Horizontal branch lengths are drawn to scale, with the bar indicating 0.05 amino acid substitution per site. The SK and IK channel genes are divided into two main clusters, one of the SK channel family and the other of the IK channel family with high bootstrap values Fig. 4 A). The SK channel family cluster is further subdivided into two clusters with SK2 and SK3 isoforms in one cluster and the SK1 isoforms in the other cluster. The IK family genes are subdivided into two main clusters, with the murine/rodent and human IK genes falling into two different groups (Fig. 4 A). Although we did not experimentally examine the human chromosomal localization of hSK2, a Blastn search at the GenBankTM via the HTGS identified three matching human chromosome 5 contigs (AC010595, AC021085, and AC025761), suggesting that hSK2 maps to human chromosome 5. Furthermore, we performed an electronic PCR scanning the sequence of these three chromosome 5 contigs in dbSTS data base. The contigsAC021085 and AC025761 retrieved one STS, D5S2065 (GenBankTMaccession number Z54068). On the Marshfield map, D5S2065 is mapped to chromosome 5 at position 122.01 (centimorgan). On the WI-YAC and genethon maps, D5S2065 is assigned to chromosome 5 at positions 389 (ordinal) and 121.70 (centimorgan), respectively. On the cytogenetic map, the D5S2065 STS is mapped to chromosome 5 between the cytogenetic markers 5q21.2 and 5q22.1 (Fig. 4 B). In the vicinity of this locus, are found the genes encoding the polysialytransferase, mannosidase, the fer tyrosine kinase, Ca2+-calmodulin kinase type IV, and the adenomatous polyposis coli gene which is responsible for colorectal cancers. However, in the OMIM map no obvious diseases seem to be linked to thehSK2/KCNN2 locus. Exploiting the"

Studies have shown that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are among the ligand-gated ion channels affected by prenatal ethanol exposure. We exposed pregnant dams to an ethanol-containing liquid diet that results in blood ethanol levels near the legal intoxication limit in most states (0.08%). Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from the neonatal offspring of these dams, and NMDA receptor function was assessed by patch clamp electrophysiological techniques after 6–7 days in culture in ethanol-free media. Unexpectedly, we did not detect any changes in hippocampal NMDA receptor function at either the whole-cell or single-channel levels. However, we determined that fetal alcohol exposure alters the actions of the neurosteroids pregnenolone sulfate and pregnenolone hemisuccinate, which potentiate NMDA receptor function. Western immunoblot analyses demonstrated that this alteration is not due to a change in the expression levels of NMDA receptor subunits. Importantly, in utero ethanol exposure did not affect the actions of neurosteroids that inhibit NMDA receptor function. Moreover, the actions of pregnenolone sulfate on type A γ-aminobutyric acid and non-NMDA receptor function were unaltered by ethanol exposure in utero, which suggests that the alteration is specific to NMDA receptors. These findings are significant because they provide, at least in part, a plausible mechanistic explanation for the alterations in the behavioral responses to neurosteroids found in neonatal rats prenatally exposed to ethanol and to other forms of maternal stress (Zimmerberg, B., and McDonald, B.

These effects range from isolated alcohol-related birth defects to a combination of abnormalities that characterize the fetal alcohol syndrome (1Larkby C. Day N. Alcohol Health Res. World. 1997; 21: 192-198PubMed Google Scholar). This syndrome is characterized by alterations in growth, facial and skull development, and central nervous system function. Fetal ethanol exposure produces long-lasting and debilitating neurobehavioral and neurophysiological dysfunctions such as deficits in learning, memory, information processing, and problem solving skills (2Streissguth A.P. Bookstein F.L. Sampson P.D. Barr H.M. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 1989; 11: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Mattson S.N. Riley E.P. Delis D.C. Stern C. Jones K.L. Alcohol Clin. Exp.

Retard. 1998; 103: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is considerable interest in understanding the consequences of the teratogenic actions of ethanol in the central nervous system. Research from a number of laboratories suggests that the actions of ethanol on ligand-gated ion channels have important roles in the pathophysiology of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders (for review, see Ref. 6Costa E.T. Savage D.D. Valenzuela C.F. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2000; 24: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence indicates that glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)1 subtype are among the ligand-gated ion channels affected by fetal exposure to ethanol. Studies have shown that fetal and/or neonatal ethanol exposure alters ligand binding to NMDA receptors and expression of NMDA receptor subunits (7Savage D.D. Montano C.Y. Otero M.A. Paxton L.L.

Reductions in NMDA receptor function have also been detected in neuronal preparations from both the neonatal and the adult offspring of rats exposed to ethanol during pregnancy (6Costa E.T.

Since the normal functioning of NMDA receptors is critical for growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, plasticity, and programmed death of neurons (16Ebralidze A.K. Rossi D.J. Tonegawa S.

The participation of the NMDA-Rs in complex neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral processes requires precise regulation of the function of these channels. Among the molecules that regulate NMDA receptors are the neurosteroids, which produce rapid effects on the function of these receptors by nongenomic mechanisms. Compounds such as dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone sulfate (PS) enhance NMDA-R function (24Bergeron R. de Montigny C. Debonnel G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Compagnone N.A. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. Brain Res. 1998; 803: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This neurosteroid-mediated enhancement of NMDA-R function was shown to have a role in axonal elongation in developing neurons (25Compagnone N.A. Mellon S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4678-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Dehydroepiandrosterone and PS were also shown to enhance cognitive performance and to have anxiogenic effects in rodents (29Flood J.F. Morley J.E. Roberts E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14865-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Importantly, Zimmerberg and collaborators found that prenatal ethanol exposure reduced the anxiogenic effect of PS in neonates subjected to maternal separation-induced stress (33Zimmerberg B. McDonald B.C. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1996; 55: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The authors of this study postulated that alterations in the sensitivity of ligand-gated ion channels to neurosteroids could mediate these effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. It is noteworthy, however, that the mechanism by which prenatal alcohol exposure produces these alterations in the behavioral responses to neurosteroids has yet to be determined. We have investigated the effects of fetal ethanol exposure on NMDA-R function and modulation by neurosteroids. Rats consumed a liquid diet that produces blood ethanol levels of ∼0.08%, which are near the legal intoxication limit in many states. We then prepared primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from the offspring of these rats and used patch clamp electrophysiological techniques to assess NMDA-R function after 6–7 days in culture. We found that exposure to ethanol during pregnancy affects the sensitivity of NMDA-Rs to neurosteroids. Details of the breeding colony procedures have been described previously (34Allan A.M. Wu H. Paxton L.L. Savage D.D. J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 250-257PubMed Google Scholar). Five-month-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat dams (Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, IN) were individually housed in plastic cages in a temperature-controlled room (22 °C) on a 16-h dark:8-h light schedule (lights off from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m.). Beginning on day 1 of gestation, rat dams were assigned to one of the three diet groups. Two of the three diets consisted of a liquid diet based on the Lieber-DeCarli (35Lieber C.S. DeCarli L.M. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1982; 6: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) formulation, which provides 1 kcal/ml (BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ). These groups received 110 ml of liquid diet at 5:30 p.m. each day. The feeding tubes were removed 16 h later (at 9:30 a.m. on the next morning). The fetal ethanol-exposed group received a liquid diet containing no ethanol for the first 2 days of gestation for adjustment to the liquid diet. The animals in this group were then given 110 ml of a liquid diet containing 2% (v/v) ethanol for the gestational days 3–4, 3% (v/v) for the next 2 days, and thereafter 5% (v/v) ethanol (26% ethanol-derived calories) until they gave birth. This diet produces blood alcohol levels of ∼0.08% (34Allan A.M. Wu H. Paxton L.L. Savage D.D. J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 250-257PubMed Google Scholar). The other liquid diet group, serving as pair-fed control, was given a 0% ethanol liquid diet (isocalorically equivalent to the 5% ethanol diet) each day throughout the gestation. A third diet group had continuous access to Purina breeder block chow and water ad libitum and served as control for the paired feeding technique. At birth, all litters were weighed and counted. Cultures were prepared from 3–4-day-old rats. Meninge-free hippocampi were microdissected in cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline plus 15 mm HEPES, 27 mm glucose, 17.5 mm sucrose, pH 7.4, with a final osmolarity of 320–335 mosmol. Isolated hippocampi were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.), transferred to neurobasal A media (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and then gently triturated with a Pasteur pipette. Trituration was repeated with a Pasteur pipette flamed to half its original opening size. Cells were then plated at a density of 15–20 × 103/ml of media in culture dishes containing coverslips coated with polylysine and collagen and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were initially plated in neurobasal A media (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 25 μm glutamate. After 24 h, fetal bovine serum was substituted with the B27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) and after 3 days in culture, glutamate was removed from the culture media. Cells were used for experiments after 6–7 days in culture. Neurons used for recordings were large and had pyramidal shape and well defined dendritic processes. Immediately before recording, coverslips were transferred to a perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hampden, CT), and neurons were visualized under a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with Varel contrast optics or under an Olympus microscope equipped with Hoffman modulation optics. Membrane potentials were clamped at −60 mV with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The resting membrane potential for the recorded neurons was approximately −60 mV. Recording pipettes (borosilicate capillaries with filament, outer diameter 1.5 mm, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) were prepared with a two-step puller (Narishige Instrument Co, Tokyo, Japan) and had resistances between 5–9 megaohms. Series resistance was not compensated. The external solution (all chemicals from Sigma) contained 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 11 mm glucose, and 300 nm tetrodotoxin. For NMDA recordings, this solution was nominally Mg2+-free. The internal solution contained (all chemicals from Fluka, Milwaukee, WI) 130 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm GTP. For recordings of kainate and GABAAreceptor-mediated currents, glass microelectrodes were front-filled with internal solution containing (all chemicals were from Fluka) 155 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mmEGTA, and 1 mm MgCl2 adjusted to 285 mosmol. Pipettes were then back-filled with the same internal solution containing 50 units/ml creatinine phosphokinase, 22 mmphosphocreatine, and 4 mm Mg2+-ATP (300 mosmol). Drugs were applied with a fast-exchange flow-tube perfusion system driven by motor (Warner Instrument Co.). Agonists were applied at 30–60-s intervals. The neurosteroids, PS (5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one sulfate), pregnenolone hemisuccinate (PHS; 5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one hemisuccinate), 5β-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one sulfate(3α5βPS), and 5β-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one hemisuccinate (3α5βPHS), were obtained from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). Steroid solutions were prepared as 100–250 mm stocks in Me2SO. The final Me2SO concentration of all recording solutions was between 0.01% and 0.05%. Identical concentrations of Me2SO were added to control solutions. All experiments were performed at room temperature (23–25 °C). Data were acquired and analyzed with either the Neuropro software (RC Electronics, Santa Barbara, CA) or pClamp7 (Axon Instruments). Modulation of NMDA, kainate, and GABAA responses by neurosteroids is presented as percent change, [(I′/I) − 1] × 100%, where Iis the average of control responses obtained before application and after washout of steroid, and I′ is the average of agonist-induced responses obtained from the same cell in the presence of steroid. Single-channel recordings were obtained in the cell-attached configuration to avoid alterations in intracellular modulators of NMDA-R function. The patch solution contained 10 μm NMDA and 1 μm glycine in a solution containing 70 mm NaCl, 70 mmNa2SO4, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mmCs2SO4, 33 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and 300 mosmol. The pipette potential was +20 mV. Events were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and stored on digital tape using a digital audio tape recorder (Panasonic SV3800). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass, lightly fire-polished, and coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning, MI). Recordings were played back and acquired and analyzed using the pClamp7 program (Axon Instruments). Single-channel currents were initially filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. Only patches with stable basal activities were used. The single channel open probability was determined from the ratio of the time spent in the open state to the duration of recording:Po = ( t1 +t2 + … +tn)/Nttot, where tis the amount of time that n channels are open, andN is the maximum number of levels observed in the recording. Open times were obtained with the pStat 6.0 computer program (Axon Instruments) by fitting plots of event number versus open time to exponential functions using the Marquardt algorithm. Closed times were obtained in the same manner from plots of event numberversus log of closed time. Hippocampi from two P3 neonates, each from 3–6 different litters per diet group, were homogenized by sonication and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblot assays. Anti-NR2A, -2B, -2C, NR1-N1, NR1-C1, and NR1-C2 antibodies were produced, purified, and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Browning at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Anti-NR1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of bound antibodies was performed by chemiluminescence using a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Densitometric analysis of Western blot chemiluminescence x-ray films were performed using an Image-Pro® Plus image analysis system (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). In all cases, a protein standard curve was generated from a single homogenate of adult rat hippocampal tissue kept at −80 °C. This standard curve was included in the same membrane (using 15-well combs) as samples from control and ethanol-treated animals. This curve was used to calculate relative units of protein concentrations. We selected the appropriate bands and measured relative optical density with respect to these standards. To correct for variations in protein loading, concentrations of all samples were normalized against β-tubulin levels (anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma). Relative protein concentrations are expressed as relative units (R.U.) of protein/R.U. of tubulin. The potentiating or inhibiting effects of neurosteroids were quantified with respect to the average of control and washout responses. Neurosteroid dose response curves were fitted to four-parameter logistic equations (sigmoid) using GraphPad Prizm computer program (San Diego, CA). Statistical comparison of the effect of neurosteroids among the three diet groups was performed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. Effect of multiple concentrations of PS on neurons from all three diet groups were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Effects of PS on non-NMDA and GABAA receptor function in cells from the pair-fedversus fetal ethanol-exposed groups were analyzed byt test. In all cases, a p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. TableI summarizes the results of the feeding paradigm used in this study (values are mean ± S.E. of 34–43 dams/diet group). No statistical differences were found in diet consumption, total number of newborns, live newborns, or the average mean weight of live newborns among the three diet groups. Furthermore, no gross anatomical abnormalities were noted at birth in the fetal ethanol-exposed animals.Table IComparison of liquid diet consumption and the effects of diets on offspring at birthDiet groupAverage No. of newborns/litterAverage No. of live newborns/litterAverage mean weight of live newbornsAverage daily food consumptiongKcalAd libitum12 ± 1.012 ± 1.06.7 ± 1.0UndeterminedPair-fed12 ± 1.012 ± 1.06.5 ± 0.185 ± 0.3Fetal ethanol11 ± 1.011 ± 1.06.3 ± 0.191 ± 1.7Values are mean ± S.E. of 36, 43, and 40 dams for the ad libitum, pair-fed, and fetal ethanol groups, respectively.

Shown in Fig. 1 are NMDA dose response curves recorded in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration for neurons from the ad libitum control, pair-fed control, and fetal ethanol-exposed groups. Fig. 1 Ashows examples of currents obtained by increasing concentrations of NMDA in the presence of a constant glycine (1 μm) concentration. Fig. 1 B shows a summary graph of NMDA dose response curves obtained from neurons from the three feeding groups (n = 6–9 neurons from 2–3 different litters per diet group). Data were normalized with respect to maximum NMDA (100 μm) currents. The EC50 concentrations were 11 ± 1, 12 ± 1, and 13 ± 1 μm for neurons from the ad libitum control, pair-fed control, and the fetal ethanol-exposed groups, respectively. The Hill slope was ∼1.4 for all treatment groups. It should be noted that we did not find a difference in NMDA-R maximum current densities (pA/picofarads) (Fig. 1 B, inset). Current densities were 11 ± 1, 11 ± 1, and 13 ± 1 pA/picofarads for neurons from the ad libitumcontrol, pair-fed control, and the fetal ethanol-exposed groups, respectively (n = 21–23 neurons from 3–4 different litters per diet group). We also measured dose response curves for 7-chlorokynurenate, a competitive antagonist of the glycine co-agonist site of NMDA-Rs (Fig. 1 C), in the presence of constant NMDA (100 μm) plus glycine (1 μm) concentrations (n = 4–5 neurons from 2–3 litters per diet group). The IC50concentrations were 83 ± 18, 57 ± 17, and 93 ± 29 nm for neurons from the ad libitum control, pair-fed control, and the fetal ethanol-exposed groups, respectively. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences among these diet groups. We also assessed the effect of fetal ethanol exposure on NMDA-R function at the single channel level. Fig. 2 shows sample tracings obtained from neurons from pair-fed and fetal ethanol-exposed groups in the cell-attached configuration. The patch solution contained 10 μm NMDA and 1 μm glycine. Single channel parameters are summarized in Table II. We did not detect any statistically significant differences in any of these parameters among the three diet groups. Since resting membrane potentials cannot be determined in the cell-attached mode, single-channel conductance was not calculated.Table IINMDA receptors single-channel parameters (cell-attached mode)Diet groupOpen probability (n = 12–14) 2-an = number of neurons recorded, which were obtained from 8–12 different litters per diet group.Open time (n = 11–12) 2-an = number of neurons recorded, which were obtained from 8–12 different litters per diet group.Closed time (n = 5–7) 2-an = number of neurons recorded, which were obtained from 8–12 different litters per diet group.τ1τ2τ1τ2τ3msmsAd libitum0.07 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.011.4 ± 0.10.08 ± 0.010.7 ± 0.0716 ± 2Pair-fed0.08 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.031.1 ± 0.10.08 ± 0.010.7 ± 0.0121 ± 6Fetal ethanol0.08 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.011.2 ± 0.20.08 ± 0.010.7 ± 0.0622 ± 4Values are mean ± S.E.2-a n = number of neurons recorded, which were obtained from 8–12 different litters per diet group.

Sample tracings illustrating the effects of 50 μm PS on currents induced by application of 50 μm NMDA on cultured hippocampal neurons from ad libitum, pair-fed, and fetal ethanol-exposed neonatal rats are shown in Fig. 3 A. PS produced a significant potentiation of NMDA-R-mediated currents in cells from the ad libitum and the pair-fed groups but not in cells from the fetal ethanol-exposed group (Table III). The reduction in the effects of PS was evident at different concentrations of this neurosteroid (Fig. 3 B).Table IIIEffect of fetal ethanol exposure on modulation of ligand-gated ion channel currents by PS (50 μm)Diet groupNMDA 3-aCurrents were elicited by 50 μm NMDA in Mg2+-free external solution.Non-NMDA 3-bCurrents were elicited by 100 μm kainate.GABAA 3-cCurrents were elicited by 50 μm GABA.%%%Ad libitum72 ± 10 (12)Not determinedNot determinedPair-fed67 ± 11 (12)−22 ± 12 (8)−82 ± 2 (7)Fetal ethanol−4 ± 8 (11) 3-dSignificantly different fromad libitum and pair-fed groups (P < 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test).−20 ± 7 (6)−88 ± 2 (6)Values are mean ± S.E.

Neurons were obtained from 5–8 different litters per diet group for NMDA experiments and from one litter per diet group for the non-NMDA and GABAA experiments. Shown in Fig. 4 A are sample traces illustrating the effect of PHS on NMDA-R-mediated currents in all the three diet groups. In neurons from ad libitumcontrols, pair-fed controls, and fetal ethanol-exposed rats, the amplitude of these currents in the presence of 50 μm PHS corresponded to 53 ± 9% (n = 6 neurons from 3 different litters), 55 ± 13% (n = 6 neurons from 3 different litters), and 17 ± 8% (n = 8 neurons from 2 different litters) of control, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Statistical analysis indicated that the effect of both PS and PHS was significantly different in neurons from ethanol-exposed ratsversus ad libitum and pair-fed controls (p < 0.02 by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test). The results of these experiments suggest that modulation of NMDA-Rs by neurosteroids that potentiate receptor function is impaired by prenatal ethanol exposure. Shown in Fig. 5 A are sample tracings illustrating the effect of 3α5βPS, a negative neurosteroid modulator of NMDA-Rs. In neurons from ad libitum control, pair-fed controls and fetal ethanol-exposed rats, the amplitude of these currents in the presence of 100 μm 3α5βPS was decreased by 52 ± 12% (n = 9 neurons from 1 litter), 44 ± 15% (n = 7 neurons from 2 different litters), and 40 ± 4% (n = 6 neurons from 2 different litters) in comparison to control, respectively (Fig. 5 B). The amplitude of NMDA-R currents in neurons from the same diet groups in the presence of 100 μm 3α5βPHS were decreased to 60 ± 23% (n = 9 neurons from 2 different litters), 78 ± 17% (n = 7 neurons from 3 different litters), and 73 ± 23% (n = 7 neurons from 3 different litters) of control values (Fig. 5 C). Statistical analysis indicated that the effect of both 3α5βPS and 3α5βPHS was not significantly different in neurons from ethanol-exposed rats versus ad libitum and pair-fed controls (p > 0.05 by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test). PS has been shown to selectively modulate other classes of ionotropic receptors. PS inhibits AMPA/kainate and GABAA receptors (27Wu F"

In contrast, triggering of the fibrosarcoma cell line L929sA gives rise to characteristic cellular changes resulting in necrosis. The intracellular domain of TNF-R55 can be subdivided into two parts: a membrane-proximal domain (amino acids 202–325) and a C-terminal death domain (DD) (amino acids 326–413), which has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for apoptosis. Structure/function analysis of TNF-R55-mediated necrosis in L929sA cells demonstrated that initiation of necrotic cell death, as defined by swelling of the cells, rapid membrane permeabilization, absence of nuclear condensation, absence of DNA hypoploidy, and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen intermediates, is also confined to the DD. The striking synergistic effect of the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone on TNF-induced necrosis was also observed with receptors solely containing the DD. TNF-R55-mediated necrosis is not affected by the dominant negative deletion mutant of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD-(80–205)) that lacks the N-terminal death effector domain. Moreover, overexpression of FADD-(80–205) in L929sA is cytotoxic and insensitive to CrmA, while the cytotoxicity due to overexpression of the deletion mutant FADD-(1–111) lacking the DD is prevented by CrmA. These results demonstrate that the death domain of FADD can elicit an active necrotic cell death pathway. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces a typical apoptotic cell death program in various cell lines by interacting with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R55).

Apoptosis is morphologically characterized by membrane blebbing, shrinking of the cell and its organelles, and internucleosomal degradation of DNA (6Kroemer G. Petit P. Zamzami N. Vayssiere J.L. Mignotte B. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Finally, the cell disintegrates and apoptotic bodies are cleared by phagocytosis, in most cases without any detrimental effects on the surrounding tissue (7Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 8Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar). In contrast, cell death by necrosis is often accompanied by inflammation due to massive release of the cytoplasmic cell content. Necrosis is characterized by swelling of the cell and its organelles and an immediate loss of the plasma membrane integrity (1Grooten J. Goossens V. Vanhaesebroeck B. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A key step in the pathway to apoptosis is activation of procaspases. Activation of these cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases is initiated by formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) after oligomerization of the p55 TNF receptor (TNF-R55) or the Fas receptor by the respective ligands (9Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 10Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Both death receptors contain a homologous C-terminal cytoplasmic death domain (DD) involved in apoptosis (11Tartaglia L.A.

In contrast, the DD of Fas does not require the TRADD adaptor protein but serves as a direct docking surface for FADD (16Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J.

Besides its C-terminal DD, FADD contains a death effector domain (DED) implicated in the recruitment of procaspase-8 (19Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

Oligomerization of procaspase-8 leads to proximity-induced autocatalytic activation followed by direct or indirect downstream activation of executionary caspases, which cleave substrates involved in apoptotic morphology (21Muzio M.

The initial intracellular molecular events responsible for necrosis are less well understood. Leist and co-workers (5Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar) proposed a model in which low cellular ATP concentrations give rise to a necrotic cell death process, whereas in the presence of high ATP concentrations the apoptotic, caspase-dependent pathway becomes apparent. On the other hand, it was shown that mitochondria are crucial in the necrotic process (reviewed in Ref. 4Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Depletion of mitochondria protects L929sA cells from necrotic cell death (23Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), and TNF induces the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) (24Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). This oxidative phosphorylation-linked ROI production is required for TNF-induced necrotic cell death, since addition of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), an oxygen radical scavenger and inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation (25Fones E. Amigo H. Gallegos K. Guerrero A. Ferreira J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3443-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), blocks TNF cytotoxicity (24Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that inhibition of caspase activity by the caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk or CrmA resulted in enhanced ROI formation and considerably increased the sensitivity to TNF-induced necrosis (26Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), suggesting a modulator role for caspases in the oxidative metabolism. In this paper we demonstrate that the DD of TNF-R55 as such is sufficient for mediating necrotic signaling pathways of TNF. We show that the membrane-proximal region, upstream of the DD, is required neither for necrosis nor for formation of mitochondrial ROI. Furthermore, the strong sensitization of TNF-induced necrosis in the presence of caspase inhibitors is also confined to the DD. In contrast to apoptotic systems, overexpression of FADD-(80–205) lacking the DED is cytotoxic for L929sA cells in a CrmA-insensitive way, while overexpression of a FADD-(1–111) mutant containing the DED is cytotoxic in a CrmA-inhibitory way. This indicates that the death domain of FADD might be implicated in TNF-R55-mediated necrosis. The mouse fibrosarcoma cells L929sA (27Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F.M. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar), the mouse fibrosarcoma cells 24T2.5 (Hans Schreiber, Chicago), and the human HeLa H21 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum and 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), andl-glutamine (0.03%). Stable transfected clones of these cells were generated as described previously (28Boone E. Vandevoorde V. De Wilde G. Haegeman G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and maintained under selection by adding 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, United Kingdom) to the medium. Recombinant murine TNF was produced in our laboratory and was purified to at least 99% homogeneity. The specific activity amounted to 2.2 × 108 IU/mg, as determined in a standardized cytotoxicity assay on L929sA cells. htr1 and htr9 are agonistic mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of the p55 human tumor necrosis factor receptor (hTNF-R55) and was generously provided by Dr. M. Brockhaus (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (27Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F.M. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar). The agonistic anti-human Fas antibody, clone 2R2, was purchased from Cell Diagnostica (Münster, Germany). BHA (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and used at 100 μm. zVAD-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA) was dissolved in ethanol and used at 25 μm. Propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (3 mm) and was used at 30 μm. Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was dissolved at 5 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide and was used at 1 μm. Constitutive expression of hTNF-R55 and various mutants thereof were obtained by cloning the cDNA after the early SV40 promoter in pSV25S as described previously (29Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vanhaesebroeck B. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2904-2913PubMed Google Scholar). pSV2neo, containing the neomycin resistance gene, was used as a selection vector. Mutants were generated by standard cloning procedures and subsequently verified by sequence analysis. For transient transfection assays, receptor variants were cloned into pCDM8 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The expression vectors for CrmA (cDNA was a gift from D. Pickup, Durham, NC) and human Fas (the cDNA was a gift from S. Nagata, Department of Genetics, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan) have been described previously (30Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Mouse RIP and procaspase-8 (31Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vandenbrande I. Van Loo G. Molemans F. Schotte P. Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were cloned via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and introduced into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA1 and pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), respectively. The human FADD and TRADD genes were also picked up by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pCDNA1. FADD-(80–205), encoding a DED-deficient FADD molecule and reported as a dominant negative molecule in many apoptotic assays (32Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), FADD-(1–111), containing the entire DED but lacking the DD, were made by standard cloning procedures. All sequences were verified by sequence analysis. Cells were cultured in uncoated 24-well suspension plates. At day 1, cells were seeded at 5 × 105/well and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified air incubator. 1 × 106 cells were incubated on ice for 1 h with 200 μl of primary anti-hTNF-R55 antibody solution (htr9 at 1 ng/μl). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Harlan Sera-Lab, Crawley Down, UK) was used as secondary antibody. Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence intensity (measured at 525 nm) was analyzed on a FACScalibur flow fluorocytometer (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA), equipped with a 488 nm argon ion laser. Cells were seeded on day 1 at 2 × 104/well in 96-well plates. The next day, cells were treated with inhibitors, cytokines, and/or antibodies, as mentioned. Generally, cells were pretreated for 2 h with inhibitor, followed by 18–24-h treatment with TNF or htr1 agonistic antibody. Next, medium was removed by flicking the microtiter plate to discard detached dead cells. Crystal violet staining on the remaining adherent cells was used to monitor the extent of cell viability. The percentage of cell survival was calculated as follows: (A 595treated cells − A 595 blank well)/(A 595 untreated cells −A 595 blank well) × 100. In case of combined addition of TNF or htr1 with zVAD-fmk, the percentage of cell survival was compared with the condition with caspase inhibitor alone. To obtain L929sA cells in suspension, cells were cultured in bacterial-grade Petri dishes or uncoated 24-well plates. At day 1, cells were seeded at 5 × 105/ml and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified air incubator. DHR123 was added together with TNF, and samples were taken at different time points. Simultaneously, PI fluorescence (excitation at 488 nm and detection at 610 nm) was measured to exclude interference by dead cells. Rhodamine 123 fluorescence, as a result from DHR123 oxidation, was excited at 488 nm and was detected at 525 nm on 3000 PI-negative cells. Changes in rhodamine 123 fluorescence are shown by subtracting the basal mean fluorescence of untreated cells from the fluorescence of treated cells at a given time point (24Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). L929sA, 24T2.5, or HeLa H21 cells were seeded 24 h before transfection at 40,000 cells/24-well plate. Transient transfection was done using the LipofectAMINE PLUS transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cytotoxicity in transient transfection assays with TNF-R55 and FADD constructs was evaluated by cotransfecting the pUT651 reporter gene construct, containing the β-galactosidase gene fused to a nuclear localization signal under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Cayla, Toulouse, France). The total amount of DNA per 24-well plate was 400 ng. Immediately after removal of the transfection mix, cells were either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml htr1 for 24 h, after which cells were lysed to measure β-galactosidase activity by chemiluminescence using the Galacto Light kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The cells dying from overexpression of cell death-inducing molecules detach from the bottom surface of the well and are removed during the washing steps prior to the lysis of the remaining cells. This results in a reduced β-galactosidase activity in case of cell death. Percentage cell survival was calculated as follows: [(light units sample) − (light units of blank)]/[(light units only pUT651 transfected cells) − (light units of blank)] × 100%. Blank is the amount of light units obtained in cells transfected with control vectors not expressing β-galactosidase, whereas 100% cell survival corresponded to the amount of light units in pUT651 transfected cells only. Transfection was carried out in triplicate for each condition. L929sA cells were stably transfected with cDNAs encoding different hTNF-R55 variants (Fig.1 A) and a pSV2neo selection plasmid. After selection, several clones were screened for plasma membrane expression of hTNF-R55 and the different mutants. FACS analysis revealed constitutive cell membrane expression of full-length hTNF-R55, of the deletion mutants hR55Δ203–304, hR55Δ327–426, and hR55Δ243–383, as well as of the hR55-L351A mutant mimicking the DD-inactivating lprcg mutation originally found in Fas (Fig. 1, A and B).Figure 1A, schematic representation of the different hTNF-R55 proteins. EC, extracellular domain;TM, transmembrane domain; MPR, membrane-proximal region; DD, death domain; E, E-tag;link, 18-amino acid long linker with the sequence GGS(G4S)3. The L351A mutation corresponds to the inactivating lpr mutation in the DD of Fas (48Watanabe-Fukanaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). B, FACS analysis of membrane-expressed wild type and mutant hTNF-R55 receptors in L929sA cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Specific triggering of the membrane-associated hTNF-R55 mutants was achieved by treatment of the cells with the agonistic antibody htr1. The L929sA transfectants expressing those two receptor variants containing an active DD, viz. hTNF-R55 and hR55Δ203–304, displayed htr1-dependent death (Fig.2 A). In contrast, oligomerization of hR55Δ327–426, hR55-L351A, or hR55Δ243–383 with htr1 revealed the inability of TNF-R55 variants lacking the death domain to trigger cell death (Fig. 2 A). Next, we excluded the possibility of having selected for TNF-resistant L929sA cell clones (27Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F.M. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we treated these murine cells with human TNF, which interacts both with human and murine TNF-R55, and with agonistic anti-murine TNF-R55 polyclonal antibodies. We found that triggering of endogenous TNF-R55 was still cytotoxic (data not shown). Microscopic evaluation of treated cells revealed that both hTNF-R55 and hR55Δ203–304 induced characteristic necrotic swelling of the cell, resulting in loss of membrane integrity and finally cell lysis (Fig.2 B). Staining with PI further demonstrated the absence of nuclear condensation (Fig. 2 B). Triggering of hR55Δ327–426, hR55Δ243–383, or hR55-L351A did not result in cell death or in any morphological changes (data not shown). Hence, the DD of TNF-R55 is required and sufficient for TNF-R55-mediated necrosis. Recently, we demonstrated that overexpression of CrmA, which is a specific inhibitor of caspase-1 and caspase-8 (33Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7797-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), strongly increased TNF-induced necrosis in L929sA cells, instead of blocking it. A similar observation was made when cells were pretreated with zVAD-fmk (26Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of zVAD-fmk-induced synergy, the different TNF-R55 mutants were triggered in the presence of this caspase inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 3 A, htr1-induced necrosis by clustering hTNF-R55 was 100-fold sensitized in the presence of zVAD-fmk. In contrast, the necrotic inactive mutants hR55-L351A, hR55Δ327–426, or hR55Δ243–383 remained insensitive to htr1 treatment, even in the presence of zVAD-fmk (Fig. 3, B,D, and E). However, these clones retained the ability to respond to a combined treatment of human TNF and zVAD-fmk, indicating that the endogenous zVAD-fmk-sensitive pathway(s) were still intact in these cells (data not shown). Necrotic cell death induced by hR55Δ203–304, on the other hand, was enhanced as strongly by zVAD-fmk as the full-length receptor (Fig. 3 C). This demonstrates that the synergistic action of caspase inhibitors to necrotic cell death occurs independently of the membrane-proximal region of hTNF-R55. The production of mitochondrial ROI by TNF has been shown to be crucial for necrotic cell death of L929sA cells (24Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is still not clear which signaling pathways originating from TNF-R55 are involved in the formation of ROI. When hTNF-R55 was triggered by htr1, the generation of ROI could be detected by the accumulation of oxidized DHR123 in PI-negative cells (Fig.4 A). Simultaneously, necrotic cell death was monitored by the uptake of PI (Fig. 4 B). After 3 h of incubation, about 50% of the cells were dead, whereas the remaining plasma membrane-intact cells produced twice as much ROI. Aggregation of hR55Δ203–304 resulted in a delayed cell death, as reported previously (34Devos K. Goossens V. Boone E. Vercammen D. Vancompernolle K. Vandenabeele P. Haegeman G. Fiers W. Grooten J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9673-9680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the extent of ROI production in PI-negative cells at 50% cell death was exactly the same as with full-length receptor. Treatment of cells expressing hR55Δ327–426 or hR55-L351A did not result in the production of ROI (data not shown). Thus the DD alone is sufficient to generate a full oxidative response. To examine whether an increase in ROI is required for necrotic cell death, cells were incubated in the presence of the hydrophobic radical scavenger and inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation BHA (25Fones E. Amigo H. Gallegos K. Guerrero A. Ferreira J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3443-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows that BHA strongly delayed the formation of PI-positive cells, both in cells expressing hTNF-R55 and hR55Δ203–304. Furthermore, BHA abrogated almost completely the synergistic effect of zVAD-fmk, confirming the involvement of mitochondrial ROI production in zVAD-fmk-synergized necrotic cell death (26Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The TNF-R55 adapter molecules TRADD and FADD have been shown to be required for TNF-R55 induced apoptosis (13Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Also RIP is recruited in the TNF-R55 complex and its overexpression induces apoptotic cell death (35Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.-H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). We examined the influence of FADD-(80–205), a dominant negative mutant for TNF-R55-induced apoptosis (32Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H.

Surprisingly, in L929sA cells transient expression of FADD-(80–205) alone resulted already in massive cell death (Fig.6 A). As a control, overexpression of FADD-(80–205) in 24T2.5 (Figs. 6 B and Fig. 7 B) or HeLa H21 cells (Fig. 8C) prevented TNF-R55-, TRADD-, and RIP-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of hTNF-R55 or hR55Δ203–304 induced already substantial cell death in both L929sA and 24T2.5 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Addition of htr-1 agonistic antibody further enhanced cell death in this transfection system. Receptors lacking an active death domain (hR55-L351A and hR55Δ327–426) were incapable of activating any cell death program in both cell lines. Thus, the transient transfection cytotoxic assays with TNF-R55 mutants reflect the data obtained in stable transfected cell lines (Fig. 2 A). The strong cytotoxic effect of FADD-(80–205), that lacks the DED and is not able to recruit procaspase-8, prompted us to distinguish whether FADD is at the bifurcation of necrotic or apoptotic cell death in L929sA cells. Therefore, we tested whether cell death by transient overexpression of human TNF-R55 mutants, TRADD, FADD, and RIP was affected by cotransfection with the caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA. Clearly, overexpression of CrmA is not able to block TNF-R55-, hR55-link-326–426-, TRADD-, and RIP-induced cell death in L929sA cells (Fig. 8 A). Furthermore, also FADD-induced cell death is insensitive to CrmA-mediated inactivation of caspases. This indicates that FADD-induced cell death occurs despite the presence of CrmA. To elaborate further on the ability of FADD to induce cell death in the presence of a caspase-8 inhibitor, we tested the influence of CrmA overexpression on the cytotoxicity by FADD mutants that either lacked the DED domain or the DD domain, FADD-(80–205) and FADD-(1–111), respectively. As shown in Fig. 8 B, FADD- and FADD-(80–205)-induced cell death is not affected by the presence of CrmA. In contrast, cell death induced by FADD-(1–111) in the same cells is blocked by the presence of CrmA, indicating a role for caspase-8. As a control, the same constructs were transfected in HeLa H21 cells (Fig. 8 C). In these cells both FADD- and FADD-(1–111)-induced cell death is counteracted by cotransfecting CrmA, whereas FADD-(80–205) has no killing capacity at all, as expected (Fig. 8 C).Figure 8CrmA is unable to block TNF-R55 -, TRADD -, FADD -, or RIP-induced cell death in L929sA cells. CrmA blocks cell death induced by FADD-(1–111) but not by FADD-(80–205) in L929sA cells. L929sA cells (A, B) and HeLa H21 cells (C) were transiently transfected with 300 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector, 20 ng of expression vectors for receptors, adapter molecules, or mutants thereof and, where mentioned, 100 ng of CrmA expression plasmid. 24 h after transfection cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Percentage cell survival was calculated as described under “Material and Methods.” Transfection in HeLa H21 functions as a control for apoptotic cell death.View Large"

In our continuing studies on rhodopsin folding, assembly, and structure, we have attempted to reconstruct the interacting surface(s) for these proteins by inserting fragments corresponding to the cytoplasmic loops and/or the carboxyl-terminal tail of bovine opsin either singly, or in combination, onto a surface loop in thioredoxin. The purpose of the thioredoxin fusion is to provide a soluble scaffold for the cytoplasmic fragments thereby allowing them sufficient conformational freedom to fold to a structure that mimics the protein-binding sites on light-activated rhodopsin. All of the fusion proteins are expressed to relatively high levels in Escherichia coli and can be purified using a two- or three-step chromatography procedure. Biochemical studies show that some of the fusion proteins effectively mimic the activated conformation(s) of rhodopsin in stimulating G-protein or competing with the light-activated rhodopsin/G-protein interaction, in supporting phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal opsin fragment by rhodopsin kinase, and/or phosphopeptide-stimulated arrestin binding. These results suggest that specific segments of the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin can adopt functionally discrete conformations in the absence of the connecting transmembrane helices and retinal chromophore.

The light-induced cis → trans isomerization of retinal is thought to induce rigid body movements of the TM helices forcing a transition of rhodopsin to the active metarhodopsin II (MII) state. Formation of the latter, as documented by the combined use of a number of biochemical and biophysical techniques, is accompanied by small but significant tertiary structural changes in the solvent-exposed cytoplasmic interhelical loops thereby opening high affinity sites for the binding and activation of several signaling proteins (1Kühn H.

Thus, the goal of this study was to create optimized constructs of the cytoplasmic domain, or its subdomains, and examine their ability to mimic the signal-transducing and deactivation potential of light-activated rhodopsin. For this purpose, defined polypeptide fragments corresponding to the cytoplasmic loops and the carboxyl-terminal region of bovine opsin were inserted onto a surface loop in a mutant form of thioredoxin (HPTRX, histidine patch thioredoxin) (49Lu Z.

The HPTRX fusion provides a soluble scaffold for restraining the ends of the cytoplasmic loops as well as a “histidine patch” for purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC).

The culture was grown at 30 °C until the A550 reached ∼0.5, andl-tryptophan was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the culture grown for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was processed immediately or stored at −80 °C until use. The cell pellets were resuspended in 9 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, a protease inhibitor tablet, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted in a French pressure cell at 900 pounds/square inch with two passes. The concentrations of NaCl and MgCl2 in the cell lysate were brought to 500 and 1 mm, respectively, and then incubated with 1 μg/ml DNase for 1 h at 4 °C.

The lysate was applied to a Toso Haas G3000 SW gel filtration column (2.15 × 60 cm) attached to a BioCAD Sprint perfusion chromatography workstation (Perspective Biosystems). The column was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the HPTRX/opsin fragment fusion proteins were collected and purified by IMAC on Ni2+-NTA resin (bed volume ∼2 ml). The resin was extensively washed with the same buffer followed by 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm NaCl.

Bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, purified on Ni2+-NTA, and chromatographed on the gel filtration column as described above. Molecular masses of the opsin fragment/thioredoxin fusions were determined with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, delayed extraction reflection, time-of-flight instrument (Voyager DE Biospectrometry Workstation, Perspective Biosystems). The proteins (1–2 pmol) were co-crystallized with equal volumes of matrices consisting of a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The protein/matrix mixtures (1 μl) were spotted on the sample plate and allowed to dry for 5 min prior to loading in the spectrometer. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization spectra were internally calibrated using myoglobin as a standard. The fluorescence assay for Gtactivation was adapted from previously described methods (52Guy P.M. Koland J.G. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6954-6964Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 53Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This assay allows measurement of the rate of GTPγS uptake by Gtα by monitoring the increase in its intrinsic fluorescence. Fluorescence was measured with a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorometer in signal/reference mode with excitation at 295 nm (2 nm bandwidth) and emission at 340 nm (12 nm bandwidth). Signal integration time was 2 s, and the temperature was maintained at 20 °C. The 100-μl assay mixture contained 5 nm rod outer segment (ROS) rhodopsin membranes or 100 nm to 1 μm HPTRX/opsin fragment fusion protein and 1 μm Gt in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The solution was mixed, and after obtaining a stable base line (∼500–1000 s), the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.5 μm GTPγS and followed for another 2200 s. In some cases, the 100 μl assay mixture initially contained 1 μm Gt and 1.5 μmGTPγS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. After obtaining a stable base line, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 200 nm HPTRX/CDEF and followed for 1000 s. A second aliquot of HPTRX/CDEF (300 nm) was then added bringing the concentration to 500 nm, and the reaction was followed for another 1200 s. A radionucleotide filter-binding assay, which monitors guanine nucleotide exchange by Gtα using [35S]GTPγS, was carried out as described previously (43Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 54Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3697-3705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filter-binding assay is based on the property that Gt and its bound [35S]GTPγS are retained on nitrocellulose filters, whereas the free [35S]GTPγS passes through the filters. The HPTRX/opsin fragment fusion proteins were evaluated for their ability to activate directly Gt or compete with the MII/Gtinteraction. For the activation assays (250 μl), 2 nm ROS rhodopsin membranes or 200 nm HPTRX/opsin fragment fusion protein was preincubated with 400 nm Gt in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT for 30 min at 20 °C. The rhodopsin-containing sample was illuminated (>495 nm) for 1 min, and then the reactions were initiated by addition of 1 μm [35S]GTPγS. After 30 min at 20 °C, 100 μl of the reaction mixture was removed in duplicate and filtered through nitrocellulose with the aid of a vacuum manifold. The filters were washed four times with 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT, dried, and analyzed for 35S radioactivity by scintillation counting. For the competition studies, 10–400 nm HPTRX/opsin fragment fusion protein was preincubated with 2 nm ROS rhodopsin membranes and 200–400 nm Gt in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT for 30 min at 20 °C. The assay mixture (250 μl) was illuminated (>495 nm) for 1 min, and 1 μm[35S]GTPγS was added to initiate the reaction. After 30 min, 100 μl of the reaction mixture was removed in duplicate, and the amount of bound [35S]GTPγS was quantified as described above. Two different procedures were used to phosphorylate rhodopsin with RK. In the first procedure (55Wilden U. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), rhodopsin (100 μm) in ROS membranes containing RK was phosphorylated by addition of 1 mm ATP (spiked with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for quantitation purposes) in 70 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GTP, and 150 μm DTT. The total reaction volume was 1 ml. The sample was illuminated (>495 nm light) for 1 min at 20 °C, and phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for another 60 min. The reaction was quenched by dilution and addition of 100 mmNH2OH, pH 7.0. The membranes were extensively washed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to remove residual all-trans-retinaloxime (and ATP) and then an additional two times in the same buffer without BSA. The rhodopsin chromophore was regenerated by addition of a 3-fold excess of 11-cis-retinal to the resuspended membranes for 3 h at 4 °C. The membranes were washed two times by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 30 min with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2% (w/v) BSA to remove residual 11-cis-retinal followed by two washes with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 800 mm NaCl. Prior to each of the above-mentioned centrifugation steps, the membranes were underlaid with 2 ml of 200 mm sucrose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. Alternatively, urea-washed ROS membranes were phosphorylated by addition of partially purified RK prepared according to Ref. 56Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The reaction mixtures (1.25 ml) contained 10 μm rhodopsin, 30 nm RK, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP in 70 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0, containing 5 mmMgCl2, 10 μm GTP, and 150 μmDTT. The assay mixture was illuminated (>495 nm) for 1 min. At different time points (2–60 min), 100 μl was removed, and the proteins were precipitated with 900 μl of 5 mm phosphoric acid containing 7% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 25 μg of BSA. After 2 h at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 20,200 × g for 30 min, and the precipitate was washed five times with 1 ml of the 7% trichloroacetic acid solution. Cerenkov counting was used to analyze the pellets for 32P radioactivity. Alternatively, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the32P in the protein bands was quantified by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager). HPTRX/CT was also phosphorylated by addition of partially purified RK. For the time course reaction, the assay mixtures (1.25 ml) contained 1 mm HPTRX/CT, 30–300 nm RK, and 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP in 70 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.0, containing 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μm GTP, and 150 μmDTT. At different time points (2–60 min), 100 μl of the reaction mixture was removed, and the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed for 32P radioactivity as described above for ROS rhodopsin. The interaction between HPTRX/ABCDEF and RK was also examined by phosphorylation of HPTRX/CT. The assay mixtures (60 μl) contained 1 mm HPTRX/CT (or 1 mm HPTRX), 200 nm HPTRX/ABCDEF, 100 nm RK, and 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP in 70 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GTP, and 150 μm DTT. After 60 min, the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and 32P in the pellet quantified by Cerenkov counting. Arr was prepared from bovine retina according to the method of Puig et al. (29Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The purified Arr (20 μm) was preincubated with 200 nm HPTRX or HPTRX/ABCDEF for 60 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 80 nm phosphorylated, regenerated ROS membranes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm DTT, and 50 mmpotassium acetate for 5 min at 37 °C in the dark. The reaction mixture (50 μl) was diluted with an equal volume of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm DTT, and 50 mmpotassium acetate and underlaid with 2 ml of 200 mm sucrose in the same buffer. The sample was centrifuged at 80,000 ×g for 1 h, and the membrane pellet was resuspended and washed in the same buffer without potassium acetate. The pellets were solubilized in 20 μl of concentrated (4×) SDS-PAGE sample buffer, diluted to 80 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm DTT, and an aliquot analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amount of Arr bound to the phosphorylated rhodopsin membranes was determined by immunoblotting with the C10C10 anti-arrestin monoclonal antibody. The immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence and quantitated by phosphorimaging. Protein samples were analyze"

We addressed the issue of whether toxic sPLA2s might exert specific effects on the Plasmodium falciparumintraerythrocytic development. We showed that both toxic and non-toxic sPLA2s are lethal to P. falciparum grownin vitro, with large discrepancies between respective IC50 values; IC50 values from toxic PLA2s ranged from 1.1 to 200 pm, and IC50 values from non-toxic PLA2s ranged from 0.14 to 1 μm. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms responsible for cytotoxicity of bee venom PLA2 (toxic) and hog pancreas PLA2 (non-toxic) demonstrated that, in both cases, enzymatic hydrolysis of serum phospholipids present in the culture medium was responsible for parasite growth arrest. However, bee PLA2-lipolyzed serum induced stage-specific inhibition ofP. falciparum development, whereas hog PLA2-lipolyzed serum killed parasites at either stage. Sensitivity to bee PLA2-treated serum appeared restricted to the 19–26-h period of the 48 h parasite cycle. Analysis of the respective role of the different lipoprotein classes as substrates of bee PLA2 showed that enzyme treatment of high density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins, and very low density lipoproteins/chylomicrons fractions induces cytotoxicity of either fraction. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that toxic and non-toxic PLA2s 1) are cytotoxic to P. falciparum via hydrolysis of lipoprotein phospholipids and 2) display different killing processes presumably involving lipoprotein by-products recognizing different targets on the infected red blood cell.

They are important for signal transduction processes, general lipid metabolism, and membrane remodeling (for review, see Refs. 1Dennis E.A. Biotechnology. 1987; 5: 1294-1300Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar and 2Dennis E.A. Rhee S.G. Billah M.M. Hannun Y.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2068-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). From this superfamily of secreted and cytosolic enzymes, classified in 1997 into nine groups (3Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), the groups I, II, and III are all secreted, low molecular mass (13–18 kDa), Ca2+-dependent PLA2s (4Davidson F.F. Dennis E.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1990; 31: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The pancreatic group IB is expressed at high level in the pancreas but has also been detected in various other tissues (5Sakata T. Nakamura E. Tsuruta Y. Tamaki M. Teraoka H. Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and apart from its role in the digestion of dietary lipids, it has been implicated in biological activities such as cell proliferation (7Arita H. Hanasaki K. Nakano T. Oka S. Teraoka H. Matsumo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19139-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell migration (8Ohara O. Ishizaki J. Harita H. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1995; 34: 117-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Kundu G.C. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5092-5098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Snake and insect venoms contain a wide variety of secreted PLA2s (sPLA2s), which can be potent toxins exerting deleterious effects such as myotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and inflammation (11Hawgood B. Bon C. Tu A.T. Handbook of Natural Toxins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1991: 3-52Google Scholar, 12Gutierrez J.M. Lomonte B. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 1405-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Involvement of enzymatic activity in many of these effects is unclear because not all venomous PLA2s display toxic effects, although they all have similar catalytic activities (13Tischfield J.A. Xia Y.R. Shih D.M. Klisak I. Chem J. Engle S.J. Siakotos A.N. Winstead M.V. Seilhamer J.J. Allamand V. Gyapay G. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1996; 32: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In some cases, like the cytotoxicity of nigexine, a PLA2 from cobra venom (14Chwetzoff S. Tsunasawa S. Sakiyama F. Menez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13289-13297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the activation of prostaglandin E2 production in rat mesangial cells by the mammalian pancreatic PLA2 (15Kishino J. Kawamoto K. Ishizaki J. Verheij H.M. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that catalytic activity and toxicity or biological effects are unrelated. Furthermore, the identification of different membrane proteins that bind secreted PLA2s strongly suggest that these enzymes could behave as ligands for receptors and might be responsible for other physiological functions than the catalytic one (16Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Malaria is a widespread parasitic disease. Its estimated incidence in the world is in the order of 300–500 million clinical cases each year, with mortality estimated to be more than one million (46World Health OrganizationWeekly Epidemiol. Rec. 1998; 72: 269Google Scholar). The causative agent of malaria is an intracellular protozoan from the genusPlasmodium. Of the four human Plasmodium species,Plasmodium falciparum is the one responsible for most of the severe physiopathology. Increasing resistance of the parasite to classical antimalarial drugs calls for new chemotherapeutic approaches based on a better understanding of Plasmodium biology and its interaction with the host. In humans, part of the P. falciparum life cycle takes place inside the erythrocyte, where it develops through the successive stages ring, trophozoite and schizont, within 48 h. During its intraerythrocytic maturation, the parasite undergoes a large re-organization of the host cell membrane by inserting newly synthesized proteins, forming “knob-like” electron-dense structures (17Atkinson C.T. Aikawa M. Blood Cells (N. Y. ). 1990; 16: 351-368PubMed Google Scholar), and remodeling of the molecular species of phospholipid composition (18Hsiao L.L. Howard R.J. Aikawa M. Taraschi T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Secreted PLA2s have been used as tools for studying the phospholipid asymmetry of the Plasmodium-infected erythrocyte membrane (19Joshi P. Dutta G.P. Gupta C.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Van der Schaft P.H. Beaumelle B. Vial H. Roelofsen B. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 901: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Apart from these structural studies, one study reported the toxicity of a chemically modified pig pancreatic PLA2 toward Plasmodium knowlesi-parasitized erythrocytes (21Moll G.N. Vial H.J. van der Wiele F.C. Ancelin M.L. Roelofsen B. Slotboom A.J. de Haas G.H. van Deenen L.L.M. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); it was demonstrated that the fatty acylated PLA2 acquired an enhanced penetrative power, leading to the selective elimination of the parasitized erythrocytes, which present an altered membrane lipid packing compared with healthy erythrocytes. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the perturbation of Plasmodiumphysiological processes by exogenous PLA2s activity. Owing to the many deleterious effects attributed to these enzymes and the variability of their mode of action, we were interested in testing the possibility that externally added PLA2s might induce specific toxic effects on P. falciparum. In this study, we analyzed the toxicity of bee and snake venom enzymes (toxic PLA2s) and hog and bovine pancreas enzymes (non-toxic PLA2s) toward P. falciparum cultured in vitro. Toxic and non-toxic PLA2s both killed the intraerythrocytic parasite, but with very different efficiencies, allowing a clear discrimination between the two categories of enzymes. Comparative analysis of the development of a synchronized culture ofPlasmodium upon addition at different times of bee venom PLA2 and hog pancreas PLA2, revealed that a low dose of the toxic enzyme is lethal to the young trophozoite stage only, whereas pancreatic PLA2 kills the parasite at each developmental stage. We demonstrate that these specific effects can be reproduced by using human serum previously incubated with the corresponding PLA2, and that purified lipoproteins lipolyzed by the bee venom PLA2 are inhibitory to the parasite growth. Taken together, our results demonstrate that bee PLA2 and hog PLA2 modify serum lipoproteins in different ways, leading to the generation of specific lipoprotein by-products toxic to the intraerythrocytic Plasmodium and presumably acting on different targets. Phospholipases A2s fromAgkistrodon halys venom and from hog pancreas were purchased from Fluka; the PLA2 from Crotalus adamanteusand Naja mossambica venoms were from Sigma; the bee venom PLA2 was purchased from Fluka and from Sigma.p-Bromophenacyl bromide (p-BPB) andl-α-lecithin were purchased from Sigma. [3H]Hypoxanthine (10–30 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, France. Affi-Gel 10 gel was purchased from Bio-Rad. P. falciparum Colombian strain FcB1 was used in all the experiments and was cultured as described previously (22Le Bonniec S. Deregnaucourt C. Redeker V. Banerjee R. Grellier P. Goldberg D.E. Schrével J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14218-14223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in a 3% CO2, 6% O2, 91% N2atmosphere with human red blood cells in complete medium. Complete medium consisted of RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mm Hepes, supplemented with 11 mm glucose, 27.5 mm NaHCO3, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 7% (v/v) compatible heat-inactivated human serum. The parasite cell culture was synchronized by Plasmagel (23Pasvol G. Wilson R.J.M. Smalley M.E. Brown J. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1978; 72: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and sorbitol (24Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar) treatments. Under our culture conditions, the in vitro life cycle of the FcB1 strain was 48 h. Enzymatic assays on mixed micelles of phosphatidylcholine and Triton X-100 were performed according to Lôbo de Araujo and Radvanyi (25Lôbo de Araujo A. Radvanyi F. Toxicon. 1987; 25: 1181-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, the substrate solution was prepared by stirring 3.5 mml-α-lecithin from egg yolk in 7 mm Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 55 μm phenol red; the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.5 with 40 mm NaOH so that the absorbance reading at 558 nm was 1.8 to 2. The substrate solution (1 ml) was introduced into the titration cuvette, and the reaction was started by adding the enzyme (resuspended in H20 at a known concentration) in a volume smaller than 50 μl. The difference in absorbance between the reference (substrate solution alone) and the sample cuvettes was monitored continuously at 558 nm using a Uvikon spectrophotometer (Kontron, Zurich, Switzerland). Under these conditions, a decrease in absorbance of 0.1 corresponds to the release of 0.01 μmol of fatty acid. 1 IU of PLA2 hydrolyzes 1 μmol ofl-α-phosphatidylcholine tol-α-lysophosphatidylcholine and a fatty acid per min at room temperature and appropriate pH. An asynchronous culture of P. falciparum at 1–1.5% parasitemia and 4% hematocrit in complete medium was distributed (100 μl/well) in a 96-microwell plate. Increasing concentrations of PLA2s resuspended in complete medium were added (100 μl/well), and the cells were allowed to grow in a candle jar system. After 24 h in culture, [3H]hypoxanthine was added (0.5 μCi/well), and after an additional 24-h incubation period, cells were harvested on filters after a freeze-thawing cycle. Dried filters were submerged in a liquid scintillation mixture (OptiScint Hisafe) and counted in a 1450 Microbeta counter (Wallac). Growth inhibition was calculated from the parasite-associated radioactivity (incorporated into nucleic acids) compared with controls. The IC50 was determined according to Desjardins et al. (26Desjardins R.S. Canfield C.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar) as was the IC100 minimum (IC100m = minimum enzyme concentration leading to 100% inhibition of the parasite growth). To estimate the concentration in terms of enzymatic units (IU/ml), enzymatic activity of each commercial PLA2 was measured in the mixed micelles assay system. Supernatant of the cell culture was used to determine the extent of hemolysis from its optical density at 420 nm and by comparing this value with that of a 100% lysate prepared from the corresponding batch of cells. The effect of bee and hog PLA2s on Plasmodiumre-invasion rate was analyzed on synchronized cultures, by adding the enzymes at their respective IC100m at different times of the parasite cycle. Re-invasion rate was determined 60 h after time zero of the cycle by counting 2000 cells on Giemsa-stained smears. Chemical modification of bee and hog PLA2s by p-BPB was achieved according to the procedure described in Robertset al. (27Roberts M.F. Deems R.A. Mincey T.C. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2405-2411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Enzyme (50 μg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 8) was incubated with 1 × 10−4m p-BPB at room temperature for 3 h. The reagent was added from a 2 × 10−3m stock solution in acetone. The reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3 to quench the reaction, then excess p-BPB was removed by extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Control samples were prepared in the same way except that p-BPB was omitted from the procedure. Aliquots from p-BPB-treated and control samples were tested for PLA2 activity in the mixed micelles assay system. Coupling of PLA2s to Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad) was achieved following instructions recommended by the manufacturer. At the end of the reaction, the efficiency of the coupling was determined by measuring the concentration of free PLA2 in the supernatant using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and enzymatic activity of the Affi-Gel-coupled PLA2 was measured in the mixed micelles assay system. After coupling, 1% of the bee PLA2 had retained activity, but all hog PLA2 activity had been lost. Complete culture medium containing 14% heat-inactivated human serum was incubated at 37 °C with 130 pm Affi-Gel-coupled bee venom PLA2 for various periods of time (1, 3, 6, 17 h). Here, 130 pm PLA2 is the concentration of enzyme still active after immobilization. After a 17-h incubation, an aliquot of the supernatant was tested in the mixed micelles assay system for the presence of released PLA2 to ensure that any effect on parasite growth would be due to modified serum and not to free PLA2 in the supernatant. To check if in the case of hog pancreas PLA2 enzyme toxicity toward the parasites might be due to modification of the serum, complete medium containing 14% heat-inactivated serum was incubated at 37 °C for 30 h with 40 nm enzyme. The 40 nm concentration was chosen since it is the highest PLA2 concentration with no effect on parasite growth for one cell cycle. An asynchronous culture ofP. falciparum was washed twice in culture medium without serum and resuspended at 1–1.5% parasitemia and 4% hematocrit in the same medium. 100 μl per well were distributed in a 96-microwell plate. PLA2-treated culture medium at increasing dilutions in non-treated complete medium containing 14% serum was added (100 μl/well), and parasites were allowed to grow in culture conditions. After 24 h, 0.5 μCi/well [3H]hypoxanthine was added, and cells were harvested after an additional 24-h period. Radioactivity incorporated into macromolecules was counted as described above. Parasite growth inhibition was plotted against dilution of the treated medium, and the highest dilution leading to 100% inhibition was determined. To analyze the respective susceptibility of parasite stages to PLA2-modified serum, synchronized cultures were grown in the presence of modified medium (at the 100% inhibitory dilution) for various periods of time, and the re-invasion rate at the end of the parasite cycle was determined from Giemsa-stained smears. VLDL/chylomicrons, LDL, and HDL were prepared by differential ultracentrifugation from heat-inactivated human serum following the procedure described in Grellier et al. (28Grellier P. Rigomier D. Clavey V. Fruchart J-C. Schrével J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The lipoprotein fractions were extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) and filtered through 0.2-μm membrane. The protein content of the different fractions was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. An aliquot of each fraction was incubated at 37 °C for 17 h with Affi-Gel-immobilized bee PLA2 (130 pm active enzyme). The supernatant was analyzed for parasite growth inhibition by the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation test. Two non-toxic, non-inflammatory PLA2s from hog and bovine pancreas (group IB) and four toxic PLA2s of venomous origin, the N. mossambica (group IA), A. halys and C. adamanteus (group IIA), and Apis mellifera (group III), were tested for their capacity to inhibit the intraerythrocytic development of P. falciparum. Asynchronous cultures of the FcB1 strain were grown at 1.5% parasitemia for one cell cycle (48 h) in the presence of various concentrations of PLA2. Parasite growth was checked via nucleic acid synthesis by [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation, and extent of hemolysis was measured by reading absorbance of the supernatants of the culture media at 420 nm. IC50 values obtained for each PLA2 as well as minimum PLA2 concentration leading to detectable hemolysis are given in TableI.Table IComparative analysis between the IC50 values of toxic and non-toxic PLA2s toward the P. falciparum in vitro growthPLA2 originA. mellifera group IIIN. mossambica group IAA. halys group IIAC. adamanteus group IIAHog pancreas group IBBovine pancreas group IBIC50(pm)1.12.2100200145 × 103>1 × 106(S.D. ± 1.2)(S.D. ± 2.7)(S.D. ± 50)(S.D. ± 55)(S.D. ± 10.5 × 103)IC50 (IU/ml)0.65 × 10−52.30 × 10−513.50 × 10−519.60 × 10−51.12>0.15(S.D. ± 0.7 × 10−5)(S.D. ± 5.7 × 10−5)(S.D. ± 0.7 × 10−5)(S.D. ± 5.3 × 10−5)(S.D. ± 0.07)Concentration of PLA2 inducing 1% hemolysis>62.5 nm≥47 nm≥7 μmND≥100 μm>1.4 μmAn asynchronous culture of the FcB1 strain of P. falciparumwas grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of various toxic (from A. mellifera, N. mossambica, A. halys, and C. adamanteus) and non-toxic (from hog and bovine pancreas) PLA2s.

Open table in a new tab An asynchronous culture of the FcB1 strain of P. falciparumwas grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of various toxic (from A. mellifera, N. mossambica, A. halys, and C. adamanteus) and non-toxic (from hog and bovine pancreas) PLA2s. Respective concentrations leading to 50% parasite growth inhibition (IC50) were determined via the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation test and expressed either in molarity or in number of enzymatic units per ml.

Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). All PLA2s appeared toxic to P. falciparum, with IC50 values much lower than the minimum enzyme concentration required for 1% hemolysis. It should be noted, however, that the amount of released hemoglobin would hardly account for lysis being restricted to infected erythrocytes, owing to the low parasitemia in the test. PLA2s from venoms appear much more toxic to P. falciparum than pancreatic PLA2s, with low IC50 values ranging from 1.1 pm to 0.2 nm. Values were translated in terms of enzymatic units after the amount of active enzyme present in each PLA2commercial preparation had been checked by kinetic analysis of mixed micelles (Triton X-100/phosphatidylcholine) hydrolysis. The same differences in magnitude were found (see Table I); IC50s of toxic PLA2s ranged from 0.65 × 10−5 to 19.60 × 10−5 IU/ml, whereas IC50s of non-toxic PLA2s were 1.12 IU/ml (hog) and >0.15 IU/ml (bovine). Several conclusions may be drawn from these data. If added to cell culture, both sets of PLA2 (toxic and non-toxic) are able to stop parasite development; as previously shown (21Moll G.N. Vial H.J. van der Wiele F.C. Ancelin M.L. Roelofsen B. Slotboom A.J. de Haas G.H. van Deenen L.L.M. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), PLA2 concentrations effective in killing parasite are clearly much lower than concentrations required to lyse healthy red blood cells; pancreatic PLA2s are very inefficient in parasite killing compared with venom PLA2s. From these results, the bee venom (toxic) and hog pancreas (non-toxic) PLA2s were chosen for further investigations. Because some situations have been reported where cytotoxicity or biological effects due to secreted PLA2s were independent of catalytic activity, we analyzed the importance of PLA2 enzymatic activity inPlasmodium growth arrest by chemical inhibition of the bee venom and hog pancreas enzymes by p-BPB (27Roberts M.F. Deems R.A. Mincey T.C. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2405-2411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction of PLA2s with p-BPB has been shown to be active site-directed, leaving the overall conformation of the protein mainly unchanged and free to interact with other molecules. Inhibition of the venom and pancreatic enzyme activities was measured in assays using mixed micelles as substrates. In our hands, PLA2 inhibition by p-BPB never reached 100%, and the best inhibition rates that could be obtained varied from 80 to 95%. Bee venom PLA2 and hog pancreas PLA2 used in the experiment presented in Fig. 1 were inhibited by 95 and 94%, respectively. Analysis of the growth inhibition of the FcB1 strain in the presence ofp-BPB-treated enzymes (Fig. 1) shows that their lethal effect depends largely upon enzymatic activity in both cases, since the IC50 of bee PLA2 is increased by more than 2 log units upon enzyme inhibition and the IC50 of hog pancreas PLA2 by more than 1 log unit upon inhibition, even though both enzymes were not totally inactivated. The same results were obtained with different batches of phospholipases A2, making it most unlikely that a p-BPB-sensitive contaminant from the commercial preparation would be responsible for the observed effect. It must be noted that IC50 value of native bee PLA2 in Fig. 1 appeared higher (70 pm) than IC50 value in Table I (1.1 pm), indicating that some enzyme has been lost during the successive steps of the inhibition procedure. The more effective killing of parasites by toxic PLA2s compared with non-toxic ones led us to question their respective mechanisms of lethal action. One possible explanation was the higher penetration power of toxic PLA2s into a lipid mono- or bilayer compared with non-toxic PLA2s. Indeed, the penetration power of PLA2 enzymes depends on lipid pressure of the layer (29Demel R.A. Geurts van Kessel W.S.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Roelofsen B. van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 406: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and disorganization of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer in parasitized cells is expressed in part by a decreased lateral surface pressure compared with intact erythrocytes. Mollet al. (21Moll G.N. Vial H.J. van der Wiele F.C. Ancelin M.L. Roelofsen B. Slotboom A.J. de Haas G.H. van Deenen L.L.M. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1024: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) report the preferential attack ofPlasmodium-infected erythrocytes by a modified pig pancreas PLA2 with enhanced penetration power. However, if we hypothesize that killing of parasites strictly depends upon enzyme capacity to penetrate the erythrocyte membrane, we must notice that although all PLA2s tested kill parasites, the number of enzymatic units required to kill is very different between toxic and non toxic PLA2s, suggesting that the substrate itself,i.e. the infected erythrocyte, might be “seen” differently by the two types of enzymes. First of all, we analyzed the effects of bee venom and hog pancreas PLA2s on the intraerythrocytic cell cycle of P. falciparum. Parasites from the FcB1 strain were synchronized. Cultures of young rings at 1–1.5% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit were distributed into 96-well plates in RPMI containing 7% heat-inactivated human serum. The minimum concentration of PLA2 enzyme leading to 100% inhibition of the parasite growth (IC100m) was determined from curves of growth inhibition plotted as a function of PLA2concentration (not shown). Bee PLA2 IC100m was set at 30 pm, and hog PLA2 IC100m was set at 500 nm. PLA2s at these concentrations were added to the cell cultures at different times of the 48 h cell cycle, and parasitemia from each well was determined on Giemsa-stained smears after 60 h. 100% re-invasion was determined from control cultures under the same conditions but in the absence of PLA2. Experiments were repeated twice with red blood cells and serums from different donors. Results are presented in Fig. 2. When added to culture medium early in the cell cycle (at the young ring stage), bee PLA2prevented re-invasion, but when added beyond the 25–29-h period (i.e. the young trophozoite stage), bee PLA2 displayed only a slight inhibitory effect on parasite re-invasion. In contrast, almost no re-invasion was observed upon the addition of hog PLA2 to the culture, regardless of the time of addition, demonstrating that killing potencies of the two PLA2s at IC100ms are different. Furthermore, we could notice from the observation of the Giemsa-stained smears that the healthy erythrocytes of the PLA2s-treated cultures were shrunk, with an echinocytic shape, compared with the control erythrocytes. The results obtained with bee venom PLA2 might be explained either by the necessity for a long period of time for the toxic activity to exert its effect (i.e. the longer the time of incubation with PLA2, the more deleterious the effect on cells) or by a specific targeting of the toxic effect to pre-schizogonic forms of the intraerythrocytic Plasmodium, whereas hog pancreas PLA2 would exert its toxic effect on any development stage. Since in vitrocultivation of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum is performed in the presence of human serum, it was possible that phospholipids from serum lipoproteins might be substrates of PLA2s as well as phospholipid"

Cell. 1993; 75: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). These polypeptides belong to a growing family of membrane proteins that lack a signal sequence and are anchored in the membrane by a hydrophobic segment at the C terminus (5Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends. Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These tail-anchored proteins can be found at the plasma membrane as well as on intracellular membrane compartments, and evidence suggests that gene families as well as alternative splicing mechanisms may generate products with distinct hydrophobic C-terminal peptides that determine subcellular localizations and hence function (6Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 7Spring J.M. Kato M. Bernfield M. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 124-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The membrane insertion of these polypeptides is believed to be achieved by unique mechanisms that do not require the signal recognition particle (8Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). An important feature in these polypeptides is an extended coiled-coil structure, believed to be important for their intermolecular interactions (9Zhang P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Chapman E.R. An S. Barton H. Jahn R. J. Biol.

We have previously defined the cloning of a series of cDNAs that encode polypeptides, which were found to be associated with cardiac membranes, referred to as SLAPs1 (for sarcolemmal-associated proteins (12Wigle J.T. Demchyshyn L. Pratt M.A.C. Staines W.A. Salih M. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32384-32394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). Three different SLAP transcripts expressed in cardiac tissue were found to contain unique 5′ and common 3′ sequences that encode three SLAP polypeptides (37-kDa SLAP1, 46-kDa SLAP2, and 74-kDa SLAP3). The most noticeable structural features of SLAPs include their predicted ability to form an extended coiled coil over most of their length and a putative transmembrane domain at the extreme C terminus, although there was no consensus signal sequence (12Wigle J.T. Demchyshyn L. Pratt M.A.C. Staines W.A. Salih M. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32384-32394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicate that SLAPs are integral membrane proteins that localize to the cell membrane as well as intracellular membranes, but it is not known whether the putative transmembrane domain found in the SLAPs is responsible for their membrane integration (12Wigle J.T. Demchyshyn L. Pratt M.A.C. Staines W.A. Salih M. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32384-32394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although we do not know the physiological role of the SLAPs, the proteins share common core features with the tail-anchored membrane proteins and hence may play important roles in membrane biology. In this regard, homology searches of the GenBankTM data base revealed that the SLAP1 isoform shares high nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity with TOPAP, a topographically graded antigen of the chick visual system implicated in the neuronal guidance and development of the chick retinotectal map (13Savitt J.M. Trisler D. Hilt D.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The molecular properties of TOPAP reveal that it is a 35-kDa coiled-coil protein with a putative transmembrane domain at the C terminus, which is believed to be localized at the cell membrane. There was strong identity (76% at the amino acid level) between avian TOPAP and the 37-kDa SLAP1 isoform over most of the coding region, with the differences noted in the predicted transmembrane domains in the two polypeptides. This finding led us to hypothesize that avian TOPAP and mammalian SLAP may be derived by alternative splicing mechanisms from a common gene. We therefore undertook studies to determine the genomic organization of the 3′ region of the SLAP gene, which revealed that mammalian SLAP1 and avian TOPAP are generated by alternative splicing mechanisms that are highly conserved among mammalian and avian species. In addition, we report that the alternatively spliced products were expressed in a developmental and tissue-specific manner and the putative transmembrane domains were responsible for their membrane integration. The screening of the rabbit genomic λ DashII library (Stratagene) with a radiolabeled restriction fragment of SLAP3 cDNA (U21157; 324 nt AvaI-HindIII, 1607–1931) led to the isolation of three positive clones (R-2, R-13, R-14). A full-length SLAP3 cDNA probe, SalI-EcoRI (nt 1–3017), was also used to screen a mouse genomic λ DashII library, and two additional clones (M-2 and M-3) were isolated. The genomic clones were digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and KpnI, resolved on agarose gels, and blotted onto MCI nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized at 65 °C for 16 h, withAvaI-HindIII and SalI-EcoRI cDNA radiolabeled probes in 10% polyethylene glycol, 7% SDS and 2.5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA. The membranes were then washed at 60 °C for 30 min and using intensifying screens were exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film at −70 °C for 16 to 24 h. The positive restriction fragments of the genomic λ clones were subcloned into pBlueScript KS (Stratagene) and sequenced. Mouse spleen and human cardiac cDNA libraries constructed in λZAP were screened with aSalI-EcoRI restriction fragment of rabbit SLAP3 cDNA encompassing the entire coding region of SLAP3 (U21157, nt 1–3017). Among the various positive clones obtained, mouse spleen clone 15.1 and human cardiac clone 12.3 were in vivo excised, and the nucleotide sequences were determined using AmpliTaqsequencing methodology (ABI) and analyzed with SeqAidII (University of Kansas), PROSITE, PSORT, and BLAST. Total RNA was prepared from dissected tissues using the TriPure methodology (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For developmental expression, RNA was prepared from rat heart, brain, and muscle at fetal (day 18 of gestation), neonatal (day 4), and adult stages. First-strand cDNA synthesis reaction contained 1.0 μg of RNA, 200 units of SuperScript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.), and random hexamers. 10 μl of the first-strand product was used as a template in PCR reactions (50 μl total) with a final concentration of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 0.01% gelatin, 3 mm MgCl2, 400 μm dNTPs, and 0.3 μm primers P1 (5′-ATGGATGAGCAAGACCTG; U21157, nt 1709–1726); P2, (3′-GCTGCTTGATGAAGGAGC; U21157, nt 1942–1956); P3 (5′-TCAATCACAGATGAGC TC; U21157, nt 2516–2533); and P4 (3′-CCTCTTTACAGACAGATAC; U21157, nt 2834–2852). A single round of amplification was initiated by denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 94 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s (30 cycles). The last extension was carried out for 5 min at 72 °C. The amplicons were resolved on a 1% agarose gel and gel-purified, and the DNA was recovered by gel extraction (Qiagen). Following restriction digestion of amplicons with EcoRI andXhoI restriction enzymes, PCR products were subcloned (pBlueScript KS) and sequenced. Developmental amplification of the 3′ end of the SLAP was carried out with primers P5 (CAGTGCTCTCAGAACTGAAG; TOPAPU17000, nt 923–942) and P6 (CTTCTAAAGGGAGGAC GGTG; TOPAP, nt 1261–1242) based on the conserved sequences among chicken, rabbit, mouse and human forms. In a series of experiments, the DNA fragments separated on agarose gels were stained with VistraGreen (Molecular Dynamics) and digitalized with the STORM system (Molecular Dynamics) to determine the net intensities of the different size amplicons. A Myc-tagged SLAP expression construct in pcDNA3 vectors (Invitrogen) was generated as described previously (12Wigle J.T. Demchyshyn L. Pratt M.A.C. Staines W.A. Salih M. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32384-32394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SLAP lacking both of the putative TM domains (encoded by exons X and XI, respectively), was generated by PCR amplification of Myc-tagged SLAP with the following primers: Myc6 (5′-GAATTCAATGGATGAGCAAG ACCT G-3′) and TM (5′-CCGTCTAGATCATTGGAGCAGCTTCAGGTTGTC-3′). Subsequently, the PCR amplicon was restriction digested with EcoRI andXbaI and subcloned into the pBlueScript KS vector. The 6-Myc-tagged SLAP cDNA lacking both TM domains was then excised with KpnI/XbaI, ligated to the pcDNA3 expression vector, and specified as TM−. A SLAP construct containing an alternative TM domain encoded by exon X (TM1) was constructed by digestion of the exon X+ construct with theSstI restriction enzyme and ligated into the SstI predigested 6-Myc-tagged (TM−) pcDNA3 construct lacking both TM domains and specified as TM1. A construct containing a constitutively expressed putative TM domain encoded by exon XI was prepared by restriction digestion of SLAP with EcoRI and XbaI and ligated in frame to the 6-Myc-tagged pBlueScript KS vector. Following excision of the 6-Myc-SLAP with KpnI andXbaI, the insert was ligated to pcDNA3 and specified as TM2. C2C12 cells were transfected with SLAP plasmids (TM1, TM2, and TM−) using the calcium phosphate method to isolate stable transfectants in G418 antibiotic and processed for immunohistochemistry with anti-Myc antibodies as described previously (12Wigle J.T.

Subcellular fractionation of C2C12 cells was performed to isolate homogenate, membrane, and cytosoilc fractions (14Resh M.D. Erikson R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc as described previously (12Wigle J.T.

Previous studies have identified three SLAP isoforms, SLAP1, SLAP2, and SLAP3, encoded by a single gene mapped to human chromosome 3p14.3–21.2. SLAP isoforms contain common core C-terminal sequences that are highly conserved, with variable N-terminal sequences giving rise to different isoforms. Furthermore, human ESTs (gb N27488) exhibit 100% identity with the C-terminal sequence in rabbit SLAP, suggesting strong conservation and perhaps functional significance of this region of the molecule. To elucidate the genomic organization of the SLAP gene encompassing the common core region, rabbit and mouse genomic λ DashII DNA libraries were screened with SLAP cDNA restriction fragments used as hybridization probes (U21157, nt 1607–1931 and 1–3017) A total of five positive genomic clones from rabbit (R-2, R-13, R-14) and mouse (M-2 and M-3) were isolated, and the coding regions and intron-exon junctions of both the rabbit and mouseSLAP genes were mapped by restriction endonuclease, Southern blotting, and hybridization analysis. The various fragments were subcloned and partially sequenced to determine exon-exon boundaries. Characterization of genomic λ DASHII DNA clones revealed that they encompass the C-terminal common region of the SLAP isoforms (U21157, nt 1560–2675) and the entire encoding region of the SLAP1 transcript (Fig. 1). The results indicate that the SLAP1 isoform is composed of 11 exons spanning over 35 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA. The identified exons range in size from 60 to 321 bp, where exons I (60 nt) and II (81 nt) were untranslated in SLAP1, whereas they are coding exons in SLAP2 and SLAP3 isoforms. The initiating methionine of the SLAP1 isoform residing in exon III (60 nt) conforms to the Kozak consensus sequence. Utilization of this methionine predicts generation of a 322-amino acid polypeptide of 35.4 kDa as previously shown to be expressed in cardiac muscle. Exons VII (118 nt) and VIII (172 nt) both contain the predicted specialized coiled-coil leucine zippers, whereas exon VIII contains, in addition, a glutamate stretch composed of six glutamate heptad repeats. Exon XI encodes a stretch of hydrophobic residues that potentially represent a transmembrane anchor of SLAPs. Exons IV (142 nt) and X (90 nt) were found to be alternatively spliced (discussed below).Figure 1Genomic organization of the 3′ region of the SLAP gene. Rabbit and mouse genomic λ DashII DNA libraries were screened with two 32P-radiolabeled SLAP cDNA probes (U21157; nt 1607–1931 and 1–3017) to isolate five positive genomic clones (R-2, R-13, and R-14 from rabbit and M-2 and M-3 from mouse).The DNA was isolated, restriction mapped, and sequenced to elucidate the intron-exon junctions in both the rabbit and mouseSLAP genes. Characterization of genomic λ DASHII DNA clones revealed the presence of 11 exons that encode the common C-terminal core of the three isoforms (SLAP1, SLAP2, andSLAP3) (U21157; nt 1560–2675).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All of the exon-intron boundaries encompassing the common region of SLAP isoforms conform to the consensus splice donor and acceptor sites (Fig. 2 A) (15Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). In addition, the exon-exon boundaries in mouse and rabbit were also determined to be conserved (Fig. 2 B). The size of the SLAP introns range from 0.2 to 5.5 kilobase pairs. All of the identified introns begin with a “gt” and end with an “ag.” Introns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 represent class 1 introns, where each intron interrupts the coding sequence between the first and second bases of the codon. Intron 8 belongs to class 2 (it interrupts the second and the third bases of the codon), and introns 9, 10, and 11 are class 0 (the intron occurs between codons). As introns 1–7 and 9–11 represent introns of the same class, the open reading frames are good candidates for exon shuffling. Moreover, as the alternative exons IV and X are flanked on either side by class 1 or class 0 introns, respectively, the alternative splicing results in a conservation of the open reading frame of SLAP. To further investigate the molecular nature of SLAP, human cardiac and mouse spleen λZAP cDNA libraries were screened using a rabbit SLAPSalI-EcoRI cDNA fragment (U21157, nt 1–3017) as a probe. A total of 55 and 43 positive clones were isolated from the human and mouse libraries, respectively. Following a detailed sequence analysis, the common SLAP regions were found to be highly conserved, although two areas of sequence divergence were identified when compared with the previously published rabbit SLAP1 sequence (Fig. 3). The nucleotide sequence alignment revealed that mouse and human SLAP1 cDNAs contain sequence insertions of 142 and 90 nt that are highly conserved between the two species. Moreover, the sites of the novel sequence inclusions are identical in both human and mouse cDNAs, i.e. after nucleotides 1700 and 2582 of rabbit SLAP cDNA, respectively. The open reading frame analysis revealed (see Fig. 5) that both of the novel inserts are in frame with the open reading frame of SLAP cDNA.Figure 5Alternative splicing is conserved among mammalian and avian species. RT-PCR of RNA from retina was performed as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4 to amplify the 5′ and 3′ regions of divergence in SLAP1; the PCR fragments were isolated and the DNA sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence alignments of the 5′ and 3′ regions of SLAP from rabbit heart, rat retina, mouse spleen, human heart and chicken retina indicates that the alternative sequences are in frame with the SLAP1 sequence and highly conserved among species (panels A and B). Furthermore, the sites of insertion are also conserved among the various species.Panel A demonstrates a 43-amino acid sequence that is highly conserved among species. Panel B reveals a 30-amino acid peptide that includes a premature in-frame termination that also was conserved among all species analyzed to date. Moreover, sequence alignment reveals that the rabbit sequence contains an additional Asp (asparagine) residue that is absent in other species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the identified novel sequences are also present in rabbit SLAP, RT-PCR analysis of RNA from rabbit heart was performed with primers (P1 and P2 as well as P3 and P4) designed to amplify SLAP containing the regions of divergence. Rabbit cardiac tissue was selected, as previous studies have shown that the heart is a good expressor of the different SLAP isoforms (12Wigle J.T. Demchyshyn L. Pratt M.A.C. Staines W.A. Salih M. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32384-32394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results, shown in Fig. 4, indicate that two distinct fragments were amplified by each set of primers based in the 5′ region (P1 and P2) or the 3′ region (P3 and P4) of SLAP from heart RNA (lane H). An additional fragment of 389 bp was amplified from heart RNA compared with the 247-bp fragment expected from SLAP1 cDNA (lane +) in the 5′ region. A fragment of 426 bp was amplified from heart RNA in addition to the expected 336-bp fragment from SLAP1 cDNA (lane +) in the 3′ region. Following subcloning of these fragments, a detailed sequence analysis revealed that the 389-bp fragment contained the 142-nt sequence in the 5′ region of SLAP, and the 426-bp fragment contained the 90-nt sequence at the 3′ region of SLAP. The two rabbit cardiac variants were also generated by the inclusion of 142- and 900-nt sequences after nucleotides 1700 and 2522, respectively, as noted in the human and mouse SLAP variants. It, therefore, appears that inclusion of the 142- and 90-nt sequences could be generated by alternative splicing and are highly conserved regions among various species. A BLAST search of the SLAP1 sequence indicated that it exhibits 76% identity with avian TOPAP (GenBankTMaccession number U17000), a protein expressed in a topographic gradient in the developing chicken retina (13Savitt J.M. Trisler D. Hilt D.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further analysis indicated that avian TOPAP also contains the 142- and 90-nt sequences identified in the new SLAP1 splice variants described above. To determine whether the mammalian retina also expresses these SLAP1 splice variants, an RT-PCR of RNA from rat retina was performed with the 5′ and 3′ primers described above, and two fragments were identified that contained the 142- and the 90-nt sequence inserts. The results of the deduced amino acid sequence alignment of rabbit, mouse, rat, and chick SLAP1 variants are summarized in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 A demonstrates that the 142-nt novel sequence encodes a 43-amino acid peptide sequence that is highly conserved among species. Fig. 5 B reveals that the 90-nt sequence encoding the C-terminal 30-amino acid peptide includes a premature in-frame termination codon (TGA) that is also conserved among all species analyzed The 3′ alternative sequence would therefore encode an alternative hydrophobic C terminus in SLAP polypeptides. Moreover, sequence alignment reveals that the rabbit sequence contains an additional Asp residue, which is absent in other species. The significance of the extra asparagine remains unclear at present time. Thus, it is clear that the 142- and 90-nt novel sequences that were identified represent the alternatively spliced exons IV and X of the SLAP gene. In view of the strong conservation of sequence and alternative splicing of exons IV and X in mammalian and avian species, studies were carried out to determine the tissue-specific expression of these SLAP variants. RT-PCR analysis was employed to characterize SLAP expression in various rabbit tissues with primers P1 and P2 to amplify the 5′ alternative regions and P3 and P4 for the 3′ alternative variants of SLAP. The results of RT-PCR analysis of tissue-specific expression of the 5′ region of SLAP reveal that all of the tissues examined express the two variants: a higher molecular size fragment of (389 nt), which encode a variant with the alternative exon IV, and a lower fragment of (247 bp) without the alternative exon (Fig. 6). In heart (H), soleus (Sol), fast-twitch muscle (FT), and lungs (Lu), the lower molecular size isoform (without the alternative exon IV) appears to be more predominant. On the other hand, the kidneys (K), pancreas (P), spleen (Sp), liver (Li), and ovaries (O) express preferentially the higher molecular size isoform encoding the alternative exon IV. In brain (B), the expression of both isoforms appear to be similar. Analysis of the tissue-specific expression pattern of the 3′ alternative exon also utilized the RT-PCR approach using primers P3 and P4, which would amplify two products of 426 and 336 nt. The results of the analysis (Fig. 6 B) indicate that all of the tissues examined express the two variants, with and without the alternative exon X. However, these variants are expressed at different levels. Heart (H), the left and right ventricles (LV andRV), septum (Sep), atria (A), and pancreas (P) demonstrate a higher expression of the lower molecular size isoform (without the alternative exon X), whereas kidney (K), lung (Lu), spleen (Sp), liver (Li), and ovaries (O) preferentially express the higher molecular size isoform (with the alternative exon X). None of the tissues examined appears to express exclusively any of the two alternatively spliced transcripts. Alternative splicing represents a fundamental process that generates tissue-specific and developmentally regulated pattern of gene expression. To determine whether the alternatively spliced variants of SLAPs were expressed in a developmentally regulated manner, mRNA from three distinct stages of rat development (fetal (day 18 of gestation), neonatal, and adult tissue) was examined by RT-PCR analysis with primers that would amplify the appropriate regions in SLAP and its variants. Fig. 7 A depicts RT-PCR amplification of the 5′ alternative region of SLAP from various developmental stages with the primers P1 and P2, which resulted in amplification of two products of 389 and 247 nt, with and without exon IV, respectively. Quantification of the results by densitometry of the relative level of each variant at each stage of development is indicated (Fig. 7 A, bar graph). In the heart, the expression of the variant lacking alternative exon IV (IV−) is about 20-fold higher at all stages of development relative to the variant with the alternative exon IV (IV+). In brain, on the other hand the expression of the IV− variant is about 1.5-fold higher at the fetal stage compared with the IV+; this pattern of expression is seen to reverse in the neonatal and adult brain. The level of expression of the IV− variant in fast twitch skeletal muscle was found to increase from 3-fold to about 9-fold during development relative to the IV+ variant. RT-PCR of the 3′ alternative region of SLAP using primers P5 and P6 and RNA from various developmental stages resulted in amplification of 428- and 338-nt products, with and without exon X, respectively (Fig. 7 B). In the heart, the expression of the X− variant increases from 1.5-fold at the neonatal stage to about 2.5-fold in the adult myocardium compared with the X+ variant. In brain, on the other hand, the expression of the X+ variant is about 1.5-fold higher at the fetal and neonatal stage compared with the X− variant. Interestingly, the expression of the X− variant in the adult brain was about 2-fold higher then the X+ variant. The relative expression of the X+ variant was about 1.5-fold higher in neonatal and fetal skeletal muscle and increased by twice in adult tissue. Although both SLAP and TOPAP have been shown to be integral membrane proteins that lack a signal sequence, it remains to be defined whether the hydrophobic C termini direct their membrane integration. Expression constructs of SLAP either lacking the putative TM domains or containing TM1 or TM2 tagged with Myc were transfected into C2C12 myoblasts and the localization studied by immunohistochemistry and subcellular fractionation (Fig. 8). Staining of the C2C12 cells with anti-Myc shows a clear pattern of the perinuclear and reticular membrane networks in cells expressing SLAP constructs containing the putative TM1 or TM2 sequences. Cells expressing SLAP constructs lacking these sequences exhibited a diffuse pattern of staining throughout the cytosol. Subcellular fractionation of these C2C12 cells was performed, and the various fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-Myc. TM1- and TM2-containing SLAP was found to be enriched in the membrane fractions, whereas the TM− construct (SLAP lacking TM1 and TM2) was enriched in the cytosolic fraction. It therefore appears that hydrophobic sequences encoded in exons X and XI serve to direct the SLAP polypeptide into membrane systems. We have elucidated the genomic organization of the 3′ region of the SLAP gene encoding the common C-terminal region of the various SLAP isoforms. The common region (nt 1560–2675 of SLAP3 cDNA U21157) spreads over more than 35 kilobase pairs of continuous DNA and consists of 11 exons. All of the exon-intron junctions display the consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences. Moreover, rabbit and mouse SLAP gene exon-exon boundaries are identical in the common region, indicative of conservation of genomic structure and splicing mechanisms. In addition, the results demonstrates that SLAP isoform heterogeneity, arising because of alternative usage of the N terminus, is further diversified by alternative splicing of a primary transcript in two areas (exons IV and X) of the 3′ region of the SLAP gene. The sequence of the alternatively spliced SLAP variant was found to be similar (>90% identity) to TOPAP, a coiled-coil membrane protein thought to be involved in the development of the avian retinotectal map. Thus, avian TOPAP and mammalian SLAP1 are spliced variants, and the observed evolutionary conservation of the alternative splicing in human, rabbit, rat, mouse, and chicken strongly suggests that alternative exons may have functional roles that have been maintained by natural selection. Alternative splicing of exon IV results in an in-frame inclusion of a 142-nt sequence encoding a 43 amino acid peptide that is predicted to adopt and extend by 11 turns the α-helical secondary structure of SLAP1 (12Wigle J.T.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of exon IV also results in the introduction of a putative casein kinase II phosphorylation site ([S/T]xx[D/E]). Casein kinase II represents a ubiquitous kinase found in the nucleus and cytoplasm, which phosphorylates multiple substrates involved in control of cell division and signal transduction (16Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). This putative phosphorylation site introduced by alternative splicing is not, however, unique, as the SLAP3 isoform polypeptide contains numerous putative phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (more than 20 sites). Although in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation studies of this site remain to be performed, its conservation among species strongly suggests a functional role. The alternative exon X, on the other hand, introduces a highly hydrophobic segment containing a premature in-frame termination codon and represents the putative transmembrane domain found in TOPAP. Alternative splicing of exon X, therefore, generates a polypeptide with a putative alternative membrane anchor. Immunocytochemical localization and subcellular fractionation studies of SLAP polypeptides containing either exon X or XI demonstrated that these sequences are necessary for SLAP integration into membranes, because the absence of these exons resulted in exclusion of SLAP from membrane structures. Therefore, mutually exclusive transmembrane domains encoded by exons X and XI, respectively, are responsible for targeting SLAP to membrane systems. Analysis of the alternatively spliced variants of SLAP revealed developmental changes in the expression of the alternative exons IV and X in tissues such as the brain. In addition, expression of the alternative variants was found to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The observed developmental and tissue-specific splicing of the alternative exons is indicative of a functional differentiation of the alternative variants. Interestingly, SLAP heterogeneity due to alternative N-terminal usage and diversity due to alternative splicing could together generate up to 12 distinct SLAP variants. Although the exact functional role of the SLAP variants remains to be defined, it is apparent that several of the splice variants have been localized to the cell membrane as well as to intracellular membranes, suggesting a role in membrane function (12Wigle J.T. Demchyshyn L. Pratt M.A.C. Staines W.A. Salih M. Tuana B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32384-32394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Savitt J.M. Trisler D. Hilt D.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 253-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this regard, avian TOPAP, which our data reveals to be a SLAP variant, has been proposed to be localized at the cell surface to serve a role in neuronal guidance in the developing chick retina; it is conceivable that the mammalian orthologue would serve a similar function. In this regard, mRNA transcripts for both SLAP1 and the variant TOPAP were found to be expressed in mammalian retina. It is apparent from the results presented that the SLAPs are targeted to the membrane by the alternatively spliced C-terminal hydrophobic domains. In this regard, the SLAPs belong to the emerging family of tail-anchored coiled-coil membrane proteins, which lack a signal sequence and contain a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Several members of the tail-anchored family are involved in diverse and important cellular processes including docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with plasma membrane (syntaxin 1 and synaptobrevin) and intracellular vesicle trafficking (syntaxins). It has been postulated that the syntaxin family of proteins form intermolecular interactions via their coiled-coil structures with other protein components of the vesicular transport pathway machinery, thus mediating vesicle targeting, membrane fusion, and endocytotic membrane recycling. Syntaxin 1 is a neuronal cell membrane protein that interacts with SNAP-25 (9Zhang P. Chen Y.A. Tam D. Chung D. Scheller R.H. Miljanich G.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), synaptobrevin (10Chapman E.R. An S. Barton H. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and indirectly with synaptotagmin, a Ca2+ sensor of vesicle endocytosis. In addition, syntaxin also interacts with the N-type Ca2+ channel (11Sheng Z.H. Rettig J. Cook T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), thus localizing it to the site of vesicle release. The direct binding between components of exocytotic machinery is mediated by α-helical heptad domains that form intermolecular coiled-coil structures. It is notable that syntaxin 2 is a tail-anchored family member known to contain alternative transmembrane domains generated by splicing mechanisms similar to that described herein for the SLAP isoforms (3Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that syntaxin contains different C termini generated by alternative splicing, a specific function for the variants beyond simply anchorage to the membrane is suggested. Thus, the SLAP variants, by virtue of their structural features and cellular locations, are likely to play significant roles in cell function."

Among the high molecular mass water-soluble proteins, proenkephalin-A (PEA)1 and a family of acidic proteins, named chromogranins, constitute the major constituents of the chromaffin granules.

PEA generates enkephalins, other opioid peptides, and other derived peptides (PEAPs), which display various biological effects, including antinociception and immunomodulation (5Plotnikoff N.P.

Because large amounts of enkephalins and enkephalin-containing peptides are found in adrenal medullary chromaffin granules, these organelles represent an excellent model to study the intragranular processing of PEA (6Dillen L.

Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), showing that PEA processing proceeds through an orderly series of steps. Similarly to other precursors, PEA processing appears to start with the removal of the bovine C-terminal peptide B (PEA209–239) (10Mathis J.P. Lindberg I.

Among the intragranular matrix components, enkelytin, an antibacterial peptide corresponding to the bisphosphorylated fragment PEAP209–237, was identified (14Goumon Y. Strub J.M. Moniatte M.

The antibacterial spectrum of enkelytin shows that this peptide is active in the micromolar range against several Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, but it is not able to inhibit Gram-negative bacterial growth nor to lyse erythrocytes (15Goumon Y.

In addition, the two antibacterial C-terminal PEAPs, enkelytin (PEAP209–237) and the bisphosphorylated peptide B (PEAP209–239) are secreted from stimulated cultured chromaffin cells and are immunodetectable in wound fluids and polymorphonuclear neutrophil secretions (15Goumon Y.

The co-release of enkelytin and PEAP209–239 with catecholamines suggests that in stressful situations, these peptides may play an important role in defense mechanisms. Recently, we have described the release of the antibacterial form of the peptide B in the hemolymph of leech (Theromyzon tessulatum) and mussel (Mytilus edulis) following lipopolysaccaride stimulation, surgical trauma, and electrical stimulation of the neural tissues (18Tasiemski A.

Thus, the antibacterial C-terminal fragments PEA209–237/239 that are expressed in the nervous and immune systems appear to be highly conserved during evolution and may provide a basis for neuroimmune interactions (5Plotnikoff N.P.

In the present work, we used reverse phase HPLC, peptide sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify all the PEAPs (in addition to Leu- and Met-enkephalins and whole PEA) present in chromaffin granules and chromaffin cell secretions. Thirty PEAPs have been characterized, indicating that preferential proteolytic attacks are located at the N- and C-terminal regions (PEA1–116 and PEA209–239, respectively), as well as 16 new proteolytic cleavage sites. Among all the naturally released PEAPs, enkelytin, the antibacterial C-terminal fragment corresponding to the bisphosphorylated form (Ser221 and Ser223) of PEA209–237 was a predominant component. In addition, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a very efficient tool for the identification of peptides in biological materials. Secretory granules were isolated from bovine adrenal medulla according to Smith and Winkler (19Smith A.D. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), except that sucrose solutions were buffered with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7). Granules were lysed by successive freezing and thawing in 10 mmHepes (pH 7). Granule membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min (20Aunis D. Bouclier M. Pescheloche M. Mandel P. J. Neurochem. 1977; 29: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The supernatant was collected, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. In some experiments, protease inhibitors were included in solutions, but their presence did not modify the pattern of proteolytic fragments. Chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands and cultured as described previously (3Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 107 cells/50 mm in plastic Petri dishes. After 3 days in culture, the medium was removed, and cells were washed four times with Locke's solution (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, 0.5 mm ascorbic acid, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and subsequently stimulated for 10 min with Locke's solution containing 10 μm nicotine. External medium was carefully collected, completed with trifluoroacetic acid up to 0.1%, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. PEAPs were isolated using the Applied Biosystems HPLC system 140 B. Chromatography was performed on a Macherey Nagel Nucleosil 300-5C18 column (4 × 250 mm; particle size, 5 mm). Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 700 μl/min using gradient as shown on chromatogram. The sequence of purified peptides was determined in our laboratory by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473A microsequencer. Samples purified by HPLC were loaded on polybrene-treated and precycled glass fiber filters (3Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). PTH-derivatives (Pth-Xaa) were identified by chromatography on a C-18 column (PTH C-18, 2.1 × 200 mm). Mass determination was carried out in our laboratory on a Brucker BIFLEXTM MALDI-TOF equipped with the SCOUTTM system, High Resolution Optics with X-Y multisample probe, a gridless reflector, and the HIMASTMlinear detector. This instrument has a maximum accelerating potential of 30 kV and may be operated either in the linear or reflector mode. Ionization was accomplished with a 337-nm beam from a nitrogen laser with a repetition rate of 3 Hz. The output signal from the detector was digitized at a sampling rate of 250 MHz in linear mode and 500 MHz in reflector mode using a 1 GHz digital oscilloscope (Lecroy model). The instrument control and data processing were accomplished with software supplied by Bruker using a Sun Sparc workstation. These studies were realized using as the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) prepared as a satured solution in acetone. Aliquots (1–2 μl) of the sample matrix solution were deposited onto probe tips and air dried. After fast spreading and fast evaporation of the solvent, we obtained a thin layer of matrix crystals (21Vorm O. Mann M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spec. 1994; 5: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A micromolar analyte solution was applied to the matrix and allowed to dry under moderate vacuum. This preparation was washed by applying 0.7 μl of a 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in water solution and then flushed after a few seconds. This cleaning procedure often allows an increase in sensitivity and mass accuracy by removing the remaining cations. Soluble intragranular proteins were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 17% acrylamide (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). To detect immunologically reactive fragments, proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose sheets (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and immunodetection was performed as previously reported (3Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Immediately after the preparation of soluble material from bovine chromaffin granules, a separation by chromatography on a reverse phase C-18 column was performed (Fig. 1 A). PEAPs were recovered in fractions labeled 1–3, according to the immunoreactivity with antisera raised against NH2- and COOH-specific peptides (PEAP63–70 and PEAP224–237, respectively; Fig. 1 B). By comparison with the theoretical molecular mass deduced from the PEA amino acid sequence (24Noda M. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Toyosato M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 295: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), we have attributed several experimental values obtained after MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of HPLC fractions 1–3 (Fig. 1 C). In fraction 1, we have identified the N-terminal fragment PEA1–70 (7731.9 Da) and different forms of the C-terminal peptide 209–237, corresponding to non-phosphorylated PEAP209–237 (3355.7 Da) and the mono-, bis-, and tri-phosphorylated forms (3434.3, 3513.6, and 3594.0 Da), as shown in the spectrum window 3200–3900 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, by direct MALDI-TOF analysis, enkelytin, the antibacterial peptide corresponding to the major and bisphosphorylated form (Ser221, Ser223) of PEA209–237 (14Goumon Y. Strub J.M. Moniatte M. Nullans G. Poteur L. Hubert P. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 516-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was easily identified by its specific molecular mass (3513.6 Da). Direct MALDI-TOF analysis of fraction 2 indicated three peptides located in the core of PEA and corresponding to PEA80–106 (3007.1 Da), PEA80–115 (4098.8 Da), and PEA116–162 (4998.8 Da). Fraction 3 corresponds to large fragments located in the PEA1–223 (Fig. 1 B) and characterized after additional purifications (see below).Figure 23200–3900-Da window of the MALDI-TOF spectra of the peptidic material included in fraction 1 (Fig. 1). Among the detected molecules, peaks with m/z values of 3355.7, 3434.3, 3513.6 (enkelytin), and 3594.0 were respectively attributed to the non-, mono-, bis-, and tri-phosphorylated forms of PEAP209–237.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To characterize all the PEAPs present in the other fractions (Fig. 1 A), sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis were performed on the fractions eluted before and after peaks a and c, respectively. Only, Met- and Leu-enkephalins were found in the peaks preceding the fraction 1, whereas entire PEA was found in the peak eluted at 40% acetonitrile (data not shown). To complete this study, additional purifications by reverse phase HPLC were performed to (i) further identify the complex peptide mixture present in fraction 1, (ii) characterize the immunodetected N-terminal fragments (antisera 63–70) present in fractions 2 and 3 (Fig. 1 B), and (iii) elucidate the structure of median PEAPs located within the PEA core (). Thus, one of the repurification steps of fraction 2 is shown in Fig. 3 A. Five fractions (a–e) were recovered and analyzed by the combination of sequencing and MALDI-TOF analysis (Fig. 3 B). Five different PEAPs were identified, corresponding to sequences located in the core of the protein (, , ); two peptides are located in the N-terminal moiety (1–68 and 1–74). These data are in accordance with the Western blot results (Fig. 1 B). Two distinct fractions (d and e) contain an unique sequence corresponding to PEAP1–74, which suggests the presence of a thin difference in the spatial conformation of the peptides that may induce a difference in the elution of the peptide. For instance, this fragment includes three glutamine and one asparagine residues that may be partially deamidated during preparation, introducing additional negative charges to the molecule. The analysis of peak a (Fig. 1 A) shows the presence of PEAP80–105 and 80–106, which corresponds, respectively, to the amidorphin and its extended form. Finally, analysis of PEAPs included in fraction 1 allowed us to identify three N-terminal fragments (PEA1–68, PEA1–74, and PEA1–77), a median peptide (PEA116–155), and five C-terminal fragments corresponding to PEA209–232 (non-, mono-, and bis-phosphorylated), PEA209–235, and the phosphorylated form of PEA211–237, whereas the study of fraction 3 led to the characterization of PEA1–165 and PEA116–196. Thus, this complete analysis of the soluble intragranular material shows the presence of 25 different PEAPs (Table I) as the result of a complex proteolytic mechanism occurring along the polypeptide chain of PEA.

The location of different PEAPs was obtained by alignment with the full bovine PEA sequence (24Noda M. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Toyosato M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Numa S.

Predominantly recovered PEAPs are underlined, and names previously attributed are indicated. After stimulation of cultured chromaffin cells with 10 μm nicotine, PEAPs present in the extracellular medium were separated by HPLC on a reverse phase C-18 column (Fig. 5 A). Analysis of peaks 1–3 by sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 5 B) revealed that peaks 1 and 2 contain C-terminal fragments PEA209–237/239 with one, two, and three phosphate groups, whereas peak 3 contains a mixture of N- and C-terminal fragments PEA1–69/70/72 and PEA230–237. It is important to note that the predominant fragments exocytotically released from nicotine-stimulated cultured chromaffin cells were located in the N-terminal domain (PEA1–72, synenkephalin) and also in the C-terminal domain (PEA209–239) of the precursor (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the three cleavage sites Leu-Ala (69Loewe H. Baeger I. Knoll A. Herzig J.W. Arzneimittelforschung. 1999; 49: 297-303PubMed Google Scholar, 70Stein C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), Ala-Lys (70Stein C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 71Inturrisi C.E.

A. 1980; 77: 5512-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and Met-Glu (229) correspond to new proteolytic attacks that have not yet been identified. Interestingly, the mono- and bis-phosphorylated forms of PEA209–239 are concomitantly recovered in fractions 1 and 2. Because three phosphorylation sites (Ser215, Ser221, and Ser223; Fig. 4) are present in PEA, the fragments recovered in fractions 1 and 2 are not phosphorylated at identical positions, leading to different elution times. Taking together, the analysis of the PEAPs released in the extracellular space upon nicotine cell stimulation led to the identification of five new fragments, resulting from extracellular processing. It is well documented that pro-hormones and pro-neuropeptides are synthesized as inactive large precursors that are processed during their intracellular transport and their storage to generate active peptides (25Rouille Y. Duguay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva A.A.J. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 322-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 26Marx R. El Meskini R. Johns D.C. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8300-8311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversion of these precursors to smaller biologically active peptides requires specific proteolytic cleavages. Thus, several endopeptidases (cleaving inside the protein sequence) and exopeptidases (removing amino acids from the NH2- and COOH-ends) are involved in PEA maturation (6Dillen L. Miserez B. Claeys M. Aunis D. De Potter W. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 22: 315-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The knowledge of pro-hormone and pro-neuropeptide processing and of its relationship to the secretory pathway has significantly progressed during the last 5 years. In the trans-Golgi network, pro-hormones are thought to be sorted with processing enzymes into regulated secretory vesicles (27Payne C.M. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1989; 52: 277-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Within these organelles, pro-hormone processing is dependent on condensation-induced protein organization, on calcium concentration that may reach several mm (i.e. 20 mm in chromaffin granules), and on pH that is below 6.0 in most endocrine and neuroendocrine secretory granules (27Payne C.M. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1989; 52: 277-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Aunis D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 181: 213-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-hormone cleavage, occurring mainly at specific paired basic sites, takes place in a strict temporal order and is likely to involve a variety of endoproteases. This processing is completed in some cases by the combined action of amino- and carboxy-peptidases. In the present study we have identified 30 PEAPs generated during the intragranular and extracellular processing of PEA. Some of these peptides have never been described up to now. These data were made possible by the combination of sensitive methods, in particularly MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which allows for low level peptide analysis. An initial screening, based on the expected molecular mass of three immunoreactive fractions, resulting from the first HPLC purification of the soluble intragranular material led to the characterization of eight peptides. Analysis of fractions eluted before and after the peaks of interest indicated the presence of enkephalins and whole PEA. Then several additional purifications were crucial for the structural characterization of minor but numerous PEAPs present in immunoreactive fractions (Figs. 1 and 2). Further analyses identified 25 intragranular PEAPs in fractions 1–3 (Table I). Six major cleavage sites are located at positions 68–69 (Leu-Leu), 74–75 (Gly-Gly), 79–80 (Arg-Tyr), 115–116 (Lys-Asp), 208–209 (Arg-Phe), and 237–238 (Met-Arg), according to the bovine PEA sequence (24Noda M. Furutani Y. Takahashi H. Toyosato M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Numa S. Nature. 1982; 295: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Proteolytic sites located at positions 79–80, 115–116, 208–209, and 237–238 have been previously described (6Dillen L. Miserez B. Claeys M. Aunis D. De Potter W. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 22: 315-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas broken linkages 68–69 and 74–75 were identified in this study as new and major cleavage sites. In addition, 12 minor cleavage sites were characterized along the PEA polypeptide chain (Fig. 4), localized before dibasic sites such as 70–71 (Ala-Lys/Lys), 77–78 (Met-Lys/Arg), 106–107 (Gly-Lys/Arg), 113–114 (Met-Lys/Lys), 155–156 (Ser-Lys/Arg), and 165–166 (Leu-Lys/Arg) or after the dibasic sites 72–73 (Lys/Lys-Tyr) and 232–233 (Lsy/Arg-Tyr). Furthermore, cleavage points were identified at positions 162–163 (Met-Arg) and 163–164 (Arg-Gly) on both sides of Arg163 residue. Natural processing of Met-enkephalin was also observed at positions 74–75 (Tyr/Gly-Gly/Phe/Met) and 235–236 (Tyr/Gly/Gly-Phe/Met). Additional endogenous splitting points were characterized along the polypeptide chain in position outside the basic residues such as 138–139 (Asp-Gln/Arg) and 196–1"

The active enzyme is an (αβ)2 heterotetramer of two non-identical subunits that are cleaved autoproteolytically from an enzymatically inactive precursor polypeptide. In this study, we prepared and characterized a chemically modified enzyme, and also examined an effect of the modification on enzyme catalysis and autocatalytic processing of the enzyme precursor. We found that treatment of the enzyme with cyanate ion led to a significant loss of the enzyme activity. Structural and functional analyses of the modified enzyme showed that carbamylation of the free α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit resulted in the loss of the enzyme activity. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters indicates that a single ionizing group is involved in enzyme catalysis with pKa = 6.0, which could be attributed to the α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199. The carbamylation also inhibited the secondary processing of the enzyme precursor, suggesting a possible role of the α-amino group for the reaction. Mutagenesis of the invariant N-terminal residue Ser-199 confirmed the key function of its side chain hydroxyl group in both enzyme catalysis and autoproteolytic activation. Partial activity and correct processing of a mutant S199T were in agreement with the general mechanism of N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases. Our results indicate that GL-7-ACA acylase utilizes as a nucleophile Ser-199 in both enzyme activity and autocatalytic processing and most importantly its own α-amino group of the Ser-199 as a general base catalyst for the activation of the hydroxyl group both in enzyme catalysis and in the secondary cleavage of the enzyme precursor.

Cephalosporin acylases including this enzyme have long been of industrial interest in the synthesis of semi-synthetic cephem antibiotics but their catalytic mechanisms are still poorly understood.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have proposed that the enzyme is activated through a two-step autocatalytic processing upon folding: the first step is an intramolecular cleavage of the precursor between Gly-198 and Ser-199 for generation of the inactive α subunit containing a spacer peptide of 9 amino acids and the β subunit; the second is an intermolecular event, which may be mediated by the N-terminal Ser (Ser-199) of the β subunit and results in a further cleavage of the peptide bond between Gly-189 and Asp-190 and the removal of the spacer peptide. Our previous data have also shown that Ser-199, the N-terminal residue of the β subunit, is essential for the catalytic activity and autoproteolytic activation of the enzyme (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases form a novel class of hydrolytic enzymes. They are activated from an enzymatically inactive precursor polypeptide by proteolytic processing, producing a new N-terminal residue. Several amidohydrolases belonging to the Ntn hydrolase family have been described with very different substrate specificities and functions (5Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.

Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) all have a similar central four-layer sandwich of α helices and β sheets (αββα) as a catalytic domain and an N-terminal nucleophile responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of an amide bond. The N-terminal residue, which is exposed upon the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor polypeptide, has been shown to be essential for the enzymatic activity in the Ntn hydrolases. This residue is threonine in aspartylglucosaminidase and proteasome β subunit, serine in penicillin acylase, and cysteine in glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase. All of these residues can function as a catalytic nucleophile and are located at the beginning of a β strand. In the case of aspartylglucosaminidase and penicillin acylase activation, the precursor polypeptide chain is cleaved into two polypeptide subunits of the active protein, whereas in proteasome and glutamine 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase, the activation results in the removal of a propeptide. Recently, a number of studies have suggested that the breaking of this critical peptide bond occurs autocatalytically and that the autoprocessing is initiated by a proximal N-O or N-S acyl shift which occurs by nucleophilic attack by Ser, Cys, or Thr (10Guan C.

The suggested catalytic mechanisms of these four enzymes contain another interesting feature in common that has only been described for them. It has been suggested that the α-amino group of the N-terminal catalytic amino acid could function as a base that increases the nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl/thiol group (5Brannigan J.A. Dodson G.

Here, we report the first experimental study that probes the function of the free α-amino group of the N-terminal catalytic amino acid within the family of Ntn hydrolases. Our results suggest that the α-amino group of GL-7-ACA acylase is an essential catalytic group, acting as a general base catalyst by deprotonating the hydroxyl group of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit in enzyme catalysis and possibly in secondary processing of the enzyme precursor. Mutagenesis of the invariant N-terminal Ser-199 confirmed the key function of its side chain hydroxyl group as a putative nucleophile in both enzyme catalysis and autoproteolytic activation. Our data would also imply that GL-7-ACA acylase is a member of a novel family of structurally similar hydrolytic enzymes with an analogous catalytic mechanism resembling that of serine proteases and in which the N-terminal amino acid of a polypeptide chain acts both as the nucleophile and the base. The sources of materials used were as follows: potassium cyanate was from Fluka; Bio-Gel P-6 DG desalting gel from Bio-Rad; Sephacel C18 column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Lys-C endopeptidase of sequencing grade from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; GL-7-ACA from ChongKunDang Co. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or the highest quality commercially available. GL-7-ACA acylase with the C-terminal (His)6 tag was purified using TalonTMmetal-charged affinity columns as described previously (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified GL-7-ACA acylase (12 μg) was titrated with increasing concentrations of KCNO (10–160 mm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After incubation, each of the mixtures was gel filtrated on Bio-Gel P-6 DG spin columns to terminate the modification reaction. The residual GL-7-ACA acylase activity was measured as described later. GL-7-ACA acylase (600 μg) was incubated with 1 m KCNO in 500 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 2 h. This treatment resulted in a 95% reduction of the enzyme activity. Modified and unmodified enzymes were separately dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 6m guanidine HCl at 4 °C. The β subunits from modified and unmodified enzymes were purified as described previously (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and then dialyzed extensively against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Each of the purified β subunits (77 μg) was digested with the protease Lys-C in an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixtures were then applied to a Sephacel C18 reverse-phase column (2.1 × 100 mm) in SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column eluate was monitored at 214 nm. Each of the entire Lys-C digests of modified and unmodified β subunits was desalted using ZipTipTM (Millipore), and then mixed together with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution. The sample/matrix solution was dropped onto a sample plate for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and then dried under ambient conditions. A mass spectrum was obtained on a Kratos Kompact MALDI II instrument (Kratos). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 491 protein sequencer fitted with a high-pressure liquid chromatography on-line system. Point mutations to form mutants S199T and K208Q were introduced into pSH, a plasmid that contains a sequence coding for mature wild-type GL-7-ACA acylase with a C-terminal (His)6 tag downstream from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction method (18Hayashi N. Welschof M. Zewe M. Braunagel M. Dubel S. Breitling F. Little M. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 314-315Google Scholar). All the mutations were verified by automated DNA sequencing to ensure that only the desired mutation and no other changes were inserted into the sequence. The assay for GL-7-ACA acylase activity was based on the colorimetric measurement of 7-ACA released from the substrate GL-7-ACA (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For pH profiles of enzyme activity, purified wild-type and S199T mutant enzymes were diluted into the buffers with different pH values. For pH 4–6, 20 mmcitric acid/Na2HPO4 buffers were used. For pH 7–8 and 9–10, 20 mm potassium phosphate and 20 mm bis-Tris-propane/HCl buffers were used, respectively. Determination of the Km andVmax values for wild-type and S199T mutant enzymes was performed at varying substrate concentrations at pH 7.0. The following pH range was explored: citric acid/Na2HPO4, pH 5–6.5, sodium phosphate, pH 7–8, bis-Tris-propane/HCl, pH 8.5–9.5. All the buffers were 20 mm, and the ionic strength of the solution was kept at 0.1 m by adding NaCl. The kinetic parameters were obtained by determining initial rates at various concentrations of the substrate at different pH values. The apparent pKa value governing the pH dependence of steady-state kinetic parameters was extracted from y versus pH profiles fitted to the following general equation, y=ylim/(1+10pKa−pH)Equation 1 where ylim represents the maximum pH-independent value. The recently described Ntn hydrolases suggest that the α-amino group of the N-terminal catalytic amino acid of the enzymes may play an essential role as a general base to enhance the nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl/thiol group (5Brannigan J.A.

Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). As the penicillin acylase of these enzymes is functionally homologous to GL-7-ACA acylase, the α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit of GL-7-ACA acylase may be critical for the enzyme activity. To examine this possibility, we attempted to carbamylate the α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 by treating the enzyme with KCNO under various conditions, and the chemically modified derivatives of the enzyme were examined for their enzyme activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the incubation of GL-7-ACA acylase with KCNO led to a progressive loss of enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting the importance of one or more amino group-containing residues. We first examined which carbamylated subunit of GL-7-ACA acylase was responsible for the loss of enzyme activity. Since enzyme activity can be regained by enzyme reconstitution with inactive α and β subunits (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the α and β subunits were purified from unmodified and modified GL-7-ACA acylases, and mixed in various combinations for enzyme reconstitution. TableI shows that the modification in the β subunit results in enzyme inactivation.Table IGL-7-ACA acylase activities of reconstituted enzymesComponentsEnzyme activityα (−) + β (−)100α (−) + β (+)8.2α (+) + β (−)100α (+) + β (+)7.6Each of α and β subunits was purified from intact and carbamylated GL-7-ACA acylases, which were denatured with 6 m urea. For enzyme reconstitution, the denatured α and β subunits were mixed in various combinations at a molar ratio of 1:1, and diluted 15-fold with renaturation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 25 °C for 12 h so that the enzymes could be reconstituted. The activity of a reconstituted enzyme with α and β subunits purified from intact GL-7-ACA acylase was normalized to 100. −, from intact enzyme; +, from carbamylated enzyme.

The activity of a reconstituted enzyme with α and β subunits purified from intact GL-7-ACA acylase was normalized to 100. −, from intact enzyme; +, from carbamylated enzyme. To identify the carbamylated residue, we used β subunits purified from intact and carbamylated GL-7-ACA acylases. The β subunits were subjected to Lys-C endopeptidase digestion, after which the Lys-C digests were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The differences observed between the two elution profiles were a single shift of an arrow-labeled peak which only appears as a minor shoulder in the HPLC chromatogram of carbamylated sample (Fig. 3, A andB). Because the peak of overlapping peptides including the carbamylated peptide seen in Fig. 3 B was not further separated by means of a shallow water/acetonitrile gradient, we analyzed the entire Lys-C digests of intact and carbamylated β subunits by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight. The mass spectrometric analyses clearly allowed us to find a new peptide having an additional 43 mass units, not found among peptides from the Lys-C digest of intact β subunit (TableII). The single difference of molecular masses between the Lys-C digests of intact and carbamylated β subunits corresponds to the mass of a carbamyl adduct, suggesting that the peptide having an additional 43 mass units is a peptide corresponding to residues from N-terminal Ser-199 to Lys-208 of the β subunit bearing a single carbamylated amino group. Furthermore, the SNSWAVAPGK sequence corresponding to residues from N-terminal Ser-199 to Lys-208 of the β subunit was determined in the N-terminal sequence analysis on the arrow-labeled peak that appears from uncarbamylated sample. For the N-terminal sequence analysis of carbamylated β subunit itself, no phenylthiohydantoin-derivative of amino acid was detected. Also, an active K208Q mutant was still sensitive to enzyme inactivation with KCNO, and treatment of wild-type enzyme with 1,3,5-trinitrobenzenesulfonate, a specific lysine modifier, had no effect on enzyme activity (data not shown). All the results indicate that the single site modification of an α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 occurred on the β subunit and led to the inactivation of GL-7-ACA acylase.Table IIExperimental and calculated masses of Lys-C peptides from intact and carbamylated β subunitsMolecular masses from MALDI-TOF (Da)Calculated molecular masses (Da)Identified fragments1016.9 ± 0.1, 1059.8 2-aThe difference of two molecular masses corresponds to the mass of a carbamyl adduct (43 Da).

Komatsu K. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1222-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By enzyme reconstitution experiments, we have previously revealed that the GL-7-ACA acylase precursor undergoes the secondary processing catalyzed by the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit, which is generated from the primary processing of the precursor (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the carbamylation of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit affects the secondary processing, each of the intact and carbamylated β subunits was mixed and reconstituted with α subunit containing a spacer peptide from a S199C mutant, which undergoes only the primary processing of its precursor (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the carbamylated N-terminal Ser of the β subunit was not able to catalyze the secondary processing,i.e. the removal of the spacer peptide, suggesting that the α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit also plays an important role in the secondary processing of the precursor as well as enzyme catalysis. Previous substitutions of the β-subunit N-terminal Ser-199 by Cys or Ala suggested that the N-terminal Ser is essential both for enzyme catalysis and for complete processing of the precursor (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether a hydroxyl-containing residue at the position is critical for the autoproteolytic activation and enzyme activity of GL-7-ACA acylase, Ser-199 was replaced with Thr using site-directed mutagenesis. The conservative replacement of Ser-199 with Thr had no effect on the correct cleavage of the enzyme precursor into α and β subunits but greatly affected the enzyme activity, which was reduced to only 13% that of wild type. In combination with the inability of Cys to replace the N-terminal Ser of the β subunit for the enzyme activity and secondary processing of the precursor, these results indicate that Ser-199 is critical not only for two steps of processing but also for catalysis as a nucleophile. Relative to wild-type enzyme, bothKm and kcat values of the S199T mutant were reduced about 25-fold, butkcat/Km values were almost the same for both enzymes (TableIII).Table IIICatalytic parameters of wild-type and S199T mutant GL-7-ACA acylasesProteinKMkcatkcat/KMmms−1s−1 mm−1Wild type1.05 ± 0.19.48 ± 0.49.03S199T0.04 ± 0.020.35 ± 0.028.75Assays of purified wild-type and S199T mutant enzymes were carried out with 6.5 μg of each enzyme added in 100 μl of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing varying substrate (GL-7-ACA) concentrations at 37 °C. The assay for GL-7-ACA acylase activity was based on the colorimetric measurement of 7-ACA released from the substrate. The results shown are the average of three independent assays. The values are in the form of mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab Assays of purified wild-type and S199T mutant enzymes were carried out with 6.5 μg of each enzyme added in 100 μl of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing varying substrate (GL-7-ACA) concentrations at 37 °C. The assay for GL-7-ACA acylase activity was based on the colorimetric measurement of 7-ACA released from the substrate. The results shown are the average of three independent assays. The values are in the form of mean ± S.D. We also measured the relative enzyme activity of wild-type and S199T mutant enzymes at different pH values to detect variations in the pH optimum (Fig. 5). The S199T mutant enzyme showed some alterations in its pH optimum profiles. The activity of the wild type increased as the pH rose, having a broad optimum range between pH 6 and 10, while the S199T mutant had a relatively narrow range of pH optimum from pH 6 to 8, after which the activity declined sharply. However, it was questionable whether the decline in enzyme activity of S199T mutant at pH > 8.0 is due to an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. To answer this issue, the enzyme was preincubated at various pH values in the range of 5–10 for the usual assay time, and the activity was then measured after buffer exchange into pH 7.0 buffer by spin column chromatography. Whereas the enzyme preincubated between pH 5.0 and 8.0 regained full activity at pH 7.0, irreversible inactivation for the enzyme increased rapidly above pH 8.0 (data not shown), indicating that the decline of the enzyme activity in the pH profile of S199T mutant enzyme must result from the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. If the α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit of GL-7-ACA acylase is responsible for deprotonating the hydroxyl group of Ser-199, then the enzyme would be active only when this acidic group is unprotonated in the enzyme. The pH dependence of the reaction rate should indicate the presence of an ionizable group that must be unprotonated for enzyme catalysis. Thus, we generated pH profiles of the steady-state kinetic parameters, kcat andkcat/Km. The effect of pH on the enzyme catalysis of wild-type and S199T mutant enzymes was determined over the pH range of 5.0–9.5 or 5.5–8.0, respectively. The pH profile of both kcat/Kmand kcat revealed a critical ionization that must be unprotonated for catalysis (Fig. 6). As the pH increases, there is a corresponding increase in catalytic activity that plateaus above the critical ionization with pKa values of 5.6 ± 0.1 for kcat and 6.0 ± 0.1 forkcat/Km. The S199T mutant showed similar results of pKa values of 5.7 ± 0.1 for kcat and 6.0 ± 0.1 forkcat/Km. These data indicate the catalytic requirement of an unprotonated active site group in the enzyme. The slight difference of pKa values forkcat andkcat/Km also imply little change in the states of ionization of the catalytic center group on formation of the acyl-enzyme. To explore the possibility of general base catalysis by the free α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit of GL-7-ACA acylase, we treated the enzyme with cyanate ions under controlled conditions, and identified a single amino group essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. We also examined the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters of wild-type and S199T mutant enzymes. We found that carbamylation of the α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 of GL-7-ACA acylase led to a significant loss of its enzyme activity, indicating that the α-amino group is essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

All these hydrolases have N-terminal catalytic amino acids of Ser, Thr, or Cys. The suggested mechanisms of these enzymes for catalysis contain an interesting feature in common that has only been described for them. Because no adjacent histidine equivalent to that found in the serine proteases is in close enough proximity to the N-terminal catalytic amino acid in the crystal structures of Ntn hydrolases, the proposal was made that the α-amino group of the N-terminal catalytic amino acid functions as a base that increases the nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl/thiol group. The α-amino group of the N-terminal catalytic amino acid is suitably positioned to mediate proton transfers directly or via a bridging water molecule (5Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J.

If the α-amino group of GL-7-ACA acylase has a same role for enzyme catalysis as those of the Ntn hydrolases, it is speculated that the carbamylation of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit of GL-7-ACA acylase must lead to a reduction of basicity of the Nα nitrogen of the α-amino group, which probably makes it unable to act as a general base to enhance the nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl group, thereby abolishing the enzymatic activity. An active site base is required to catalyze proton transfers in overall catalysis, and we thus determined the pH dependence ofkcat andkcat/Km of wild-type and S199T mutant enzymes. Thekcat/Km pH profile of the wild type indicates that a single ionizable group with a pKa of 6.0 ± 0.1 has to be unprotonated for activity. The kcat pH profile is very similar, except that the pKa is shifted to 5.6 ± 0.1. It is likely that the acidic group revealed in thekcat/Km andkcat pH profiles corresponds to the same ionizable group. Typically, thekcat/Km pH profile represents pKa values of residues in the free enzyme or free substrate and the kcat pH profile represents pKa values in the enzyme-substrate complex (19Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 309-405Google Scholar). The pKa value from thekcat/Km pH profile most likely represents an ionizable group in free enzyme, since the free substrate does not have an ionizable group in the pH range tested. The pKa values from thekcat/Km andkcat pH profiles of the S199T mutant enzyme were similar to those of the wild type, suggesting that the same ionizable group as the wild type is required for the catalytic activity of the S199T mutant. Therefore, the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters in GL-7-ACA acylase indicates that a group with an apparent pKa of 6.0 in the free enzyme is critical for activity. Although the value of apparent pKa is somewhat less than a pKa value of 6.8–7.9 expected for an α-amino group, a decreased value is plausible in a protein environment that is less polar than that of the aqueous solvent. A similar result is seen in penicillin acylase, a functional homologue of GL-7-ACA acylase and a member of the Ntn hydrolase family, in which the pKa value of the free α-amino group of the N-terminal catalytic Ser was assigned to 6.1 (20Morillas M. Goble M.L. Virden R. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 235-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since histidine's first pKa value is 6.2, however, we could not exclude a possibility that a His residue may function as a general base in the enzyme catalysis. Based on a multiple amino acid sequence alignment of cephalosporin acylases and a comparative modeling study with the crystal structures of penicillin acylase, we mutagenized two completely conserved His residues on the β subunit which seem to reside near the catalytic Ser of GL-7-ACA acylase to Ser or Ala. As these mutant proteins were exclusively expressed as inclusion bodies, we examined the effect of the mutations on the enzyme activity byin vitro refolding and enzyme reconstitution with the α subunit purified from the wild type and the mutant β subunits separately expressed. The mutants had slightly reduced or comparable enzyme activities to that of the wild type in the same conditions. 2Y. S. Lee, H. W. Kim, and S. S. Park, unpublished data. Accordingly, it is evident that the apparent pKa of 6.0 could be ascribed to the ionization of the free α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit of GL-7-ACA acylase. The neutral α-amino group of an N-terminal amino acid could function as a base in a way similar to histidine, due to their similar pKavalues: the α-amino group of an N-terminal amino acid has a pKa value of 6.8–7.9, and histidine's first pKa is 6.2 (21Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 69-165Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Like Ntn hydrolases, the α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser of the β subunit of GL-7-ACA acylase could be mainly uncharged and act as the catalytic base for accepting a proton from the hydroxyl group of the Ser-199. In this study, although it could not be clearly explained why the S199T mutant has reduced Km value and is unstable at high pH as compared with the wild type, Thr did offer somewhat an acceptable replacement for the enzyme activity. This suggests that either hydroxyl group of serine or threonine can function as a nucleophile in the enzyme catalysis. This result is consistent with the general mechanism of Ntn hydrolases in which either Ser, Cys, or Thr functions as the nucleophile. Carbamylation of the N-terminal Ser-199 of the β subunit completely inhibited the secondary processing (Fig. 4), which is catalyzed by the N-terminal Ser-199 generated from the primary processing of the enzyme precursor and results in the removal of a spacer peptide (4Lee Y.S. Park S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4576-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover,in vitro processing of the GL-7-ACA acylase precursor is maximal between pH 7.0 and 10.0 (data not shown). It is noteworthy that this behavior is similar to the pH-dependent profile for GL-7-ACA acylase activity. Accordingly, the inhibition of the secondary processing by carbamylation could be explained by speculation that carbamylation of the α-amino group of the N-terminal Ser makes it unable to act as a general base to activate the hydroxyl group of the N-terminal Ser, since precursor and mature enzyme may share a similar structure (16Xu Q. Buckley D. Guan C. Guo H.-C. Cell. 1999; 98: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, the replacement of Ser-199 with Thr did not affect the correct processing into α and β subunits, suggesting that Thr could offer an acceptable replacement for autocatalytic processing of the enzyme precursor. Overall, these results suggest that a hydroxyl side chain (Ser or Thr) at position 199 is required for the complete processing reaction of the GL-7-ACA acylase precursor. According to the data, the side chain of Ser-199 would play an active role as a nucleophile in the autoproteolytic activation of GL-7-ACA acylase. The present data allow us to conclude that the single N-terminal amino acid (Ser-199) of GL-7-ACA acylase can function as a nucleophile and a base in a way similar to that of serine and histidine residues in the active sites of serine proteases. Also, our data suggest that GL-7-ACA acylase utilizes Ser-199 as a nucleophile for both the primary and secondary processing and that the free α-amino group exposed from the primary processing could act as a general base for the secondary processing reaction. Taking all available experimental data together, we propose that GL-7-ACA acylase from Pseudomonas sp. strain GK16 is a member of a recently described novel class of Ntn hydrolases. X-ray three-dimensional structure analysis on the GL-7-ACA acylase that is underway by us (22Kwon T.H. Rhee S. Lee Y.S. Park S.S. Kim K.H. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) will be able to reveal the detailed catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and to encourage the studies on the catalytic and autoproteolytic activation mechanisms of the enzyme. Further work is required to characterize and understand all biochemical aspects of GL-7-ACA acylase, from autoproteolytic activation to catalysis.

The Na,K-ATPase maintains homeostasis by regulating cellular volume, transepithelial ion transport, action potential propagation in nerve and muscle cells, and the sodium-coupled uptake of metabolic substrates such as glucose and amino acids (1Horisberger J. Lemas V. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Rossier B.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 565-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 2Skou J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase is a transmembrane, heterodimer protein consisting of an α and β subunit. The α subunit contains the catalytic site responsible for ion translocation, whereas it is thought that the β subunit is responsible for plasma membrane targeting (3Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In lung epithelial cells, evidence supports that the β1 subunit is the rate-limiting unit for functional pumps (4Factor F.

Several isoforms exist for each subunit, whereas the α1 and β1 subunits predominate in epithelial cells. The Na,K-ATPase is regulated both transcriptionally, by glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, and hyperoxia, and post-transcriptionally (5Carter E.P. Wangensteen O.D. O'Grady S.M. Ingbar D.H. Am. J.

We, and others, have previously demonstrated that hyperoxia can up-regulate Na,K-ATPase gene expression in lung epithelial cells (5Carter E.P. Wangensteen O.D. O'Grady S.M. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L542-L551PubMed Google Scholar, 10Harris Z.L. Ridge K.M. Gonzalez-Flecha B. Gottlieb L. Zucker A. Sznajder J.I. Eur. Respir.

Gilmore-Hebert M. Jamieson J.D. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 261: L307-L314Google Scholar). The amount of up-regulation ranges between 2- and 6-fold and varies according to the duration of exposure and oxygen concentration (5Carter E.P. Wangensteen O.D. O'Grady S.M. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L542-L551PubMed Google Scholar, 10Harris Z.L. Ridge K.M. Gonzalez-Flecha B. Gottlieb L. Zucker A. Sznajder J.I. Eur. Respir.

Gilmore-Hebert M. Jamieson J.D. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 261: L307-L314Google Scholar). In addition, these relatively small changes in gene expression result in physiological responses with concomitant increases in protein levels and activity, which are also dependent on the dose and duration of oxygen exposure (10Harris Z.L. Ridge K.M. Gonzalez-Flecha B. Gottlieb L. Zucker A. Sznajder J.I. Eur. Respir. J. 1996; 9: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Olivera W. Ridge K. Wood L.D.H. Sznajder J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L577-L584PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation of the Na,K-ATPase by hyperoxia in the lung has physiological significance, because the lung is exposed to oxidant stress continuously, due to high oxygen tension. Oxidant stress can be exacerbated during lung injury and the therapeutic need for high oxygen delivery. We sought a model cell line to determine the molecular mechanism by which hyperoxia increased Na,K-ATPase gene expression, and screening of several epithelial cell lines revealed MDCK1 cells to be an excellent model. MDCK cells are a canine kidney epithelial cell line that is abundant in Na,K-ATPase. In culture, these cells form domes when exposed to hyperoxia, presumably due to increased ion transport (13Dreher D. Tochat T. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C358-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the kidney is not exposed to high oxygen tension, it is exposed to oxidant stress during ischemia and injury. The role of oxidants and oxygen tension on gene regulation has been recognized in several systems. Several transcription factors have been identified that up-regulate eukaryotic gene expression in the presence of oxidizing conditions, such as the anti-oxidant responsive element, AP1, and NFκB (14Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pinkus R. Weiner L.M. Daniel V. J. Biol.

Interact. 1994; 91: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which oxidants up-regulate transcription has been most clearly defined for NFκB, however, for many genes the mechanism remains undefined. We previously demonstrated that hyperoxia up-regulated gene expression of the Na,K-ATPase α1 and β1 subunits in MDCK cells (5Carter E.P. Wangensteen O.D. O'Grady S.M. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L542-L551PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wendt C. Towle T. Sharma R. Duvick S. Kawakami K. Gick G. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C356-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this cell system, hyperoxia increased the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit transcription via a 61-bp region on the β1 subunit promoter. Although the Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter contains putative AP1 and NFκB sites, these sites were not located in the 61-bp region necessary for hyperoxia induction. Rather, this sequence contained a core GC element consistent with an SP family consensus site. In this study, we demonstrated that an SP site is required for the up-regulation of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit transcription by hyperoxia in MDCK cells. Deletion of the GC element resulted in loss of both basal and hyperoxia-activated transcription. MDCK cells treated with hyperoxia demonstrated increased binding of SP1/SP3 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), which was eliminated with mutation of the GC consensus sequence. This represents a novel function for SP family transcription factors. Three cell lines were tested to determine whether hyperoxia increased gene expression of the Na,K-ATPase. These cell lines included two lung epithelial cell lines (MP48, gift from G. Hunninghake; A549, ATCC) and one kidney epithelial cell line (Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), low resistance, ATCC CCL 34). Only the MDCK cells had an increase in Na,K-ATPase gene expression by hyperoxia (data not shown) and were used for subsequent analysis. Cells were cultured on plastic tissue culture dishes and incubated in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.). The media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated in 5% CO2/95% air (normoxia) at 37 °C. Cells treated with hyperoxia were placed in a humidified, sealed chamber (Billups) that was flushed with 5% CO2/95% O2 at 5 liters/min for 10 min each day of incubation under normobaric conditions. Cells treated with 0.2 mm diamide were placed in an incubator under normoxic, normobaric conditions. Cells were subconfluent at the start of the experiments and became confluent by 48 h of incubation, either in normoxic or hyperoxic conditions. Plasmids containing: pGEM empty plasmid (control), and Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit cDNA (gift from E. Benz, Johns Hopkins) were placed into wells of a slot blot (10 μg/slot) on nitrocellulose filters and vacuum-dried. The Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit cDNA was contained in the pGEM plasmid, therefore, pGEM was chosen as a negative control to measure nonspecific binding. Nuclei were isolated from MDCK cells (5 × 106) by cell lysis using standard techniques (8Liu B. Huang F. Gick G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were incubated with nucleotides and 0.5 mCi of [32P]UTP for 30 min at 37 °C before terminating the reaction with DNase I and extracting and precipitating the RNA. The RNA was resuspended in prehydridization solution, and 1 million counts of each sample was hybridized to the slot blots in the smallest possible volume for 48 h and then washed with 2× SSC. The nitrocellulose filters were then autoradiographed. The RNA integrated optical density was determined using Densitometry Image software. The Na,K-ATPase β1promoter-reporter constructs consisted of the 5′-promoter region plus 151 bp of the first exon linked to a promoterless firefly luciferase expression vector (pXP1-luc), as previously reported (9Wendt C. Towle T. Sharma R. Duvick S. Kawakami K. Gick G. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C356-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu B. Gick G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The deletion constructs designated β1-102, β1-84, β1-62, and β1-55 contained 102, 84, 62, and 55 bp, respectively, upstream from the transcription start site to +151 base pairs (Fig. 1). The β1-102 construct was created by exonuclease III digestion of a β1-817 construct as described previously (9Wendt C. Towle T. Sharma R. Duvick S. Kawakami K. Gick G. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C356-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu B. Gick G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Luciferase constructs that contained the β1-84, β1-62, and β1-55 promoter sequences were synthesized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Oligonucleotides from −84 to +151, −62 to +151, and −55 to +151 were generated by PCR using β1-102 as a template. The reactions to synthesize the −84 to +151 and −62 to +151 oligonucleotides were performed in a total volume of 100 μl containing 1 μg of template, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2 μm of each primer (5′-primers, GCGGATCCGATTGGCCTGCGGTGCGGATCCTAGGCGGAGCTAC; 3′-primer, GCAAGCTTGCATGCAGG), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). The run included 25 cycles, and each cycle consisted of: denaturation for 15 s (94 °C), annealing for 15 s (70 °C), and elongation for 1 min and 15 s (72 °C). The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of the luciferase vector pXP1. The PCR reaction to synthesize the −55 to +151 oligonucleotide was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 30 ng of template, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 0.1 mm of each primer (5′-primers, AAAGAATCCGAGCTACGGATGGTGGAGGC; 3′-primer, CTTGAATCCCCTGCTGCTTCAAG), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (ProStratagene). The run included 28 cycles, and each cycle included: denaturation for 1 min 30 s (96 °C), annealing for 40 s (60 °C), and elongation for 1 min and 30 s (68 °C). The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of the luciferase vector pXP1. Each clone was sequenced to confirm the appropriate DNA sequence. Transfection experiments with the empty vector did not demonstrate luciferase activity above background, either in normoxia or hyperoxia. For a control, cells were transfected with the β1-41 construct, which contained 41 bp upstream from the transcription start site to +151 base pairs of the first exon, to test whether the vector or the 3′-region was responding to hyperoxia. This construct demonstrated less than 5% luciferase activity compared with the β1-102 construct, similar to the empty vector (data not shown) and did not demonstrate increased activity in hyperoxia. To confirm that the region from −59 to −55 was sufficient for hyperoxic induction independent of the Na,K-ATPase endogenous promoter, an oligonucleotide spanning this region was subcloned into a vector containing a minimal promoter of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV-ATCC 37582) for transfection experiments. A 38-bp oligonucleotide was synthesized that spanned from −82 to −44 (5′-ATTGGCCTGCGGTGCCGCCCGGTAGGCGGAGCTACGGATG-3′; University of Minnesota Molecular Laboratory) and was subcloned into a luciferase vector containing a minimal promoter of the mouse mammary tumor virus. In addition, a 38-bp oligonucleotide was synthesized that spanned from −82 to −44, which contained a mutation of the GC site at −68 (5′-ATTGGCCTGCGGTGCTCTCCGGTAGGCGGAGCTACGGATG-3′ University of Minnesota Molecular Laboratory) and was subcloned into the MMTV-luciferase plasmid. The minimal promoter consisted of 109 bp of the 5′-proximal promoter of the MMTV linked to the luciferase gene. The oligonucleotides were subcloned intoHindIII/SacI-digested MMTV-luc plasmid. Plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli and isolated using the Qiagen maxi-prep and designated MMTV-82/44WT and MMTV-82/44SM. To generate a construct with point mutations, we utilized a PCR-based method (Stratagene) using the double-stranded, supercoiled DNA vector, β1-102, which was annealed to two synthetic complementary oligonucleotides (−84 to −42) containing the desired mutation of the GC sites at −68 and −59 (5′-CGATTGGCCTGCGGTGCTCTCCGGTAGAGAGAGCTACGGATGGT-3′). The extension and incorporation of the mutant primers were accomplished by PCR. The PCR-generated mutant plasmid was treated withDpnI, which specifically digested the hemi-methylated wild type parental DNA plasmid and eliminated the non-mutant template from the PCR reaction. The plasmid containing the PCR-generated mutation was transformed and isolated as described above. The plasmid was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and was designated β1-102DM. MDCK cells were plated at a density of 8 × 106 cells/35-mm plate in media with 10% FBS. On the second day of culture, each well was transfected with 10 μl of Superfect (Qiagen) and 2 μg of the β1promoter-reporter construct. Lipofection was carried out using the manufacturer's recommendation for a total of 4 h in serum-free and antibiotic-free media. After lipofection, the cells were incubated for 48 h in media plus 10% FBS in normoxia or hyperoxia. Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) in a luminometer (LB 9501, Berthold), and protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid system of Pierce. Luciferase activity normalized to either co-transfection with a CMV-LacZ plasmid or protein concentration was identical, therefore, all subsequent transfections were normalized to protein concentration as described previously (8Liu B. Huang F. Gick G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK cells grew to confluency in both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions, however, overall cell number and total protein were less in the hyperoxia experiments. All normalized promoter activity was reported as a percentage activity over control (normoxia). To prepare nuclear extracts, cells were suspended in hypotonic solution (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol (DTT)) to lyse the cells and homogenized, and the nuclei were collected by centrifugation. High salt buffer was added slowly to release soluble proteins from the nuclei. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was dialyzed into a moderate salt solution (20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT; a reducing agent), and any precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. Approximately 2–5 × 108cells were needed to obtain 100–150 μg of nuclear extract. Whole cell extracts (WCE) were obtained from MDCK cells incubated in media plus 10% FBS and incubated for 24 h in normoxia, hyperoxia, or 0.2 mm diamide. To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were suspended and washed in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, and 0.05 mm DTT). Next, cells were lysed in buffer B (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.05 mm DTT) followed by centrifugation and collection of the supernatant. The supernatant was diluted to 100 μl per 107 cells with modified buffer C (10 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid system. The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were generated by the University of Minnesota Molecular Laboratory and were gel-purified. The probes were as follows: −82/−44 (5′-ATTGGCCTGCGGTGCCGCCCGGTAGGCGGAGCTACGGATG-3′); −122/−84 (5′-CCGCCCCTTCGGGCTCAGGCCCGCCTTCTCGGCACCGGC-3′); −84/−42DM (5′-CGATTGGCCTGCGGTGCTCTCCGGTAGAGAGAGCTACGGATGGT-3′); −84/−42SM (5′-ATTGGCCTGCGGTGCTCTCCGGTAGGCGGAGCTACGGATG-3′). The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with a random primer kit (Promega) using [32P]CTP and Klenow fragment. The probe was electrophoresed, eluted, and resuspended in TE buffer. The binding reaction included 1 × 104 cpm of DNA probe (0.2–0.7 ng), bulk carrier DNA, and 6.5–8.0 μg of extract in 24–36 μl of 10× binding buffer (100 mm TrisCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 50 mmMgCl2, 50% glycerol) incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was placed in a 4% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 4 °C, blotted, and autoradiographed using standard methods (8Liu B. Huang F. Gick G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar). Competition experiments consisted of incubating the probe and extract with excess cold competitor, double-stranded oligonucleotides prior to electrophoresis. The SP1 and AP1 double-stranded oligonucleotides (Promega) used in competition assays contained 21 and 22 bp, respectively. Each oligonucleotide contained the core consensus sequence for either SP1 or AP1. Other oligonucleotides used in competition assays included: −86/−62 (5′-GGCGATTGGCCTGCGGTGCCG-3′); and −66/−44 (5′-GCCGGTAGGCGGAGCTACGGATG-3′). Supershift assays involved incubation of probe and extract with 2 μl of antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) to the SP1 and SP3 transcription factors prior to electrophoresis. The SP antibodies were polyclonal, rabbit IgG antibodies that were not cross-reactive with other SP family members of different species, as reported by the manufacturer. Whole cell extracts (50 μg), as described above, were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto Hybond-nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked overnight with 10 ml of TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3) with 6% powdered milk. This was followed by incubation with the goat polyclonal SP1 antibody (final dilution 1/100; Santa Cruz) at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the blot was washed three times with TBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-goat antibody (final dilution 1/2000) for 1 h. After washing with TBST, bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probing for SP3 and actin was performed separately, after the blot was stripped with buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) at 55 °C for 30 min and then washed with TSBT. The goat polyclonal SP3 antibody (Santa Cruz) was incubated at a final dilution of 1/300, and the rabbit polyclonal actin antibody was incubated at a final dilution of 1/100. Appropriate anti-goat or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used as described above. Numerical data are expressed as means ± S.E., and p values were determined by Student'st test using Macintosh InStat 2.00 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Our previous studies demonstrated that hyperoxia increased Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit mRNA levels 5-fold in MDCK cells without a change in mRNA stability (9Wendt C. Towle T. Sharma R. Duvick S. Kawakami K. Gick G. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C356-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that hyperoxia increased Na,K-ATPase transcription, we performed nuclear run-on assays in nuclei isolated from MDCK cells treated with either normoxia or 12 h of hyperoxia. Nuclei were incubated with nucleotides and 0.5 mCi of [32P]UTP, then the newly synthesized RNA was hybridized to slot blots containing Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit and pGEM (control) cDNAs. There was no MDCK RNA nonspecific binding to the pGEM cDNA, whereas hyperoxia increased transcription of the Na,K-ATPase β1gene 3.0-fold (Fig. 2). In our previous studies we localized a 61-bp region, between −102 and −41, on the Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter that was necessary for induction by hyperoxia (9Wendt C. Towle T. Sharma R. Duvick S. Kawakami K. Gick G. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C356-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wendt C. Sharma R. Towle T. Gick G. Ingbar D.H.

This region contained multiple GC elements, but no consensus sequences for transcription factors with known responsiveness to oxidizing conditions, such as AP1, anti-oxidant responsive element, or NFκB. To further define the area involved in hyperoxia up-regulation, we transfected MDCK cells with deletion constructs of the Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter between −102 and −41, designated β1-84, β1-62, and β1-55 (Fig. 1). These constructs were generated via PCR, subcloned into the luciferase expression vector (pXP1), and transfected into MDCK cells. Transfected cells were treated with either 48 h of normoxia or hyperoxia after transfection (95% O2/5% CO2) under normobaric conditions, then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured. There were positive regulatory elements between −102 and −62, demonstrated by a decrease in basal promoter activity to 86.2% for the β1-84 construct and 27.7% for the β1-62 construct relative to the β1-102 construct (Table I). Both the β1-84 and the β1-62 constructs demonstrated a 2-fold induction in promoter activity in the presence of hyperoxia, thereby localizing a region necessary for hyperoxia induction to a 21-bp region between −62 and −41.Table IEffect of hyperoxia on Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit promoter activityConstructNormoxiaHyperoxiaHyperoxia/normoxia%β1-102100194.3 ± 16.81.9 ± 0.2β1-8286.2 ± 12.1219.6 ± 56.52.5 ± 0.4β1-6227.7 ± 5.160.9 ± 2.92.2 ± 0.5β1-414.3 ± 1.92.3 ± 0.70.5 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab The 21-bp region between −62 and −41, which contained the hyperoxia-inducible element, had an SP1 consensus sequence (GGCGG) spanning from −59 to −55. To eliminate this putative site, a construct was generated via PCR, which spanned from −55 to +151 of the Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter and was subcloned into the pXP1 luciferase expression vector (designated β1-55). Transfection with the β1-55 construct in MDCK cells demonstrated a marked decrease in basal promoter activity with only 10.5% promoter activity compared with the β1-62 construct (Fig. 3). In addition, deletion of this GC element eliminated hyperoxia induction. Therefore, a GC element between −62 to −55 contained a positive regulatory site for induction by hyperoxia as well as basal promoter activity. To determine whether hyperoxia could up-regulate this element independent of the Na,K-ATPase promoter, we subcloned a dimer of an oligonucleotide that contained the hyperoxia element and spanned from −82 to −44 into a plasmid containing luciferase and a minimal promoter region from the MMTV gene. The empty MMTV plasmid had very low basal promoter activity in MDCK cells and did not up-regulate with hyperoxia (data not shown). In the presence of hyperoxia, the −82/−44-MMTV construct was induced 5.1-fold (Fig. 4). Because this oligonucleotide contained two GC elements (−68/−64 and −59/−55), we eliminated the distal −68 GC site by mutation. A similar construct containing a multimer of the −82 to −44 oligonucleotide with a mutation of the GC site at −68 to −64 was also inducible by hyperoxia, 4.1-fold (Fig. 4). This confirms that the GC site at −59 is sufficient for hyperoxia induction of transcription. The proximal promoter of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit contained three separate GC boxes between −102 and −41 (Fig. 5 A). We have demonstrated, in our transfection experiments with serial deletions, that the GC element at −59 is sufficient to induce the up-regulation by hyperoxia. To determine whether the distal GC site (−102 to −98) could up-regulate Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter activity, we mutated the proximal GC sites at −68 and −59 using site-directed mutagenesis of the β1-102 construct. Mutation of these two proximal GC sites resulted in a marked decrease in basal promoter activity to 24.1 + 11.6% of the wild type activity. However, induction by hyperoxia (1.9-fold) was maintained in the mutant β1-102 construct (β1-102DM), identical to the wild type promoter construct (β1-102WT; Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the GC element at −102 to −98 also was capable of up-regulating transcription in the presence of hyperoxia. The transfection experiments with the deletion constructs revealed a GC box, consistent with a SP family consensus site, that was necessary for hyperoxia induction. We performed EMSA to determine whether there was specific protein-DNA binding correlating to this particular GC box. To determine whether hyperoxia altered protein binding, EMSA of a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the putative hyperoxia site (−82 to −44) was performed using nuclear extract (NE) from MDCK cells treated with 12 h of normoxia or hyperoxia. Using NE, we observed only a slight increase in binding (1.3- to 1.5-fold, data not shown). Because oxidation of nuclear binding proteins may be playing a role in the regulation by hyperoxia, but could be masked by redox changes during their extraction, we decreased the DTT concentration to see if this reducing agent altered binding"
https://openalex.org/W1982171021,"Antiestrogens, including tamoxifen and raloxifene, block estrogen receptor (ER) action by blocking the interactions of an estrogen-dependent activation function (AF-2) with p160 coactivators. Although tamoxifen does show some agonist activity in the presence of ERα, this stems from a distinct constitutive activation function (AF-1) that lies within the ERα N terminus. Previous studies identified a naturally occurring mutation (D351Y) that allows ERα to perceive tamoxifen and raloxifene as estrogens. Here, we examine the contributions of ERα activation functions to the D351Y phenotype. We find that the AF-2 function of ERα D351Y lacks detectable tamoxifen-dependent activity when tested in isolation but does synergize with AF-1 to allow enhanced tamoxifen response. Weak tamoxifen-dependent interactions between the ERα D351Y AF-2 function and GRIP1, a representative p160, can be detected in glutathione S-transferase binding assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity can be detected in the presence of ERα D351Y and high levels of overexpressed GRIP1. We therefore propose that the D351Y mutation allows weak tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity but that this activity is only detectable when AF-1 is strong, and AF-1 and AF-2 synergize, or when p160s are overexpressed. We discuss the possible structural basis of this effect.

Both receptors are conditional transcription factors that work either by binding to specific estrogen response elements (EREs) within the promoters of estrogen-regulated genes or by enhancing the activity of heterologous transcription factors such as the AP-1 (Jun·Fos) complex (5Webb P.

Like other nuclear receptors, the ERs consist of three distinct domains, an N-terminal domain, a centrally located DNA binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). Specific DNA recognition is mediated by the DBD, and transcriptional enhancement is mediated by the synergistic action of two separate activation functions, AF-1 and AF-2, that lie within the N-terminal domain and LBD, respectively. The overall process of transcriptional enhancement has two distinct hormone-dependent components. First, estrogens promote ERα dissociation from a heat shock protein-chaperonin complex that serves to restrict its activity. Second, AF-2 absolutely requires estrogens for its activity. The ER activation functions work by recruiting coactivator proteins (7Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol.

AF-2 binds to members of the p160 coactivator family, including GRIP1 (TIF2/NCoA2), SRC-1 (NCoA1), and ACTR (pCIP/RAC3/AIB1/TRAM1), which bind to the histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300 and pCAF. The ER AF-2 functions also bind to other coactivators, including TRAP220 (11Chang C.Y. Norris J.D. Grøn H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell.

In each case, AF-2 binds short amphipathic α-helices with the consensus LXXLL, termed nuclear receptor boxes (NR boxes), which are often reiterated several times within each coactivator. The AF-2 surface is composed a hydrophobic cleft made up of residues from helices 3–5 and 12 (15). A recent ERα co-crystal with a GRIP1 NR box peptide has revealed that there are two components of ERα/NR box recognition (16Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A.

Because estrogens stimulate the growth of about 50% of human breast tumors and also play a role in tumor incidence, drugs that antagonize estrogen action have found favor as breast cancer treatments and preventatives (21Jordan V.C. Sci. Am. 1998; 279: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Each of the available antiestrogens (including tamoxifen, raloxifene, and ICI 182,780) allows the ERs to bind to DNA but inhibits the ability of AF-2 to bind to coactivators (22Katzenellenbogen J.A.

Tamoxifen and raloxifene do show some agonist activity at classical EREs, but this activity stems from AF-1 and not from residual AF-2 activity (17Gronemeyer H. Benhamou B. Berry M. Bocquel M.T.

Unlike estrogens, which are completely buried within the LBD hydrophobic core, tamoxifen and raloxifene both possess a bulky side chain extension that protrudes through the LBD surface near the base of helix 12. This extension displaces helix 12, which rotates 110° and folds back into the remainder of the hydrophobic cleft thereby occluding the coactivator binding surface. Thus, the tamoxifen and raloxifene side chain extension plays a key role in the antiestrogenicity of both compounds. Interestingly, an aspartic acid residue, which lies at the base of ERα helix 3 (Asp-351), forms hydrogen bonds with a tertiary amine group in the tamoxifen and raloxifene extensions (16Shiau A.K.

Moreover, Asp-351 was later found to be mutated to tyrosine in an MCF-7 breast tumor cell variant whose growth was stimulated, rather than inhibited, by tamoxifen, and the D351Y mutant allowed increased tamoxifen and raloxifene agonist activity at ERE-responsive genes (28Levenson A.S.

It was therefore proposed that Asp-351 plays an important role in securing the position of the tamoxifen and raloxifene side chain extensions and that the D351Y mutation allowed ERα to perceive tamoxifen and raloxifene as estrogens. The molecular basis of the D351Y phenotype is not yet known. One possible explanation for the enhanced tamoxifen responses is that the D351Y mutant might allow AF-2 activity in the presence of both estrogens and antiestrogens (28Levenson A.S. Catherino W.H. Jordan V.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Levenson A.S. Jordan V.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1872-1875PubMed Google Scholar), although this has not been directly confirmed. Another possible explanation is that the D351Y mutant might indirectly enhance AF-1 activity. In this study, we examine the role of ERα activation functions in the D351Y mutant phenotype. We demonstrate that the enhanced tamoxifen responses that are characteristic of this mutant stem from synergy between AF-1 and very weak (<1% maximal) tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity. We discuss possible structural explanations for this effect.

The expression vector for the Gal-GRIP1 NR box fusion protein was generated by PCR using pSG5-GRIP1 as a template. The upper strand oligonucleotide contained an EcoRI site and began at the nucleotide corresponding amino acid 618. The lower strand oligonucleotide contained a SalI site and began at the nucleotide corresponding to amino acid 778. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned in frame into the pM Gal4DBD expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) which had been linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes. The expression vector for the VP16-ERαLBD fusion protein was generated from a mammalian expression vector for the ERα LBD amino acids 282–595 (HE14G) (37Lopez G.N. Webb P. Shinsako J.H. Baxter J.D. Greene G.L. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 897-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The LBD coding sequences were excised as aBamHI fragment and cloned into the corresponding site in the pACT VP16 AD expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The resulting clone was then put into the appropriate reading frame by standard PCR-based point mutagenesis (Quickchange kit, Stratagene) to remove a single base between the VP16-AD and ERα-LBD coding regions and thereby destroy the pACT SmaI site. ERα D351Y mutations were introduced into the full-length ERα, DBD-LBD region and VP16-LBD fusion protein by PCR-based point mutagenesis (Quickchange kit, Stratagene). In all cases, the resulting clones were subjected to sequence analysis. MDA-MB-453, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells were transfected by electroporation (5Webb P. Lopez G.N. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 2–3 million cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS supplemented with 10% glucose and 10 μg/ml BioBrene (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a single cuvette. Cells were electroporated at 0.24 kV, 960 microfarads in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Generally, transfections included 2 μg of luciferase reporter and 1 μg of actin-β-galactosidase internal control. Other expression vectors were included, as appropriate, at levels detailed in the figure legends. Following electroporation the cells were resuspended in growth medium, plated onto 12-well dishes, and treated with ligands (ICI 182,780 (0.1 μm), raloxifene (0.1 μm), tamoxifen (5 μm), estradiol (10 nm), or diethylstilbestrol (DES) (10 nm)) or ethanolic vehicle. Cells were harvested 20–24 h after transfection, except for assays performed with the AP-1-responsive reporter which were harvested 36–40 h after transfection. The transfected cells were washed in cold PBS, lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton X-100. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were then measured using standard luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) and β-galactosidase Galacto-Light assay systems (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Luciferase activities were normalized for β-galactosidase activities, although the variation in transfection efficiency was usually relatively small (>20%). Individual transfections (each containing data from triplicate wells) were repeated three times. To produce labeled proteins, 1 μg of coupled transcription-translation vector was incubated with a coupled transcription-translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The GST-GRIP1 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coliBL21. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C, and 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added atA 600 = 0.7, and cultures were then induced for 4 h. Bacteria were then pelleted, resuspended in IPAB-80 (20 mm Hepes, 80 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.9), and then sonicated mildly. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 h in an SS34 rotor. The cleared supernatant was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 500 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, which had been prewashed with 5 volumes of PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 and equilibrated with 5 volumes of IPAB-80 at 4 °C. The protein/bead mixture was then washed with 5 volumes of PBS, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in 1 ml of IPAB-80. Protein preparations were stored at −20 °C. For binding assays a volume of bead suspension containing 3 μg of GST fusion protein was incubated at 4 °C with 1–2 μl of35S-labeled protein in IPAB-80 supplemented with 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, either 5 μm tamoxifen, 100 nm estradiol, or vehicle, in a total final volume of 150 μl. After a 90-min incubation the beads were washed four times in IPAB-150 (identical to IPAB-80, but including 150 mminstead of 80 mm KCl). The beads were then resuspended in standard SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. Bound proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography, along with input protein controls. To investigate the contribution of ER activation functions to the D351Y phenotype, we first examined the behavior of ERα D351Y in cell types that naturally allow distinct levels of AF-1 activity. In MDA-MB-453 breast tumor cells, which allow relatively strong AF-1 activity (18Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.-M. Subramanian S. McInerney E.

ERα enhanced ERE-dependent transcription even in the absence of exogenous ligand, and addition of estradiol or the synthetic estrogen DES gave further stimulation (Fig.1 A). Whereas the antiestrogens all suppressed the ERα-dependent constitutive activity, they did so to different degrees. Significant residual activity was retained in the presence of tamoxifen, modest activity in the presence of raloxifene, and none in the presence of the pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (hereafter, ICI). An ERα G400V mutant (34Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), which lacks constitutive activity, gave comparable levels of transcriptional activity to wild type ERα in the presence of each ligand. In parallel, and in agreement with previous results (31Anghel S. Perly V. Melancon G. Barsalou A. Chagnon S. Rosenauer A. Miller Jr., W.H. Mader S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20867-20872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), ERα D351Y showed no constitutive activity but did give estrogen activation that was comparable to wild type ERα. Here, however, tamoxifen gave significantly higher transcriptional activity. Raloxifene also gave higher transcriptional activity in the presence of ERα D351Y, although these effects were weaker than tamoxifen. No ICI activation was detected. Thus, our results confirm that ERα D351Y allows enhanced tamoxifen and raloxifene agonist activity in breast cells (28Levenson A.S. Catherino W.H. Jordan V.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

We then examined the behavior of the D351Y mutant in HeLa cells, which only allow low AF-1 activity (18Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.-M. Subramanian S.

Tamoxifen, however, only gave weak residual agonist activity, and the other antiestrogens showed none. ERα G400V and ERα D351Y again gave similar levels of estrogen activation to wild type ERα, and ERα G400V again showed comparable levels of tamoxifen activation. While ERα D351Y did show slightly enhanced tamoxifen response, the overall level remained low. Thus, the extent of ERα D351Y-dependent tamoxifen activation is cell type-specific and correlates with AF-1 activity. We next examined the effect of the ERα D351Y mutant upon ERα truncations that only contained isolated ER activation functions. An ERα truncation that only contained AF-1 (AB-DBD) elicited modest constitutive activity that was comparable to the overall level of tamoxifen activation with wild type ER (Fig.2 A). An ERα truncation that only contained AF-2 (DBD-LBD) elicited a strong estrogen response and no tamoxifen response. Thus, in agreement with previous observations made in other cell types (17Gronemeyer H. Benhamou B. Berry M. Bocquel M.T. Gofflo D. Garcia T. Lerouge T. Metzger D. Meyer M.E. Tora L. Vergezac A.

After washing, the products of the binding reaction were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In parallel, ERα D351Y again showed comparable estrogen response and enhanced tamoxifen response. However, a DBD-LBD truncation that contained the D351Y mutation showed only modest estrogen response and no tamoxifen response. Thus, AF-1 is absolutely required for the D351Y phenotype and the D351Y mutation does not allow strong tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity in vivo. We next examined the interactions of ERα D351Y with GRIP1, a representative p160, in vitro (Fig. 2 B). As expected, wild type ERα bound strongly to a bacterially expressed GST-GRIP1 fusion protein overlapping the NR box region in the presence of estradiol but only showed weak residual binding in the presence of tamoxifen. In parallel, ERα D351Y showed reduced binding to GRIP1 in the presence of estradiol. Moreover, although tamoxifen-liganded ERα D351Y did show a slight, but reproducible, increase in binding to GRIP1 (taken up below), this still represented a very weak interaction. We therefore conclude that ERα D351Y lacks strong tamoxifen-dependent AF-2 activity and that, in fact, ERα D351Y behaves as a partial AF-2 mutant even in the presence of estradiol. Given that ERα D351Y showed both enhanced tamoxifen response and reduced AF-2 activity, we confirmed that the enhanced tamoxifen response was not a general consequence of reduced AF-2 activity. Fig. 3 shows that ERα D351Y again showed enhanced tamoxifen response relative to either wild type ERα or ERα G400V in HeLa cell"
https://openalex.org/W2070662795,"It is well established that medium and long chain (+)-acylcarnitines (i.e. fatty acid esters of the unnaturald-isomer of carnitine) inhibit the oxidation of long chain fatty acids in mammalian tissues by interfering with some component(s) of the mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system. However, whether their site of action is at the level of CPT I (outer membrane), CPT II (inner membrane), carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT, inner membrane), or some combination of these elements has never been resolved. We chose to readdress this question using rat liver mitochondria and employing a variety of assays that distinguish between the three enzyme activities. The effect on each of (+)-acetylcarnitine, (+)-hexanoylcarnitine, (+)-octanoylcarnitine, (+)-decanoylcarnitine, and (+)-palmitoylcarnitine was examined. Contrary to longstanding belief, none of these agents was found to impact significantly upon the activity of CPT I or CPT II. Whereas (+)-acetylcarnitine also failed to influence CACT, both (+)-octanoylcarnitine and (+)-palmitoylcarnitine strongly inhibited this enzyme with a similar IC50 value (∼35 μm) under the assay conditions employed. Remarkably, (+)-decanoylcarnitine was even more potent (IC50 ∼5 μm), whereas (+)-hexanoylcarnitine was far less potent (IC50 >200 μm). These findings resolve a 35-year-old puzzle by establishing unambiguously that medium and long chain (+)-acylcarnitines suppress mitochondrial fatty acid transport solely through the inhibition of the CACT component. They also reveal a surprising rank order of potency among the various (+)-acylcarnitines in this respect and should prove useful in the design of future experiments in which selective blockade of CACT is desired.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, studies from this and other laboratories demonstrated that certain (+)-acylcarnitines (i.e. fatty acid esters of the unnaturald-isomer of carnitine), such as (+)-decanoylcarnitine and (+)-octanoylcarnitine, blocked the oxidation of long chain fatty acids but not of octanoic acid in rat liver both in vitro andin vivo (1Williamson J.R.

The supposition was that these agents exerted their action at the level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; DC, decanoylcarnitine; OC, octanoylcarnitine; CACT, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase; OG, octyl glucoside; PC, palmitoylcarnitine; HC, hexanoylcarnitine. , a step that is bypassed in the oxidation of octanoate. Moreover, previous experiments by Fritz and Marquis (7Fritz I.B. Marquis N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using isolated mitochondria appeared to have established this point directly. It is important to note, however, that all of these studies were conducted before the recognition that a carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) also operates in the mitochondrial transport of long chain fatty acids but not of medium chain fatty acids (8Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Also, at that time it had not yet emerged that the CPT system encompasses two distinct gene products CPT I and CPT II, having separate mitochondrial locations (outer and inner membranes, respectively) and very different properties, e.g.sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, K m for carnitine, and detergent lability (9McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). A careful review of the literature, now with the advantage of hindsight, reveals that the precise mechanism of action of (+)-acylcarnitines on mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation has actually never been firmly delineated. Of particular note is that in their initial characterization of mitochondrial CACT, Pande (8Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and Pande and Parvin (10Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6683-6691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) presented evidence that the enzyme can be inhibited to some extent by medium and long chain (+)-acylcarnitines. Taking this fact into consideration, it seemed to us entirely possible that the results of earlier work suggesting that the same compounds inhibit one or both of the CPT enzymes (7Fritz I.B. Marquis N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 11Delisle G. Fritz I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) could equally be well explained if their site of action was exclusively at the level of CACT. This observation prompted us to ask whether using current and highly specific assays for CPT I and CPT II (+)-acylcarnitines ranging in chain length from C2 to C16 has any effect on either of these enzymes in rat liver mitochondria. The results outlined below clearly establish that they do not. Rather, the C6-C16 derivatives are all shown to be specific inhibitors of CACT with a broad-ranging hierarchy of potency. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (∼300 g of body weight) were maintained on regular Purina chow and used in the fed state. Liver mitochondria were isolated as described by McGarry et al. (12McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) using Method A and suspended in ice-cold 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The protein concentration was measured using the method of Lowry et al. (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial CPT activity was determined in a variety of ways, all at 30 °C. In Assay 1, the reaction was followed in the direction palmitoyl-CoA + [14C]l-carnitine → palmitoyl-[14C]l-carnitine + CoASH. The reaction mixture contained in a final volume of 0.5 ml: 30 mm KCl, 105 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 500 μm[14C]l-carnitine (∼280,000 cpm), 1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 4 mm ATP, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm GSH, 2 mm KCN, 40 μg/ml rotenone, and ∼0.25 mg of mitochondrial protein. To measure CPT I activity the mitochondria were kept intact, and incubations were carried out in the absence or presence of 100 μm malonyl-CoA or the indicated concentration of (+)-acylcarnitine. Under these conditions, the assay monitors only the external malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPT I activity together with a small and variable contribution of internal CPT II, resulting from the unavoidable minor damage of mitochondria during the isolation procedure (14Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). CPT II activity was measured using the same system except that the mitochondrial suspension was first brought to 1% (w/v) with octyl glucoside (OG) and kept on ice for 30 min before assay. This treatment destroys CPT I activity while causing complete release of the detergent-stable and malonyl-CoA-insensitive CPT II isoform (14Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of mitochondria and were terminated with 0.5 ml of 1.2 n HCl after 4 min. The palmitoyl-[14C]l-carnitine formed was extracted with butanol and quantified by scintillation counting (12McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar,14Esser V. Brown N.F. Cowan A.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Assay 2 measured the activity of CPT II in OG-treated mitochondria in the “physiological” direction, i.e.palmitoyl-[14C]l-carnitine + CoASH → palmitoyl-CoA + [14C]l-carnitine. Here the reaction mixture contained initially 25 μmpalmitoyl-[14C]l-carnitine (∼30,000 cpm), 100 μm CoASH, and ∼0.25 mg of mitochondrial protein together with the other components used in Assay 1, and the rate of loss of label from palmitoylcarnitine was followed for over 4 min. In Assay 3, used only with intact mitochondria, the initial reactants were 125 μm [14C]l-carnitine (∼280,000 cpm), 125 μmpalmitoyl-l-carnitine, and ∼0.75 mg of mitochondrial protein together with the other components listed for Assay 1. Under these conditions (absence of external CoASH), CPT I cannot operate, but palmitoyl-[14C]l-carnitine is still formed because of the combined activity of CACT and internal CPT II,i.e. both the external [14C]l-carnitine and unlabeled palmitoyl-l-carnitine can enter the matrix via CACT, and label is exchanged between them through the action of CPT II using the matrix pool of CoASH. In this isotope exchange assay, the appearance of label in palmitoylcarnitine was monitored for over 4 min. In all three assays, the reaction rate was essentially linear over the 4-min period. The sources of all reaction components and (+)-acylcarnitines have been given previously (3McGarry J.D. Meier J.M. Foster D.W. J. Biol.

CPT I and CPT II catalyze the reversible reaction: palmitoyl-CoA + carnitine ↔ palmitoylcarnitine + CoASH. We shall refer to the reaction generating palmitoylcarnitine as “left → right” and the opposite reaction as “right → left.” As seen from TableI, 100 μm malonyl-CoA had the expected inhibitory effect on CPT I (Assay 1, intact mitochondria), the suppression being ∼80%. The residual activity stemmed from (a) partial damage to the mitochondria during their preparation, allowing limited exposure of the usually latent malonyl-CoA-insensitive CPT II, and (b) some desensitization of CPT I to the inhibitor, a phenomenon that always occurs when dealing with mitochondria from fed animals if extreme precautions are not taken to maintain the mitochondria at 0–4 °C at every step before assay (15Zammit V.A.

Tanaka K. New Developments in Fatty Acid Oxidation. 375. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 47-61Google Scholar). The key point to be emphasized, however, is that none of the (+)-acylcarnitines tested impacted significantly on CPT I activity or suppressed the activity of CPT II, regardless of the direction in which the reaction was measured (Assays 1 and 2 with OG-solubilized mitochondria). In other experiments, raising the concentration of (+)-OC to 1 mm still had no impact on Assays 1 and 2.Table IEffects of malonyl-CoA and (+)-acylcarnitines on components of the CPT system in rat liver mitochondriaAssay 1Assay 2 OG-solubilized, CPT II, right → leftAssay 3 Intact, CPT II + CACT, isotope exchangeIntact, CPT I, left → rightOG-solubilized, CPT II, left → right% of control% of control% of controlControl100 1-a2.9 nmol · min−1 · mg mitochondrial protein−1.100 1-b5.0 nmol · min−1 · mg mitochondrial protein−1.100 1-c4.4 nmol · min−1 · mg mitochondrial protein−1.100 1-d2745 cpm appearing in palmitoyl-l-carnitine · min−1 · mg mitochondrial protein−1.Malonyl-CoA (100 μm)21.7 ± 3.190.6 ± 2.199.9 ± 1.199.3 ± 1.0(+)-AC (200 μm) 1-eAC, aceytlcarnitine.98.5 ± 2.0101.3 ± 1.398.0 ± 3.6100.1 ± 0.9(+)-HC (200 μm)98.5 ± 2.797.2 ± 2.799.2 ± 1.569.0 ± 1.5(+)-OC (200 μm)101.0 ± 3.5102.0 ± 3.2101.3 ± 1.517.0 ± 0.1(+)-DC (200 μm)96.0 ± 4.298.3 ± 2.496.2 ± 3.03.2 ± 0.2(+)-PC (50 μm)103.1 ± 3.5101.2 ± 2.595.6 ± 1.958.6 ± 0.5(+)-PC (200 μm)93.4 ± 3.789.6 ± 1.092.5 ± 3.222.3 ± 3.5Assays 1–3 were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are means ± S.E. for three experiments.1-a 2.9 nmol · min−1 · mg mitochondrial protein−1.1-b 5.0 nmol · min−1 · mg mitochondrial protein−1.1-c 4.4 nmol · min−1 · mg mitochondrial protein−1.1-d 2745 cpm appearing in palmitoyl-l-carnitine · min−1 · mg mitochondrial protein−1.1-e AC, aceytlcarnitine.

The small effect of malonyl-CoA seen in the assay of CPT II from “left → right” was not because of enzyme inhibition but rather because of low-grade release of free CoASH resulting from nonspecific breakdown of malonyl-CoA by the detergent-solubilized mitochondria. This has the effect of displacing the equilibrium position of the reaction to the left and is not observed when the assay is run in the presence of thiol reagents, such as N-ethylmaleimide or sodium tetrathionate, to trap any CoASH generated in the system (data not shown). Also, the apparent 10% suppression of CPT II activity caused by 200 μm (+)-PC in Assay 1 with OG-solubilized mitochondria was probably a detergent effect resulting from the simultaneous presence of OG and the amphipathic long chain acylcarnitine at high concentration. A similar phenomenon was observed previously using other detergent mixtures (17Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9822-9827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to their lack of effect in Assays 1 and 2, both medium and long chain (+)-acylcarnitines (but not (+)-acetylcarnitine) markedly suppressed the exchange of 14C betweenl-carnitine and palmitoyl-l-carnitine in Assay 3, the degree of inhibition being 97, 83, 78, and 31% by (+)-DC, (+)-OC, (+)-PC, and (+)-HC, respectively, when used at a fixed concentration of 200 μm (Table I). When each compound was tested over a range of concentrations, the IC50 values for (+)-DC, (+)-OC, (+)-PC, and (+)-HC were found to be ∼5, 33, 38, and >200 μm, respectively, under the experimental conditions employed here (Fig. 1). As CPT I cannot function during Assay 3 because of the absence of external CoASH, malonyl-CoA, not surprisingly, was totally without effect (Table I). The unique feature of this assay is that it monitors the combined activity of CACT and internal CPT II in intact mitochondria. Because neither CPT I nor CPT II is influenced by any of the (+)-acylcarnitines examined here (see above), it follows that the C6–C16 derivatives act only on the CACT component of the mitochondrial CPT system. In the present study, we have revisited an issue that surprisingly has laid dormant and unresolved for more than 30 years, namely the question of how (+)-acylcarnitines suppress the mitochondrial oxidation of long chain fatty acids. It was originally proposed that they do so by inhibiting one or both of the CPT enzymes (7Fritz I.B. Marquis N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 11Delisle G. Fritz I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed based on this assumption, this laboratory and others used (+)-DC and (+)-OC to block hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production in the perfused rat liver (1Williamson J.R. Browning E.T. Scholz R. Kreisberg R.A. Fritz I. Diabetes. 1968; 17: 194-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Williamson J.R. Browning E.T. Thurman R.G. Scholz R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1974; 249: 7984-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to effect the rapid reversal of diabetic ketoacidosis in intact alloxanized rats (4McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Diabetes. 1974; 23: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Subsequently, however, Pande (8Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and Pande and Parvin (10Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6683-6691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the sequential operation of CPT I and CPT II in mitochondrial long chain fatty acid oxidation is coupled by a third component, i.e.CACT, which allows the one-for-one exchange of l-carnitine and acyl-l-carnitine across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Furthermore, they demonstrated that CACT can be inhibited by certain (+)-acylcarnitines, although the assay employed showed a rather high background activity, and a detailed comparison of the relative effectiveness of different chain length (+)-acylcarnitines was not carried out (8Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Pande S.V. Parvin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6683-6691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation left open the question of whether such compounds act not only on CACT but also at the level of CPT I and/or CPT II. Armed with our current and more sophisticated understanding of the CPT system (9McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar) together with specific assays for its various components, we considered it important to readdress this matter, albeit after a 25-year hiatus. What emerges is an unambiguous answer to the issue at hand, namely that over a broad range of chain lengths (from C2 to C16) none of the (+)-acylcarnitines that we tested affect CPT I or CPT II in mitochondria from rat liver (and presumably from other tissues). By contrast, whereas (+)-acetylcarnitines also had no impact on CACT activity, the medium and long chain (+)-acylcarnitines did inhibit this enzyme. Interestingly, under the defined conditions of our assay, (+)-DC (IC50 ∼5 μm) proved to be far more potent than either (+)-OC or (+)-PC, both of which displayed a similar IC50 value (∼35 μm), whereas (+)-HC was the least effective (IC50 >200 μm). Thus, it is solely through the inhibition of CACT that these agents block hepatic ketogenesis from long chain fatty acids (1Williamson J.R. Browning E.T. Scholz R. Kreisberg R.A. Fritz I. Diabetes. 1968; 17: 194-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Williamson J.R. Browning E.T. Thurman R.G. Scholz R. J. Biol.

Because the entire CPT system is bypassed in the oxidation of medium chain fatty acids, the failure of (+)-acylcarnitines to suppress ketogenesis from octanoate (1Williamson J.R. Browning E.T. Scholz R. Kreisberg R.A. Fritz I. Diabetes. 1968; 17: 194-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7984-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is readily explained. The current findings also provide explanations for two additional longstanding and puzzling observations. First, why using increasing concentrations of (+)-PC did Fritz and Marquis (7Fritz I.B. Marquis N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) see an initial apparent inhibition followed by a subsequent paradoxical stimulation of CPT activity in rat heart mitochondria? Almost certainly this is because they employed an isotope exchange assay in which the initial reactants were palmitoyl-l-carnitine, [3H]carnitine, and CoASH, and the rate of appearance of labeled palmitoylcarnitine was measured. It is now clear that this assay monitors the combined activity of CPT I, CPT II, and CACT and that the suppression of isotope exchange observed at the lower concentrations of (+)-PC (7Fritz I.B. Marquis N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) resulted not from the inhibition of CPT I or CPT II as the authors concluded but from the suppression of CACT activity. The enhancement of isotope exchange seen with much higher concentrations of (+)-PC (7Fritz I.B. Marquis N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1226-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) undoubtedly stemmed from the detergent effect of this agent (which the authors actually documented) to cause the inactivation of CPT I, loss of translocase function, and simultaneous exposure of the detergent-stable CPT II. Second, why in the studies of McGarry and Foster (6McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7984-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the perfused rat liver was the inhibitory effect of (+)-OC on ketogenesis from oleate so readily overcome by the addition of (−)-octanoyl-l-carnitine ((−)-OC) orl-carnitine itself to the perfusate? Knowing now that the anti-ketogenic effect of (+)-OC results from the inhibition of CACT rather than the inhibition of CPT I or CPT II, a simple answer is evident. As shown by Pande (8Pande S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), (+)-acylcarnitines act as competitive inhibitors against l-carnitine in the CACT reaction. Clearly, under our experimental conditions where (−)-OC underwent β-oxidation, it was the accumulation of intracellularl-carnitine (which we measured at the time (6McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7984-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) that overcame the attenuation of oleate oxidation by (+)-OC. The provision of exogenous carnitine obviously had the same effect (6McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7984-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We consider the current findings to be important for several reasons. First, they resolve a number of hitherto confusing observations surrounding the mechanism of action of (+)-acylcarnitines on the mitochondrial CPT system. Second, Assay 3 as described here provides a simple method for measuring the combined activities of mitochondrial CACT and CPT II. This could have practical utility in that it affords a selective screening tool for potential modulators of CACT activity provided that the test compound is first shown not to alter the activity of CPT II. Third, the data reveal a striking and surprising difference in potency between the various (+)-acylcarnitines with regard to the inhibition of CACT and establish the C10compound as a particularly effective agent for this purpose (Unfortunately, the C12 and C14 homologues were not available for study.). Finally, given the recent explosion of interest in the role of the CPT system in fuel homeostasis, the knowledge gained from this study will allow more accurate interpretation of future experiments in which (+)-acylcarnitines might be used as inhibitors of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation."

Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE plays a key role in lipoprotein particle clearance from the blood plasma through its interaction with members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family (2Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). ApoE exists as one of three predominant isoforms (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant isoform (ApoE3) contains cysteine at position 112 and arginine at position 158. ApoE2 has cysteines at both positions 112 and 158, while apoE4 has arginines at these positions. Structural characterization studies (3Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 6249-6258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that apoE is composed of two independently folded domains. The 10-kDa C-terminal domain (residues 216–299) has a high lipid binding affinity and is responsible for apoE self-association in the absence of lipid. The 22-kDa N-terminal domain (residues 1–191) adopts a water-soluble, monomeric globular conformation that is resistant to denaturation. The N-terminal domain associates poorly with plasma lipoproteins (5Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Westerlund J.A. Weisgraber K.H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that either the lipid binding affinity of this domain is weak or the C-terminal domain is required to initiate association with lipoprotein particles. The LDL receptor binding site of apoE has been localized to the N-terminal domain of the protein between residues 130 and 150 (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region is rich in basic amino acids, and their proposed role in receptor interactions is consistent with studies demonstrating loss of receptor binding after chemical modification of lysine and arginine residues (7Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Brown J.H. Gross E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7279-7287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of lipid, apoE does not recognize the LDL receptor, while complexation of full-length apoE or the isolated N-terminal domain with lipid results in particles that bind efficiently to the LDL receptor (9Innerarity T.L. Friedlander E.J. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that a lipid binding-induced conformational change in apoE, or more specifically the N-terminal domain, is essential for apoE to serve as a ligand for receptor-mediated endocytosis of plasma lipoproteins. The x-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain in the lipid-free state is known (10Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This domain is composed of four extended amphipathic α-helices connected by short loops. The global fold is a helix bundle wherein the nonpolar faces of the α-helices are directed toward the center of the bundle, adopting a leucine zipper-like motif. In addition, numerous salt bridge interactions exist within helices and on adjacent helices, probably contributing to the unusually high stability of this domain compared with other apolipoproteins. The x-ray structure of the N-terminal domain of apoE has led to a model of the lipid-associated conformation of the protein wherein it adopts an open conformation to manifest receptor binding competence (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many synthetic peptides have been used to study the structural and/or functional characteristics of different regions of apoE. Two peptides, apoE-(263–286) and apoE-(267–289), have been studied by CD and NMR in the presence of SDS. Since apoE-(263–286) was shown to bind to DMPC, it was proposed to be a primary lipid-binding region of apoE (11Sparrow J.T. Sparrow D.A. Fernando G. Culwell A.R. Kovar M. Gotto Jr., A.M.

Their most active peptide consisted of short helices linked by a turn (13Luo P. Braddock D.T. Subramanian R.M. Meredith S.C. Lynn D.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12367-12377Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This peptide is able to increase the binding of LDL particles to fibroblast cell surfaces independent of the LDL receptor, possibly through a novel member of the scavenger receptor family, SR-AI (14Braddock D.T.

Chem. 1983; 258: 12341-12347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed in 1983 that a peptide isolated following chemical cleavage of apoE and complexed with lipid could bind to the LDL receptor, synthetic peptides have been designed to find the minimal sequence needed that retains this property. In 1985, Sparrow et al. (17Sparrow J.T. Sparrow D.A. Culwell A.R. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6984-6988Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that, among other peptides containing the receptor binding region of apoE, apoE3-(126–169) forms complexes with DMPC. Later it was shown that an N,N-distearyl derivative of glycine of the peptide, diC18-Gly-apoE3-(126–169), has a high affinity for lipid and a high helical content in the presence of lipid and was capable of enhancing the uptake and degradation of LDL by fibroblasts (18Mims M.P. Darnule A.T. Tovar R.W. Pownall H.J. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Via D.P. Smith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20539-20547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another synthetic peptide, a tandem repeat of the amino acids 141–155 inhibited 125I-LDL degradation by human fibroblasts (19Dyer C.A. Curtiss L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22803-22806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dyer C.A. Cistola D.P. Parry G.C. Curtiss L.K. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 80-88PubMed Google Scholar). Further modification of this dimeric peptide by acetylation at its N terminus increased its ability to bind cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, enhancing their clearance in vivo (21Nikoulin I.R. Curtiss L.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, apoE-(130–152) has been studied using two-dimensional homonuclear NMR spectroscopy in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles and shown to adopt a helical conformation over its entire length (22Clayton D. Brereton I.M. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1797-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the absence of data demonstrating that this peptide is able to interact with the LDL receptor, however, it is difficult to know if apoE-(130–152) is in a receptor-active conformation. In the present study, we have purified a 58-residue peptide, apoE3-(126–183), encompassing the receptor binding region of apoE and demonstrate its ability to adopt a helical conformation in phospholipid disc complexes that bind the LDL receptor. Moreover, two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR data showed that resolution of the structure of this peptide is feasible. Recombinant apoE3-(1–183), expressed and purified according to Ref. 23Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, was resuspended at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml in 4 m guanidine HCl, 0.1m HCl. CNBr was added at a CNBr/methionine ratio of >100 and incubated under N2 atmosphere for 24 h in the dark. After quenching the reaction by the addition of excess water, the sample was frozen and lyophilized to remove residual CNBr. The sample was resuspended in water and subjected to reversed-phase HPLC using a semipreparative Zorbax RX-C18 column with a water (plus 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) to acetonitrile (plus 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) 0.5%/min gradient. Isolated apoE3-(126–183) was lyophilized, dissolved in a minimal volume of 0.1 m HCl, and relyophilized to remove residual trifluoroacetic acid. DMPG (Avanti Polar Lipids) was resuspended in CHCl3/CH3OH (3:1 (v/v) ratio) in a glass tube and dried under a N2 stream. Further dryness was achieved under vacuum (16 h). The dried lipid sample was dispersed in prewarmed (37 °C) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) to a final lipid concentration of 5 mg/ml and vortexed for 1 min. From this solution, small unilamellar vesicles (∼200 nm in diameter) were prepared by extrusion using 200-nm filters (24MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.Ph.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) with a miniextruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). ApoE3-(1–183) or apoE3-(126–183) were complexed with DMPG by mixing preformed DMPG vesicles with the corresponding protein (or peptide) resuspended in water, at a DMPG/protein weight ratio of 2.5:1 and then incubating overnight at 24 °C with gentle shaking. The sample was adjusted to a density of 1.10 g/ml with KBr (final volume 2.5 ml), transferred to a 5-ml quick-seal ultracentrifuge tube, overlaid with 0.9% saline, and centrifuged at 416,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Fractions (300 μl) were collected from the top and assayed for protein using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and stored at 4 °C. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorimeter (model LS 50B) was used to monitor DMPG vesicle clearance as a result of association with apolipoprotein (or peptide) by 90° light scattering (25Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto Jr., A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 580 nm with a slit width of 3 nm. The temperature inside the cuvette was regulated at 32 °C, and all solutions were preincubated at this temperature. Buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) was added to DMPG vesicles (350 μg) to a final volume of 1 ml and equilibrated for 10 min. Specified apolipoproteins or peptides were then added and rapidly mixed, and the change in light scattering was monitored as a function of time. Far UV CD spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) as described previously (26Ryan R.O. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1525-1530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flotation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 20 °C in a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge using interference optics following procedures described by Nelsonet al. (27Nelson C.A. Lee J.A. Brewster M. Morris M.D. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to experimentally determine both the partial specific volume (v̄) and the apparent weight average molecular weight (Mr(app)). Three aliquots of apoE3-(126–183)·DMPG complexes were dialyzed against three buffer solutions containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.2) and different concentrations of KBr or NaBr, providing solvent densities of 1.25, 1.30, and 1.35 g/ml and protein concentrations of 0.50, 0.59, and 0.31 mg/ml, respectively. The solvent densities were calculated using the program SEDNTERP. An aliquot (110 μl) of each sample solution was loaded into a six-sector CFE sample cell along with 115 μl of the corresponding dialysate for each solution. Runs were performed at speeds of 10,000 and 14,000 rpm, and each speed was maintained until there was no significant difference in scans taken 2 h apart to ensure that equilibrium was achieved. Electron microscopy was performed on a Philips EM420 as described previously (28Wientzek M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normal human skin fibroblasts were grown to 60% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, cells were switched to medium containing 10% delipidated fetal bovine serum. At confluence, cells were cooled on ice for 30 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing fatty acid-free albumin, and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free albumin, 1.5 μg/ml125I-labeled LDL (specific activity ∼300 cpm/ng of protein), and 20 μg of receptor-binding competitor. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline/fatty acid-free albumin and twice with phosphate-buffered saline alone. Then the cells were dissolved by incubation with 0.1m NaOH for 1 h at 24 °C. The relative ability of DMPG·apolipoprotein complexes to compete for LDL receptor binding sites was determined by measuring cell-associated radioactivity in a Beckman LS 6000 TA liquid scintillation spectrometer. Cell protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. LDL was isolated from human plasma by sequential density centrifugation (29Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and was iodinated according to Langeret al. (30Langer T. Strober W. Levy R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 52: 1528-1536Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). ApoE3-(126–183) was enriched in15N by culturing bacteria harboring the apoE3-(1–183)/pET plasmid construct in M9 minimal medium containing15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source (23Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and purified as described above. A sensitivity-enhanced1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum (31Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) was acquired with the peptide resuspended in 50% TFE-d3, 40% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 3.3, at a final concentration of ∼2 mm. The HSQC spectrum was acquired at 30 °C on a Varian Unity INOVA 500 spectrometer with the following parameters: 128 and 896 complex points, respectively, for 15N and 1H dimension. The spectral widths were 1115 Hz in 15N and 6000 Hz in 1H dimension. The carrier positions were at 115.5 and 4.75 ppm, respectively, in 15N and 1H dimension. ApoE3-(126–183) was obtained from recombinant human N-terminal apoE3 (residues 1–183) following CNBr chemical cleavage (see “Experimental Procedures”). The peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 1) and further characterized by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1, inset). According to the HPLC trace and mass spectrometry data, the peptide is >99% pure with a mass of 6595.1 ± 1.2 Da, in agreement with the expected theoretical average calculated mass (6594.5 Da) of the peptide. After HPLC purification, the peptide was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. The CD spectrum of apoE3-(126–183) in water (pH 3.3) revealed a random coil, nonstructured conformation (Fig. 2,solid line). Above pH ∼4, the peptide tends to aggregate (data not shown). Upon the stepwise addition of TFE (0–50%, v/v), the helical content of the peptide increases up to 69%, as shown by the increase in negative ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 2,dashed line, and TableI). Likewise, upon the progressive addition of DPC, a micelle-forming detergent, an α-helical conformation (68% in presence of 13 mm DPC) is induced in the peptide (Fig. 2, dotted line, and TableI).Table IFar UV circular dichroism spectroscopy of apoE3-(126–183)TFE addedα-Helical contentDPC addedα-Helical content% (v/v)%mm%0170175190.281710360.551915510.82320602.84225685.5593067862506912.968Data were obtained at pH 3.3. The protein concentration in absence of TFE or DPC was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated molar absorption coefficient. The concentration was 1.06 mg/ml.

Most exchangeable apolipoproteins possess the capacity to transform phospholipid unilamellar vesicles at the gel-liquid crystalline phase transition temperature into discoidal complexes. During lipid vesicle transformation trials with apoE3-(126–183), we observed that negatively charged DMPG unilamellar vesicles were rapidly cleared at 23 °C, indicating efficient transformation into lipid complexes. Under the same conditions, DMPC vesicles showed a significantly slower clearance rate (data not shown). Thus, we employed DMPG vesicles for studies of peptide-lipid interaction, lipid particle production, and characterization. ApoE3-(126–183)·DMPG disc complexes were purified on a density gradient prior to characterization. The partial specific volume and the apparent molecular mass of the discs were determined by flotation equilibrium experiments at three different densities and two different speeds (Fig. 3). Log fringe displacementversus radial distance squared plots were produced, yielding slope terms (d log fringe displacement/d r 2) for each density and speed condition. The conventional molecular weight equation was rearranged so that a plot of solvent density (ρ) versus(1/ω2) × (d log fringe displacement/d r2), where ω is the speed in rpm, produces a straight line. Using the slope and the yintercept, a partial specific volume (v̄) of 0.942 ml/g and an apparent molecular mass of 252 kDa were calculated for apoE3-(126–183)·DMPG complexes. This mass is in good agreement with data obtained by nondenaturating gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4).Figure 4Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of apoE3-(126–183)· DMPG complexes. Lane 1, protein standards; lane 2, apoE3-(126–183)·DMPG complexes (arrow). The 4–20% acrylamide gradient gel was electrophoresed for 24 h at a constant 150 V at 4 °C and stained with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The disc complexes were further characterized by electron microscopy (data not shown), yielding an average diameter of 13 ± 3 nm. Interestingly, micrographs of peptide-DMPG discs show no evidence of stacking, as often seen with discs composed of DMPC (23Fisher C.A. Wang J. Francis G.A. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Wientzek M. Kay C.M. Oikawa K. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4605-4612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary structure content of the peptide in DMPG disc complexes was determined by far UV CD spectroscopy. Upon binding DMPG, the peptide displayed 80% α-helical character (Fig. 5, dotted line). For comparison, N-terminal apoE3-(1–183) in DMPG complexes also showed a 80% α-helical content (Fig. 5, solid line). Phospholipid unilamellar vesicle transformation into discoidal particles upon apolipoprotein or peptide binding can be monitored by light scattering spectroscopy. Homogeneous DMPG vesicle (diameter ∼200 nm) suspensions prepared by extrusion are turbid. Upon interaction with a suitable apolipoprotein or peptide and transformation into discoidal particles, the diameter of the particles decreases dramatically, leading to a decrease in sample turbidity. Taking advantage of this property, we recorded light scattering as a function of time to monitor peptide association with lipid vesicles. Because interaction of the peptide with DMPG at 23 °C is extremely rapid, we conducted studies at 32 °C. At this temperature, using apoE3-(1–183), the rate of transformation of DMPG vesicles into disc particles is still rapid (Fig. 6), requiring ∼30 s to reach 50% maximal clearance (t12). The reaction end point was achieved in about 400–450 s. In the case of apoE3-(126–183), 90% of maximal clearance was reached within the time (∼5 s) needed to mix the peptide with the vesicles and start recording on the spectrofluorimeter. Thet12 is less than 5 s, and maximal clearance is complete within 180 s. It is important to note that to attain the same maximal clearance level, we used twice the molar amount of peptide compared with apoE3-(1–183). Thus, the lipid/protein molar ratio was 135 in the case of the N-terminal domain and 64 in the case of apoE3-(126–183). The ability of apoE3-(126–183)·DMPG discs to compete with 125I-LDL for binding to the LDL receptor was investigated using cultured human skin fibroblasts (Fig. 7). In the absence of competitor, efficient binding of 125I-LDL occurred. This level of cell-associated radioactivity was normalized to 100%. When incubated in the presence of an excess of unlabeled LDL, a dramatic decrease in cell-associated radioactivity was observed. N-terminal apoE complexed with DMPG competes as well as cold LDL for receptor binding with a 77% decrease in cell-associated radioactivity. These data show that the use of DMPG does not prevent apoE binding to the receptor. In the case of peptide·DMPG complexes, a 73% decrease in 125I-LDL binding was observed, indicating that, under these conditions, apoE3-(126–183) complexed with phospholipids retains 90% (7378) of the receptor binding ability of the N-terminal domain. To test the suitability of the peptide for NMR structure determination, and especially multidimensional NMR experiments, the peptide was enriched with15N. Recombinant apoE3-(1–183) was expressed in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as sole nitrogen source to uniformly 15N label the protein. After CNBr cleavage and purification (see above), ∼95% 15N enrichment of apoE3-(126–183) was achieved, as determined by mass spectrometry. A 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of15N-labeled apoE3-(126–183) was recorded in the presence of 50% TFE (Fig. 8) at pH 3.3. The peaks observed correlate the chemical shift of amide protons with amide nitrogens in the same amino acid. The chemical shifts are well dispersed, resulting in separation of the overall cross-peaks. As expected for a peptide in a α-helical conformation, the central region of the spectrum is crowded and the peaks are generally shifted upfield (32Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). This spectrum demonstrates that complete assignment of the individual resonances is feasible, permitting calculation of the three-dimensional structure of the peptide. X-ray crystal structures of the N-terminal domain of three natural variants of apoE have been determined, improving our understanding of the structural basis of isoform-specific differences in apoE-mediated lipoprotein metabolism. For example, the E2 isoform possesses dramatically reduced affinity for the LDL receptor. It has been shown that this property arises from an altered salt bridge interaction, which results in relocation of the Arg150 side chain outside of the receptor recognition region (33Dong L.-M. Parkin S. Trakhanov S. Rupp B. Simmons T. Arnold K.S. Newhouse Y.M. Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the N-terminal domain of apoE has also led to a model of the lipid-associated conformation of the protein (1Weisgraber K.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 249-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) wherein it is proposed to adopt an open conformation that manifests receptor binding competence. According to this model, the N-terminal domain exposes its hydrophobic interior by opening its structure via a putative hinge region located in the loop between helix 2 and helix 3. Experimental evidence has shown that the N-terminal domain undergoes a conformational change when bound to a lipid surface (34Weisgraber K.H. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Miller N.E. Tall A.R.

Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence alignment studies of the DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) family indicate that C-61 and C-328 (numbers correspond to the E. coli Phe-sensitive isozyme) are highly conserved, as are four of the eleven histidine residues, H-64, H-172, H-207, and H-268 (17Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T.H. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of cysteine residues in DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) has been investigated using chemical modification, and it was found that at least one cysteine residue is required for DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) activity (18Staub M.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that C-61 is catalytically essential in DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) and is a metal ligand (21Stephens C.M. Bauerle R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5762-5767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Sundaram et al. have reported that C-61 is located near the metal in the active site (22Sundaram A.K. Howe D.L. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Park et al. (23Park O.K. Bauerle R. J.

Chemical modification studies of E. coli KDO 8-P synthase reveal that there are two essential cysteine residues (13Hedstrom L. Abeles R. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1988; 157: 816-820Google Scholar, 25Salleh H.M. Patel M.A. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8942-8947Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, using chemical modification studies and site-directed mutagenesis, it was determined that there is at least one essential histidine, H-202, in KDO 8-P synthase (26Sheflyan G.Y. Duewel H.S. Chen G. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14320-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment studies of KDO 8-P synthase and DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) indicate that H-202 in KDO 8-P synthase is homologous to H-268 in DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) (17Subramaniam P.S. Xie G. Xia T.H. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these enzymes catalyze the same type of reaction and appear to require a cysteine residue for activity, and DAH 7-P contains a histidine residue that aligns with an essential histidine in KDO 8-P synthase. Based on these facts, it would appear that histidine residues might also play a role in DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) activity. In this paper, we investigate the role of histidine residues in DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) using chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis.

E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the pT7-7/aroG plasmid, with either the histidine to glycine mutant gene or the wild-type gene, were cultured, and the proteins were isolated and purified as previously reported (27Sheflyan G.Y. Howe D.L. Wilson T.L. Woodard R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11027-11032Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All proteins were >95% pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (30Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein concentrations were determined using the calculated monomeric molecular weight (38 kDa) based on the amino acid sequence of DAH 7-P synthase (Phe). Optical spectroscopy was performed using a Cary 3 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). The circular dichroism spectra of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes were obtained using an Aviv circular dichroism spectrophotometer Model 62 DS and deconvoluted using the method of Sreerama and Woody (31Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) as described by Salleh et al. (25Salleh H.M. Patel M.A. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8942-8947Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The continuous UV spectrophotometric method reported by Schoner and Herrmann (32Schoner R. Herrmann K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5440-5447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), based on the absorbance of the double bond of PEP (λ = 232 nm; ε = 2840 m−1 cm−1), was used to assay DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) activity for both wild-type enzyme and the histidine mutants. The standard assay mixture (1 ml) contained 10 mm BTP buffer (pH 6.8), 150 μm PEP, 500 μm E 4-P, and 1 mm MnCl2. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 25 °C for 5 min and initiated by the addition of DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) (125 nm). To determine the kinetic parameters, the concentration of one substrate was held constant (10 × Km) while the other was varied over the range of 0.1 to 10 × Km. The initial rates were determined from a least-squares fit of the data recorded for the first 30 s of the reaction using Kaleidagraph version 3.08d (Synergy Software). Best fits of Kmand Vmax were determined by fitting the initial velocity versus substrate concentration using a non-linear least squares fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. An alternate method for determining the activity of this mutant was utilized due to its diminished activity. The assay mixture contained 10 mm BTP (pH 6.8), 3 mm E 4-P, 3 mmPEP, 1 mm MnCl2, and the C61G mutant (125 nm) in a total volume of 150 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then quenched with 150 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) activity was measured by determining the amount of DAH 7-P produced using a slight modification of the periodate-thiobarbituric acid assay (3Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Aminoff D. Biochem. J. 1961; 81: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). The oxidation step was performed at 60 °C instead of at room temperature. Two ml of the protein solution (4 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 1 L of 10 mm BTP (pH 6.8) containing 10 mm EDTA for 12 h at 4 °C. The EDTA was subsequently removed by dialyzing the above protein solution against 1 L of metal-free 10 mm BTP (pH 6.8) (3 × 4 h each) at 4 °C. The latter buffer was rendered metal free by passage over a Chelex-100 column. The activity of metal-free wild-type DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) was reduced to 5% of the Mn2+-DAH 7-P synthase (Phe). The concentration of iron bound to protein was determined using the colorimetric method developed by Fish (34Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Metal-free DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) (wild-type and mutants) (12.5 μm) was incubated for 1 h with 10 equivalents of iron (II) sulfate in 10 mm BTP (pH 6.8). The excess iron was removed by dialyzing against 1 L of metal-free 10 mmBTP (pH 6.8) (3 × 4 h each) at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein fractions were analyzed for iron and protein concentrations. Stock solutions of DEPC (10 mm) were prepared in absolute ethanol immediately before use. The inactivation of DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) was performed in a reaction mixture containing 2 μmmetal-free DAH 7-P synthase (Phe), 10 mm BTP (pH 6.8), and DEPC (0.2–1.4 mm) at 4 °C. At various times over 15 min (12 min effective time), aliquots (5 μl) were removed and assayed for residual enzyme activity. The initial concentration of DEPC in the reaction solutions was determined spectrophotometrically by reacting an aliquot with imidazole (10 mm) and measuring the increase in absorbance at 240 nm (ε = 3200 m−1cm−1) (35Melchior Jr., W.B. Fahrney D. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The rate of hydrolysis of DEPC was determined by incubating DEPC (1 mm) in 10 mm BTP (pH 6.8) at 4 °C. Aliquots were assayed for the amount of DEPC remaining at various time intervals using the imidazole assay described above. The enzyme-DEPC inactivation data were fit to the following equation: ln(A/A0)=−(k/k′)I0(1−e−k′t)Equation 1 where A/A0 is the fractional activity remaining at time t, I0 is the initial concentration of DEPC, k is the pseudo-first order rate constant for the inactivation of DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) by DEPC, and k′ is the pseudo first order rate constant for the hydrolysis of DEPC (36Gomi T. Fujioka M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The value of k′ was determined to be 0.026 min−1 at pH 6.8. DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) (25 μm) was incubated in the presence of DEPC (1 mm) in 10 mm BTP of various pH values (6.8–7.2) at 23 °C. After 15 min, the difference UV spectrum was acquired using an identical enzyme solution lacking DEPC as a control. DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) (25 μm) and DEPC (1 mm) were incubated in the absence or presence of Mn2+ (80 μm) in 10 mm BTP (pH 6.8) at 4 °C. At 3-min intervals over 15 min, aliquots were removed and the activity was determined. In a parallel experiment, the number of histidine residues modified at each time interval as above was determined by measuring the increase in the difference spectra at 240 nm. The data were evaluated according to the following equation as described by Tsou (37Horiike K. Tsuge H. McCormick D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6638-6643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Huynh Q.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar): lognxAA01/i−p=log(n−p)+α−1ilogAA0Equation 2 where A/A0 is the fraction of enzyme activity remaining, n is the number of modifiable residues of which p residues, including i essential residues, react with DEPC at a pseudo-first order rate constantk1 and (n − p) nonessential residues react at a rate constantk2 (k2 = αk1), and x is the number of residues remaining after the DEPC inactivation reaction. The number of essential residues is determined by plotting log [(nx/(A/A0)1/i ) − p] as a function of log (A/A0). The variables, p and i, are varied to give the best linear fit, and the value of α is determined from the slope. DEPC was added (1 mm final concentration) to various DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) samples (2 μm) in 10 mm BTP buffers with pH values ranging from 5.8 to 8.5. Aliquots were removed at various times and assayed for residual enzyme activity. The pseudo-first order rate constant of DEPC hydrolysis (k′) was determined independently at each pH. The k′ value increased approximately 5-fold at pH 8.5 as compared with pH 6.8 (0.101versus 0.026 min−1). The pseudo-first order rate constant of DEPC inactivation of DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) was determined at each pH value as described previously. The data were fit to the following equation: kobs[H+]=Kakobs(max)−KakobsEquation 3 where Ka is the acid dissociation constant of the reacting group, and kobs(max) is the pseudo-first order rate constant of the unprotonated reacting group (39Takeuchi M. Asano N. Kameda Y. Matsui K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Metal-free DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) (2 μm) in 10 mm BTP (pH 7.0 or 7.2) was incubated in the presence or absence of 1 mm DEPC for 15 min. An aliquot (100 μl) was diluted with 0.5 mm DTNB, 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 150 mm Tris (pH 7.6) (700 μl). Total free thiol concentration was determined from the absorbance at 412 nm (ε = 13,600 m−1 cm−1). Appropriate control solutions were prepared to correct for background absorption. DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) or its mutants (2 μm) were mixed with an 80 μmconcentration of either PEP, E 4-P, or MnCl2 prior to addition of 1 mm DEPC. After the addition of DEPC, aliquots (5 μl) were removed at various times and the enzyme was assayed for residual activity. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the metal-free H268G mutant enzyme (80 μm) in the absence or presence of CuSO4 (0.8 mm) in 10 mm BTP buffer (pH 6.8) were recorded. Metal-free DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) is inactivated in a time-dependent manner by DEPC as shown in Fig. 1. The pseudo-first order rate constants vary linearly with DEPC concentration (Fig. 1, inset). The second order rate constant for the inactivation of DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) by DEPC obtained from the slope of the plot is 4.9 ± 0.8m−1 s−1 (Fig. 1,inset). Plots of residual enzyme activity as a function of the number of histidine residues modified by DEPC at pH 6.8 with and without Mn2+ (Fig. 2) indicate that activity decreases with an increase in the number of modified histidine residues. After a 15-min incubation of DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) with 1 mm DEPC, five out of the eleven histidine residues were modified with 80% loss of activity. However, over the same time period, seven histidine residues are modified in the presence of Mn2+ with 100% loss of activity (Fig. 2). The number of essential histidine residues as determined using Eq. 2 is one in the presence or absence of Mn2+ (Fig. 3). The values of α, the constant relating the reaction rates of the essential and nonessential residues with and without metal present, are 0.31 and 0.33, respectively. These results indicate that one essential histidine is present and reacts approximately three times faster than the nonessential residues. When metal-free DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) is modified with DEPC, the difference spectrum between the modified and untreated enzymes at pH 6.8 (not shown) or pH 7.0 (Fig. 4A) shows an absorption maximum at 240 nm characteristic of the carbethoxylation of histidine (40Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The lack of a trough at 278 nm (Δε278 = 1310m−1 cm−1) in the difference spectrum indicates that tyrosine residues are not carbethoxylated (41Burstein Y. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues are not modified under these conditions as evidenced by the lack of a peak at 230 nm (42Saluja A.K. McFadden B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1980; 94: 1091-1097Google Scholar). However, as discussed below, cysteine residues appear to be modified at higher pH values or in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 4,B and C). DEPC inactivation of DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) was studied in the pH range of 5.8–8.5. A representative plot of DEPC inactivation of metal-free DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) as a function of pH is depicted in Fig. 5 A, which reveals that the data are discontinuous. Although the observed discontinuity is not expected for this type of experiment, several repeated attempts produced analogous results. The data are discontinuous between pH 7.0 and 7.2, and two pKa values can be calculated using Eq. 3. The pKa values are approximately 6.0 and 7.5, as determined from the available data. Metal-free DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) modified by DEPC at pH values immediately before and after the discontinuity (pH 7.0 and 7.2, respectively) were characterized using UV-difference spectroscopy (Fig. 4, A and B). Cysteine residues appear to be carbethoxylated at pH 7.2, based on the appearance of a shoulder at 230 nm in the UV-difference spectra (Fig. 4 B) (42Saluja A.K. McFadden B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1980; 94: 1091-1097Google Scholar). Titrating DEPC modified metal-free DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) at the pH values bordering the discontinuity with DTNB, further substantiated this finding. Of the seven cysteine residues in DAH 7-P synthase (Phe), the number remaining after DEPC modification at pH values 7.0 and 7.2 are 6.7 ± 0.4 and 5.8 ± 0.3, respectively, implying that one cysteine residue is modified by DEPC at the higher pH. In the presence of Mn2+, DEPC reacts with this cysteine residue at pH 7.0 (Fig. 4 C), and the discontinuity in the pH-DEPC inactivation plot (Fig. 5 B) now occurs between pH 6.8 and 7.0. The UV-difference spectra of the metal-free C61G mutant (22Sundaram A.K. Howe D.L. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) modified at pH 7.2 is shown in Fig. 4 D. The shoulder at 230 nm is no longer present, indicating that for the C61G mutant, in contrast to wild-type enzyme at pH 7.2, no cysteine residues are modified by DEPC. From these observations, it appears that C-61 is the cysteine residue modified by DEPC at higher pH values. The effect of pH on the DEPC inactivation of the C61G mutant is shown in Fig. 5 C. The rate of DEPC inactivation increases with increasing pH, and the discontinuity in the DEPC versus pH plot observed with the wild-type enzyme is no longer observed with the C61G mutant. The rate of inactivation by DEPC for the C61G mutant enzyme is approximately the same obtained for wild-type DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) below pH 7 (Fig. 5, A and C). The pKa of the essential histidine residue in the C61G mutant is 7.0, as compared with 6.0 in the wild-type enzyme. The activity of the C61G mutant as a function of pH indicates that the C61G mutant appears to have a pH optimum greater than 8 (Fig. 5 D). In contrast, the pH optimum of wild-type DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) is 6.8 (43Simpson R.J. Davidson B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The conformational integrity of each mutant DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) was analyzed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. There appear to be significant structural changes for the mutants H172G, H207G, and H304G. The CD spectra of the H268G and C61G mutants are similar to wild-type DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) (22Sundaram A.K. Howe D.L. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (data not shown). A summary of the kinetic constants for the various mutants is given in Table II. Substantial changes in Km values for E 4-P are seen for the H172G, H207G, and H304G mutants, whereas only the H172G enzyme, and to a lesser extent the H304G mutant, demonstrate any significant increase in Km for PEP. Mutation of H-268 to glycine renders DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) inactive. With the exception of the C61G and H268G mutants, only modest effects on kcatare observed (Table II) for the other histidine to glycine DAH 7-P synthase (Phe) mutants.Table IIKinetics constants of DAH 7-P synthases (Phe)EnzymeKmkcatkcat/KmPEPE 4 PPEPE 4 Pμms−1s−1 μm−1Wild-type 2-aPreviously published results (22).986323.60.37H64G 2-aPreviously published results (22).40140531.30.38H172G258 ± 15460 ± 548 ± 10.030.017H207G19 ± 2437 ± 3610 ± 20.530.023H268G2-bNA, not active.NANANANANAH304G64 ± 6822 ± 6171 ± 21.10.09C61G 2-aPreviously published results (22).>100045>0.6ND 2-cND, not determined.ND2-a Previously published results (22Sundaram A.K.

We propose a simple steric interference model to explain the observed pattern of KMnO4modification of thymines. ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction chloroacetaldehyde dimethyl sulfate potassium permanganate metal responsive element metallothionein-I homopurine/homopyrimidine base pair(s) osmium tetroxide phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The familiar DNA double helix typically exists in B-form when studied as a purified molecule in solution. The extent to which DNA adopts other, more exotic structures in vivo is a fascinating question of continuing interest (reviewed in Ref. 1Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994Google Scholar). For example, during transcription and replication, DNA exists in a partially unpaired configuration. These two enzymatic processes promote obvious non-B DNA structures that are transient and largely sequence-independent. Under specific in vitro conditions, unusual non-B DNA structures have also been shown to exist at specific sequences (reviewed in Refs. 1Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function.

Science. 1989; 243: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) is characterized by an intramolecular DNA triplex and accompanying regions of base unpairing with a sequence requirement for homopurine/homopyrimidine mirror repeats (7Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M.

Dyn. 1986; 3: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All three of the non-B structures described above are stabilized by negative supercoiling (which favors base unpairing) and typically require additional sequence-specific in vitro conditions. For example, H-DNA isomers involving the pyrimidine triple helix motif are strongly stabilized by protonation of cytosines at acidic pH (7Frank-Kamenetskii M.D. Mirkin S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 65-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and Z-DNA structures are stabilized at high ionic strength (3Kim J. Yang C. DasSarma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Z-DNA, cruciform DNA, and H-DNA have been detected in isolated plasmids under specific in vitro conditions, and in isolated nuclear preparations using antibodies thought to be specific for these structures (10Agazie Y.M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2656-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The major non-B DNA structures described above all contain regions of base unpairing. Detection of unpaired structures at single nucleotide resolution typically requires treatment of large amounts (5–10 μg) of purified plasmid with chemical probes that specifically modify either unpaired or unstacked bases (16Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Here we apply a different approach involving the use of cell-permeable chemical probes together with LMPCR1 to characterize the in vitro and in vivo chemical reactivity of a naturally occurring R/Y sequence. LMPCR has been shown to be an excellent tool for in vivo footprinting of protein-DNA interactions and methylation patterns (17Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). We now apply LMPCR to examine the possibility of unusual DNA structures or protein binding within a long R/Y sequence in vivo. LMPCR permits the analysis of specific gene sequences at nucleotide resolution using as little as 10 pg of plasmid or 2 μg of total eukaryotic genomic DNA. LMPCR relies on exponential amplification of a population of gene-specific chemical degradation fragments to create a sequencing pattern. The focus of our study is a peculiar R/Y sequence upstream of the mouseMT-I gene (19Bacolla A. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1639-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We refer to this element as theMT-I R/Y sequence (Fig. 1). The MT-I R/Y sequence is of particular interest for three reasons. First, it is upstream of the well characterized MT-I gene. Metallothioneins are thought to play an important role in metal homeostasis (21Anderson R.D. Taplitz S.J. Wong S. Bristol G. Larkin B. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Thiele D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).MT-I gene expression is induced by heavy metals via transcription factor binding to several copies of a 15-bp metal responsive element (MRE) present in the promoter regions of MT genes (24Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Culotta V.C. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Hamer D.H. Walling M. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 273-288PubMed Google Scholar, 27Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y.

Chem. 1981; 256: 5712-5716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse MT-I proximal promoter contains six such MREs mediating metal induction. Upon exposure to heavy metals, a rapid 5–20-fold increase in MT mRNA levels is typically detected in cultured cells (24Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Culotta V.C. Hamer D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Second, the MT-I R/Y sequence is of interest because of its unusual length and provocative location (centered 1184 bp upstream of the MT-I gene). The element is a 128-bp R/Y sequence containing a single pyrimidine interruption within the homopurine strand. The MT-I R/Y sequence contains no single plane of extensive mirror symmetry, but it contains several imperfect homopurine/homopyrimidine mirror repeats. Third, this sequence has been previously studied in purified plasmid in vitro and shown to adopt a non-B DNA structure reminiscent of H-DNA in vitro. Formation of this non-B DNA structure requires negative superhelical strain and additional stabilization is offered by low pH (19Bacolla A. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1639-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Our previous genetic studies have not detected a function for the MT-I R/Y sequence in the regulation of MT-I gene expression after transient transfection of reporter constructs into cultured cells (20Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).Figure 1Mouse MT-I promoter regions studied by in vivo footprinting. Upper sequence includes the 128-bp MT-I R/Y sequence and flanking region. The pyrimidine strand (shaded) is studied in this paper. The MT-I R/Y sequence is centered at position 1184 relative to the major MT-I transcription start point (tsp). A single pyrimidine interruption (·) occurs within the purine strand at position −1176. Lower sequence is the TATA proximal promoter region of the MT-I gene. Shown are three of the six metal responsive elements (MRE) and the TATA box (shaded). The major MT-I tsp is indicated by +1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We now use chemical probes of DNA structure together with LMPCR to determine if the MT-I R/Y sequence adopts a discernable non-B DNA structure before or after metal induction of cultured cells. We first show LMPCR data for plasmids studied in vitro. These data confirm and extend our published demonstration of a non-B DNA structure that depends upon negative supercoiling and acidic pH (20Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In contrast, the results of in vivo probing with KMnO4 and chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) do not indicate the formation of either a profoundly unpaired DNA structure or protein complexes within the MT-I R/Y sequence. Using KMnO4 as a probe of thymine accessibility, we show bothin vivo and with purified genomic DNA that thymine residues within the R/Y sequence react with KMnO4 in a predictable pattern that is more consistent than for thymine residues outside the R/Y sequence. These data suggest that although the R/Y sequence is not forming an unpaired structure, its thymine bases have subtle distinguishing characteristics. Possible explanations for the uniform pattern of thymine reactivity within the MT-I R/Y sequence are discussed. Plasmid pMTCAT (6300 bp (29Maher L.J. Wold B. Dervan P.B. Science. 1989; 245: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar)) contains ∼1775 bp of the mouse MT-I promoter including the upstreamMT-I R/Y sequence. Plasmid pMTCAT at native superhelical density was extracted from E. coli DH5α cells and purified by CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in the presence of ethidium bromide (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite chemistry on an ABI 394 synthesizer. The oligonucleotides were purified on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, eluted from gel slices, and desalted by Sep-Pak C18cartridge chromatography (Waters). Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For metal induction and RNA isolation, NIH3T3 cells at 90% confluency were shifted to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without 2 μm CdCl2 for 4 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. In each 10-μl reverse transcription reaction, 15 μg of total RNA was combined with 0.5 pmol of the MT-I mRNA reverse primer (5′-GCAG2AG2TGCACT2GCAGT2C) and 0.5 pmol of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA reverse primer (5′-A3TG2 CAGC3TG2TGAC2) in 200 mm KCl. The MT-I and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers yield reverse transcripts of 159 and 110 nucleotides, respectively. Reverse primers were annealed to total RNA by incubation at 80 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 20 min, and 37 °C for 30 min. Each reaction was supplemented with 25 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm dNTPs, 10 pg/μl actinomycin D, and 25 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase enzyme (Promega). Primer extension was carried out at 42 °C for 30 min. Each reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of room temperature stop buffer (0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% glycogen) followed by ethanol precipitation. Reverse transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis through a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). Anhydrous hydrazine, dimethyl sulfate (DMS), 2,2′-bipyridyl, formic acid, osmium tetroxide (OT: 4% weight solution in H2O), KMnO4, and piperidine were obtained from Aldrich. CAA (45% weight solution in H2O) was obtained from Fluka. All chemical reagents were used without further purification. The chemical reactivities of pMTCAT DNA and naked genomic DNA were analyzed using modifications of published procedures (31Pestov D. Dayn A. Siyanova E. George D. Mirkin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6527-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, supercoiled or HpaI-linearized pMTCAT DNA samples (1 μg) were dissolved in 100 μl of buffer containing 15 μg of sheared calf-thymus DNA as a carrier. For plasmid experiments at pH 4.5, the buffer contained 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 4 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. For plasmid experiments at pH 7.1, the buffer contained 25 mmMOPS, pH 7.1, 4 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. For in vitro analysis of genomic DNA, 40 μg of purified NIH3T3 genomic DNA was dissolved in 300 μl of buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.1, 4 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. To monitor OT reactivity, samples were treated for 15 min at 37 °C by adding 7.6 μl (plasmid samples) or 15.2 μl (genomic samples) of a solution made by mixing 14.2 μl of 0.5% 2,2′-bipyridyl and 3 μl of OT solution (final concentration of both OT and 2,2′-bipyridyl was 2 mm). OT reactions were terminated by adding 0.1 volume of sodium acetate, pH 5.2, followed by two ethanol precipitations. To monitor KMnO4 reactivity, samples were treated with 5 mm (final concentration) KMnO4 for 2 min at 24 °C. KMnO4 reactions were terminated by adding 0.1 volume of sodium acetate, pH 5.2, containing 1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, followed by two ethanol precipitations. To monitor DMS reactivity, samples were treated with a 5% aqueous DMS solution in 50 mm sodium cacodylate and 1 mm EDTA (0.5% final DMS concentration) for 2 min at 24 °C. DMS reactions were terminated by adding 0.1 volume of sodium acetate, pH 5.2, containing 1m β-mercaptoethanol, followed by two ethanol precipitations. To monitor CAA reactivity, samples were treated with 2% (final concentration) CAA for 30 min at 37 °C. CAA reactions were terminated by adding 50 mm (final concentration) NaCl followed by two ethanol precipitations. CAA-treated samples were resuspended in H2O and then incubated with either formic acid or hydrazine in high salt followed by two ethanol precipitations to superimpose the CAA data on Maxam and Gilbert reference ladders (32Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8987) Google Scholar). Dried DNA samples were then resuspended in 1 mpiperidine, and base modifications were cleaved by incubation at 90 °C for 30 min. The samples were lyophilized extensively to remove all traces of piperidine and resuspended in H2O. DNA samples were then analyzed by LMPCR. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were seeded into 10-cm culture plates and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For CdCl2 induction, NIH3T3 cells at 80–90% confluency were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 h with or without 2 μmCdCl2. For chemical treatment, cells at 80–90% confluency were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at ambient temperature just prior to treatment. For KMnO4 treatment, cells were exposed to 10 mm KMnO4 in PBS for 2 min at 24 °C. For DMS treatment, cells were exposed to 0.1% DMS in PBS for 2 min at 24 °C. For CAA treatment, cells were exposed to 3% CAA in PBS for 20 min at 37 °C. All reactions were terminated by washing cells twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell lysis and DNA purification were by standard protocols (33Spiro C. McMurray C.T. Latchman D.S. Transcription Factors, A Practical Approach. 2 Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 27-62Google Scholar). CAA-treated DNA was then processed as described above for in vitro-treated DNA to superimpose either G + A or C > T chemistry. Dried genomic DNA was cleaved with piperidine and prepared for LMPCR as described for in vitro genomic samples. The genomic DNA concentration was then determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Three gene-specific primer sets were designed with the assistance of Oligo 4.0 software for LMPCR analysis of the MT-I promoter (34Rychlik W. Rhoads R.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8543-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Primer set A was used to analyze the pyrimidine strand of the MT-I R/Y sequence and included gene-specific primers A1 (5′-C2A3TGA2G2T9G2ATC), A2 (5′-G2ATCT2C3ACGCAGAG3TAT2GC), and A3 (5′-G2TAT2GCTGTGT2GTCTC2TC2A2GAG). Primer set B was used to analyze the TATA-proximal promoter non-template strand and included gene-specific primers B1 (5′-C2AG3AGCTCTGCACTC), B2 (5′-TCTGCACTC2GC3GA4GTG), and B3 (5′-GTGCGCTCG2CTCTGC2A2G). Primer set C was used to analyze the TATA-proximal promoter template strand and included gene-specific primers C1 (5′-AGCAGT2G4T-C2AT2C), C2 (5′-TC2AT2C2GAGATCTG2TGA2GCTG), and C3 (5′-G2TGA2GCTG2A-GCTACG2AGA2G). The chemical reactivities of genomic and plasmid samples were analyzed using standard LMPCR methods (17Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Briefly, chemically treated and purified DNA samples (2 μg of genomic DNA or 10 pg of plasmid DNA) were used at the start of LMPCR. Primer extension was performed using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the first gene-specific primer. After ligation of a blunt unidirectional linker duplex (17Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 18Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), PCR was performed in the presence ofTaq DNA polymerase (Fisher Scientific), the second gene-specific primer, and the unidirectional linker primer (5′-GCG2TGAC3G3AGATCTGA2T2C) for 20 cycles. The PCR products were separated on either a 6 or 8% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel (19:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide). The sequencing gel was electroblotted to a nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), prehybridized, and hybridized with a radioactive probe created by single-sided PCR using the third gene-specific primer. Sequencing markers were created by standard Maxam and Gilbert (32Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8987) Google Scholar) chemical modifications of genomic DNAin vitro, together with standard LMPCR detection. Radioactive signals were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager. Chemical and enzymatic probes of non-B DNA structures have previously been employed in vitro to characterize the 128-bp MT-I R/Y sequence (Fig. 1) present in purified plasmids (19Bacolla A. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1639-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using both low and high resolution probing techniques, these studies indicated that theMT-I R/Y sequence forms a non-B DNA structure under conditions of negative superhelical strain and low pH (19Bacolla A. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1639-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The pattern of chemical reactivity suggested the possible formation of multiple, concurrent H-DNA-like structures. Transient transfection assays detected no effect of the R/Y sequence on promoter strength (20Becker N.A. Maher L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1951-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, although the MT-I R/Y sequence is able to adopt a non-B DNA structure under specific in vitro conditions, it plays no demonstrable role in transcriptional regulation. These previous data did not rule out the possibility that the R/Y sequence adopts a non-B DNA structure in vivo, perhaps stabilized by increased negative superhelical strain that might accompany metal-induced transcription of the MT-I gene (35Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). This possibility is emphasized by a recent report of transcription-induced cruciform extrusion within living Escherichia coli cells (36Krasilnikov A.S. Podtelezhnikov A. Vologodskii A. Mirkin S.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Assessment of chemical reactivity in the MT-I R/Y sequence before and after induction of MT-I transcription by exogenous metal thus provides an excellent eukaryotic opportunity to explore the possibility of similar phenomena. In the present study we sought to answer the following questions. Can chemical probing and LMPCR be used to corroborate the presence of a non-B DNA structure in plasmid DNA containing the MT-I R/Y sequence? Is there evidence of protein binding to this element in cultured cells either before or after metal induction? Is there evidence for a non-B DNA structure within the R/Y sequence in vivo either before or after metal induction? Before LMPCR analysis of genomic DNA in cultured NIH3T3 cells, we wished to confirm the metal responsiveness of the endogenousMT-I gene in these cells. Reverse transcription analysis was employed to quantitate MT-I mRNA levels before and after CdCl2 induction (Fig. 2). NIH3T3 cells induced with 2 μmCdCl2 for 4 h showed a ∼10-fold increase inMT-I mRNA levels compared with uninduced cells (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2 and 3). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was monitored as an internal control. This result confirmed that our experimental metal treatment significantly induced MT-I gene expression, and suggested that metals might increase negative superhelical strain in the vicinity of the MT-I R/Y sequence. Chemical probes of DNA structure were used in combination with LMPCR to analyze two regions of the MT-I promoter (Fig. 1). Chemical reagents that react preferentially with unusual DNA structures (CAA, OT, and KMnO4) or serve as footprinting agents (DMS) can be valuable for detecting unusual non-B DNA structures and indicating regions of protection resulting from the binding of proteins or nucleic acid strands (16Wells R.D. Collier D.A. Hanvey J.C. Shimizu M. Wohlrab F. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2939-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 31Pestov D. Dayn A. Siyanova E. George D. Mirkin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6527-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Kohwi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 155-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DMS modifies the N-7 position of guanine within a DNA duplex. In contrast, guanine is protected from DMS modification when a protein is bound to the DNA or when guanine is involved in Hoogsteen (or reverse-Hoogsteen) hydrogen bonding (e.g. within a C + G·C triplet) because the N-7 position of guanine is made inaccessible to DMS. KMnO4 is thought to react primarily with unstacked or unpaired thymine bases, and to a much lower degree with unstacked or unpaired cytosine and guanine residues (38Nejedly K. Sykorova E. Diekmann S. Palecek E. Biophys. Chem. 1998; 73: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). CAA reacts with the Watson-Crick base pairing face of unpaired adenine and cytosine residues to form their respective etheno derivatives. OT, in the presence of 2,2′-bipyridyl reacts primarily with unpaired or unstacked thymine bases (38Nejedly K. Sykorova E. Diekmann S. Palecek E. Biophys. Chem. 1998; 73: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To validate our chemical probing and LMPCR assay, we first analyzed the TATA-proximal region of the MT-I promoter in isolated genomic DNA and in cultured cells. Previous in vivostudies of the MT-I promoter used DMS and a genomic primer extension analysis to reveal subtle differences between the chemical reactivity of promoter DNA sequences of uninduced and metal-induced cells (24Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mueller et al. (24Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) noted differences between DMS reactivities of samples treated in vitro versus in vivo as well as differences between samples treated in vivo before or after CdCl2induction. We analyzed NIH3T3 cells before or after CdCl2induction using either DMS or KMnO4 followed by DNA extraction and LMPCR analysis. Reactivities were compared with those observed for isolated genomic DNA treated with the same reagents. KMnO4 has not previously been used to analyze theMT-I promoter. Differences in KMnO4 reactivity on both DNA strands of the promoter were noted when in vitroand in vivo samples were compared (Fig. 3, A and B, comparelanes 4 and 5). KMnO4 footprints were evident within the MREs on both non-template and template strands (Fig. 3, A and B, red bars andcircles). Curiously, only subtle increases in reactivity were detected near the transcriptional start point (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 1–3, red circle at +3), but these differences indicated base unpairing in vi"
