https://openalex.org/W1989423171,"Narcotic analgetics administered directly into the spinal subarachnoid space of the rat via a chronically inserted catheter produce a potent analgesia that can be antagonized by naloxone. The narcotics, acting only at the spinal level, changed cord function to block not only spinal reflexes but also the operant response to painful stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W1993023565,"Some individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) experience multiple episodes of acute hepatitis. It is unclear whether these episodes are due to reinfection with HCV or to reactivation of the original virus infection. Markers of viral replication and host immunity were studied in five chimpanzees sequentially inoculated over a period of 3 years with different HCV strains of proven infectivity. Each rechallenge of a convalescent chimpanzee with the same or a different HCV strain resulted in the reappearance of viremia, which was due to infection with the subsequent challenge virus. The evidence indicates that HCV infection does not elicit protective immunity against reinfection with homologous or heterologous strains, which raises concerns for the development of effective vaccines against HCV."
https://openalex.org/W2037854429,"Abstract Brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which utilizes NADPH and calcium/calmodulin as cofactors for metabolizing L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and L-citrulline, contains recognition sites for the flavins FAD and FMN. Using a spin-trapping technique combined with electron spin resonance spectroscopy, we report that brain NOS generates superoxide O2-. in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent manner. The specific inhibitors of NOS, NG-monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA), and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), have different effects on O2-. generation. For L-NMMA, O2-. production is unaffected, while for L-NAME, inhibition of this free radical is concentration-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2085069351,"Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are polyamide oligomers that can strand invade duplex DNA, causing displacement of one DNA strand and formation of a D-loop. Binding of either a T10 PNA or a mixed sequence 15-mer PNA to the transcribed strand of a G-free transcription cassette caused 90 to 100 percent site-specific termination of pol II transcription elongation. When a T10 PNA was bound on the nontranscribed strand, site-specific inhibition never exceeded 50 percent. Binding of PNAs to RNA resulted in site-specific termination of both reverse transcription and in vitro translation, precisely at the position of the PNA.RNA heteroduplex. Nuclear microinjection of cells constitutively expressing SV40 large T antigen (T Ag) with either a 15-mer or 20-mer PNA targeted to the T Ag messenger RNA suppressed T Ag expression. This effect was specific in that there was no reduction in beta-galactosidase expression from a coinjected expression vector and no inhibition of T Ag expression after microinjection of a 10-mer PNA."
https://openalex.org/W2077873945,"The overall sequence similarity between the voltage-activated K+ channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels from retinal and olfactory neurons suggests that they arose from a common ancestor. On the basis of sequence comparisons, mutations were introduced into the pore of a voltage-activated K+ channel. These mutations confer the essential features of ion conduction in the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels; the mutant K+ channels display little selectivity among monovalent cations and are blocked by divalent cations. The property of K+ selectivity is related to the presence of two amino acids that are absent from the pore-forming region of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. These data demonstrate that very small differences in the primary structure of an ion channel can account for extreme functional diversity, and they suggest a possible connection between the pore-forming regions of K+, Ca2+, and cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels."

https://openalex.org/W2070157281,"Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide immunoreactivity is present in high concentrations in clonal lines of neuronal and glial origin. The central nervous system and sympathetic ganglia are also rich in the peptide. The findings suggest that this peptide, hitherto thought limited to the gastrointestinal tract, is widely distributed in neural tissue and may have broad physiological significance."
https://openalex.org/W1968421165,"Studies of a series of short oligonucleotide double and triple helices containing either all RNA, all DNA, or a mixture of the two show strand-dependent variation in their stability and structure. The variation in stability for both groups falls over a range of greater than 10 kilocalories per mole. In forming the triple helix, RNA is favored on both pyrimidine strands, whereas DNA is favored on the purine strand. In general, relatively unstable duplexes form particularly stable triplexes and vice versa. Structural data indicate that the strands in hybrid helices adopt a conformation that is intermediate between molecules containing all DNA and all RNA. Thus, RNA-DNA hybrids were not forced into the conformation of the RNA (A-form). The provocative stability of the triplex with an RNA third strand+DNA duplex points to novel antisense strategies and opens the possibility of an in vivo role of these structures. Overall, the data emphasize the fundamental role of sugars in determining the properties of nucleic acid complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2072819545,"Two DNA strand transfer reactions occur during retroviral reverse transcription. The mechanism of the first, minus strand strong-stop DNA, transfer has been studied in vitro with human immunodeficiency virus 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) and a model template-primer system derived from the HIV-1 genome. The results reveal that HIV-1 RT alone can catalyze DNA strand transfer reactions. Two kinetically distinct ribonuclease (RNase) H activities associated with HIV-1 RT are required for removal of RNA fragments annealed to the nascent DNA strand. Examination of the binding of DNA.RNA duplex and single-stranded RNA to HIV-1 RT during strand transfer supports a model where the enzyme accommodates both the acceptor RNA template and the nascent DNA strand before the transfer event is completed. The polymerase activity incorporated additional bases beyond the 5' end of the RNA template, resulting in a base misincorporation upon DNA strand transfer. Such a process occurring in vivo during retroviral homologous recombination could contribute to the hypermutability of the HIV-1 genome."

https://openalex.org/W2041404362,"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that can be induced in susceptible strains of mice by immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) or its immunodominant T cell determinants, serves as a model of human multiple sclerosis. Tolerance to MBP in adult mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of synthetic peptides of immunodominant determinants of MBP and prevented MBP-induced EAE. Furthermore, tolerance-inducing regimens of peptides administered to mice after the disease had begun (10 days after induction with MBP) blocked the progression and decreased the severity of EAE. Peptide-induced tolerance resulted from the induction of anergy in proliferative, antigen-specific T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038031211,The cell wall of mycobacteria is an efficient permeability barrier that makes mycobacteria naturally resistant to most antibiotics. Liposome swelling assays and planar bilayer experiments were used to investigate the diffusion process of hydrophilic molecules through the cell wall of Mycobacterium chelonae and identify the main hydrophilic pathway. A 59-kilodalton cell wall protein formed a water-filled channel with a diameter of 2.2 nanometers and an average single-channel conductance equal to 2.7 nanosiemens in 1 M potassium chloride. These results suggest that porins can be found in the cell wall of a Gram-positive bacterium. A better knowledge of the hydrophilic pathways should help in the design of more effective antimycobacterial agents.

These antibodies were associated with the immunoglobulin A class. When infected with Streptococcus mutans, orally immunized animals developed significantly fewer carious lesions than nonimmunized infected controls."
https://openalex.org/W2082307070,"Hydrophobic signal-sequences direct the transfer of secretory proteins across the inner membrane of prokaryotes and the endoplasmic reticulum membranes of eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, signal-sequences are recognized by the 54K protein (M(r) 54,000) of the signal recognition particle (SRP) which is believed to hold the nascent chain in a translocation-competent conformation until it contacts the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The SRP consists of a 7S RNA and six different polypeptides. The 7S RNA and the 54K signal-sequence-binding protein (SRP54) of mammalian SRP exhibit strong sequence similarity to the 4.5S RNA and P48 protein (Ffh) of Escherichia coli which form a ribonucleoprotein particle. Depletion of 4.5S RNA or overproduction of P48 causes the accumulation of the beta-lactamase precursor, although not of other secretory proteins. Whether 4.5S RNA and P48 are part of an SRP-like complex with a role in protein export is controversial. Here we show that the P48/4.5S RNA ribonucleoprotein complex interacts specifically with the signal sequence of a nascent secretory protein and therefore is a signal recognition particle."
https://openalex.org/W2068435366,"Synaptic events at the neuromuscular junction are integer multiples of a quantum, the postsynaptic response to transmitter released from one presynaptic vesicle. At central synapses where quanta are small, it has been suggested they are invariant due to occupation of all postsynaptic receptors, a concept neglecting inherent fluctuations in channel behavior. If this did occur, the quantal release model would not apply there and could not be used to localize sites of synaptic modification. Monte Carlo simulations of quanta include transmitter diffusion and interactions with postsynaptic receptors that are treated probabilistically. These models suggest that when there are few postsynaptic channels available at a synapse, their stochastic behavior produces significant intrinsic variance in response amplitude and kinetics, and saturation does not occur. These results were confirmed by analysis of inhibitory quanta in embryonic and adult Mauthner cells involving a small and large number of channels, respectively. The findings apply to excitatory synapses as well."
https://openalex.org/W2093733268,"The flight response of both sexes of Dendroctonus brevicomis to the mixture of myrcene, racemic frontalin, and (1R,5S,7R)-(+)-exo-brevicomin and to the mixture of myrcene, (1S,5R)-(-)-frontalin and racemic exo-brevicomin was significantly greater than the response to the same mixtures in which the antipodes were substituted. The flight response to these two mixtures was also greater than the response to the ternary mixture of myrcene, racemic frontalin, and racemic exo-brevicomin (MFE). The walking response of both sexes to the mixture of myrcene, racemic frontalin, and (+)-exo-brevicomin was not different from the response to MFE. Substitution of the antipode lowered the response when compared to that of MFE. When evaporated with ponderosa pine turpentine, (-)-frontalin was active in the field while its antipode was not."
https://openalex.org/W1531104076,"Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an atherosclerosis-causing lipoprotein that circulates in human plasma as a complex of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)). It is not known whether apo(a) attaches to LDL within hepatocytes prior to secretion or in plasma subsequent to secretion. Here we describe the development of a line of mice expressing the human apo(a) transgene under the control of the murine transferrin promoter. The apo(a) was secreted into the plasma, but circulated free of lipoproteins. When human (h)-LDL was injected intravenously, the circulating apo(a) rapidly associated with the lipoproteins, as determined by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Human HDL and mouse LDL had no such effect. When h-VLDL was injected, there was a delayed association of apo(a) with the lipoprotein fraction which suggests that apo(a) preferentially associated with a metabolic product of VLDL. The complex of apo(a) with LDL formed both in vivo and in vitro was resistant to boiling in the presence of detergents and denaturants, but was resolved upon disulfide reduction. These studies suggest that apo(a) fails to associate with mouse lipoproteins due to structural differences between human and mouse LDL, and that Lp(a) formation can occur in plasma through the association of apo(a) with circulating LDL."
https://openalex.org/W2018478739,"Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation time (T1) of the intracellular water protons and water content were measured in synchronized HeLa cells. The T1 was maximum (1020 milliseconds) in mitotic and minimum (534 milliseconds) in S phase cells. The cyclic pattern of T1 values correlated well with the chromosome condensation cycle. By treating cells with spermine, it was possible to alter T1 without a significant change in the water content. The results of this study suggest that an additional variable, namely, the conformational state of macromolecules, should be incluced in any expression explaining the shortened relaxation times of water protons in biological systems."

https://openalex.org/W1973589466,"Juvenile coho salmon were exposed to morpholine or phenethyl alcohol (p-alcohol) for 1 1/2 months and then released in Lake Michigan. During the spawning migration 18 months later, morpholine and p-alcohol were metered into separate streams, and the number of morpholine- and p-alcohol-exposed fish returning to each stream was determined. Seventeen other locations were also monitored. The majority of the fish exposed to morpholine were captured in the stream scented with morpholine and most fish exposed to p-alcohol were captured at the p-alcohol-treated stream. This field study demonstrates that coho salmon imprint to and utilize chemical cues for homing."
https://openalex.org/W2062916647,"The cystic fibrosis gene product (CFTR) is a complex protein that functions as an adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated ion channel and possibly as a regulator of intracellular processes. In order to determine whether the CFTR molecule contains a functional aqueous pathway, anion, water, and urea transport were measured in Xenopus oocytes expressing CFTR. Cyclic AMP agonists induced a Cl- conductance of 94 microsiemens and an increase in water permeability of 4 x 10(-4) centimeter per second that was inhibited by a Cl- channel blocker and was dependent on anion composition. CFTR has a calculated single channel water conductance of 9 x 10(-13) cubic centimeter per second, suggesting a pore-like aqueous pathway. Oocytes expressing CFTR also showed cAMP-stimulated transport of urea but not the larger solute sucrose. Thus CFTR contains a cAMP-stimulated aqueous pore that can transport anions, water, and small solutes. The results also provide functional evidence for water movement through an ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1972861232,"Ligation of the antigen receptor on B cells induces the rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine on a number of cellular proteins. A monoclonal antibody that recognized a tyrosine-phosphorylated cell surface protein that was present in activated B cells was generated. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that this 140-kilodalton protein was CD22, a B cell-specific cell surface glycoprotein and putative extracellular ligand of the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 may be important in B cell signal transduction, possibly through regulation of the adhesiveness of activated B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2009434490,"Hyperactive and nonhyperactive children performed a learning task in two states, while being treated with stimulant medication (methylphenidate) and while taking a placebo, and were tested for retention of each class of learned material in both states. Symmetrical state-dependent learning was demonstrated in the hyperactive group but not in the nonhyperactive group. The state-dependent effect was contingent on the presence of drug-induced facilitation during initial learning. This is apparently the first report on record of state-dependent learning with a drug agent that facilitates rather than impairs performance of human subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2092201084,"Rebinding of carbon monoxide to the beta chain of hemoglobin after photodissociation by a laser flash is intramolecular below about 200 K. Above 25 K, rebinding occurs via classical over-the-barrier motion; below, quantum-mechanical tunneling dominates. Both are described by an energy spectrum peaked at Epeak=4.0 kilojoules per mole. The barrier width d(E), determined from the energy dependence of the tunneling rate, depends on barrier height, d(E) approximately 0.05 nanometer X (E/Epeak) 1.5."
https://openalex.org/W1971065866,"Sodium arachidonate causes shape change and aggregation of rabbit or human platelets that have been washed and then degranulated by treatment with thrombin. Since these platelets do not contain releasable adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the aggregation is not inhibited by the creatine phosphate-creatine phosphokinase system, sodium arachidonate must be able to cause aggregation that is independent of the release of ADP. Since aggregation of these platelets induced by sodium arachidonate is inhibited by acetylsalicylic acid or indomethacin, it seems likely that products (such as prostaglandin G2) formed from sodium arachidonate are responsible for aggregation. Thus, sodium arachidonate-induced shape change and aggregation of platelets may be caused (i) by the release of ADP by products of sodium arachidonate metabolism and (ii) directly by the products of sodium arachidonate metabolism, independently of released ADP."

https://openalex.org/W2048169623,"Hormones and purine nucleosides and nucleotides induced cultured bone cells to transform transiently from a spherical to a stellate shape. Cytochalasin B also induced the transformation. The change was blocked by colchicine and vinblastine, but not by lumicolchicine or cycloheximide. This morphologic transformation may provide a dynamic model of hormone action and bone cell modulation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1999115702,"According to traditional models, natural selection is largely insensitive to an organism's effect on its community. Effects on the community at large cannot feed back differentially to the organisms that cause them, and, hence, cannot lead to the differential fitness of the organisms. However, if a spatial variation exists in community composition, organisms do differentially feel their own effects on the community, and this leads to a form of evolution on the community level. Without violating the principle of individual selection, the concept of an organism that exists for the ""function"" its performs in its community may be valid in some cases."
https://openalex.org/W1997374895,"Acute oral administration of cannabis extract to rats (tetrahydrocannabinol dose, 10 milligrams per kilogram) impaired maze learning. The impairment was more marked after ten daily doses of the same size. After 1, 2, or 3 months' pretreatment with the same daily dose, followed by a 25-day drug-free period, no residual learning impairment was found. However, 6 months of daily administration of cannabis (tetrahydrocannabinol, 20 milligrams per kilogram) or alcohol (6 grams per kilogram) produced significant residual impairment of learning of maze and motor coordination tasks, 2 months or more after the last drug administration."

Viruses, regularly found in the secondary effluent, were not detected in any renovated water samples. Our results indicated that human viral pathogens do not move through soil into the groundwater, but are apparently absorbed and degraded by the soil and reduced in numbers by a factor of at least 10(4) (99.99 percent removal)."
https://openalex.org/W2022782932,Bag cell activity in Aplysia can be recorded intracellularly and extracellularly. Electrical stimulation anywhere along the connective nerves can produce prepotentials which are not synaptic potentials but represent the passive invasion of action potentials blocked in the neurites. Potentiation of these prepotentials results from progressive movement of the site of spike blockade toward the somata. This type of propagation plasticity may occur in many networks of low conduction safety.
