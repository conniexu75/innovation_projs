https://openalex.org/W2104373322,"The bis-indole indirubin is an active ingredient of Danggui Longhui Wan, a traditional Chinese medicine recipe used in the treatment of chronic diseases such as leukemias. The antitumoral properties of indirubin appear to correlate with their antimitotic effects. Indirubins were recently described as potent (IC50: 50–100 nm) inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). We report here that indirubins are also powerful inhibitors (IC50: 5–50 nm) of an evolutionarily related kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Testing of a series of indoles and bis-indoles against GSK-3β, CDK1/cyclin B, and CDK5/p25 shows that only indirubins inhibit these kinases. The structure-activity relationship study also suggests that indirubins bind to GSK-3β's ATP binding pocket in a way similar to their binding to CDKs, the details of which were recently revealed by crystallographic analysis. GSK-3β, along with CDK5, is responsible for most of the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein tau observed in Alzheimer's disease. Indirubin-3′-monoxime inhibits tau phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo at Alzheimer's disease-specific sites. Indirubins may thus have important implications in the study and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Indirubin-3′-monoxime also inhibits the in vivophosphorylation of DARPP-32 by CDK5 on Thr-75, thereby mimicking one of the effects of dopamine in the striatum. Finally, we show that many, but not all, reported CDK inhibitors are powerful inhibitors of GSK-3β. To which extent these GSK-3β effects of CDK inhibitors actually contribute to their antimitotic and antitumoral properties remains to be determined. Indirubins constitute the first family of low nanomolar inhibitors of GSK-3β to be described.

The colorful indirubin (1) and indigo (5) originate from the dimerization of colorless precursors, indoxyl and isatin (4) (see Fig. 1). These indoles are released during the fermentation process from conjugates, the nature of which depends on the plant (indican, isatan B) or mollusc (indoxylsulfate) species from which the dyes are prepared (see Fig.1). The use of indigoı̈ds as textile dyes dates back to the Bronze age (−7000), but indigo (now synthetic) remains the most abundantly produced dye in the world (blue jeans, denims, etc.) (1Hurry J.B. The Woad Plant and Its Dye. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1930Google Scholar, 2Balfour-Paul J. Indigo. British Museum Press, London1998Google Scholar). Indigo-producing plants have also been used in traditional Chinese medicine (3Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Chinese Drugs of Plant Origin: Chemistry, Pharmacology, and Use in Traditional and Modern Medicine.

A well-studied example is Danggui Longhui Wan, a mixture of 11 herbal medicines traditionally utilized against certain types of leukemias. Only one of these ingredients, Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis), a dark blue powder originating from various indigo-producing plants, was found to carry the antileukemic activity (6Chen D.H. Xie J.X. Chinese Trad. Herbal Drugs. 1984; 15: 6-8Google Scholar). Although it is mostly constituted of indigo, a minor constituent, indirubin, was identified as the active component by the Chinese Academy of Medicine (7Institute of Haematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Chinese J.

Preclinical studies performed with indirubin, and more soluble analogues, confirmed that these compounds exhibit good antitumor activity and only minor toxicity (10Ji X.J. Zhang F.R. Lei J.L. Xu Y.T.

Several mechanisms of action have been brought forward to explain the antimitotic and antitumoral properties of indirubins (22Wu G.Y. Fang F.D. Liu J.Z. Chang A. Ho Y.H. Chinese Med. J. 1980; 60: 451-454Google Scholar, 23Wu G.Y. Liu J.Z. Fang F.D. Zuo J. Sci. Sin. 1982; 25: 1071-1079Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Wu G.Y. Qiu C.C. Acta Acad. Med. Sin. 1985; 7: 112-116Google Scholar). We recently reported that indirubins are potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1(25Hoessel R. Leclerc S. Endicott J. Noble M. Lawrie A. Tunnah P. Leost M. Damiens E. Marie D. Marko D. Niederberger E. Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), a family of key cell cycle regulators (26Dunphy, W. G. (ed) (1997) Methods Enzymol. 283, 1-67Google Scholar, 27Morgan D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar, 28Vogt P.K. Reed S.I. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 1-169PubMed Google Scholar). Indirubins act by competing with ATP for binding to the catalytic site of the kinase. The kinase selectivity study showed that indirubins have a strong affinity for CDKs (IC50 values in the range of 50–100 nm) (25Hoessel R. Leclerc S. Endicott J. Noble M. Lawrie A. Tunnah P. Leost M. Damiens E. Marie D. Marko D. Niederberger E. Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, they are not totally devoid of activity toward a few kinases (IC50 values in the 1–10 μm range) (25Hoessel R. Leclerc S. Endicott J. Noble M. Lawrie A. Tunnah P. Leost M. Damiens E. Marie D. Marko D. Niederberger E. Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). This rather loose selectivity, when compared with the high specificity of purine inhibitors of CDKs, led us to continue to investigate the selectivity of indirubins as kinase inhibitors. We report here that indirubins are very potent inhibitors (IC50 values in the 5–50 nm range) of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). This kinase is an essential element of the WNT signaling pathway (29Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). It is involved in multiple physiological processes, including cell cycle regulation by controlling the levels of cyclin D1 (30Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar) and β-catenin (31Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), among others. Furthermore, GSK-3β and CDK5 are responsible for most of the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-binding protein tau observed in the paired helical filaments, which are diagnostic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (38Imahori K. Uchida T. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that conversion of p35, the regulatory subunit of CDK5, to a truncated form, p25, deregulates CDK5 activity and promotes neurodegeneration (40Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. De la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). We here show that indirubins are very potent inhibitors of CDK5/p25. Furthermore, indirubin-3′-monoxime inhibits tau phosphorylation in vitro and in vivoat Alzheimer's disease-specific sites. Indirubins may thus constitute a lead compound in the study and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders involving abnormal phosphorylation of tau (“taupathies”). We here also show that indirubin-3′-monoxime inhibits phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by CDK5. DARPP-32 is a striatum protein acting downstream of dopamine action, which is either phosphorylated on Thr-34 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (it then acts as a phosphatase 1 inhibitor) or on Thr-75 by CDK5 (it then becomes a PKA inhibitor) (41Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Nishi A. Yan Z. Meijer L. Fienberg A.A. Tsai L.-H. Kwon Y.T. Girault J.-A. Czernik A.J. Huganir R.L. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nature. 1999; 402: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Finally, we also show that many, but not all, CDK inhibitors are potent GSK-3β inhibitors. Whether the antimitotic/antitumoral properties of indirubins (and other CDK inhibitors) derive from their dual inhibitory effects on GSK-3β and CDKs remains to be determined.

Synthesis reactions involving oxygen or moisture-sensitive compounds were performed under a dry argon atmosphere. All reaction mixtures and column chromatographic fractions were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on plates (Alugram Sil G/UV254, purchased from Macherey & Nagel). Column chromatography was carried out using Silica Gel 60 (0.063–0.2 mm, Macherey & Nagel). Melting points of the non-indigoı̈d compounds were determined on a Büchi 510 melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. Melting points over 260 °C were determined on a Wagner and Munz Kupferblock. Elemental analyses were performed using a 2400 CHN elemental analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Unless otherwise indicated, NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature.1H NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz, 13C NMR spectra at 100 MHz on a Bruker AMX 400, using tetramethylsilane, or Me2SO (δ = 39.4 ppm) as internal standard.J values are reported in hertz. Apparent multiplicities were designated as s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, double doublet; t, triplet; pt, pseudo-triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; b, broad. Mass spectra were taken in the positive ion mode under electron impact (EI 70 eV) using a Finnigan MAT 90 mass spectrometer. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed using a Hewlett-Packard, 5890 Series II gas chromatograph on a 25-m fused silica column (Hewlett-Packard HP-5, I.D. = 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm) and a Hewlett-Packard, HP 5971A mass-selective detector with the following temperature program: 80 °C (4 min), 25 °/min, 320 °C (16.4 min). All compounds were dissolved and stored as 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO. They were diluted in aqueous buffers just prior use.

[γ-32P]ATP (PB 168) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The GS-1 peptide (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQSpEDEEE) was synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Unit, Institute of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Southampton, UK. AT-8, AT-180, and AT-100 antibodies were obtained from Innogenetics, SA, Ghent, Belgium, PHF-1 was a gift from Dr. P.

Buffer A consisted of 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml heparin. Buffer C consisted of homogenization buffer but 5 mm EGTA, no NaF, and no protease inhibitors. This buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. HLB buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet-P40, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 5 μm microcystin, and 100 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. Kinase activities were assayed in Buffer A or C (unless otherwise stated), at 30 °C, at a final ATP concentration of 15 μm. Blank values were subtracted, and activities were calculated as picomoles of phosphate incorporated for a 10-min incubation. The activities are usually expressed in percentage of the maximal activity, i.e. in the absence of inhibitors. Controls were performed with appropriate dilutions of dimethyl sulfoxide. In a few cases phosphorylation of the substrate was assessed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE (see below). GSK-3β was expressed in and purified from insect Sf9 cells (42Hughes K. Pulverer B.J. Theocharous P. Woodgett J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It was assayed, following a 1/100 dilution in 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm DTT, with 5 μl of 40 μm GS-1 peptide as a substrate, in buffer A, in the presence of 15 μm[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml) in a final volume of 30 μl. After 30-min incubation at 30 °C, 25-μl aliquots of supernatant were spotted onto 2.5- × 3-cm pieces of Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper, and, 20 s later, the filters were washed five times (for at least 5 min each time) in a solution of 10 ml of phosphoric acid/liter of water. The wet filters were counted in the presence of 1 ml of ACS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) scintillation fluid. CDK1/cyclin B was extracted in homogenization buffer from M phase starfish (Marthasterias glacialis) oocytes and purified by affinity chromatography on p9CKShs1-Sepharose beads, from which it was eluted by free p9CKShs1 as described previously (43Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P.J. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 44Borgne A. Ostvold A.C. Flament S. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11977-11986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The kinase activity was assayed in buffer C, with 1 mg/ml histone H1, in the presence of 15 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml) in a final volume of 30 μl. After 10-min incubation at 30 °C, 25-μl aliquots of supernatant were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose papers and treated as described above. CDK5/p25 was reconstituted by mixing equal amounts of recombinant mammalian CDK5 and p25 expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (vectors kindly provided by Dr. J. H. Wang). (p25 is a truncated version of p35, the 35-kDa CDK5 activator.) Its activity was assayed in buffer C as described for CDK1/cyclin B. Sf9 cells (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) were grown at 27 °C in monolayer culture Grace's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin. BaculoGold was obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), pVL1392 was obtained from Invitrogen. The gene for htau23, the shortest human tau isoform, was excised from the bacterial expression vector pNG2 (45Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) with XbaI and BamHI and inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 cut with the same restriction endonucleases. The BaculoGold system was used to construct the tau baculovirus-containing vector. The BaculoGold DNA is a modified type of baculovirus containing a lethal deletion. Cotransfection of the BaculoGold DNA with a complementing baculovirus transfer vector rescued the lethal deletion of this virus DNA and reconstituted viable virus particles carrying the htau23 coding sequence. Plasmid DNA used for transfections was purified using Qiagen cartridges (Hilden, Germany). Sf9 cells grown in monolayers (2 × 106 cells in a 60-mm cell culture dish) were cotransfected with baculovirus DNA (0.5 μg of BaculoGold DNA) and with vector derivatives of pVL1392 (2 μg) using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. The presence of recombinant protein was examined in the infected cells 5 days post-infection by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To determine the effects of aminopurvalanol and indirubin-3′-monoxime on tau phosphorylation, Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expressing htau23 protein were treated 36 h post-infection (when cells have already expressed levels of tau sufficient for the outgrowth of cell processes (46Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) with 20 μm inhibitors for 3 h before being harvested. Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1–5. Cell lysates were prepared in hypotonic lysis buffer (HLB). After 15-min centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was recovered and its NaCl concentration raised to 500 mm. It was then boiled for 10 min and recentrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 15 min. Proteins (3 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and Western-blotted with the following antibodies: AT-8 (1:2000), AT-180 (1:1000), AT-100 (1:1000), PHF-1 (1:600), and polyclonal anti-tau antibody K9JA. The immunostaining was visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). Tau phosphorylation in vitrowas performed using purified GSK-3β and recombinant human tau-32 (provided by Dr. M. Goedert) as a substrate. After 30-min incubation in the presence of various indirubin-3′-monoxime concentrations, under the GSK-3β assay conditions described above, the kinase reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Tau was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and its phosphorylation level was visualized by autoradiography. Adult mouse brain striatal slices were prepared using standard methodology (47Nishi A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8147-8155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following equilibration in Krebs' bicarbonate buffer oxygenated with continuous aeration (95% O2/5% CO2), slices were treated with various concentrations of indirubin-3′-monoxime or 10 μm roscovitine for 60 min or were left in Krebs' bicarbonate buffer for the same period of time. Slices were homogenized by sonication in boiling 1% SDS and 50 mm NaF. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method using a BSA standard curve. Equal amounts of protein (80 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 15% acrylamide gel, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with a phosphorylation state-specific antibody that selectively detects DARPP-32 phosphorylated at Thr-75 (41Bibb J.A.

In the course of studying the CDK inhibitory properties of indirubin, we synthesized a series of indole derivatives and dimers (TableI). While further investigating the kinase inhibition selectivity of indirubin-3′-monoxime, the indirubin used in our cellular studies, we noticed that this compound was a powerful inhibitor of GSK-3β (see below). Our collection of indoles/bis-indoles was further evaluated for inhibition against purified GSK-3β, CDK5/p25, and CDK1/cyclin B. Kinase activities were assayed with an appropriate substrate (GSK-3β, GS1 peptide; CDKs, histone H1) in the presence of 15 μm ATP and increasing concentrations of compounds. IC50 values were calculated from the dose-response curves and are presented in TableII. The GSK-3β and CDK inhibition activity was limited to the indirubins family. Neither indigo nor isatin, and their derivatives, displayed a significant effect on any of the three kinases. To compare the effects of active compounds on GSK-3β and CDKs, the IC50 values toward each enzyme were plotted against the IC50 values for the other two kinases (Fig. 2). This analysis shows that the efficacies of indirubins toward CDK1 and CDK5 are closely related, whereas the efficacies toward GSK-3β and CDKs are less so. This probably reflects the closer evolutionary proximity between CDK1 and CDK5 compared with that between GSK-3β and CDKs (48Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2296) Google Scholar). The dose-response curves for (a) the most active compound on the three kinases (5-iodo-indirubin-3′-monoxime), (b) the most GSK-3β-selective compound (5,5′-dibromoindirubin), (c) the most CDK-selective compound (5-sulfonic acid-indirubin-3′-monoxime), and (d) the most frequently used compound in the studies of indirubins' cellular effects (indirubin-3′-monoxime) are presented in Fig. 3.Table IStructure of the indoles and bis-indoles used in this study Open table in a new tab Table IIInhibition of GSK-3β, CDK1, and CDK5 by indoles and bis-indolesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Numbers refer to structures shown in Table I.

Sci. U. S. A. 95, 14687–14692). Here we describe a vector (pZJM) for in vivo tetracycline-inducible synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in stably transformed cells. The dsRNA is synthesized from opposing T7 promoters. We tested the vector with genes involved in processes such as kinetoplast DNA replication, mitochondrial mRNA synthesis, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, glycosome biogenesis, and polyamine biosynthesis. In most cases the induction of dsRNA caused specific and dramatic loss of the appropriate mRNA, and in many cases there was growth inhibition or cell death. One striking phenotype was the loss of kinetoplast DNA after interference with expression of a topoisomerase II. The gene being analyzed by this procedure need not even be fully sequenced. In fact, many of the genes we tested were derived from partial sequences in the T. brucei genome data base that were identified by homology with known proteins. It takes as little as 3 weeks from identification of a gene sequence in the data base to the appearance of a phenotype.

Closely related parasites, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania, are also significant pathogens in tropical countries. In addition to their major impact on human health, these parasites have been important subjects for the study of a number of significant basic biological processes, including RNA editing, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring, and antigenic variation. However, many questions concerning the virulence and general biology of these fascinating parasites remain to be answered. These problems are sometimes difficult to address because trypanosomes are diploid and the available genetic tools are labor intensive. RNA interference (RNAi)1 is a recently discovered process in which the introduction of a double-stranded RNA into a cell causes specific degradation of an mRNA containing the same sequence (reviewed in Ref. 1Bass B.L. Cell. 2000; 101: 235-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Specific loss of gene expression by RNAi has been shown to occur in a variety of organisms including Caenorhabditis elegans (2Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C.

Timmons L. Fire A. Mello C.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 11Ketting R.F. Haverkamp T.H. van Luenen H.G. Plasterk R.H.

Cell. 2000; 101: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As suggested by Ullu and co-workers (3Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), RNAi could be a powerful tool to genetically manipulate trypanosomes. One advantage of RNAi over conventional gene knockout approaches is that only a few hundred base pairs of a gene sequence is required. This feature is noteworthy because the T. brucei genome project is rapidly moving forward and currently there are at least partial sequences available for most of the genes of the parasite. RNAi in T. brucei was first achieved in transient fashion by electroporation of in vitro synthesized dsRNA (3Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). A more valuable approach utilizing inducible, stably maintained constructs that express stem-loop transcripts has recently been described (16Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Bastin P. Ellis K. Kohl L. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These integrated constructs are heritable and provide for prolonged expression of dsRNA, allowing interference of expression of genes of highly stable proteins. We have now designed a vector (pZJM) in which a PCR-amplified gene fragment is ligated in a single step between opposing T7 promoters (18Timmons L. Fire A. Nature. 1998; 395: 854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). pZJM also incorporates features of the powerful tetracycline-inducible promoters in vectors developed by Wirtz et al. (19Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Integration of pZJM into a nontranscribed region of theT. brucei genome results in establishment of a stable cell line (20Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Tetracycline induction then leads to the production of dsRNA with concomitant degradation of the target mRNA. We have assessed the effectiveness of this vector in targeting a wide variety ofT. brucei genes. Given its relative ease of use and effectiveness, pZJM should prove to be a valuable tool in evaluating gene function in trypanosomes. Two vectors for RNAi were constructed by modifying pLew100 (a generous gift from Drs. Elizabeth Wirtz and George Cross, Rockefeller University (21Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar)). The first vector is similar to that recently published by Shi et al. (16Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A) and produces dsRNA as a stem-loop structure. The vector was constructed as follows. First, a ∼ 500-bp fragment of the gene of interest (target gene) was amplified by PCR from T. brucei 427 DNA using primers containing XbaI andHindIII linkers. This product was ligated into theNheI/HindIII sites of pJM326 (a gift from Dr. Stephen Gould, Johns Hopkins University (22Schrader M. Reuber B.E. Morrell J.C. Jimenez-Sanchez G. Obie C. Stroh T.A. Valle D. Schroer T.A. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29607-29614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)). This plasmid carried the gene for an irrelevant Myc-tagged human protein (Pex 11 β), part of which will form the loop of the stem-loop transcript. This construct was then digested with HindIII and XbaI, liberating a ∼1050-bp fragment containing the target gene fused to the 3′ terminus of the Pex 11 β/Myc tag construct. The vector pLew100 was then digested with MluI andXbaI, releasing the luciferase reporter. The same region of the target gene as used above was amplified by PCR with MluI and XbaI linkers, followed by ligation into pLew100. Finally, the modified pLew100 was cut with XbaI andHindIII, and the ∼1050-bp target gene/Pex 11 β/myc tag fragment was ligated into the vector. The resultant plasmid contains two copies of the target gene fragment in opposite orientation separated by a ∼550-bp irrelevant stuffer region. Transcription from the tetracycline-inducible procyclin promoter yields an RNA that can fold into a stem-loop structure. The pZJM vector (see Fig. 1 B) was constructed as follows. Dual T7 terminators were amplified by PCR from pLew82 (19Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using primers containing KpnI and NheI linkers (the primers were GGTACCCCGGATATAGTTCCTCCTTTCA and GCTAGCCCGCTGAGCAATAACTAGCATAACC), and the 230-bp product was cloned into pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA). A 71-bp fragment containing the T7 promoter/Tet operator was amplified from pLew82 using primers with NheI and XhoI linkers (the primers were GCTAGCACCTGATTAATACGACTCACT and CTCGAGGGGCTAGATCTCTATCACTG). This fragment was then ligated into the NheI and XhoI sites of the T7 terminator construct generated above. The T7 terminator/promoter cassette was then ligated into the KpnI and XhoI sites of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla CA). A 650-bp fragment of the T. brucei α-tubulin gene was amplified by PCR with primers containing XhoI andHindIII linkers (the primers were CACCTCGAGATGCGTGAGGCTATCTGCATC and CACAAGCTTAGGTTGCGGCGAGTCAAATC). The product was then ligated into the XhoI andHindIII sites of the modified pBluescript SK+ described above. A second T7 terminator/promoter cassette was generated by PCR of the original cassette using primers with BamHI andPstI linkers (the primers were GGATCCCCGGATATAGTTCCTCCTTTCA and CTGCAGGGGCTAGATCTCTATCACTG). The product was then ligated into the modified pBluescript SK+ that contains the tubulin/T7 terminator/promoter cassette. This pBluescript SK+ construct contains two opposing T7 terminator/promoter cassettes separated by a 650-bp tubulin gene fragment. To generate pZJM, theKpnI-BamHI fragment was ligated into pLew100, replacing the luciferase gene. The tubulin fragment was included to prevent the formation of cruciform structures. To insert a gene fragment into pZJM for transfection into the parasite, a 250–600-bp fragment of the coding region of the target was amplified by 30 cycles of PCR, with an annealing temperature of 55 °C using 50 ng of T. brucei 427 genomic DNA as template. The PCR primers contained XhoI and HindIII linkers. The PCR products were then ligated into pZJM, replacing the tubulin stuffer. Procyclic T. brucei strain 29–13 (also a gift from Drs. Elizabeth Wirtz and George Cross), which harbors integrated genes for T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor, were grown in SDM-79 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (21Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Parasites were cultured in the presence of G418 (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml) to maintain the T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor constructs, respectively. For transfection, cells (1 × 108) were washed once in 5 ml of cytomix (23van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of cytomix containing 10 μg of plasmid that had been linearized with EcoRV (stem-loop construct) or NotI (pZJM) so that it could target the rDNA spacer region (20Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out in 2-mm cuvettes using a BTX electroporator with peak discharge at 1.6 kV in resistance timing mode R2 (24 ohms). Immediately following transfection, cells were transferred into 10 ml of SDM-79 supplemented with G418 and hygromycin. After 1 day, selection was applied by culturing in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and the cells were grown for 2 weeks to form stable lines. The cells were not cloned. For induction of dsRNA, cells were cultured in the above medium containing 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were diluted 10-fold when densities reached a minimum of 1 × 106 cells/ml. They were not allowed to grow beyond 5 × 106 cells/ml before diluting again. Cell densities were determined using a Coulter counter model Z1 (Coulter Electronics) and plotted on the growth curves as the product of the cell density and the total dilution. Total RNA was purified from 5 × 107 parasites (Purescript RNA Isolation Kit, Gentra Systems) and electrophoresed on formaldehyde-1.5% agarose gels. Ribosomal RNA levels were estimated by ethidium bromide staining to ensure equal amounts of total RNA were loaded in each lane. The RNA was then transferred to GeneScreen Plus transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 32P-Labeled probes were made by random priming the same PCR products used as inserts in either the stem-loop or the pZJM vector. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed twice for 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 56 °C. The percentage of reduction of mRNA levels induced by RNAi was estimated by densitometry of appropriately exposed autoradiograms. Proteins from 2.5 × 106cell equivalents were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gel), transferred onto Immobilon P, and probed using mouse IgG polyclonal antibodies raised against Crithidia fasciculata universal minicircle sequence-binding protein (UMSBP). The antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Joseph Shlomai (Hebrew University). Primary antibodies were detected with secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and then developed with NBT/BCIP. Using this vector (Fig. 1 A), we tested sequences encoding parts of a topo II (24Strauss P.R. Wang J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 38: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and a candidate mitochondrial RNA polymerase. The entire open reading frame of topo II had been cloned, whereas the RNA polymerase was identified in the TIGR database by searching for sequences homologous to a mammalian mitochondrial RNA polymerase. We selected stable transfectants, induced expression of dsRNA and then monitored the effects of dsRNA production on steady-state mRNA levels and cell growth. In the case of topo II (Fig. 2), Northern analysis revealed a ∼90% reduction of its mRNA 24 h after induction with tetracycline. Cells stopped growing eight days after induction (Table I and Fig. 2). Interestingly, the kDNA of these cells, visualized by DAPI staining, became gradually smaller until the cells became dyskinetoplastic (not shown) and died (Table I). We are now conducting a detailed study of the mechanism of this loss of kDNA. Expression of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase dsRNA led to a ∼95% reduction of its mRNA after 24 h of induction, with growth inhibition 6 days after induction (Fig. 2). This inhibition was followed by cell death (Table I).Table IRNAi of different genesRNAi target 1-aReferences or GenBank™ accession numbers are: Topo II (24), RNA pol (AQ653994), p34/p37 (33), GPI 10 (28), Pex 11 (30), UMSBP (AQ952609), CDC47 (AF164200), RNase HI (U74470), Pol β (AQ948642), SSE1 (AQ650584), and ODC (31).

Open table in a new tab To avoid the time-consuming introduction of inserts into the stem-loop vector, we constructed pZJM, a vector that allows PCR-generated fragments of any target gene to be inserted between opposing tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters (Fig. 1 B). In an initial characterization of this vector, we attempted to generate FAT cells, a swollen cell phenotype described previously for RNAi of the α-tubulin gene (3Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 16Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). With a fragment of the α−tubulin gene in the cloning site of pZJM, we transfected procyclic forms of T. brucei. Following the generation of stable transfectants, we induced with tetracycline and after 1 day FAT cells were evident, comparable with previous results (16Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To further characterize pZJM, we tested RNA interference of a number of other genes, including one homologous with UMSBP, a C. fasciculata protein that binds to the replication origin of kDNA minicircles (25Tzfati Y. Abeliovich H. Kapeller I. Shlomai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6891-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After 40 h of tetracycline induction, UMSBP mRNA was reduced by ∼80%. In contrast, probing the same blot for mitochondrial pol β mRNA revealed no change in level after tetracycline induction (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel), confirming the specificity of RNAi. Although a substantial amount of UMSBP-specific dsRNA of the predicted size is detected in the tetracycline-induced lane, a small amount of the same species was detected in the uninduced culture (indicated by an asteriskin Fig. 3 A). Therefore, there is a low level of expression of dsRNA even in the absence of added tetracycline. Induction of dsRNA led to loss of detectable UMSBP protein after 10 days (Fig. 3 B). In another experiment, UMSBP protein levels were reduced by ∼32% after 1 day of induction and ∼75% after 3 days of induction (data not shown). Growth was slowed in the tetracycline-induced cells starting at about day 7. After 12 days of induction, 10–15% of the cells lacked nuclei, whereas less than 0.1% of the uninduced cells were anucleate. We then tested the pZJM system on genes involved in a number of biological processes, including kDNA replication (topo II (24Strauss P.R. Wang J.C. Mol. Biochem.

The RNAi effect on growth kinetics and mRNA levels for all of these proteins is shown in Fig. 4, and the results are summarized in Table I. Using pZJM(topo II) to interfere with topo II expression, we were able to reduce its mRNA level by ∼80% at 40 h (Fig. 2). The growth rate of a culture expressing topo II dsRNA was similar to that with the stem-loop vector, with cell growth inhibited about 8 days after induction. Furthermore, expression of dsRNA from pZJM(topo II) led to dyskinetoplasty and cell death, as seen with the stem-loop construct (not shown). As was the case with UMSBP, a small amount of dsRNA was synthesized in uninduced cells (not shown), but this had little impact on cell growth. The doubling time of the uninduced cell line was 17.8 h compared with the doubling time of the parental cell line 29–13, which was 17.4 h (not shown). Furthermore, cells harboring pZJM(topo II) cultured for 2 months in the presence of phleomycin (to maintain the integration construct) grew normally. These cells retained the ability to express dsRNA upon induction and became dyskinetoplastic and died at rates similar to those seen with the original transfectants (not shown). These results indicate that the low level of topo II-specific dsRNA in uninduced cells does not have detectable deleterious effects. Table I summarizes the effects of dsRNA expression on cell growth and mRNA levels for the genes examined. RNA interference of p34/p37 (mRNA reduced ∼95%), SSE1 (mRNA reduced ∼35%), ODC (mRNA reduced ∼98%), and Pex 11 (mRNA reduced ∼93%) led to aberrant cell growth after 5–10 days (Fig. 4). Following induction of p34/p37 dsRNA, 20% of the parasites became multinucleate, whereas uninduced cells did not show this effect. In the case of SSE1, there appeared to be an enlargement of the kinetoplast after expression of dsRNA. On the other hand, RNA interference of other genes, including GPI10 (mRNA reduced ∼50%), CDC47 (mRNA reduced ∼80%), and pol β (mRNA reduced ∼55%), had little or no effect on trypanosome growth. pZJM(RNase H1)-transfected cells expressed dsRNA (not shown) which, in contrast to all the other genes studied, did not lead to a reduction of the targeted mRNA (Fig. 4). ODC converts ornithine to putrescine, a reaction in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway that is required for parasite growth (31Phillips M.A. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of ODC dsRNA led to a 98% reduction of mRNA level and inhibition of cell growth after 3 days (Table I and Fig. 4). Parasites lacking ODC because of conventional gene knockouts could not grow but persisted in an elongated, slender form for up to 8 weeks (34Li F. Hua S.B. Wang C.C. Gottesdiener K.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found the same morphology in cells expressing ODC dsRNA (not shown). Furthermore, like cells with the ODC genes knocked out (34Li F. Hua S.B. Wang C.C. Gottesdiener K.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the RNAi parasites could be rescued if putrescine was added to the growth medium (Fig. 5). Finally, cells that had been expressing ODC dsRNA for 13 days were rescued by removal of tetracycline, with recovery occurring after 2 days of growth in tetracycline-deficient medium (Fig. 5). The fact that cells deficient in ODC expression because of RNAi behave similarly to ODC knockout cells provides confidence in the reliability of RNAi for studyingT. brucei gene expression. For this experiment we ligated a 584-bp fragment of topo II and a 527-bp fragment of pol β in tandem into pZJM. Expression of dsRNA from this construct led to the reduction of mRNA for both topo II and pol β (82% and 93%, respectively). The control mRNA level (UMSBP) was not altered (Fig. 6 A). These cells developed a growth defect and dyskinetoplasty similar to that found in cells transfected with pZJM(topo II) (Fig. 6 B). Traditional methods for generating genetic knockouts inT. brucei are time-consuming. In contrast, RNAi has been shown to be a much simpler and faster method for selective interference of gene expression (3Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 16Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Unlike gene knockouts in which each locus must be individually disrupted, RNAi can inhibit expression of multiple copies of a target gene. Furthermore, RNAi does not even require fully cloned genes, whereas traditional knockouts generally need at least the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions. This feature makes RNAi a powerful tool to assess the function of partially sequenced genes available in the rapidly expanding T. brucei genome data base. It was our objective to make a vector that could be stably integrated and easily used for the analysis of a variety of genes. pZJM uses opposing tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters flanking a partial sequence of the target gene, and it is integrated into a nontranscribed region of the genome of procyclic trypanosomes that express both the T7 polymerase and the tetracycline repressor (21Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). pZJM is simple to use because it requires only a single cloning step in which the target gene fragment is inserted between the two T7 promoters. The convenience of the pZJM method is emphasized by the fact that after identification of a candidate gene sequence in the data base it takes as little as 3 weeks to obtain results from induction of RNAi in a stable cell line. Both the stem-loop and pZJM vectors were effective in inducing the selective reduction of mRNA levels 24–40 h after induction with tetracycline. In many cases induction of RNAi resulted in a slowing or termination of cell growth, often followed by cell death. There was some variation in the effectiveness of interference of gene expression. For example, in the case of topo II with the stem-loop vector (Fig. 2) or with pZJM(topo II/pol β) (Fig. 5) reduction of the mRNA level was at least 90%. However, with pZJM(topo II) (Fig. 4) RNAi was less effective, with only about 80% reduction of mRNA level. In a different induction of the same pZJM(topo II) cell line, there was only a 70% reduction of topo II mRNA. In all cases, however, cell growth reduction and the timing of appearance of dyskinetoplasty were similar. With pZJM, different genes varied in their sensitivity to RNAi as judged by Northern blots (Fig. 4). In the cases of p34/p37, Pex 11, and ODC, the depletion of mRNA was nearly complete, and in all cases there was a striking effect on cell growth. In contrast, interference of expression of topo II, GPI10, and pol β had less severe effects on mRNA levels (Fig. 4 and Table I). In the latter two cases there was no effect on growth, either because the genes are not essential under our experimental conditions or because there is sufficient mRNA present after tetracycline induction to sustain normal cell growth. Again, pol β interference showed variation with different constructs. Using pZJM(pol β), mRNA reduction was 55% and using pZJM(topo II/pol β), it was 93%. It is worth noting that in one experiment using the stem-loop construct (not shown), pol β mRNA was depleted by 98%, and in that case the growth of the parasites was affected. One reason for the differences could be that the cells are not clonal. RNase H1 mRNA was not reduced by expression of dsRNA (Fig. 4). This insensitivity to RNAi could be a consequence of rapid turnover of its mRNA. Alternatively, RNase H1 might play a heretofore unrecognized role in the RNAi mechanism so that its reduction would diminish the process of RNAi. As for phenotypes induced by RNAi, there is considerable variation with different genes in the rate of appearance of the growth effects, and this variation is probably due to differences in the turnover kinetics of both the mRNA and the protein product. dsRNA is detected several hours after the addition of tetracycline (16Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), 2Z. Wang, J. C. Morris, M. E. Drew, and P. T. Englund, unpublished observations. and in most cases a large fraction of the mRNA is degraded within 40 h (Table I and Fig. 4). After depletion of mRNA, the appearance of a phenotype must depend on the abundance and the stability of the protein. For example, UMSBP mRNA was depleted by 80% after 40 h of dsRNA induction, and after 3 days protein levels dropped 75%. The growth phenotype only became convincing after 10 days of induction, when the protein was undetectable by Western blotting (Fig. 3). Some phenotypes, such as the appearance of anucleate cells after interference with UMSBP expression and multinucleate cells after blocking p34/p37 expression, are complex and have not yet been studied further. We consistently detected a small amount of dsRNA expressed from the pZJM vector in the absence of added tetracycline. This did not appear to be the case with the stem-loop vector, which uses the procyclin promoter (Fig. 1), because even with long exposures of the autoradiograms there was no detectable dsRNA in any of the uninduced cells. In all of the genes tested, this uninduced transcription had little or no detectable effect on the growth of the cells. In the case of pZJM(topo II), uninduced cells grew normally for over 2 months and, upon induction, exhibited the same phenotype as that of newly transfected strains. We have shown that pZJM can be used to analyze a large number of genes quickly (Fig. 4), and it can also be used to study two genes simultaneously (Fig. 5). We are currently generating a pZJM-based library of genomic fragments that should allow the use of “forward genetics” to discover genes responsible for interesting phenotypes.

More than a dozen families were identified, with diverse but overlapping clinical features. Pathological changes include selective frontotemporal atrophy, neuronal loss, gliosis, and spongiosis in several brain areas in addition to abundant filamentous inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons and, to some extent, in glial cells (1Spillantini M.G.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Tau has tubulin-polymerizing activities in vitro(3Brandt R. Lee G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); it establishes short cross-bridges between axonal microtubules and thereby supports functions in intracellular trafficking including axonal transport (4Trinczek B. Ebneth A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2355-2367PubMed Google Scholar). In neurons affected by tauopathy, tau is hyperphosphorylated and is located not only in axons but also in cell bodies and dendrites (5Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Vanmechelen E.

Results from in vitro studies suggest that disease-causing mutations in the tau gene result either in the reduced ability of tau to interact with microtubules or in increased ratios of four-repeat (4R)1 to three-repeat tau caused by quantitative changes in the splicing in of exon 10.

Tau accumulated mainly in neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus; it was hyperphosphorylated at distinct sites and formed filaments similar to those present in human tauopathies.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that transgenic expression of human P301L mutant tau under control of the murine Thy1.2 genomic expression vector leads to the formation of sarcosyl-insoluble, 15-nm-wide tau filaments. By comparison, tau filaments in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 patients with the P301L mutation (Dutch family 1) consist of 15-nm-wide, slender, twisted filaments with variable periodicity, in addition to a few straight filaments (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and the tau filaments obtained from AD brains consist of 20-nm-wide, paired helical or straight filaments. The filaments in our P301L tau transgenic mice have the same width as those in the human disease associated with the P301L mutation (Dutch family 1). They were, however, shorter than filaments enriched from AD brains, which we included as positive control because of the unavailability of a brain sample from Dutch family 1. One likely explanation for the prevalence of short filaments in our mice is that the longest tau isoform expressed in our mouse contained two calpain recognition motifs for proteolytic degradation that may favor the formation of shorter filaments. In addition to the P301L mutation, the filament formation in our mice may also be related to high expression levels achieved by using the murine Thy1.2 expression vector, as shown by immunoblot analyses. A possible contribution of high expression levels to tau filament formation in our mouse lines is supported by the concentration dependence of filament assembly in vitro that resembles a nucleation-dependent process (18Perez M.

Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Together, the failure of previous attempts to model tau filament formation in transgenic mice may be related to either the absence of disease-causing mutations in the expression constructs or low expression levels (11Probst A.

Brain regions, which in human disease are spared from tau pathology, such as the cerebellum, did not express detectable levels of tau, as determined by immunofluorescence. As in human tauopathies (26Delacourte A. David J.P. Sergeant N. Buee L. Wattez A. Vermersch P. Ghozali F. Fallet-Bianco C. Pasquier F. Lebert F. Petit H. Di Menza C. Neurology. 1999; 52: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tau accumulated not only in axons but also in cell bodies and dendrites. To establish phosphoepitopes that are related to tau aggregation and filament formation, we used a panel of phosphorylation-dependent antibodies. In brains from patients of Dutch family 1, phosphorylation-dependent antibodies AT8, AT100, AT180, AT270, PHF1, and 12E8 stained numerous deposits in several brain regions, including the cortex, the dentate gyrus, and the CA1 region of the hippocampus. These deposits were mainly of the pretangle type and located in the perinuclear region and cell body and sometimes extended to the apical dendrites of neurons (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In our model, AT100 and 12E8 did not discriminate wild-type from transgenic mice. AT8 staining was weak in transgenic mice and mainly restricted to a subset of cortical neurons, where it was found not only in cell bodies but also in dendrites. AT100 and PHF1 did not stain any neuron at up to 6 months of age. Age may account for this apparent difference between human disease and the mouse model, especially because filaments obtained from 8-month-old transgenic mice were AT100- and AT8-positive. AT180 and also the conformation-dependent antibodies MC1 and TG3, which were not included in the human study, revealed strong somatodendritic staining in both cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons of transgenic mice. Antibodies MC1 and TG3 recognize a distinct pathological conformation of the tau molecule in AD. In normal autopsy-derived brain tissue, tau is not stained by these antibodies. Our data indicate that transgenic tau underwent a conformational change favoring filament formation. Indeed, by immunogold electron microscopy of sarcosyl-insoluble tau protein, the AT8, AD199, AT100, and TG3 epitopes were identified on tau filaments in our P301L transgenic mice. For comparison, in the human study only one antibody, AT8, was used that labeled tau filaments (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The distance of the gold particles from the core of the filament is similar to that reported for AD filaments (10Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The space between the filaments and the gold particles corresponds to the known fuzzy coat of the filaments (10Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 16Wischik C.M. Novak M. Edwards P.C. Klug A. Tichelaar W. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Taken together, tau in the nonfilamentous and filamentous states is hyperphosphorylated at several sites, which are also hyperphosphorylated in human tauopathies.In Dutch family 1, neurological examination of brains revealed gliosis and severe neuronal loss in frontal and temporal cortex and variable loss in the parietal cortex, whereas the hippocampus showed only mild to moderate neuronal loss and gliosis (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with our findings. Despite comparable levels and phosphorylation of human tau in hippocampus and cortex of transgenic mice, we found evidence for apoptosis and astrocytosis in cortical areas and in the amygdala but not in the hippocampus. Astrocytosis was positively correlated with levels of human tau expression, as shown for the M1 and S1 cortices. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that this pathology progresses and will include the hippocampus with advanced aging in older mice.Together, our data show that the P301L mutation in combination with high expression levels can cause the formation of abnormal tau filaments in neurons in mice. Filament formation was also reported recently in mice expressing 2−3−4R tau, along with the human pathogenic mutation P301L, under control of the mouse prion protein promoter. These mice show an advanced neurological phenotype, likely reflecting differences between 2−3−4R and 2+3+4R tau (27Lewis J. McGowan E. Rockwood J. Melrose H. Nacharaju P. Van Slegtenhorst M. Gwinn-Hardy K. Paul Murphy M. Baker M., Yu, X. Duff K. Hardy J. Corral A. Lin W.L. Yen S.H. Dickson D.W. Davies P. Hutton M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). In our P301L mice, filaments were phosphorylated at distinct epitopes, and their formation was accompanied by astrocytosis and apoptosis. These data indicate that P301L is a key pathogenic factor, and they underscore its pathophysiological role in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Moreover, our results suggest the use of these mice, either alone or in combination with a pathogenic APP mutation, for the study of both the pathophysiology and the prevention of tau filament formation in neurodegenerative diseases. Hereditary frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 is a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by early behavioral changes accompanied by subsequent cognitive and motor disturbances.

Tau is an axonal, microtubule-associated phosphoprotein in normal adult brain (2Goedert M. Jakes R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Tau has tubulin-polymerizing activities in vitro(3Brandt R. Lee G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); it establishes short cross-bridges between axonal microtubules and thereby supports functions in intracellular trafficking including axonal transport (4Trinczek B. Ebneth A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2355-2367PubMed Google Scholar). In neurons affected by tauopathy, tau is hyperphosphorylated and is located not only in axons but also in cell bodies and dendrites (5Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Crowther R.A. Vanmechelen E.

Neural. Transm. Suppl. 1998; 53: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Results from in vitro studies suggest that disease-causing mutations in the tau gene result either in the reduced ability of tau to interact with microtubules or in increased ratios of four-repeat (4R)1 to three-repeat tau caused by quantitative changes in the splicing in of exon 10. (7Grover A. Houlden H. Baker M. Adamson J. Lewis J. Prihar G. Pickering-Brown S. Duff K. Hutton M. J. Biol.

To demonstrate that human tau can form filaments in mouse brains and to reproduce aspects of the human pathology, including neurofibrillary tangle formation, in transgenic mice, we expressed the longest isoform of human tau with the frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 causing mutation P301L in neurons by using a neuron-specific promoter. Tau accumulated mainly in neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus; it was hyperphosphorylated at distinct sites and formed filaments similar to those present in human tauopathies. DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that transgenic expression of human P301L mutant tau under control of the murine Thy1.2 genomic expression vector leads to the formation of sarcosyl-insoluble, 15-nm-wide tau filaments. By comparison, tau filaments in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 patients with the P301L mutation (Dutch family 1) consist of 15-nm-wide, slender, twisted filaments with variable periodicity, in addition to a few straight filaments (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and the tau filaments obtained from AD brains consist of 20-nm-wide, paired helical or straight filaments. The filaments in our P301L tau transgenic mice have the same width as those in the human disease associated with the P301L mutation (Dutch family 1). They were, however, shorter than filaments enriched from AD brains, which we included as positive control because of the unavailability of a brain sample from Dutch family 1. One likely explanation for the prevalence of short filaments in our mice is that the longest tau isoform expressed in our mouse contained two calpain recognition motifs for proteolytic degradation that may favor the formation of shorter filaments. In addition to the P301L mutation, the filament formation in our mice may also be related to high expression levels achieved by using the murine Thy1.2 expression vector, as shown by immunoblot analyses. A possible contribution of high expression levels to tau filament formation in our mouse lines is supported by the concentration dependence of filament assembly in vitro that resembles a nucleation-dependent process (18Perez M.

Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Together, the failure of previous attempts to model tau filament formation in transgenic mice may be related to either the absence of disease-causing mutations in the expression constructs or low expression levels (11Probst A.

Brain regions, which in human disease are spared from tau pathology, such as the cerebellum, did not express detectable levels of tau, as determined by immunofluorescence. As in human tauopathies (26Delacourte A. David J.P. Sergeant N. Buee L. Wattez A. Vermersch P. Ghozali F. Fallet-Bianco C. Pasquier F. Lebert F. Petit H. Di Menza C. Neurology. 1999; 52: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tau accumulated not only in axons but also in cell bodies and dendrites. To establish phosphoepitopes that are related to tau aggregation and filament formation, we used a panel of phosphorylation-dependent antibodies. In brains from patients of Dutch family 1, phosphorylation-dependent antibodies AT8, AT100, AT180, AT270, PHF1, and 12E8 stained numerous deposits in several brain regions, including the cortex, the dentate gyrus, and the CA1 region of the hippocampus. These deposits were mainly of the pretangle type and located in the perinuclear region and cell body and sometimes extended to the apical dendrites of neurons (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In our model, AT100 and 12E8 did not discriminate wild-type from transgenic mice. AT8 staining was weak in transgenic mice and mainly restricted to a subset of cortical neurons, where it was found not only in cell bodies but also in dendrites. AT100 and PHF1 did not stain any neuron at up to 6 months of age. Age may account for this apparent difference between human disease and the mouse model, especially because filaments obtained from 8-month-old transgenic mice were AT100- and AT8-positive. AT180 and also the conformation-dependent antibodies MC1 and TG3, which were not included in the human study, revealed strong somatodendritic staining in both cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons of transgenic mice. Antibodies MC1 and TG3 recognize a distinct pathological conformation of the tau molecule in AD. In normal autopsy-derived brain tissue, tau is not stained by these antibodies. Our data indicate that transgenic tau underwent a conformational change favoring filament formation. Indeed, by immunogold electron microscopy of sarcosyl-insoluble tau protein, the AT8, AD199, AT100, and TG3 epitopes were identified on tau filaments in our P301L transgenic mice. For comparison, in the human study only one antibody, AT8, was used that labeled tau filaments (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The distance of the gold particles from the core of the filament is similar to that reported for AD filaments (10Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). The space between the filaments and the gold particles corresponds to the known fuzzy coat of the filaments (10Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A.

A. 1988; 85: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Taken together, tau in the nonfilamentous and filamentous states is hyperphosphorylated at several sites, which are also hyperphosphorylated in human tauopathies.In Dutch family 1, neurological examination of brains revealed gliosis and severe neuronal loss in frontal and temporal cortex and variable loss in the parietal cortex, whereas the hippocampus showed only mild to moderate neuronal loss and gliosis (1Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Kamphorst W. Heutink P. van Swieten J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with our findings. Despite comparable levels and phosphorylation of human tau in hippocampus and cortex of transgenic mice, we found evidence for apoptosis and astrocytosis in cortical areas and in the amygdala but not in the hippocampus. Astrocytosis was positively correlated with levels of human tau expression, as shown for the M1 and S1 cortices. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that this pathology progresses and will include the hippocampus with advanced aging in older mice.Together, our data show that the P301L mutation in combination with high expression levels can cause the formation of abnormal tau filaments in neurons in mice. Filament formation was also reported recently in mice expressing 2−3−4R tau, along with the human pathogenic mutation P301L, under control of the mouse prion protein promoter. These mice show an advanced neurological phenotype, likely reflecting differences between 2−3−4R and 2+3+4R tau (27Lewis J. McGowan E. Rockwood J. Melrose H. Nacharaju P. Van Slegtenhorst M. Gwinn-Hardy K. Paul Murphy M. Baker M., Yu, X. Duff K. Hardy J. Corral A. Lin W.L. Yen S.H. Dickson D.W. Davies P. Hutton M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). In our P301L mice, filaments were phosphorylated at distinct epitopes, and their formation was accompanied by astrocytosis and apoptosis. These data indicate that P301L is a key pathogenic factor, and they underscore its pathophysiological role in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Moreover, our results suggest the use of these mice, either alone or in combination with a pathogenic APP mutation, for the study of both the pathophysiology and the prevention of tau filament formation in neurodegenerative diseases. The results of this study show that transgenic expression of human P301L mutant tau under control of the murine Thy1.2 genomic expression vector leads to the formation of sarcosyl-insoluble, 15-nm-wide tau filaments.

The mechanism by which N-CoR represses basal transcription involves the direct or indirect recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs). We have isolated two multiprotein N-CoR complexes, designated N-CoR-1 and N-CoR-2, which possess histone deacetylase activity that is mediated by distinct HDACs. Based on Western blotting using antibodies against known subunits, the only HDAC found in the N-CoR-1 complex was HDAC3. In contrast, N-CoR-2 contained predominantly HDAC1 and HDAC2 as well as several other subunits that are found in the Sin3A·HDAC complex. Using mass spectrometry and Western blotting, we have identified several novel components of the N-CoR-1 complex including the SWI/SNF-related proteins BRG1, BAF 170, BAF 155, BAF 47/INI1, and the corepressor KAP-1 that is involved in silencing heterochromatin. Indirect immunofluorescence has revealed that both KAP-1 and N-CoR colocalize throughout the nucleus.

This is accomplished through transcription factor-mediated recruitment of coactivators and corepressors, which can regulate transcription through the modification of the local chromatin environment and by specifically interacting with components of the core transcriptional machinery (1Collingwood T.N.

The nuclear hormone receptor superfamily provides a unique model to study the mechanism of transcriptional activation and repression and the role of reversible chromatin modification in the control of gene expression. In the absence of ligand, nuclear hormone receptors such as the thyroid hormone (TR)1 andretinoic acid receptors (RAR) function as potent repressors by interacting with specific corepressor proteins (3Horlein A.J.

More recently, a strong correlation between repression mediated by the TR and recruitment of N-CoR or SMRT have also been demonstrated in Xenopus oocytes (9Urnov F.D. Yee J. Sach L. Collingwood T.N.

Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). N-CoR and SMRT contain three highly conserved repression domains designated RD1, RD2, and RD3 (3Horlein A.J. Naar A.M.

The lack of homology between these domains suggests that their mechanism of action is mediated via distinct pathways. RD1 serves as a major interacting surface for the corepressor Sin3A, which, in turn, can directly interact with the histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and 2), suggesting that repression by N-CoR and SMRT is linked to the deacetylation of histones (11Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Single cell microinjection studies using antibodies against mSin3, or its associated histone deacetylases, inhibits repression by unliganded T3R and RAR (11Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression by nuclear hormone receptors is also blocked by deacetylase inhibitors such as Trichostatin A (TSA) (11Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D.

Taken together, these studies suggest that the repressive effects of N-CoR and SMRT are mediated in part by a Sin3·HDAC complex. In contrast, the RD3 of SMRT and N-CoR interacts with the class II histone deacetylases that are structurally related to the yeast Hda1 protein (13Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 14Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M.

The interaction between SMRT and class II HDACs occurs in vivoand in vitro and correlates with the repressor activity of RD3. Recent studies have also implicated N-CoR and SMRT in transcriptional repression that is mediated by several other families of transcription factors including Notch (16Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P.

Abnormal recruitment of N-CoR and SMRT has also been linked to pathological disorders such as acutepromyelocytic leukemia (PML) that is associated with rearrangements of the gene encoding the RARα receptor and the PML zinc finger protein. This results in the formation of a PML·RAR fusion protein that blocks myeloid differentiation. Treatment with retinoic acid causes the release of N-CoR/SMRT and abolishes the PML·RAR-mediated differentiation block (21Lin R.J. Nagy L. Inoue S. Shao W. Miller Jr., W.H. Evans R.M.

Biochemical purification of the mammalian Sin3 has identified a Sin3 complex, which consists of 8–10 proteins and includes HDAC1 and 2, RbAp46/48, Sap 18, and Sap 30 (23, 24). However, neither N-CoR nor SMRT were identified as components of the mSin3·HDAC complex, or a related complex known as NURD/Mi2/NRD, which contains both histone deacetylase and nucleosome remodeling activity (25Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Vermaak D. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 843-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol.

Nature. 1998; 395: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, N-CoR may not be a stable component of a deacetylase complex and may function as an adaptor protein for sequence-specific transcriptional repressors upon activation of specific signaling pathways. Alternatively, it has been suggested that N-CoR may be targeting a different subpopulation of cellular mSin3 or HDACs (28Soderstrom M. Vo A. Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Yang W.M. Seto E. Peterson D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we have undertaken a biochemical purification of endogenous N-CoR from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by combining conventional chromatography with immunoaffinity purification using an affinity-purified anti-N-CoR antibody. We have isolated two major N-CoR-containing complexes designated N-CoR-1 and N-CoR-2, which on the basis of gel filtration chromatography are each approximately 2.0 MDa. Both complexes possess intrinsic histone deacetylase activity based on their ability to deacetylate core histones. We have demonstrated that N-CoR-2 contains proteins that are found in the Sin3·HDAC and NURD/Mi2/NRD complexes but are not found in N-CoR-1 suggesting that N-CoR-1 is a novel N-CoR-containing complex. Using mass spectrometry we have identified several components of the N-CoR-1 complex that include several subunits of the SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes as well as the corepressor Krab associatedprotein 1 (KAP-1). Taken together, these findings implicate N-CoR in multiple pathways of transcriptional repression that may involve the recruitment of distinct corepressor complexes. Subcellular fractions of cells were prepared according to standard methods (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described previously (30Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmcia Biotech). The HDAC2 and Sin3A antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The RbAp48 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. The N-CoR polyclonal antisera was raised against a His-tagged recombinant N-CoR (amino acids 2232–2453) protein and was purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. To further purify the anti-N-CoR antibody, the IgG fraction was passed through an affinity column consisting of the His-tagged recombinant N-CoR protein (amino acids 2232–2453) cross-linked to Sepharose 4B, and the specific antibody was eluted with 100 mm glycine pH 2.8 (31Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, NY1999Google Scholar). Forty liters of HeLa cells, grown to mid-log phase, were obtained from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to standard methods (29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). To purify the nuclear N-CoR complexes, the nuclear extract was dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) containing 100 mmKCl and was loaded onto an 80-ml P11 phosphocellulose column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through was collected, and the column was washed sequentially in a stepwise fashion using buffer A containing 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m KCl. At each step, the column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer containing the corresponding salt concentration to allow UV absorbance to stabilize near baseline prior to collection of the next protein peak. The majority of immunoreactive N-CoR was found in the 0.3- and 0.5-m KCl fractions. The N-CoR-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 100 mm KCl, and then passed through a DEAE-Sepharose column and eluted with an increasing KCl gradient. All fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-N-CoR antibody. The N-CoR-containing fractions were again pooled, concentrated by precipitating with 20–60% ammonium sulfate, and then applied to a Sephacryl S300 column pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl. The column was washed with buffer A at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Each N-CoR complex eluted as a single large molecular mass peak of approximately 2.0 MDa. The fractions corresponding to each peak were analyzed for N-CoR by Western blotting, pooled, and dialyzed against buffer A containing 100 mm KCl without dithiothreitol. For affinity purification of the N-CoR complexes, affinity-purified N-CoR antibody was cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose using dimethylpalmilidate according to standard procedures (31Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, NY1999Google Scholar). The pooled fractions from the gel filtration step were precleared using protein A-Sepharose cross-linked to rabbit IgG. The precleared sample was then loaded onto the affinity column at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the flow-through was collected and reloaded onto the affinity column five times. The bound proteins were washed with 10 column volumes each of buffer A (without dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.3 mKCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 m KCl, or 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.7 m KCl, and a final wash in buffer A containing 100 mm KCl prior to elution with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.8). For mock purification experiments, samples from the gel filtration step were loaded onto protein A-Sepharose alone, or protein A-Sepharose cross-linked to an irrelevant antibody. Proteins were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE and then stained with colloidal blue for 1 h followed by destaining in 25% MeOH for an additional 2 h. The protein bands were excised and cut into 1 mm3 pieces. The gel pieces were washed twice in a 50% CH3CN solution for 5 min followed by two washes with a 250-μl solution consisting of 50% CH3CN, 50 mm NH4HCO3for 30 min. The gel pieces were lyophilized, rehydrated in 10 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5 containing 0.1 μg/μl trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic fragments were extracted by two 30-min washes with a solution containing 60% CH3CN, 10% trifluoroacetic acid. The combined solutions were lyophilized using a Speedvac, resuspended in 20 μl of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid solution and the peptide suspensions were purified using a ZipTip (Millipore) cartridge according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to analysis by MALDI-MS. MALDI-MS analyses were carried out by using a Perseptive Biosystem Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Farmingham, MA), equipped with a pulsed UV nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse) and a dual microchannel plate detector. The spectra were acquired in reflectron-DE mode, acceleration voltage was set to 20 kV, grid voltage at 72% of the acceleration voltage, guide wire voltage at 0.020%, delay time at 140 ns, low mass gate was set at 250 Da, and the mass to charge ratio was calibrated internally with the dimer of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid ((2M + H)+, 380.09 Da) and trypsin autolysis peptide ((M + H)+, 2163.05 Da). Two parts of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and one part of nitrocellulose were dissolved in acetone-isopropyl alcohol (4:1) to final concentrations of 20 and 10 mg/ml, respectively. A 0.5-μl volume of this solution was deposited on MALDI target and allowed to dry. 0.5 μl of 1% acetic acid was placed on top of the matrix layer followed by addition of 1 μl of analyte solution. Mass spectra were recorded after evaporation of the solvent and processed using GRAMS software for data collection and analysis. Peptide sequence analysis was conducted by Post-Source Decay (PSD) technique. The spectra were acquired at DE-reflectron mode. The accelerating voltage was set at 20 kV, grid voltage at 75%, guide wire voltage at 0.024%, and delay time at 100 ns. The timed ion selector was preset to the protonated molecular weight of the analyte. The spectra were acquired in 10–13 segments with mirror ratio 1.0 to 0.1342 and finally “stitched” together by the instrument software. The tryptic peptides obtained were used to search for protein candidates in the nonredundant protein sequence database with the program PROWL that is publicly available. HeLa cells were plated onto Fisher brand microscope slides and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were allowed to adhere for approximately 18 h prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked for 30 min in 5% goat serum. After a brief wash, slides were incubated with rabbit anti-N-CoR antibody (1:300 dilution) and anti-KAP-1 mouse monoclonal IgG antibody supernatant (1:10 dilution) in 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and then incubated for 4 h at room temperature with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to rhodamine (1:500 dilution) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein (1:500 dilution) (Santa Cruz). Images were captured using a Sensicam digital camera on a Olympus Provis AX-70 microscope and analyzed using Image Pro Plus version 4.0. Core histones were purified from HeLa cells essentially as described with some modifications (32Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of HeLa cells were grown to a density of 0.8 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum. The cells were preincubated with 10 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h before harvesting. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 100 μg/ml cyclohexamide, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 0.1 mCi/ml [3H] acetic acid and were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with gentle stirring. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (500 × g, 5 min) and then lysed in 10 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 10 min), washed twice in 10 ml of buffer B and then resuspended in buffer B without Nonidet P-40 (buffer C). The nuclear proteins were extracted by adding buffer C containing 0.42 m KCl, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer C and were then extracted twice with 0.2 m H2S04 for 90 min in an ice bath with gentle stirring and then centrifuged (30,000 × g for 20 min). The supernatants were pooled and dialyzed extensively against 100 mm acetic acid, and the histones were precipitated with 10 volumes of ice-cold acetone and resuspended in water to a concentration of approximately 2 mg/ml. Histone deacetylase activity was monitored as described previously (33Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the affinity-purified complexes were retained on 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose affinity resin containing cross-linked anti-N-CoR antibody. The beads were washed extensively with buffer A containing 500 mm KCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then resuspended in buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0. 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfornyl fluoride) containing [3H]histones (20,000 cpm/reaction) to a final volume of 200 μl. The reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 90 min and stopped by the addition of 0.05 ml of 0.1 mHCl, 0.7 m acetic acid solution. Released [3H]acetate was extracted with 0.6 ml of ethyl acetate. After centrifugation, 0.3 ml of the upper organic phase was used for liquid scintillation counting. As a first step in determining whether endogenous N-CoR is a stable component of a corepressor complex, we generated a polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of N-CoR. The affinity-purified antibody recognized a single protein band of approximately 260 kDa that is consistent with the size of N-CoR (see Fig. 2 A). Nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells were initially fractionated on a P11 phosphocellulose column using a step gradient with increasing salt concentrations (Fig. 1, A and B). Western blot analysis of the eluates derived from this column demonstrated that N-CoR was present in three fractions. A distinct N-CoR-containing fraction was eluted with 0.3 m KCl buffer (N-CoR-1). N-CoR immunoreactivity was also found in fractions eluted with 0.5 m (N-CoR-2) and a minor component was also detected in the 1.0 m KCl (data not shown). To confirm that efficient protein separation was achieved with the P11 column, we analyzed the eluates for the transcriptional coactivator p/CIP (32Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which is part of a family of nuclear receptor coactivator proteins required for ligand-dependent signaling. p/CIP eluted from the phosphocellulose column with 0.1 m KCl. A similar elution profile was obtained with other members of this family of coactivators (data not shown) suggesting that they are found in complexes that are distinct from N-CoR.Figure 1Purification of N-CoR-containing complexes.

The salt concentrations used to purify the individual fractions are indicated at the top.

The molecular mass standards are indicated at the top of the panel; 660 kDa, thyroglobulin; 440 kDa, ferritin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relative abundance of Sin3A was also examined in the fractions eluted from the phosphocellulose column. Although Sin3A was detected in all of the N-CoR-containing fractions, the relative distribution was not consistent with the distribution of N-CoR. Based on densitometric scanning, only 7% of the total amount of Sin3A was found in the 0.3m KCl fraction, suggesting that the major N-CoR-containing fraction is not complexed to Sin3A but may function in other contexts. To characterize these complexes further, we subjected the P11-purified fractions to purification by DEAE-Sepharose followed by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S-300 column. Immunoblot analysis of the eluates derived from the Sephacryl S300 column demonstrated that N-CoR-1 and N-CoR-2 eluted with the void volume corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 2.0 MDa (Fig. 1 C). Because N-CoR is a 260-kDa protein, this result strongly suggests that it is found as part of a large multiprotein complex. To purify these complexes further, the affinity purified N-CoR antibody was cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose, and the N-CoR-containing fractions isolated from the Sephacryl S300 column were pooled and applied to the immunoaffinity column. After extensive washing with highly stringent buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.7 m KCl, the retained proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH2.8. Western blot analysis of the immunopurified N-CoR-1 complex demonstrated that the majority of N-CoR bound to the immunoaffinity column and that a single immunoreactive peak was present in the eluate with no significant breakdown products detected (Fig. 2 A). Silver staining of an SDS-PAGE gel of the N-CoR-1 complex consistently identified approximately 20 proteins ranging in molecular mass from 35 to 350 kDa (Fig. 2 B). The interaction of these polypeptides appears to be specific because the majority of these are not retained when an analogous mock purification was performed using a control affinity column. Because the mechanism of N-CoR action has been linked to the recruitment of a Sin3A·HDAC complex, we initially tested the eluate by Western blotting using antibodies against specific subunits found in this complex (Fig. 2 C). Although Sin3A and HDAC1 and 2 migrated through the Sephacryl S300 column as large molecular weight complexes and a"

In the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum antioxidative proteins represent promising targets for the development of antiparasitic drugs.

Both proteins were biochemically characterized and compared with the human host thioredoxin system. Intriguingly, the 13-kDa protein PfTrx is a better substrate for human TrxR (Km = 2 μm,kcat = 3300 min−1) than for P. falciparum TrxR (Km = 10.4 μm, kcat = 3100 min−1).

Our data suggest that GSSG reduction can be supported at a high rate by the TrxR/Trx system in glutathione reductase-deficient cells; this may be relevant for certain stages of the malarial parasite but also for cells containing high [GSSG] of other organisms like dormant forms of Neurospora, glutathione reductase-deficient yeast mutants, or CD4+ lymphocytes of AIDS patients. P. falciparum glutathione reductase thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase human 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea S-nitrosoglutathione polymerase chain reaction Tropical malaria is a severe disease caused by the multiplication of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum(Pf)1 in human erythrocytes. More than 2 million people die of malaria each year, almost half of the world's population is at risk of being infected. Therefore, new chemotherapeutic and prophylactic strategies are urgently required (1Butler D. Maurice J. O'Brien C. Nature. 1997; 386: 535-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since Plasmodium, like tumor cells, is particularly susceptible to oxidative challenge, the glutathione system and the thioredoxin system (Fig. 1) represent potential targets for antiparasitic and antitumor drug design (2Atamna H.

Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). Unlike the monothiol tripeptide glutathione, the dithiol thioredoxin (Trx; 12 kDa) has a macromolecular structure and is reduced by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR (EC 1.6.4.5); NADPH + H+ + TrxS2 → NADP+ + Trx(SH)2). High molecular weight TrxRs as they occur in malarial parasites and in mammalian cells are structurally and mechanistically closely related to glutathione reductase but differ significantly from low molecular weight bacterial TrxRs (6Williams Jr., C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.F. Veine D. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 9Holmgren A. Annu. Rev.

Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The physiologic functions of thioredoxin include detoxification of reactive oxygen and nitrogen metabolites, donation of reducing equivalents to ribonucleotide reductase, control of protein folding, and redox regulation of enzymes and transcription factors (4Holmgren A.

In many organisms, two or more thioredoxins and TrxRs have been described that act in different cell compartments. The rapidly growing literature on high molecular weight thioredoxin reductases and thioredoxins of eukaryotes has been reviewed in a series of recent articles (3Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Müller S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6118-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 4Holmgren A. Arnér E.S. Eur. J.

Becker K. Redox Report. 1999; 4: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast to glutathione reductases that specifically reduce glutathione disulfide, many high molecular weight TrxRs have a broad substrate spectrum including low molecular weight compounds as well as proteins; glutathione disulfide is, however, not accepted as a substrate (18Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 19Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A.

Pasquier C. Oxidative Stress in Cancer, AIDS, and Neurodegenerative Diseases. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 229-246Google Scholar). Due to this fact the glutathione and the thioredoxin system have been considered to work independently from each other (Fig. 1). This concept was supported by the parallel existence of glutaredoxins and thioredoxins, both of which reduce ribonucleotide reductase (9Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione reductase of the malarial parasite P. falciparumhas been characterized before (21Färber P.M. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one TrxR has been described for P. falciparum so far (6Williams Jr., C.H. Arscott L.D. Müller S. Lennon W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.F. Veine D. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6110-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Müller S. Gilberger T.W. Färber P.M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian TrxR (11Tamura T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 24Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), PfTrxR does not contain selenium, a fact representing a promising approach to drug design (3Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Müller S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6118-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 23Wang P.F. Arscott L.D. Gilberger T.W. Müller S. Williams Jr., C.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thepftrxr gene had been expressed in Escherichia coli (22Müller S. Gilberger T.W. Färber P.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, mutations affecting the C-terminal reaction center of the recombinant enzyme were frequently observed. We therefore adapted the corresponding gene section to expression in bacteria. Furthermore, we cloned and expressed P. falciparumthioredoxin and characterized the TrxR/Trx system of the parasite. Remarkably, this system was found to reduce efficiently glutathione disulfide. As demonstrated here, this feature is most pronounced inPlasmodium but also applies to other organisms including man, Drosophila melanogaster, and E. coli. Although thioredoxin-based GSSG reduction has been observed before for the E. coli thioredoxin system (9Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), its possible significance, especially for eukaryotic organisms, has not been adequately considered so far. Recombinant E. coli thioredoxin and human Trx as well as E. coli TrxR were kindly provided by Prof. Charles Williams, Ann Arbor, MI. Human thioredoxin was also bought from IMCO, Stockholm, Sweden. Human glutathione reductase (hGR) and P. falciparum glutathione reductase (PfGR) were produced and isolated according to Ref. 21Färber P.M. Arscott L.D. Williams Jr., C.H. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar. Human thioredoxin reductase (hTrxR) was purified from placenta (24Gromer S. Arscott L.D. Williams C.H. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20096-20101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The production and characterization of Trxs and TrxRs from insects will be reported elsewhere. The concentrations of flavoenzymes in oxidized form were determined using the maximal absorbance coefficient of protein-bound flavin (∼11.3 mm−1cm−1) at wavelengths of 463 ± 2 nm (3Becker K. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Müller S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6118-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 10Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 19Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Thus, the concentrations refer to the flavoenzyme subunit. Precast gels (12% polyacrylamide) and the protein dye assay were obtained from Bio-Rad and molecular weight standards from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Substrates for the enzymatic assays were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Serva, and Sigma, respectively. All reagents were of the highest available purity. The following data bases were used: NCBI GenBankTM Data Base, Swiss Model, TIGR Microbial Data Base, and Sanger Center. By making use of the unique BspHI restriction site 76 base pairs upstream to the stop codon of the pftrxr gene, the 3′-end of the coding region was isolated. Two partially (18 nucleotides) overlapping primers of 50 and 61 nucleotides, respectively, were used in a PCR (5 min at 94 °C, and then 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 90 s at 72 °C (35 cycles), 5 min at 72 °C, hold at 4 °C); the resulting PCR fragment contained aBspHI and a BamHI restriction site. The new 3′-coding region of the pftrxr gene is shown below. Nucleotides that were exchanged in the new construct are shown in bold letters. It should be emphasized that all mutations were silent so that the amino acid sequence of the protein was not altered by the cloning strategy: 5′ CATGAACCTGTTCGTGACCATCTCCAGCGGTCTGTCTTACGCTGCAAAAGGCGGTTGCGGTGGCGGTAAATGCGGATAA 3′. The fragment was digested with BspHI andBamHI and ligated with the p-Bluescript vector (previously digested with XbaI and BamHI) and thepftrxr insert (previously digested with XbaI andBspHI). Via PCR two additional restriction sites, aKpnI and an SalI site, were introduced into the 5′- and 3′-flanking region of the insert. After digestion withKpnI and SalI, the construct was cloned into the p-Bluescript vector and amplified in XL1-Blue cells. This intermediate construct can be employed for attaching fusion proteins to PfTrxR. After digestion with KpnI and HindIII the insert was cloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) and expressed in E. coli M-15 cells. By this strategy 22 mg of pure PfTrxR was obtained from a 1-liter cell culture. The gene of PfTrx was identified on chromosome 14 of the P. falciparum strain 3D7. Highly related but incomplete sequences were detected on chromosomes 9–11. By polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a P. falciparum 3D7cDNA library, the putative pftrxr gene was amplified. The forward primer was designed to introduce a BamHI restriction site (5′ GCGCGGATCCGTAAAAATTGTAACTAGTCAATC 3′) and the reverse primer a HindIII restriction site (5′ GCGCAAGCTTTTAAGCTGCGTATTTTTCG 3′). The hot start PCR conditions were as follows: 3 min at 95 °C, hold at 80 °C, and then 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 30 s at 72 °C (30 cycles), 2 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, hold at 4 °C. The amplified PCR product was digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes, purified, and subcloned into the expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen); the insert was then verified by sequencing. The pQE-30 vector places a hexahistidyl affinity tag at the N terminus of the recombinant protein. E. coli XL1-Blue cells were transfected with the pQE-30/pftrx plasmid. Cultures of transformed cells were grown in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C overnight. After cell harvesting, sonication, and centrifugation, the recombinant protein in the supernatant was purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. Elution of the protein from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column with an imidazole gradient was followed spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. This procedure resulted in 30 mg of pure PfTrx as judged from a silver-stained 18% SDS gel that showed a single protein band of 13 kDa. Preliminary experiments had shown that the hexahistidyl tag does not appear to influence the kinetic parameters of Trx in reactions with thioredoxin reductase and GSSG. The tagged proteins PfTrxR and PfTrx that we isolated using tag-specific chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose were found to be practically free of intrusive contaminations. Specifically, both preparations contained GR activities below the detection limits, which is less than 0.006% when compared with PfTrxR activity and PfTrx protein, respectively. In contrast, we did not succeed in purifying the untagged recombinant proteins in good yield and without significant contaminations ofE. coli thioredoxins and E. coli glutathione reductase. For quantification of P. falciparum thioredoxin in its oxidized form, the thioredoxin reductase-catalyzed reaction with 1 unit/ml enzyme was employed; the observed [NADPH] decrease (ε340 nm = 6.22 mm−1cm−1) served as a measure for the [TrxS2] originally present. On the basis of the molarity the absorbance at 280 nm was then determined; this yielded an ε280 nm of 11.7 mm−1cm−1 (corresponding to an absorbance of 0.90 of a 1 mg/ml solution) for recombinant tagged PfTrx in oxidized form. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences reported in this paper have been submitted as P. falciparum thioredoxin 1 (pftrx1) to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with the accession numbers AF202664 and AAF34541. Enzyme assays were conducted at 25 °C in a total assay volume of 1 ml. For determining TrxR activity two different assay systems were employed. (i) In the DTNB reduction assay (18Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 22Müller S. Gilberger T.W. Färber P.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Walter R.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) the enzyme was added to a mixture consisting of 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and 3 mm DTNB; after initiating the reaction with the addition of NADPH (200 μm final concentration), the increase in absorbance at 412 nm was monitored (18Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 19Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). One enzyme unit is defined as the NADPH-dependent production of 2 μmol of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (ε412 nm = 13.6 mm−1cm−1) per min. For obtaining theVmax value, the Michaelis-Menten equation with aKm of 465 μm for DTNB was applied. (ii) In the Trx assay, the mixture contained the same buffer but varying TrxS2 concentrations and 100 μm NADPH (ε340 nm = 6.22 mm−1cm−1). The reaction was started with TrxR, and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored during the linear phase. 1 enzyme unit is defined as the consumption of 1 μmol of NADPH per min. The Michaelis-Menten equation with a Km of 10.4 μm for TrxS2 was applied for obtaining the Vmax value (3100 μmol of TrxS2reduction per μmol of subunit). Under Vmaxconditions, 322 nm TrxR supports a TrxS2turnover (or flux) of 1000 μmmin−1 and a DTNB turnover of 206 μm min−1. This enzyme was assayed under the same conditions as TrxR but using GSSG as a disulfide substrate. In this assay buffer of pH 7.4, the Km value of GSSG with PfGR was determined as 100 μm and theVmax value as 9010 μmol/min GSSG reduction per μmol of enzyme subunit. 111 nm PfGR subunit (1 unit/ml under Vmax conditions) supports a substrate turnover of 1000 μm min−1. 1.0 μm (61 μg/ml) PfTrxR subunit in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, was incubated at 25 °C with 100 μm NADPH and various concentrations of GSNO ranging from 20 to 200 μm. The reaction was followed by the absorbance decrease at 340 nm (ε340 nm = 6.22 mm−1cm−1). From these data theKm value (35 μm) and the specific activity (0.15 units/mg) for GSNO reduction were determined according to Ref. 26Nikitovic D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19180-19185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar. The reversibility of the reaction NADPH + TrxS2 + H+ ⇌ Trx(SH)2 + NADP+ was employed for determining the equilibrium constant (18Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) using the absorbance change at 340 nm as a measure of NADPH oxidation with concomitant production of an equimolar amount of Trx(SH)2. The initial concentrations of NADPH (between 20 and 150 μm), NADP+ (1000 μm to 2000 μm), and TrxS2 were varied systematically. For each combination of substrate concentrations (for instance 100 μm NADPH, 2000 μmNADP+, 15.3 μm TrxS2), the resulting change in absorbance at 340 nm was converted into NADPH concentration change by using a millimolar absorbance coefficient of 6.22 mm−1cm−1. These experiments yielded an equilibrium constant of 110 ± 10 at pH 7.4 which corresponds to a difference in redox potential of 60.2 ± 2 mV. As the midpoint potential for the NADPH/NADP+ system at pH 7.4, 25 °C, and 0.26 μ ionic strength can be estimated to be −330 mV (25Lennon B.W. Williams C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4704-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the P. falciparum Trx(SH)2/TrxS2 redox pair has a redox potential of −270 mV which agrees well with the values reported for E. coli thioredoxin (9Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lennon B.W. Williams C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4704-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 5 ml of magnetically stirred incubation mixture (100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 25 °C) contained 100 μm NADPH, 21.3 μm PfTrx, 322 nm(= 1000 milliunits/ml) PfTrxR, and 100, 200, or 1000 μmGSSG, respectively. The reaction was started by adding Trx. After 15 and 30 s, 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn and added immediately to 750 μl of 50 mm HCl for protein denaturation. These solutions were then brought to a volume of 1 ml and a pH of 7.4 and assayed for free thiol groups using the DTNB method (ε412 nm of nascent nitrothiobenzoate 13.6 mm−1cm−1). It was taken into account that the reduction of GSSG (or TrxS2) leads to 2 DTNB-reactive thiols (18Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). A GSSG-free sample that was carried through the procedure served as a control. From the amount of GSH formed, the approximate glutathione disulfide reduction rate was deduced. In a second series of experiments identical conditions were used. However, the consumed NADPH and GSSG were continuously replaced from a Hamilton syringe containing 5 mm GSSG and 5 mmNADPH in phosphate buffer, for instance 41 μl/min for replacing the consumption of 41 μm/min GSSG. Aliquots were taken in 20-s intervals for 2 min. Each experiment was duplicated. In a third series of experiments PfTrxR and PfTrx were replaced by PfGR. This allowed us to estimate the GR concentration leading to equivalent GSSG reduction rates when compared with the thioredoxin system at a given GSSG concentration. For each experiment the needed GR quantity was estimated on the basis of the Michaelis-Menten equation and subsequently determined by experimental approximation. The optimal concentration giving the closest fit was then confirmed in duplicate experiments. When employing the TIGR Microbial Data base, we identified the gene of thioredoxin on chromosome 14 of the P. falciparum strain 3D7. The respective DNA sequence of 312 base pairs was cloned from a cDNA library and expressed inE. coli, and the recombinant protein was characterized as a typical thioredoxin (Table I and Fig. 2). By using the TrxR-catalyzed redox equilibrium (18Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M.

In comparison with mammalian thioredoxins, a greater similarity with cytosolic than with mitochondrial thioredoxins became evident (4Holmgren A. Arnér E.S. Eur. J.

Homology modeling using the Swiss Model program resulted in a three-dimensional structure of PfTrx representing residues Ser-9 to Ala-104 (Fig. 2).

The coordinated induction of these genes, including NQO1, protects cells against free radical damage, oxidative stress, and neoplasia. It is critical in achieving chemoprevention. Deletion mutagenesis studies of the human NQO1 gene promoter identified 24 base pairs of an antioxidant response element (ARE) between nucleotides −470 and −447. This region is required for basal expression and induction of NQO1 in response to β-naphthoflavone and t-BHQ (6Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell.

Analysis of ARE-nuclear protein complexes have identified several nuclear transcription factors including c-Jun, Jun-B, Jun-D, c-Fos, Fra1, Nrf1, Nrf2, YABP, ARE-BP1, MafK, Ah (aromatic hydrocarbon) receptor, and the estrogen receptor (15–32). Among these transcription factors, Nrf1 and Nrf2 have been shown to heterodimerize with c-Jun and up-regulate the ARE-mediated expression and induction of NQO1 in response to antioxidants and xenobiotics (26Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 31Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K.

The transcription factor Nrf2 and Nrf1, which regulate the ARE-mediated expression and induction of NQO1, were also demonstrated to regulate the expression and induction of other detoxifying enzymes such as GST Ya, γ-GCS and heme oxygenase-1 (21Alam J.

Recently, Nrf2-MafK heterodimer was shown to bind to the ARE of a gene encoding a subunit of GST Ya (32Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh K. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Nrf2-MafK heterodimers up-regulate ARE-mediated expression and induction of the GST Ya gene. More recently, a repressive role for MafK and MafG in ARE-regulated expression of the γ-GCS gene was suggested (37Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Small Maf (MafG, MafK, and MafF) proteins are leucine zipper proteins that are known to repress, as well as activate, transcription of many eukaryotic genes including β-globin gene (38Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Fujiwara K.T. Ashida K.

Their gene products are closely related to v-Maf, especially in the structure of the DNA-binding and leucine zipper domains. The products of these small Maf proteins, however, lack the amino-terminal domain of v-Maf (39Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Fujiwara K.T. Ashida K.

This domain is required for the trans-acting activity of v-Maf (39Kim M.J. Andrews N.C. Blood. 1997; 89: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Fujiwara K.T. Ashida K. Nishina H. Iba H.

Recently, small Maf proteins were shown to homodimerize and heterodimerize with Nrf1 and Nrf2 (42Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16490-16497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Maf-Maf homodimers repressed, yet Maf-Nrf heterodimers activated transcription of the MARE-regulated β-globin gene (42Marini M.G. Chan K. Casula L. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16490-16497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on the above studies, small Maf proteins are expected to play a role in hARE-mediated regulation of NQO1 gene expression. This role remains unknown. In addition, the relationship of MafG and MafK with Nrf2 and Nrf1, in the regulation of ARE-mediated expression and induction of NQO1 and other detoxifying enzyme genes, also remains unknown. In the present report, we demonstrate that overexpression of MafG and MafK, individually or in combination with Nrf2, repressed ARE-mediated expression and induction of NQO1 and GST Ya genes. NQO1 hARE gel shift assays, with in vitro translated MafG and MafK, individually and in combination with Nrf2, revealed that MafG and MafK proteins bind to the NQO1 hARE as homodimers and heterodimers with Nrf2. These results indicate that MafG and MafK homodimers and possibly MafG-Nrf2 and MafK-Nrf2 heterodimers negatively regulate NQO1 and other detoxifying enzyme gene expression and induction by antioxidants. In similar experiments, MafG and MafK failed to bind to the NQO1 gene ARE as heterodimers with Nrf1. The enzymes used in this study were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. pcDNA3.1/V-5-His-TOPO and anti-V5 antibody were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). α-Minimum essential medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Effectene transfection reagent was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The Nrf2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). t-BHQ and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The pGL2 promoter plasmid containing firefly luciferase gene, internal control plasmid pRL-TK that encodes Renillaluciferase, the dual luciferase assay kit, and the TNT T7/T3 coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane, ECL Western blot analysis kit, and Amplify NAMP1000 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The NQO1 gene ARE, mutant ARE, and GST Ya ARE were subcloned in the pGL2 vector to generate reporter plasmids pGL2-hARE-Luc, pGL2-mhARE-Luc, and pGL2-GST Ya ARE-Luc. The nucleotide sequences of the various AREs are shown in Fig. 1. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the AREs were synthesized with eitherNheI/XhoI sites (NQO1 hARE and mutant hARE) orNheI/BamHI sites (GST Ya ARE). The oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and cloned at the respective sites in the pGL2 promoter vector. The GST Ya ARE was cloned at the NheI/BglII site. The various constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. The mouse Nrf2 and Nrf1 cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Jefferson Y. Chan (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The full-length Nrf2 and Nrf1 cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned separately into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 to make the expression plasmids pcDNA-Nrf2R, pcDNA-Nrf2C, pcDNA-Nrf1R, and pcDNA-Nrf1C. The chicken MafG and MafK cDNAs were provided by Dr. Makoto Nishizawa (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The cDNAs encoding MafG and MafK were subcloned separately into the pcDNA 3.1 vector to generate the expression plasmids pcDNA-MafGR, pcDNA-MafGC, pcDNA-MafKR, and pcDNA-MafKC. The plasmids with an R suffix contain cDNAs in the reverse orientation, and those with the suffix C contain cDNAs in the correct orientation. The MafG and MafK cDNAs were also subcloned in-frame with the V5 epitope of the pcDNA 3.1 expression plasmid. These plasmids encode the V5-tagged MafG-V5 and MafK-V5 proteins. The V5 epitope contains 14 amino acids in the sequence Gly-Lys-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn-Pro-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Asp-Ser-Thr. Human hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2) cells were grown in six-well monolayer cultures containing α-minimum essential medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (25Li Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15097-15104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Effectene transfection reagent kit from Qiagen was used to perform the transfections by procedures as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 0.5 μg of reporter constructs (hARE-Luc, mutant hARE-Luc, and GST Ya ARE-Luc) were mixed, individually and in combinations, with different concentrations of the pcDNA expression plasmids (Nrf2, Nrf1, MafG, and MafK) and transfected into Hep-G2 cells. The plasmid pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase was used as the internal control in each transfection. The various plasmids were mixed with DNA condensation buffer and Enhancer solution from the kit and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. This was followed by addition of Effectene reagent to the mixture. This mixture was incubated for 7 min at room temperature. The DNA-Enhancer-Effectene mixture was added dropwise onto the Hep-G2 cells and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 48 h after the transfection, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× passive lysis buffer from the kit. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system from Promega was used to assay the samples for luciferase activity as described in the manufacturer's protocol. First, the cell lysate was assayed for the firefly luciferase activity using 100 μl of the substrate LARII. Then 100 μl of the STOP & GLO reagent was added to quench the firefly luciferase activity and activate theRenilla luciferase activity, which was also measured. The assays were carried out in a Packard luminometer, and the relative luciferase activity was calculated as follows: 100,000/activity ofRenilla luciferase (in units) × activity of firefly luciferase (in units). Each set of transfections was repeated three times. For induction studies, the cells were treated with 200 μm t-BHQ, dissolved in Me2SO for 16 h and analyzed for luciferase activity by procedures as described above. The transfection experiments were performed using pcDNA-Maf and pcDNA-Maf-V5 constructs. Both sets of expression plasmids gave similar results. The presence or absence of V5 epitope-tagged to Maf proteins had no effect on their activity/function. Therefore, we have shown transfection data only on Maf proteins without V5 tag. The addition of V5 tag to Maf proteins enabled us to use antibodies against V5 peptide in Western and band and supershift assays. The nuclear extracts from Hep-G2 (Me2SO control and t-BHQ-treated (200 μm for 16 h)) cells were prepared by previously described procedures (25Li Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15097-15104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Hep-G2 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA-Nrf2C and pcDNA-MafG-V5 in 1:1 ratio to overexpress Nrf2 and MafG-V5. These cells were treated with Me2SO and t-BHQ (200 μm for 16 h) and nuclear extract prepared by previously described procedures (25Li Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15097-15104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thein vitro transcription/translation of the plasmids encoding Nrf1, Nrf2, MafG-V5, and MafK-V5 were performed using the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) by procedures as suggested in the manufacturer's protocol. Redivuel-[35S]methionine was substituted for methionine in the reactions. After the coupled transcription/translation, the proteins were checked for their correct size on a 10% PAGE and Western analysis. Briefly, 5 μl of the translated proteins were resolved on a 10% PAGE, treated with Amplify solution (NAMP 100; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to enhance the35S signal, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. In a similar experiment, the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane and probed with Nrf2 and V5 antibodies. V5 antibodies were used to detect the V5 tagged Maf proteins. All of the in vitro translated proteins gave the expected sized products. The NQO1 gene ARE was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled ARE was incubated with nuclear extracts or in vitro translated proteins. Band and supershift assays were then performed by previously described procedures (25Li Y. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15097-15104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). 10 μg of the nuclear extract or equimolar concentrations of in vitro translated proteins were used in the gel shift and supershift experiments. The supershift assay with nuclear extracts used 20 μg of proteins. 1.5 μl of anti-V5 antibody and 3 μl of Nrf2 antibody or preimmune serum were used in the supershift assays. The transfection of Hep-G2 cells with expression plasmids pcDNA-MafG-V5, pcDNA-MafK-V5, and pcDNA-Nrf2(C) led to the overexpression of these respective proteins as determined by SDS-PAGE, Western analysis, and antibody probing (data not shown). Overexpression of the various proteins was in near linear range between 0.1 and 1.0 μg of plasmids used for transfecting Hep-G2 cells. In similar experiments, transfection of Hep-G2 cells with cDNA in reverse orientation did not result in overexpression of the respective proteins. Transfection of Hep-G2 cells with the hARE-Luc plasmid expressed luciferase activity (Fig. 2). Overexpression of MafG in Hep-G2 cells repressed hARE-mediated luciferase activity in transfected cells (Fig. 2 A, left panel). This repression was MafG concentration-dependent. The transfection of 1.0 μg of pcDNA-MafG(C) plasmid repressed 83% of hARE-mediated luciferase activity in transfected Hep-G2 cells. Interestingly, transfection of Hep-G2 cells with plasmid pcDNA-MafG(R) expressing antisense MafG RNA significantly increased the hARE-mediated luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A, left panel). The transfection of 0.5 μg of plasmid pcDNA-MafG(R) caused 3.4-fold increase in the hARE-mediated luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A, left panel). Contrary to MafG, overexpression of Nrf2 in Hep-G2 cells led to increased expression of the NQO1 gene ARE-mediated luciferase gene (Fig. 2 A). In a similar experiment, the Nrf2-mediated up-regulation of luciferase gene expression was repressed because of the overexpression of MafG (Fig. 2 A, right panel). This repression was also MafG concentration-dependent. Similar results were also observed with Hep-G2 cells overexpressing MafK alone or MafK with Nrf2 (Fig. 2 B). The overexpression of MafK repressed hARE-mediated luciferase gene expression and its activation by Nrf2. Replacement of the reporter plasmid hARE-Luc with mutant hARE-Luc resulted in the loss of basal expression and repression of the luciferase gene by MafG and MafK (Fig. 2 C). In related experiments, the overexpression of MafG and MafK also repressed GST Ya ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression and up-regulation by Nrf2 (Fig. 3). t-BHQ treatment of Hep-G2 cells, transfected with hARE-Luc and GST Ya ARE-Luc, increased luciferase gene by approximately 2-fold (Fig. 4). Interestingly, t-BHQ induction of hARE- and GST Ya ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression was also repressed in Hep-G2 cells that overexpressed MafG and MafK (Fig. 4). The repression of t-BHQ induced expression was more or less proportional to the repression of basal expression. In other words, overexpression of small Maf proteins inhibited the basal and t-BHQ induced luciferase activity equally.Figure 3Effect of overexpression of MafG and MafK on GST Ya gene ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression and its up-regulation by Nrf2. The Hep-G2 cells were co-transfected with reporter plasmid GST Ya ARE-Luc and expression plasmids pcDNA-MafG(C), pcDNA-Maf(R), pcDNA-MafK(C), pcDNA-MafK(R), and pcDNA-Nrf2(C) individually or in combinations as shown. The concentrations (μg) of the various plasmids used in the transfections are also shown. 0.01 μg of plasmid pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase was used as the internal control in each transfection. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. The values represent the means ± S.E. of three independent transfection experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effect of overexpression of MafG and MafK on antioxidant induction of ARE-mediated luciferase gene expression.The Hep-G2 cells were co-transfected with reporter plasmid hARE-Luc or GST Ya ARE-Luc and expression plasmids pcDNA-MafG(C) and pcDNA-MafK(C) in concentrations as shown. 0.01 μg of plasmid pRL-TK encoding Renilla luciferase was used as the internal control in each transfection. The transfected cells were treated with Me2SO (control) or 200 μm of t-BHQ 32 h after transfection. The cells were harvested 16 h after the treatment and assayed for luciferase activity.

SDS-PAGE analysis ofin vitro translated Nrf2, Nrf1, and V5-tagged MafG and MafK is shown in Fig. 5. The in vitro translated Nrf2 and Nrf1 proteins migrated between the 105- and 75-kDa standards. Nrf1 migrated slower than Nrf2. The in vitro translated MafG-V5 and MafK-V5 proteins moved faster than the 25-kDa molecular mass standard. MafK-V5 moved faster than MafG-V5 in SDS-PAGE. The in vitro translated proteins were confirmed by Western blotting and probing with specific antibodies (data not shown). The binding of in vitro translated MafG-V5, MafK-V5, Nrf2, and Nrf1 to the NQO1 gene ARE was determined by band and supershift assays (Fig. 6). MafG and MafK both bound to the hARE as Maf-Maf homodimers and Nrf2-Maf heterodimers (Fig. 6). The binding of homo- and heterodimers of Maf and Nrf2 were competed with cold hARE (data not shown). The presence of V-5-tagged MafG and MafK in Maf-Maf homodimers and Nrf2-Maf heterodimers were confirmed by supershift assays with anti-V5 antibodies (Fig. 6). The antibodies against Nrf2 also supershifted Nrf2-Maf heterodimers in experiments with Nrf2-MafG and Nrf2-MafK (Fig. 6) The results of band shift assays with hARE and nuclear extract from Hep-G2 cells treated with Me2SO (control) and t-BHQ are shown (Fig. 7 A). The results demonstrated two-shifted bands as observed with in vitrotranslated Nrf2 and Maf proteins (Fig. 6). The upper and lower shifted bands corresponded to the Nrf2-Maf heterodimers and Maf-Maf homodimers, respectively. It may be noteworthy that both the lower and upper bands are not exclusively due to Nrf2-Maf and Maf-Maf dimers. These bands are also expected to contain posi"

Here, we disclose the cloning of human ADNP (hADNP) from a fetal brain cDNA library. Comparative sequence analysis of these two ADNP orthologs indicated 90% identity at the mRNA level. Several single nucleotide polymorphic sites were noticed. The deduced protein structure contained nine zinc fingers, a proline-rich region, a nuclear bipartite localization signal, and a homeobox domain profile, suggesting a transcription factor function. Further comparative analysis identified an ADNP paralog (33% identity and 46% similarity), indicating that these genes belong to a novel protein family with a nine-zinc finger motif followed by a homeobox domain. The hADNP gene structure spans ∼40 kilobases and includes five exons and four introns with alternative splicing of an untranslated second exon. The hADNP gene was mapped to chromosome 20q12–13.2, a region associated with aggressive tumor growth, frequently amplified in many neoplasias, including breast, bladder, ovarian, pancreatic, and colon cancers. hADNP mRNA is abundantly expressed in distinct normal tissues, and high expression levels were encountered in malignant cells. Down-regulation of ADNP by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides up-regulated the tumor suppressor p53 and reduced the viability of intestinal cancer cells by 90%. Thus, ADNP is implicated in maintaining cell survival, perhaps through modulation of p53. We have recently cloned the mouse activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP).

Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The relative enrichment of mADNP transcripts in the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, medulla, and midbrain and the increases found in the presence of VIP, an established neuroprotective substance (2Gozes I. Fridkin M. Hill J.M. Brenneman D.E Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1019-1034PubMed Google Scholar), implied a potential function in brain metabolism. Specifically, mADNP mRNA increased 2–3-fold in astroglial cells incubated for 3 h in the presence of nanomolar amounts of VIP (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Another tissue containing increased mADNP transcripts is the mouse testis, a highly proliferative tissue, suggesting the involvement of ADNP in cell division.As deregulation of oncogenes has been associated with neurodegeneration (3Amson R. Lassalle J.M. Halley H. Prieur S. Lethrosne F. Roperch J.P. Israeli D. Gendron M.C. Duyckaerts C. Checler F. Dausset J. Cohen D. Oren M. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

VIP regulates both neuronal survival and cell division (2Gozes I. Fridkin M. Hill J.M. Brenneman D.E Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1019-1034PubMed Google Scholar). A system whereby labeled VIP is suggested as a tumor marker has been proposed, localizing in vivo tumors of patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine cancers as well as pancreatic and colonic adenocarcinomas (4Virgolini I. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 27: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Other studies have identified a very high incidence of VIP receptor binding in breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, bladder, lung, esophageal, colonic, and pancreatic tumors as well as in neuroendocrine and brain tumors (5Reubi J.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the VIP effect on cancer growth depends on the specific tumor and may be stimulatory (6Lilling G.

In view of the high incidence of tumors containing VIP receptors, a potential intervention in tumor growth may employ a gene downstream of VIP action that is directly associated with stimulation of cell proliferation and survival.This report mapped the human ADNP (hADNP) gene (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF250860) to a chromosomal region amplified in cancer, and ADNP mRNA expression was found to increase in proliferative tissues. Inhibition of ADNP protein expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in marked reduction in metabolic activity in the target cells coupled with increases in the tumor suppressor p53 (3Amson R. Lassalle J.M. Halley H. Prieur S. Lethrosne F. Roperch J.P. Israeli D. Gendron M.C. Duyckaerts C. Checler F. Dausset J. Cohen D. Oren M. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, a paralogous protein was discovered, suggesting a novel protein family containing zinc fingers and a homeobox domain.DISCUSSIONThis report characterizes the hADNP gene, encoding an mRNA that is abundantly expressed in distinct normal tissues and that may be alternatively spliced. The 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA is GC-rich, as has been recently shown for several other genes (e.g. Refs. 24Zabarovsky E.R. Gizatullin R. Podowski R.M. Zabarovska V.V. Xie L. Muravenko O.V.

Furthermore, a family including at least two genes of significant homologies is described.Based on cDNA and deduced protein sequence (12Taguchi E. Muramatsu H. Fan Q.W. Kurosawa N. Sobue G.

The thiotransferase/glutaredoxin active site (15Johnson G.P. Goebel S.J. Perkus M.E. Davis S.W. Winslow J.P. Paoletti E. Virology. 1991; 181: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found in ADNP (Fig. 1) may modulate its own DNA binding activity or that of other DNA-binding proteins in response to oxidative stress and signal transduction pathways implicated in the redox state of the cell (27Kallioniemi A. Kallioniemi O.-P. Piper J. Tanner M. Stokke T. Chen L. Smith H.S. Pinkel D. Gray J.W. Waldman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2156-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). We have previously hypothesized that mADNP is a secreted protein (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To reconcile this discrepancy, one hypothesis may involve alternate utilization of the seven putative initiator methionine residues at the N terminus of hADNP (Fig. 1), resulting in processing pathways that may yield secreted portions. An alternative hypothesis was put forward by us in a recent report suggesting the existence of a nuclear export signal within the ADNP mRNA (Fig. 1) (28Gozes, I., Zamostiano, R., Pinhasov, A., Bassan, M., Giladi, E., Steingart, R. A., and Brenneman, D. E. (2000) Ann N. Y. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in pressGoogle Scholar). A similar sequence was discovered in the engrailed transcription factor (16Maizel A. Bensaude O. Prochiantz A.

Three of these regions have been associated with established oncogenes: ERBB2 at 17q12, MYCat 8q24, and CCND1 and EMS1 at 11q13. Amplification at 20q13 occurs in a variety of tumor types, but up to date, does not involve a previously known oncogene (20Collins C. Rommens J.M. Kowbel D. Godfrey T. Tanner M. Hwang S. Polikoff D.

Another aspect of ADNP/cancer/neuroprotection interaction is the fact that ADNP and p53 expression may be interrelated, as shown here, and both proteins may influence tumor growth as well as brain function (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J.

Previously, the TBP1 gene was localized to chromosome 11p12–13 (18Hoyle J. Tan K.H. Fisher E.M. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the TBP1 gene product was associated with the cell cycle. The finding of TBP1 downstream of hADNP either may be trivial, resulting from molecular cloning manipulations, or may indicate translocation involved with cancer abnormalities.The discovery of ADNP (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J.

VIP-binding sites have been described in astrocytes (32Gozes I. Mccune S.K. Jacobson L. Warren D. Moody T.W. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In both cases, developmental functions (33Lange D. Funa K. Ishisaki A. Bauer R. Wollina U. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 821-825PubMed Google Scholar, 34Gressens P. Hill J.M. Gozes I. Fridkin M.

The homeobox-containing protein ADNP may thus mediate some of the VIP developmental/survival-associated effects involving normal growth and cancer proliferation. The abundance of ADNP mRNA in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta may represent, in part, an astrocyte-like cell population (38Buniatian G. Gebhardt R. Traub P. Mecke D. Osswald H. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or enrichment in blood microvessels (39Said S.I. Mutt V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Indeed, the original characterization of VIP was as a vasodilator (40Lee T.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 16-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and since endothelial cells play a major role in vasodilatation, endothelial ADNP points toward a new avenue for research on potential VIP/ADNP interactions.Our original findings related ADNP to VIP-mediated neuroprotection. Thus, ADNP mRNA increased in glial cells incubated with VIP, and a very short peptide fragment derived from ADNP (NAPVSIPQ, termed NAP) provided potent neuroprotection (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Given the abundant expression of ADNP, future experiments are aimed at further assessing the question of general normal cell protection and of secreted processed forms of ADNP providing cellular protection against external toxicity. The increased ADNP mRNA expression in the cerebellum (a structure enriched in VIP-binding sites) (41Hill J.M. Lee S.J. Dibbern D.A. Fridkin M. Gozes I. Brenneman D.E. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggests a further avenue of research dealing with tissue-specific expression and function.From a clinical perspective, this report provides methods of using hADNP nucleic acid probes to detect and identify pathologically proliferating cells, including cancer cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that ADNP is important for cell survival, and the antisense ADNP oligodeoxynucleotides may be developed as antitumor therapeutics. Mouse activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (mADNP),1 a novel vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-responsive gene, was recently cloned (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The relative enrichment of mADNP transcripts in the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, medulla, and midbrain and the increases found in the presence of VIP, an established neuroprotective substance (2Gozes I. Fridkin M. Hill J.M. Brenneman D.E Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1019-1034PubMed Google Scholar), implied a potential function in brain metabolism. Specifically, mADNP mRNA increased 2–3-fold in astroglial cells incubated for 3 h in the presence of nanomolar amounts of VIP (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Another tissue containing increased mADNP transcripts is the mouse testis, a highly proliferative tissue, suggesting the involvement of ADNP in cell division. As deregulation of oncogenes has been associated with neurodegeneration (3Amson R. Lassalle J.M. Halley H. Prieur S. Lethrosne F. Roperch J.P. Israeli D. Gendron M.C. Duyckaerts C. Checler F. Dausset J. Cohen D. Oren M. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5346-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), pathways that regulate neuronal survival may impinge upon cancer proliferation. VIP regulates both neuronal survival and cell division (2Gozes I. Fridkin M. Hill J.M. Brenneman D.E Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1019-1034PubMed Google Scholar). A system whereby labeled VIP is suggested as a tumor marker has been proposed, localizing in vivo tumors of patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine cancers as well as pancreatic and colonic adenocarcinomas (4Virgolini I. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 27: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Other studies have identified a very high incidence of VIP receptor binding in breast, ovarian, endometrial, prostate, bladder, lung, esophageal, colonic, and pancreatic tumors as well as in neuroendocrine and brain tumors (5Reubi J.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the VIP effect on cancer growth depends on the specific tumor and may be stimulatory (6Lilling G. Wollman Y. Goldstein M.N. Rubinraut S. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1995; 5: 231-239Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Zia H. Hida T. Jakowlew S. Birrer M. Gozes Y. Reubi J.C. Fridkin M. Gozes I. Moody T.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3486-3489PubMed Google Scholar) or inhibitory (8Maruno K. Absood A. Said S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In view of the high incidence of tumors containing VIP receptors, a potential intervention in tumor growth may employ a gene downstream of VIP action that is directly associated with stimulation of cell proliferation and survival. This report mapped the human ADNP (hADNP) gene (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF250860) to a chromosomal region amplified in cancer, and ADNP mRNA expression was found to increase in proliferative tissues. Inhibition of ADNP protein expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in marked reduction in metabolic activity in the target cells coupled with increases in the tumor suppressor p53 (3Amson R. Lassalle J.M. Halley H. Prieur S. Lethrosne F. Roperch J.P. Israeli D. Gendron M.C. Duyckaerts C. Checler F. Dausset J. Cohen D. Oren M. Telerman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5346-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a paralogous protein was discovered, suggesting a novel protein family containing zinc fingers and a homeobox domain. DISCUSSIONThis report characterizes the hADNP gene, encoding an mRNA that is abundantly expressed in distinct normal tissues and that may be alternatively spliced. The 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA is GC-rich, as has been recently shown for several other genes (e.g. Refs. 24Zabarovsky E.R. Gizatullin R. Podowski R.M. Zabarovska V.V. Xie L. Muravenko O.V.

Furthermore, a family including at least two genes of significant homologies is described.Based on cDNA and deduced protein sequence (12Taguchi E. Muramatsu H. Fan Q.W. Kurosawa N. Sobue G.

The thiotransferase/glutaredoxin active site (15Johnson G.P. Goebel S.J. Perkus M.E. Davis S.W. Winslow J.P. Paoletti E. Virology. 1991; 181: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found in ADNP (Fig. 1) may modulate its own DNA binding activity or that of other DNA-binding proteins in response to oxidative stress and signal transduction pathways implicated in the redox state of the cell (27Kallioniemi A. Kallioniemi O.-P. Piper J. Tanner M. Stokke T. Chen L. Smith H.S. Pinkel D. Gray J.W. Waldman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2156-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). We have previously hypothesized that mADNP is a secreted protein (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To reconcile this discrepancy, one hypothesis may involve alternate utilization of the seven putative initiator methionine residues at the N terminus of hADNP (Fig. 1), resulting in processing pathways that may yield secreted portions. An alternative hypothesis was put forward by us in a recent report suggesting the existence of a nuclear export signal within the ADNP mRNA (Fig. 1) (28Gozes, I., Zamostiano, R., Pinhasov, A., Bassan, M., Giladi, E., Steingart, R.

Three of these regions have been associated with established oncogenes: ERBB2 at 17q12, MYCat 8q24, and CCND1 and EMS1 at 11q13. Amplification at 20q13 occurs in a variety of tumor types, but up to date, does not involve a previously known oncogene (20Collins C. Rommens J.M. Kowbel D. Godfrey T. Tanner M. Hwang S. Polikoff D.

Another aspect of ADNP/cancer/neuroprotection interaction is the fact that ADNP and p53 expression may be interrelated, as shown here, and both proteins may influence tumor growth as well as brain function (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J.

Previously, the TBP1 gene was localized to chromosome 11p12–13 (18Hoyle J. Tan K.H. Fisher E.M. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the TBP1 gene product was associated with the cell cycle. The finding of TBP1 downstream of hADNP either may be trivial, resulting from molecular cloning manipulations, or may indicate translocation involved with cancer abnormalities.The discovery of ADNP (1Bassan M.

VIP-binding sites have been described in astrocytes (32Gozes I. Mccune S.K. Jacobson L. Warren D. Moody T.W. Fridkin M. Brenneman D.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Neurosci. 1997; 9: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) functions have been hypothesized. The homeobox-containing protein ADNP may thus mediate some of the VIP developmental/survival-associated effects involving normal growth and cancer proliferation. The abundance of ADNP mRNA in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta may represent, in part, an astrocyte-like cell population (38Buniatian G. Gebhardt R. Traub P. Mecke D. Osswald H. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or enrichment in blood microvessels (39Said S.I. Mutt V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Indeed, the original characterization of VIP was as a vasodilator (40Lee T.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 16-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and since endothelial cells play a major role in vasodilatation, endothelial ADNP points toward a new avenue for research on potential VIP/ADNP interactions.Our original findings related ADNP to VIP-mediated neuroprotection. Thus, ADNP mRNA increased in glial cells incubated with VIP, and a very short peptide fragment derived from ADNP (NAPVSIPQ, termed NAP) provided potent neuroprotection (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Given the abundant expression of ADNP, future experiments are aimed at further assessing the question of general normal cell protection and of secreted processed forms of ADNP providing cellular protection against external toxicity.

The homeobox-containing protein ADNP may thus mediate some of the VIP developmental/survival-associated effects involving normal growth and cancer proliferation. The abundance of ADNP mRNA in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and placenta may represent, in part, an astrocyte-like cell population (38Buniatian G. Gebhardt R. Traub P. Mecke D. Osswald H. Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 675-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or enrichment in blood microvessels (39Said S.I. Mutt V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 28: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Indeed, the original characterization of VIP was as a vasodilator (40Lee T.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 16-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and since endothelial cells play a major role in vasodilatation, endothelial ADNP points toward a new avenue for research on potential VIP/ADNP interactions. Our original findings related ADNP to VIP-mediated neuroprotection. Thus, ADNP mRNA increased in glial cells incubated with VIP, and a very short peptide fragment derived from ADNP (NAPVSIPQ, termed NAP) provided potent neuroprotection (1Bassan M. Zamostiano R. Davidson A. Pinhasov A. Giladi E. Perl O. Bassan H. Blat C. Gibney G. Glazner G. Brenneman D.E. Gozes I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1283-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Given the abundant expression of ADNP, future experiments are aimed at further assessing the question of general normal cell protection and of secreted processed forms of ADNP providing cellular protection against external toxicity. The increased ADNP mRNA expression in the cerebellum (a structure enriched in VIP-binding sites) (41Hill J.M. Lee S.J. Dibbern D.A. Fridkin M. Gozes I. Brenneman D.E. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggests a further avenue of research dealing with tissue-specific expression and function. From a clinical perspective, this report provides methods of using hADNP nucleic acid probes to detect and identify pathologically proliferating cells, including cancer cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that ADNP is important for cell survival, and the antisense ADNP oligodeoxynucleotides may be developed as antitumor therapeutics.

https://openalex.org/W2078721878,"Both β2- and β3-adrenergic receptors (ARs) are able to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. We previously showed that c-Src is required for ERK activation by β2AR and that it is recruited to activated β2AR through binding of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain to proline-rich regions of the adapter protein β-arrestin1. Despite the absence of sites for phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding, ERK activation by β3AR still requires c-Src. Agonist activation of β2AR, but not β3AR, led to redistribution of green fluorescent protein-tagged β-arrestin to the plasma membrane. In β-arrestin-deficient COS-7 cells, β-agonist-dependent co-precipitation of c-Src with the β2AR required exogenous β-arrestin, but activated β3AR co-precipitated c-Src in the absence or presence of β-arrestin. ERK activation and Src co-precipitation with β3AR also occurred in adipocytes in an agonist-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Protein interaction studies show that the β3AR interacts directly with the SH3 domain of Src through proline-rich motifs (PXXP) in the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl terminus. ERK activation and Src co-precipitation were abolished in cells expressing point mutations in these PXXP motifs.

G protein-coupled receptor mitogen-activated protein β2/β3-adrenergic receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinase pertussis toxin GPCR kinase Src homology 3 glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein During the past several years, transmembrane signaling traffic through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 has grown from the classic G protein effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and phospholipases to include novel mechanisms for activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades. These signaling systems typically involve receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases as scaffolds and intermediaries (1Koch W. Hawes B. Allen L. Lefkowitz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

(2000) Science's STKEww.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans; 2000/40/rel.Google Scholar). An example of this flexibility in GPCR signaling includes the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR). Although this receptor is classically known to couple to Gs and stimulate adenylyl cyclase, it can also activate the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway (7Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

In some cell types, the β2AR activates ERK through its coupling to a PTX-sensitive Gi protein and subsequent Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation (7Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

In exploring the mechanisms of β2AR-stimulated MAP kinase activation, we have found that some of the same signaling molecules required for receptor desensitization can also be intimately involved in the activation of the MAP kinase cascade. Following agonist activation, most GPCRs are phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs), with subsequent binding of β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor serving to interdict G protein coupling and signal transduction (5Lefkowitz R.J.

However, in addition to its role in desensitization, β-arrestin can also participate in the events leading to MAP kinase activation. Binding of β-arrestin1 to the agonist-activated β2AR rapidly recruits c-Src to the receptor (12Lin F. Krueger K. Kendall H. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z. Pitcher J. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol.

This recruitment appears to be mediated by an interaction between the amino-terminal proline-rich region of β-arrestin1 and the SH3 domain of c-Src (13Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Rocca G.J.D. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 15Miller W.E.

The β3AR is a member of the βAR subfamily of GPCRs that is expressed predominantly in adipocytes. Because selective β3AR agonists have been shown to prevent or even reverse obesity and diabetes in various animal models (16Himms-Hagen J. Cui J. Danforth Jr., E. Taatjes D.J. Lang S.S. Waters B.L.

Sci. 1998; 60: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), increased attention has been focused upon the molecular and physiological regulation of this receptor as a therapeutic target (19Collins, S., and Surwit, R. S. (2000) Recent Prog. Horm. Res., in press.Google Scholar). Early studies of β-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase in adipocytes by Rodbell and colleagues (20Cooper D. Schlegel W. Lin M. Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8927-8931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated the presence of a PTX-sensitive component. In examining this issue, we showed that this effect is due to the presence of the adipocyte-specific β3AR and its ability to simultaneously couple to both Gs and Gi, leading to the activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and ERK1/2 pathways, respectively (9Soeder K.S.

Because GRK-mediated phosphorylation is necessary for β-arrestin binding (reviewed in Ref. 21Freedman N. Lefkowitz R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar), but the β3AR lacks sites for phosphorylation (22Liggett S. Freedman N.J. Schwinn D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we concluded that the β3AR must employ a novel mechanism of ERK activation. Here, we demonstrate that conserved proline-rich motifs in the third intracellular loop and carboxyl terminus of the β3AR directly recruit c-Src in a β3AR agonist- and PTX-sensitive manner. This interaction occurs specifically through the SH3 domain of c-Src. Our findings establish a new mechanism whereby some GPCRs can acquire ligand-induced tyrosine kinase activity by means of direct recruitment of Src kinases. -The β3AR agonist CL316,243 was a gift from American Cyanamid Co.

For plasmids Xa-2-Loop3 (Wt), Xa-2-Tail (Wt), Xa-2-MutL1 (L1), and Xa-2-MutT1 (T1), the wild-type or mutated third intracellular domain (amino acids 222–289) or the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 344–400) of mouse β3AR were cloned into PinPoint Xa-2 vector at HindIII and BglII sites under the control of the SV40 promoter. All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. GST fusion proteins of c-Src containing either the SH3 and SH2 domains (GST-SH3/SH2) or the SH2 domain alone (GST-SH2) were prepared as described previously (23Luttrell L.

Cells were transfected with HA-β3AR DNA (2 μg for T1/2 cells; 1 μg for COS-7 cells) and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). For T1/2, on day 2 cells were induced to differentiate (1 μmrosiglitazone, 0.1 μm LGD1069, 200 nminsulin). Prior to each analysis, the density of receptor per cell was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. MAP kinase assays were performed as previously detailed (9Soeder K.S. Snedden S.K. Cao W.

Where indicated, some cells were treated with PTX (100 ng/ml, 16 h) propranolol (0.1 μm, 5 min), CL316,243 (10 μm), or isoproterenol (10 μm, 5 min). cAMP levels in whole cells were measured as described previously (9Soeder K.S.

Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63X 1.4 numerical aperture water immersion lens, and fluorescent signals were collected (14Barak L.S.

Three independent experiments were performed, and 10 or more fields/sample were analyzed in each experiment. The biotinylated fusion proteins for the wild-type or mutated Xa-2-β3AR Loop3 or Xa-2-β3AR Tail were expressed and purified (Promega). For in vitro binding, 2 μg of purified biotinylated fusion protein was mixed with 4 μg of GST-Src-SH3/2 or GST-Src-SH2 fusion proteins and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After 16 h at 4 °C, the reactions were terminated by washing the immobilized complexes with 30 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% glycerol and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The supernatant was removed, and 50 μl of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added to each reaction. The biotinylated proteins were resolved by 4–20% SDS-acrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (Novagen), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and identified by staining with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Immunoprecipitations of HA-tagged β2AR and β3AR from intact cells and immunoblotting for co-precipitated proteins were performed as described previously (25Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T.

Activation of the Ras-dependent ERK cascade by many GPCRs requires Src kinase activity (13Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Rocca G.J.D. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). For the β2AR, ERK activation depends on the delivery of β-arrestin-bound c-Src to the receptor (13Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Rocca G.J.D. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether other GPCRs utilize this same mechanism. As shown in Fig. 1, β3AR-mediated ERK activation similarly requires Src kinase activity, as demonstrated by its concentration-dependent sensitivity to the Src-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP2. Complete inhibition was achieved within the range of 1 to 5 μm; a concentration previously established to selectively inhibit Src kinase (8Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9572-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 26Yoshizumi M. Abe J.-i. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Inhibition of β3AR-mediated ERK activation was also observed when the C-terminal Src kinase was co-expressed with β3AR (data not shown). Because GRK-mediated phosphorylation of receptors is necessary for β-arrestin binding (21Freedman N. Lefkowitz R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar), but the β3AR is not phosphorylated by GRKs, we hypothesized that agonist stimulation of β3AR would not lead to β-arrestin binding. This hypothesis is confirmed as illustrated in Fig. 2, which compares the effects of agonist stimulation on the cellular distribution of a chimeric β-arrestin 2-GFP in HEK-293 cells expressing either the human β2AR or the mouse β3AR. Isoprenaline (10 μm) stimulation of the β2AR promotes the rapid translocation of β-arrestin 2-GFP from a diffuse cytosolic distribution to the plasma membrane where it aggregates with the receptor in membrane-associated puncta (14Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In contrast, stimulation of cells expressing the mouse β3AR with the selective β3AR agonist CL316,243 (5 μm) fails to induce β-arrestin 2-GFP translocation. Thus, although β3AR-stimulated ERK activation is Src-dependent, similar to the β2AR, the β3AR response occurs without the formation of complexes between β3AR and β-arrestin.Figure 2Stimulation of β2AR, but not β3AR, results in recruitment of β-arrestin 2-GFP to the plasma membrane.Cells expressing HA epitope-tagged β2AR (upper panel) or β3AR (lower panel) and β-arrestin 2-GFP chimera were stimulated for 10 min with 10 μm isoproterenol or 5 μm CL316,243, respectively. The subcellular distribution of β-arrestin 2-GFP before (left panels) and after (right panels) agonist stimulation was determined by laser confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (13Luttrell L.M.

Frames shown are from 1 of 3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We previously showed that c-Src interacts with proline-containing motifs in the β-arrestin amino terminus and the SH3 domain of c-Src, although the c-Src catalytic domain also contributes significantly to this binding (13Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Rocca G.J.D. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the β3AR does not recruit β-arrestin, all species homologues of this receptor contain highly conserved proline residues in both the third intracellular domain and the carboxyl terminus that are completely absent from the β2AR. Two of these proline clusters in each domain contain the sequence PXXP, which represents the minimal consensus motif for SH3 domain binding (27Yu H. Chen J.K. Feng S. Dalgarno D.C. Brauer A.W. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 933-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 28Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D.

A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that these proline-rich motifs within the β3AR might directly recruit SH3 domain-containing proteins to the receptor, obviating the need for β-arrestin to function as an adapter protein. First, we determined whether β3AR could directly recruit Src kinases to activate the ERK pathway in the absence or presence of over-expressed β-arrestin in COS-7 cells, which express little endogenous β-arrestin (30Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 (lanes 1–3), agonist treatment resulted in the detectable co-precipitation of c-Src with the β2AR only in the presence of co-expressed β-arrestin. As expected from earlier studies (13Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Rocca G.J.D. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar), the provision of β-arrestin dramatically enhanced β2AR-mediated ERK phosphorylation under these conditions. In contrast, the expression of β-arrestin had no effect on responses mediated by the β3AR. Robust β3AR agonist-dependent co-precipitation of c-Src and ERK1/2 activation was observed, which did not require the presence of β-arrestin (lanes 4–6). Src that co-precipitated with β2AR and β3AR was also in its activated (dephosphorylated) state. Second, because the physiological site of expression of the β3AR is the adipocyte, a key question is whether the β3AR directly recruits Src kinase in adipocytes as observed in COS-7 cells. We performed similar co-precipitation experiments in the mouse white adipocyte cell line, C3H10T1/2 (31Lehmann J.M. Lenhard J.M. Oliver B.B. Ringold G.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 4 A, by day 4 of differentiation, C3H10T1/2 cells express the adipocyte-specific genes β3AR and the fatty acid-binding protein aP2 (32Hunt C.R. Ro J.H.-S. Dobson D.E. Min H.Y.

Fig. 4 B shows that the β3AR-selective agonist CL316,243 is capable of triggering ERK activation in both nontransfected (NT) cells (via the endogenous β3AR), and in the HA-mβ3AR transfected cells, but ERK activation was abolished by inactivation of Gi with PTX. Fig. 4 C shows that, as observed in COS-7 cells, Src kinase co-precipitates with the HA-β3AR in C3H10T1/2 adipocytes, and this interaction is both agonist- and Gi-dependent. These results taken together indicate that the β3AR can mediate the β-arrestin-independent recruitment of c-Src. To address whether binding between proline-rich motifs in the β3AR and the c-Src SH3 domain might be responsible for this interaction, we first tested whether peptides derived from these regions of the β3AR, as shown in Fig. 5 A, would bind to GST-Src fusion proteins in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5 B, biotinylated fusion proteins derived from both the third intracellular domain (Loop3) and the carboxyl terminus (Tail) of the wild-type β3AR bound to the GST-Src SH3/SH2 but not to the GST-Src SH2 fusion protein. There was no interaction with GST alone. Consistent with an SH3 domain-mediated interaction, mutants of the β3AR Loop3 (L1) and Tail (T1) peptides in which Ser was substituted for Pro in the PXXP motifs were no longer able to interact with the GST-Src SH3/SH2 peptide. In addition, we found that the wild-type β3AR Loop3 and Tail peptides could precipitate endogenous c-Src and Grb2 from whole cell lysates of HEK-293 cells (not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that proline-rich motifs in both Loop3 and the Tail of the β3AR possess the capacity to bind SH3 domains. To assess the functional role of the β3AR proline-rich motifs in Src-dependent activation of the ERK cascade, mutant β3ARs were constructed in which these motifs were disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis. Mouse β3ARs containing the L1, L2 (a deletion of Loop3 amino acids Ser-242 to Pro-266), or T1 mutations were expressed in COS-7 cells and assayed for the ability to co-precipitate endogenous c-Src and to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cAMP production. As shown in Fig. 6, mutation or deletion of the PXXP motifs in either the third intracellular loop or the carboxyl terminus resulted in a striking dissociation of β3AR-mediated c-Src binding and ERK activation from β3AR-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Fig. 6 A shows that endogenous c-Src co-precipitated with wild-type β3AR in an agonist-dependent manner, whereas co-precipitation of c-Src with each of the mutant receptors was markedly impaired. Similar effects were observed for β3AR-mediated ERK1/2 activation, which was abolished by the L1, L2, and T1 mutations (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, β3AR-mediated production of cAMP was completely unaffected by disruption of the PXXP motifs (Fig. 6 E). These data suggest that the ability of the β3AR to mediate Src-dependent activation of the ERK cascade, but not its ability to interact with Gs protein and stimulate the cAMP pathway, is dependent upon the integrity of the PXXP motifs in the third intracellular domain and the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. Each of these motifs is sufficient to bind to Src-GST SH3 domains in vitro, and site-directed mutagenesis of either motif prevents the agonist-dependent formation of complexes between the β3AR and c-Src when the mutant receptors are expressed in intact cells. The apparent necessity for intact PXXP motifs in both the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl terminus of the β3AR for agonist-dependent Src co-precipitation and functional ERK activation is not clear, but it implies that a novel multimeric complex containing at least activated c-Src and two domains of the β3AR is formed on the receptor itself to trigger this signaling cascade. However, the exact nature of this complex is unknown, and the stoichiometry of the receptor-Src interaction will require further mutagenesis and structural analysis. The distinct strategies employed by the β2AR and β3AR to recruit Src kinases illustrate the flexibility that characterizes the mechanisms of G protein coupling, agonist-induced receptor sequestration, and activation of tyrosine protein kinases by heptahelical receptors. In the case of the β2AR, G protein coupling and ERK activation occur sequentially. Src recruitment requires β-arrestin binding, an event that simultaneously terminates receptor-G protein coupling and triggers removal of the receptor from the cell surface. In contrast, the β3AR is expressed in adipocytes where it is stimulated by norepinephrine in response to the requirement for fuel mobilization and heat generation (34Strosberg A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 421-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Given its physiologic role, there is little apparent need for β3AR desensitization, particularly in times of chronic stimulation such as exposure to cold. There is increasing evidence that the coincident activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and MAP kinase pathways could have important consequences for energy balance (35Hu E. Kim J.B.

XAP2 was originally identified as the hepatitis B virus protein X-associated protein in yeast two-hybrid studies (15Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.S. Inouye C. Yang W.M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).

Plasmid pSG5/XAP2 was constructed by subcloning an EcoRI fragment of XAP2 from pGEM/XAP2 into theEcoRI site of pSG5 (Stratagene). For construction of the pCMV2/FLAG-XAP2, a DNA fragment encoding full-length XAP2 and containing HindIII and NheI restriction sites was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the pGEM/XAP2 vector as a template (primers: 5′-CGAAGCTTATGGCGGATATCATCGCAAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCTAGCTATGGGAGAAGATCC-3′). Following digestion withHindIII and NheI, the polymerase chain reaction product was inserted into HindIII-XbaI-digested pCMV2/FLAG (Kodak) in-frame with the FLAG epitope.

The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin expression plasmid, pMT123, was kindly provided by Dirk Bohmann (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany). In vitro translation of the dioxin receptor and XAP2 was performed using coupled transcription/translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

The ATP-regeneration system used in some experiments consisted of 5 mm ATP (Sigma), 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), and 15 nm phosphocreatinine (Sigma). HeLa and COS7 cells were routinely propagated in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C at 5% CO2. For intracellular localization assays, cells were grown on 20 × 20-mm glass coverslips in 30-mm diameter dishes. Transient transfections were performed by introducing 0.5 μg of plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused dioxin receptor, various receptor chimeras, and/or XAP2 into cells by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The total concentrations of DNA were kept constant by compensation with empty expression vectors. After transfection, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium for 24–30 h, and the cells were treated with TCDD (Chemsyn, Lenexa, KS), geldanamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), or combinations thereof, as detailed in the figure legends. The intracellular localization of GFP fusion proteins was monitored using a Nikon LABOPHOT microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-filter set and a camera. Quantitative evaluations of green fluorescing cells were performed as described (22Kallio P.J. Okamoto K., S., O.B. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ylikomi T. Bocquel M.T. Berry M. Gronmeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were classified into four categories according to the intracellular localization of GFP fusion proteins: C > N, for predominantly cytoplasmic fluorescence; C = N, when fluorescing proteins were equally distributed both in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus; N < C, for nuclear dominant fluorescence, and, N, for exclusive nuclear fluorescence. On average, 200 fluorescing cells were routinely evaluated on each coverslip. For ubiquitination assays, COS7 cells were grown in 10-cm diameter dishes. GST-tagged dioxin receptor (4 μg), HA-tagged ubiquitin (4 μg), and various amounts of FLAG-XAP2 (2–8 μg) were transiently expressed by using LipofectAMINE. Cells were treated with MG132 (Calbiochem), TCDD, geldanamycin, or combinations, as indicated in the figure legends. To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and lysed for 20 min on ice in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 0.5% sodium deoxycolate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with a protease inhibitor coctail (“Complete-Mini,” Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 25 μm MG132, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. 600–800 μg of total celllular protein was incubated with anti-GST (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by adding 40 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by incubation at 4 °C under slow rotation. After rapid centrifugation, the resulting pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of cold RIPA buffer. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immobilized proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse anti-HA (F-7) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech), diluted 1:500 in blocking solution (5% of nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antiserum (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as a secondary antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, 2% Tween 20, the dioxin receptor-ubiquitin conjugates were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To analyze total GST-dioxin receptor and FLAG-XAP2 protein levels in cells, 25 μg of whole cell extract protein was used for immunoblot assays. Rabbit polyclonal anti-dioxin receptor antibodies (Biomol) diluted 1:500 were used to detect the dioxin receptor fusion proteins, and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) diluted by 1:1000 were used to detect FLAG-tagged XAP2. Ligand-dependent activation of the dioxin receptor markedly enhances the turnover of the receptor protein by increasing dioxin receptor ubiquitination (24Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol.

Given the background that XAP2 has been reported to stabilize dioxin receptor protein levels (16Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 18LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we examined whether XAP2 interferes with the ubiquitination process of the dioxin receptor. In these experiments, COS7 cells were transiently co-transfected with expression vectors encoding GST-tagged dioxin receptor, HA-tagged ubiquitin, or FLAG-tagged XAP2 or with FLAG peptide alone. The cells were subsequently incubated in the absence or presence of 10 nmdioxin (TCDD) and 7.5 μm of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 before whole cell extracts were prepared. GST-dioxin receptor protein levels were increased in the presence of XAP2, as assessed by immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts using anti-dioxin receptor antibodies (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 1 and 2 to 3–8). It is noteworthy that, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, dioxin receptor protein levels remained unaffected upon ligand treatment. To monitor the levels of dioxin receptor ubiquitination, GST-dioxin receptor was immunoprecipitated with anti-GST antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the GST-dioxin receptor was efficiently ubiquitinated both in the presence and absence of ligand (upper panel, compare lanes 1, 2, and 9). Upon treatment of the cells with TCDD, we observed an increase in high molecular weight GST-dioxin receptor-ubiquitin conjugates. Strikingly, co-expression of XAP2 markedly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner the levels of ubiquitinated GST-dioxin receptor complexes both in the absence or presence of ligand (Fig. 1 B, upper panel, lanes 3–8). In excellent agreement with our observations using unfractionated whole cell extracts (Fig. 1 A), we detected an increase in dioxin receptor protein levels when we re-analyzed the precipitated material with anti-dioxin receptor antibodies (Fig. 1 B, lower panel,lanes 1–8). Under very similar experimental conditions, we also observed XAP2-dependent protection against ubiquitination of GAL4-dioxin receptor fusion proteins (data not shown). Interestingly, in the absence of XAP2, ligand-dependent ubiquitination of the GAL4-dioxin receptor was more prominent as compared with ubiquitination of the GST-dioxin receptor fusion protein, indicating that the GST moiety by itself may partially stabilize the receptor. In conclusion, these experiments strongly suggest that XAP2 protects the dioxin receptor against ubiquitination, resulting in stabilized dioxin receptor levels both in the presence or absence of ligand. Although our results indicate that XAP2 protects both the non-activated and ligand-activated dioxin receptor forms against ubiquitination, it has been reported that XAP2 is not associated with the ligand-activated dioxin receptor-Arnt complex (5Carver L.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This complex, in turn, is targeted for degradation by ligand-dependent ubiquitination (24Ma Q. Baldwin K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 26Davarinos N.A. Pollenz R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28708-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These data suggest that XAP2 may be involved in regulation of additional steps of the ligand-dependent dioxin receptor activation pathway. For instance, it is plausible that the XAP2-dependent decrease in dioxin receptor ubiquitination levels may be caused by a stabilization of the non-activated form of the receptor. We have earlier observed that the hsp90 chaperone complex is an important determinant of the subcellular compartmentalization of the dioxin receptor. 2A. Kazlauskas, L. Poellinger, and J. Pongratz, manuscript in preparation. We therefore examined the effect of XAP2 on ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation of the dioxin receptor. To this end, the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor was monitored by fluorescence microscopy upon transfection of HeLa cells with GFP-dioxin receptor constructs. For quantitative purposes, about 200 green fluorescent cells were routinely classified into four categories: C > N, predominantly cytoplasmic flouorescence; C = N, equal distribution in both the cytoplasm and nucleus; C < N, predominantly nuclear fluorescence; and N, exclusively nuclear localization (22Kallio P.J. Okamoto K., S., O.B. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ylikomi T. Bocquel M.T. Berry M. Gronmeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Representative images of green fluorescent cells and the statistical evaluation of the subcellular distribution of GFP-dioxin receptor are presented in Fig. 2, A andB, respectively. In untreated cells, the GFP-dioxin receptor fusion protein was homogeneously distributed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of the cell. Upon treatment of cells with 10 nm TCDD for 2 h, we observed a very distinct accumulation of the receptor within the cell nucleus with very low or no detectable levels of cytoplasmic fluorescence by the GFP-dioxin receptor (Fig. 2 A). Remarkably, co-expression of XAP2 resulted in a marked redistribution of the compartmentalization of the dioxin receptor. In the absence of ligand, the majority of the transfected cells (>90%) showed an exclusively cytoplasmic localization of the GFP-dioxin receptor (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, XAP2 produced a similar redistribution pattern of GFP-dioxin receptor in COS7 cells (data not shown), indicating that this effect is not cell type- specific. Consistent with these observations, the XAP2 homologue ARA9 has recently been reported to induce a similar cytoplasmic re-distribution of dioxin receptor in COS1 cells, as assessed by immunocytochemical techniques (18LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Upon ligand treatment of HeLa cells transiently expressing both XAP2 and GFP-dioxin receptor, we observed a very pronounced delay in nuclear accumulation of the receptor (Fig. 2 B, compareupper and lower panels). In control cells (i.e. in the absence of overexpressed XAP2), ligand treatment induced a rapid accumulation of the GFP-dioxin receptor in the nucleus, inducing predominating nuclear (category C < N) or exclusively nuclear (category N) localization of the receptor in the majority (60 to 80%) of the cells within 1–2 h of treatment (Fig. 2,A and B, upper panel). In contrast, in the presence of coexpressed XAP2, nuclear accumulation of the dioxin receptor was significantly delayed, yielding in the majority of cells an equally cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution pattern (category C = N) of the GFP-dioxin receptor even after prolonged (8 h) ligand treatment (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). In this context it was interesting to note that, in the absence of overexpressed XAP2, we observed a gradual decrease in the fluorescence of the GFP-dioxin receptor in the nucleus. Thus, in cells treated with TCDD for longer time periods than 8 h we were able to detect only a few weakly green fluorescing cells, all of them displaying an exclusively nuclear localization of the receptor. However, in the presence of transiently expressed XAP2, we did not observe any decrease in fluorescence of the dioxin receptor, even if the cells were treated for up to 12 h with ligand (data not shown). These results are in excellent agreement with the model that ligand treatment enhances the turnover of the dioxin receptor, and that XAP2 stabilizes dioxin receptor protein levels. Taken together, these data indicate that XAP2 mediates in living cells cytoplasmic retention of the dioxin, resulting in a significant delay in nuclear accumulation of the ligand-activated form of receptor. As schematically outlined in Fig. 3 A, the dioxin receptor contains an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the DNA-binding bHLH domain, whereas the C-terminal half of the PAS domain (spanning the PAS-B motif) harbors the minimal ligand and hsp90-binding domain. It has recently been shown that the association of XAP2 with the dioxin receptor requires both the PAS-B motif and the region between the PAS-A and PAS-B motifs (16Meyer B.K. Perdew G.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To identify the functional motifs of the dioxin receptor mediating XAP2-dependent cytoplasmic retention, we used GFP fusion proteins spanning various deletion mutants of the dioxin receptor. GRDBD/DR 83–805-GFP lacks the bHLH domain of the dioxin receptor and thus its endogenous NLS motif (Fig. 3 A). In this construct the bHLH domain was replaced with a fragment of the glucocorticoid receptor spanning the DNA-binding domain, an NLS motif (NL1 (27Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar)), and N-terminal structures except the N-terminal transactivation domain. In analogy to the wild-type dioxin receptor, the GRDBD/DR 83–805-GFP chimeric construct was evenly distributed in both the cell cytoplasm and nucleus when expressed in HeLa cells. Upon exposure to ligand, GRDBD/DR 83–805-GFP was efficiently accumulated in the nucleus with a nuclear translocation rate similar to that of the wild-type dioxin receptor, resulting in bright nuclear fluorescence in about 80% of the analyzed cells. In the presence of co-expressed XAP2, the ligand-free form of GRDBD/DR 83–805-GFP showed exclusively cytoplasmic localization. Moreover, ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of this protein was significantly delayed with <5% of cells showing predominantly nuclear localization of the protein (Fig. 3 A). Thus, these results demonstrate that the bHLH domain and the endogenous NLS motif of the dioxin receptor were not required to mediate XAP2-dependent cytoplasmic retention.Figure 2Nuclear accumulation of the ligand-activated dioxin receptor is delayed by XAP2. A, 0.5 μg of pCMX/DR-DFP was introduced into HeLa cells by transient transfection together with 0.5 μg of pSG5/XAP2 or the same amount of carrier vector (pSG5) alone.

Each repeat consists of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain containing six transmembrane (TM) segments followed by a hydrophilic domain containing an ATP-binding site (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

The drug-binding domain is located in the TM domains of P-gp because drug substrates will bind to a deletion mutant lacking both nucleotide-binding domains (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). An important step in understanding the mechanism of P-gp is to determine the residues in the drug-binding domain. A common method for identifying residues in a membrane transporter that are critical for substrate binding and/or transport is to use alanine-scanning mutagenesis. This has been used successfully for transporters such as bacteriorhodopsin (21Subramaniam S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the SERCA1 calcium pump (22Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of these two transporters showed that the amino acids involved in ligand binding are in agreement with those identified through mutational analyses (23Luecke H. Schobert B.

Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The residues in P-gp that are involved in drug binding, however, have been difficult to characterize because a large number of mutations throughout the molecule can alter the substrate specificity (25Loo T.W.

It has been difficult to determine whether mutations that affected activity were actually close to the drug-binding site or whether they affected the global structure of the protein (32Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Hrycyna C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1485-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To avoid these difficulties, we used a direct assay involving cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and modification with a thiol-reactive substrate to identify residues in the TM segments that are critical for drug binding. The rationale is that the thiol-reactive substrate, dibromobimane (dBBn), will enter the drug-binding site of P-gp, covalently label any adjacent cysteine residue, and inhibit activity. Inhibition by dBBn should be preventable by pretreatment with other substrates such as verapamil, colchicine, and vinblastine if the reactive residue is in the drug-binding domain. We have used this method and identified the residues important for drug binding in TMs 6, 11, and 12 (33, 34). In this study, we identify important residues in the remaining TM segments (TMs 1–5 and 7–10) that are important for activity. Wild-type P-gp has cysteine residues at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227. None of these cysteines are important for activity because mutation of all cysteines to alanine (Cys-less P-gp) resulted in an active molecule (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The Cys-less P-gp cDNA was modified to code for 10 histidine residues at the COOH end of the molecule (Cys-less P-gp(His)10). This facilitated purification of the Cys-less P-gp by nickel-chelate chromatography (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues were then introduced into the Cys-less P-gp(His)10 as described previously (36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The integrity of the mutated cDNA was confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of histidine-tagged P-gp mutants were done as described previously (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, fifty 10-cm-diameter culture plates of HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNA. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 μm cyclosporin A. P-gp was expressed in the presence of cyclosporin A because it is a drug substrate that promotes maturation of the protein (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were harvested 24 h later and solubilized with 1% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the mutant P-gp was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography (Ni-NTA columns; Qiagen, Inc., Mississauga, Canada). The P-gp(His)10 mutants were eluted from the nickel columns with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 0.1% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 10% (v/v) glycerol and mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S; Sigma-Aldrich) that was washed and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mmNaCl. The P-gp:lipid mixture was then sonicated for 45 s at 4 °C (bath-type probe; maximum setting, Branson Sonifier 450; Branson Ultrasonic, Danbury, CT). An aliquot of the sonicated P-gp:lipid mixture was assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity by addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and the desired drug substrates (2 mm verapamil, 0.2 mm vinblastine, or 10 mm colchicine). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined by the method of Chifflet et al. (39Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For inhibition with dBBn, the P-gp:lipid mixture was preincubated with 2 mm dBBn (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of cysteine, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 40 mm. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity was then determined as described above. In the protection experiments, the P-gp:lipid samples were treated with 2 mmverapamil, 0.2 mm vinblastine, or 10 mmcolchicine for 15 min at 4 °C before the addition of dBBn (the final concentration of dBBn was 0.2 mm or 2 mm). These were saturating substrate concentrations for stimulation of ATPase activity, whereas 0.2 mm is theKm for stimulation by dBBn (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

The samples were then incubated with 0.2 or 2 mm dBBn for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of cysteine, pH 7.5 (final concentration, 40 mm). Drug-stimulated ATPase activity was then determined with the same drug used for protection (final concentrations were 1 mm verapamil, 0.1 mm vinblastine, or 5 mm colchicine).

The amino acids predicted to be in TM segments are shown in Fig. 1. We had reported that residues within TMs 6, 11, and 12 were important for drug binding (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

In this study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the remaining TM segments and inhibition by dBBn to identify residues that contribute to the drug-binding domain. Accordingly, each residue in TMs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 was changed to cysteine, and then we determined whether the mutant protein was active. The mutant P-gps were expressed in HEK 293 cells, purified by nickel-chelate chromatography, and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. We chose verapamil as the substrate because it had the highest stimulation of the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp (about 13-fold; Ref. 33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Substrate-stimulated ATPase activity has been shown to correlate well with transport because the turnover numbers are similar (45Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of each Cys mutant after treatment with dibromobimane. A total of 189 Cys mutants were analyzed. Six mutants, V52C (TM1), G54C (TM1), G62C (TM1), G122C (TM2), G763C (TM8), and P866C (TM10), were not analyzed because of low expression or very low activity. The mutants V52C, G54C, and G62C appeared to be defective in processing and were not efficiently expressed compared with Cys-less P-gp(His)10. Blots of whole cell extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing these mutants showed very low amounts of the immature (150-kDa) form of P-gp (data not shown). Expression of these TM1 mutants in the presence of cyclosporin A induced maturation of the 150-kDa protein to the mature 170-kDa P-gp, but the yields were too low to allow accurate measurement of drug-stimulated ATPase activity. The remaining 186 P-gp mutants were expressed as well as Cys-less P-gp(His)10. Three of these mutants (G122C, G763C, and P866C) exhibited less than 20% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp(His)10. Mutants G122C (TM2), G763C (TM8), and P866C (TM10) had 9%, 11%, and 6%, respectively, of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp(His)10. It is interesting that mutants G122C (TM2) and G763C (TM8) occupy equivalent positions in each half of P-gp. We reported previously that mutation of P866A caused drastic alteration in the substrate specificity of P-gp (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Dibromobimane is a substrate of P-gp, and its reaction with a cysteine within the drug-binding site would be expected to result in the inhibition of verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. The mutant P-gps were isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography, mixed with lipid, sonicated, and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with dBBn. The reaction was stopped by the addition of cysteine to quench the reactivity of dBBn and convert it to a compound that was no longer a substrate of P-gp (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities of the dBBn-treated samples were assayed and compared with that of mock-treated samples. The results for each TM segment are shown in Fig. 2, A–I. In TM1 (Fig. 2 A), the active mutants retained more than 80% of their ATPase activity after treatment with dBBn. Two mutants in TM2 (Fig. 2 B) were substantially inhibited by dBBn. Mutants Y118C and V125C were inhibited 84% and 67%, respectively, by dBBn. The results for TM3 (Fig. 2 C) were similar to those in TM1 in that all of the mutants retained more than 80% of their activity after treatment with dBBn. In TM4 (Fig. 2 D), the activity of one mutant, S222C, was inhibited by 75% after exposure to dBBn. In TM5 (Fig. 2 E), there were modest decreases in activity (about 25–30%) for mutants A295C and S298C, whereas the remaining mutants retained more than 80% of their activity after treatment with dBBn. Although mutant I306C (TM5) had only 26% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp(His)10, its basal ATPase activity was increased (about 2-fold) upon treatment with dBBn (data not shown). Its verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity also increased to 130% after treatment with dBBn. TM7 (Fig. 2 F), the first TM in the COOH half of P-gp, showed results similar to those for TM1 in that all the mutants were quite resistant to inhibition by dBBn (all retained greater than 80% of their activity). Similarly, the pattern of inhibition in TM8 mutants (Fig. 2 G) was very similar to that seen with TM2 mutants (Fig. 2 B). Mutating the residues at the fifth position, G122C (TM2) and G736C (TM8), resulted in significant reductions in the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities (9% and 11%, respectively), whereas mutating the residues at the eighth position, V125C (TM2) and S766C (TM8), resulted in mutants that were sensitive to inhibition by dBBn (67% and 81% inhibition, respectively). The Cys mutants in TM9 (Fig. 2 H) were relatively resistant to inhibition by dBBn, with the most sensitive mutants, A834C and V835C, showing about 25% inhibition. Two mutants, I868C and G872C in TM10 (Fig. 2 I), were very sensitive to inhibition by dBBn. Their activities were inhibited by 80% and 75%, respectively. The concentrations of dBBn required to give 50% inhibition of verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity for mutants Y118C (TM2), V125C (TM2), S222C (TM4), S766C (TM8), I868C (TM10), and G872C (TM10) were 740, 870, 340, 92, 80 and 62 μm, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of cells expressing these mutants P-gps showed that the expression was similar to that of Cys-less P-gp (Fig. 3). In all cases, the major product was the mature 170-kDa protein. Although the initial results identified residues within the predicted TM segments that were sensitive to inhibition by dBBn, it was possible that these cysteines were very accessible to dBBn and may not be close to the drug-binding site. To ensure that inhibition was indeed due to inhibition of a residue in the drug-binding site, it was important to show that the presence of a substrate would protect the mutant P-gp from inhibition by dBBn. Accordingly, three substrates, verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine, were selected for the protection experiments. Verapamil was selected because it was used in the inhibition assays and showed the highest stimulation of activity. Vinblastine and colchicine were also included because they are structurally different from verapamil and have traditionally been used to study mutants of P-gp (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Loo T.W.

We have used colchicine and vinblastine to characterize the residues in TMs 6, 11, and 12 that were sensitive to inhibition by dBBn (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Six mutants that were inhibited by dBBn, Y118C (TM2), V125C (TM2), S222 (TM4), S766C (TM8), I868C (TM10), and G872C (TM10), were tested for their ability to be protected from inhibition by dBBn in the presence of substrate. Mutant I306C (TM5) was also chosen because its basal ATPase activity was increased after treatment with dBBn (data not shown). Fig. 4 A shows that dBBn treatment also inhibited the vinblastine- and colchicine-stimulated ATPase activities of the mutants, with the exception of mutant I306C. Dibromobimane inhibited the vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity of I306C, whereas the verapamil- and colchicine-stimulated activities were increased (130% and 125%, respectively). To test for protection by drug substrates, the mutants were preincubated with verapamil (2 mm), vinblastine (0.2 mm), or colchicine (10 mm) and then treated with dBBn for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was quenched with cysteine. The mutants (S766C, I868C, and G872C) that were more sensitive to low concentrations of dBBn were treated with 0.2 mm dBBn, whereas the others (Y118C, V125C, S222C, and I306C) were treated with 2 mm dBBn. Drug-stimulated ATPase activity was then determined with the same drug used for protection. The results are shown in Fig. 4 B. Most protection by substrate was observed for mutant S222C (TM4). The mutant was almost completely protected from inactivation by dBBn in the presence of vinblastine. Similarly, vinblastine protected mutant G872C (TM10) from inactivation by dBBn because more than 80% of the activity remained. G872C (TM10) was modestly protected by verapamil, whereas colchicine offered little protection. All three substrates also showed modest protection of mutant I868C (TM10). Some protection from dBBn inhibition by vinblastine was observed for mutant I306C. There was little or no protection by any of the drug substrates for mutants Y118C (TM2), V125C (TM2), and S766C (TM8). We were not able to accurately determine whether the basal ATPase activity of mutants Y118C, V125C, or S766C was inhibited dBBn because the basal ATPase activities were too low. To test whether differences in membrane fluidity affected the drug protection characteristics of the mutants, the assays were repeated at room temperature. The samples were preincubated with verapamil, vinblastine, or colchicine for 15 min at room temperature and treated with dBBn for 15 min at room temperature, and then the ATPase activity was measured at 37 °C. The results were similar to those shown in Fig. 4 (data not shown). We studied drug-binding by measuring inhibition of ATPase activity of P-gp mutants containing a single cysteine. Cys-less P-gp is a good model system because the mutant could still confer resistance to a wide variety of cytotoxic substrates (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and it retains about 80% of the drug-stimulated ATPase activity of wild-type enzyme (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A potential drawback of this approach is that the assay measures only inhibition of ATPase activity and may not reflect drug transport activity. However, drug-stimulated ATPase activity appears to reflect transport activity because the turnover number for vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity correlates with vinblastine transport out of the cell (45Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This study shows that residues S222C (TM4), I306C (TM5), I868C (TM10), and G872C (TM10) may be important for drug binding. We have reported that residues L339C and A342C in TM6, F942C and T945C in TM11, and L975C, V982C, and A985C in TM12 are important for drug binding (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In trying to understand how residues that are quite distant from each other could form the drug-binding site, we have aligned the residues in each TM segment as α-helical wheels. In Fig. 5, we have aligned the residues that are sensitive to inhibition by dBBn such that they face toward the center of the molecule. It is interesting to note that the dBBn-sensitive residues also lie on one face of the helix. Fig. 5 also takes into consideration the results from disulfide cross-linking studies that show that TMs 4–6 and 10–12 are close to one another (47Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Residues S222 (TM4) and I868 (TM10) were protected from inhibition by dBBn by verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine. This indicates that S222 and I868 may be common to the binding of all three substrates. In contrast, residue G872 (TM10), which lies on the same helical face as I868 (TM10), was protected by verapamil and vinblastine but not by colchicine and may be involved in the binding of verapamil and vinblastine. Residue I306 may be important for drug binding because of the effect of dBBn on the vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity of mutant I306C. Dibromobimane inhibited the vinblastine-stimulated activity of this mutant, but not its verapamil- or colchicine-stimulated activity. Vinblastine also protected the mutant from inactivation by dBBn. Disulfide cross-linking data support TM5 being part of the drug-binding domain. Increases in verapamil- and colchicine-stimulated activities after reaction of residues I306C with dBBn could also be an indication that I306 is close to or within the drug-binding site. It is also possible that modification of a residue within or close to the drug-binding domain could lead to inhibition or stimulation of ATPase activity. Residues Ala295 (TM5) and Ile299 (TM5) lie on either side of Ile306 in the helical wheel model (Fig. 5) and could be cross-linked to residues in TM12 (47Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of I299C (TM5) to residues in TM12 was inhibited by vinblastine and promoted by verapamil and colchicine. Assignment of TMs 4, 5, and 10 as part of the drug-binding domain of P-gp is consistent with the results obtained from mutation and labeling studies with radioactive analogs of photoactive substrates. Mutation of prolines at equivalent positions in TM4 (P223) and TM10 (P866) caused large alterations in the substrate specificity of the protein (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3143-3149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutants L210I, K209E, and I214T in TM4 of mouse mdr3 (31Kwan T. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3337-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and I299M (48Shoshani T. Zhang S. Dey S. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 623-630PubMed Google Scholar) and L305A, S, or T in TM5 of human P-gp also changed the substrate specificity of the transporter (49Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 480-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The yeast homolog of human P-gp is Pdr5. It is also an ATP-binding cassette transporter, and many of the substrates of P-gp are also substrates of Pdr5 (50Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2206-2214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Random mutagenesis studies on Pdr5 showed that residue 1360 in predicted TM10 was important for interaction with FK506 (51Egner R. Rosenthal F.E. Kralli A. Sanglard D. Kuchler K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This residue aligns with residue Leu861 (TM10) of human P-gp and faces toward the drug-binding domain in Fig. 5. TMs 4 and 5 are also labeled by photoactive derivatives of iodomycin (43Demmer A. Thole H. Kubesch P. Brandt T. Raida M. Fislage R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20913-20919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and forskolin (52Morris D.I. Greenberger L.M. Bruggemann E.P. Cardarelli C. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Seamon K.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 329-337PubMed Google Scholar). DBBn also inhibited P-gp by reacting with cysteines in TM2 (Y118C and V125C) and TM8 (S766C). The drug substrates verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine did not protect these mutants from inhibition by dBBn. It is possible that some of these residues do not lie within the drug-binding site for these compounds because relatively high concentrations of dBBn were needed to inhibit 50% of the activity of mutants Y118C (TM2) and V125C (TM2) (740 and 870 μm, respectively). Another possibility is that modification of mutant Y118C, V125C, or S766C blocks an essential conformational change during coupling of drug binding to ATPase activity. Residue Tyr118lies close to a conformationally sensitive residue, Arg113(53Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32373-32376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is also possible that these residues lie within another drug-binding site or modulator site. The results from several studies suggest that P-gp may contain up to four different drug interaction sites (54Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 55Pascaud C. Garrigos M. Orlowski S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 56Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In one model of transport, the substrates occupy two different drug-binding sites during transport (54Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In other models, different substrates interact with separate binding sites (56Shapiro A.B. Fox K. Lam P. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In both models, ATP hydrolysis leads to drug efflux. It has been reported that two to three molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed for every molecule of vinblastine transported (45Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Another way of explaining how P-gp can transport such a large variety of structurally different compounds is to assume that different residues in the TMs contribute to the binding of a particular substrate. This may be possible because of the flexibility of the TM segments. Studies have shown that the TMs are quite flexible at 37 °C because cross-linking results indicate that residues in TM6 can cross-link residues in TMs 10, 11, and 12, whereas residues in TM12 can cross-link residues in TMs, 4, 5, and 6 (36Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 47Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is possible that binding of a particular compound causes an “induced-fit” binding site by reducing the flexibility of the TMs and thereby contributing different residues to the binding of a particular substrate. Such an induced-fit binding site model has also been proposed for the BmrR transcription factor that can bind a wide variety of compounds (57Zheleznova E.E. Markham P.N. Neyfakh A.A. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1999; 96: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This model is also consistent with the observation that various structurally diverse drug substrates can induce correct folding of P-gp-processing mutants that have mutations in all parts of the molecule (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The drug substrates can do this by inducing superfolding of the transmembrane domains (58Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The ability to rescue P-gp-processing mutants with different substrates indicates that there is at least one site or overlapping site that can be occupied by most substrates. This is supported by the finding that several residues (this study and Refs. 33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and 34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) can be protected from inhibition by dBBn with verapamil, vinblastine, and colchicine. Further work with other substrates and compounds that are not transported by P-gp will be needed to clarify whether P-gp contains one drug-binding site with broad specificity or multiple sites with distinct specificities.

We propose that EPO/SCN−/H2O2reaction products comprise a potential SH-targeted cytotoxic system that functions in striking contrast to HOCl, the highly but relatively indiscriminantly reactive product of the neutrophil myeloperoxidase system. myeloperoxidase eosinophil peroxidase electrospray ionization mass spectometry glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione S-transferase tandem mass spectometry phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) phorbol myristate acetate red blood cell polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sulfhydryl 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid BME, β- mercaptoethanol Human phagocytes utilize respiratory burst-derived H2O2 in combination with a peroxidase and halides to generate reactive oxidants that can kill bacterial, fungal, metazoan, and viral pathogens but also damage host tissue. The overall reaction is: H2O2 + X− + H+ → HOX + H2O, where X− = Cl−, Br−, SCN−, or I−, and HOX is the corresponding hypohalous acid. Two distinct human phagocytic peroxidases have been identified: neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO)1 and a related (70% amino acid homology (1Ten R.M. Pease L.R. McKean D.J. Bell M.P. Gleich G.J. J.

Neutrophil MPO predominantly catalyzes the two-electron oxidation of the most abundant halide, Cl−, to generate the potent bleaching oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a highly but indiscriminantly reactive substance with potent cytocidal capacity. This powerful “bleaching” oxidant reacts rapidly with a wide variety of cell membrane components, disrupts membrane integrity, and lyses cells (3Rosen H. Klebanoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13731-13735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albrich J.M. McCarthy C.A. Hurst J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In view of these characteristics, HOCl seems well suited for fulfilling the primary function of the neutrophil: to kill relatively small internalized microbes within the confines of a phagocytic vacuole. In contrast to neutrophils, eosinophils mediate the extracellular destruction of large metazoan pathogens such as helminthic parasites (6Gleich G.J. Adolphson C.R. Adv. Immunol. 1986; 39: 177-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Eosinophils contain large quantities (15 μg/106eosinophils, 40% by weight of total specific granule protein (7Abu-Ghazaleh R.I.

EPO plays a critical role in eosinophil killing of parasites under physiologic conditions, because EPO inhibitors nearly completely block the killing of antibody- and complement-opsonized schistosomules by intact eosinophils in serum conditions (13Kazura J.W. Fanning M.M. Blumer J.L. Mahmoud A.A.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The physiologic substrate for eosinophil EPO, although clearly different from that of MPO, is less certain. EPO oxidizes Cl− poorly, if at all (9Jong E.C. Henderson W.R. Klebanoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1378-1382PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jong E.C. Klebanoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1949-1953PubMed Google Scholar, 11Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiani S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 5660-5668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In physiologic fluids such as serum and extracellular fluid, the concentrations of halides are 100 mm Cl−, 20–100 μmBr−, 20–120 μm SCN−, and <1 μm I− (14Klebanoff S.J. Gallin J.I. Fauci A.S.

Considering other potential substrates, it has been shown that the EPO/I−/H2O2 system has pronounced toxicity for bacteria (9Jong E.C. Henderson W.R. Klebanoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1378-1382PubMed Google Scholar), parasites (17Jong E.C. Mahmoud A.A.F. Klebanoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 468-471PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jong E.C. Chi E.Y. Klebanoff S.J. Am.

Alternatively, in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of Cl− and Br−(i.e. 100 mm and 20–100 μm, respectively) EPO preferentially oxidizes Br− to form another potent bleaching oxidant, HOBr, suggesting that Br− might be the predominant natural substrate (11Weiss S.J.

However, other work has shown (9Jong E.C. Henderson W.R. Klebanoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1378-1382PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jong E.C. Klebanoff S.J. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4903-4909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the pseudohalide thiocyanate (SCN−) can also be a substrate for the EPO system. We found (23Slungaard A. Mahoney J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4903-4909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that in fluids of physiologic halide composition (i.e. 100 mm Cl−, 20–100 μm Br−, 10–100 μmSCN−, and 1 μm I−) and in serum, SCN− is the virtually exclusive substrate for EPO oxidation, both by purified EPO and by activated eosinophils. Nitrite (NO2−) can also serve as a substrate for EPO, producing a bactericidal product (21Klebanoff S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that nitrates protein tyrosine residues (20Wu W. Chen Y. Hazen S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25933-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), but SCN− is preferentially oxidized over NO2− as well (20Wu W. Chen Y. Hazen S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25933-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Based upon these data, we propose that, unexpectedly, SCN− is the primary substrate oxidized by EPO and H2O2under physiologic circumstances. The product(s) of this potentially important reaction have, however, not yet been directly identified. Previous work (22Thomas E.L. Fishman M. J. Biol.

By analogy with the other halide/hypohalous systems, it was proposed that this oxidant might be HOSCN or hypothiocyanous acid. The product(s) of the EPO/SCN−/H2O2 system react(s) with the sulfhydryl dye 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) (22Thomas E.L. Fishman M. J. Biol.

Oral Biol. 1984; 29: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a profile similar to the product(s) of the lactoperoxidase/SCN−/H2O2 system. However, even in the better-characterized lactoperoxidase/SCN−/H2O2 system, based upon nuclear magnetic and electron spin resonance studies, at least four different compounds have been proposed to be the major reaction products: HOSCN (28Pollock J.R. Goff H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1159: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Modi S. Deodhar S.S. Behere D.V. Mitra S.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), NCS-O-SCN−(28), and−OSC·N− (30Lövaas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We now use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electrospray ionization mass spectometry (ESI-MS) to identify the major stable reaction products of the EPO/SCN−/H2O2 system and demonstrate its capacity to inflict sulfhydryl reactivity-based toxicity. These findings suggest that the eosinophil EPO system employs a radically different biologic strategy to kill extracellular pathogens than the neutrophil MPO system does to kill intracellular pathogens. Human EPO was kindly provided by Dr. Gerald J. Gleich (Mayo Clinic and Research Foundation, Rochester, MN). EPO was isolated from granule extracts of purified eosinophil suspensions obtained from patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome as described previously (31Agosti J.M. Altman L.C. Ayars G.H. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. Klebanoff S.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1987; 79: 496-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Granule extracts were then chromatographed on a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 0.25 m acetate buffer (pH 4.3, 0.15 m NaCl). The fractions eluting with the void volume were then collected and purified to an A415/280 ratio of >0.9 by chromatography on carboxymethyl-Sepharose as described by Carlson et al.(8Carlson M.G. Ch. Peterson C.G.B. Venge P. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1875-1879PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacryamide gel electrophoresis was used to confirm homogeneity of the EPO preparation. Two discrete bands (molecular mass of ∼78 and ∼14 kDa) that correspond to the heavy and light chains of EPO, with no contaminating bands, were present. EPO activity was assayed with guaiacol oxidation and converted to international units (the amount of the enzyme that oxidizes 1 μmol of electron donor/min at 25 °C (32Himmelhoch H.S. Evans W.H. Mage M.G. Peterson E.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 914-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the EPO utilized in the course of these experiments was 133–250 units/mg of protein. Preparations were stored at −70 °C until needed for use and were then maintained at 4 °C wrapped in foil. 13C-Labeled (99-atom %) potassium thiocyanate was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Unlabeled potassium thiocyanate was from Fisher. [14C]SCN− as the potassium salt, specific activity 55.1 mCi/mmol, was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Potassium cyanate was from J. T. Baker Inc.. Percoll was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. CD-16 magnetic microbeads were obtained from Miltenyi Biotech Inc (Sunnyvale, CA). PMA was from Consolidated Midland Corporation (Brewster, NY). Hanks' buffered salt solution was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Oxidants were quantified by titration of TNB as described previously (22Thomas E.L. Fishman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9694-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TNB was generated from 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) by the addition of 2 μl of β-mercaptoethanol to 50 ml of a 1 mm DTNB solution. Freshly prepared TNB is calibrated at A412 and combined with the EPO reaction mixture to a total volume of 1 ml to determine HOSCN/OSCN− concentration using a molar extinction coefficient of 26,000m−1 cm−1. Independent studies with reagent OCN− confirmed that this assay does not detect OCN− (not shown). EPO-catalyzed oxidation of SCN− was performed using conditions similar to those described by Modi et al. (29Modi S. Deodhar S.S. Behere D.V. Mitra S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using the lactoperoxidase system. KSCN (2 mm) and EPO (0.4 μm) were added to 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 or 7.4 (total volume 1 ml), and 5 consecutive 250 μm increments of H2O2 were added at 1-min intervals at room temperature (25 °C), vortexing between additions. One minute after the final bolus addition, 20 μl of catalase (2 mg/ml) was added to consume excess unreacted H2O2. Specimens were incubated then at 25 or 4 °C, and after 0, 30, 90, 120, and 240 min, 100-μl aliquots were removed for assay of oxidants by TNB titration. The [13C]SCN− spectra were collected either on a Bruker AMX-600 MHz apparatus using an 8-mm broad-band probe or on Varian Inova-600 using a 5-mm broad-band probe. Spectra were obtained of EPO/[13C]SCN−/H2O2reaction mixture in 10% D2O 90% 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer at either pH 6.0 or 7.4. Reactions were mixed as described above to 2 ml total volume at appropriate pH at room temperature. One minute after the final H2O2bolus addition, 50 μl of catalase (2 mg/ml) was added to the reaction tube, and reaction mixtures were transferred to ice. Samples were placed in an 8-inch, 8-mm thin-walled NMR sample tube (Wilmad Glass, Buena NJ). One-dimensional spectra were collected using the following parameters: sweep width = 15,009, number of points = 32,000, acquisition time = 1.066 s, recycle delay of 2 s, number of scans was either 1500 or 2000. The data were processed using gaussian function 0.099. Chemical shifts were referenced relative to external (CH3)4Si. For determination of cyanate spectrum, a 1 m solution of 13C-labeled urea was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% D2O and incubated for 40 min in a water bath at 85 °C to promote equilibration between urea and cyanate. Assay of OCN− by chemical analytic assay (see below) in this preparation confirmed a cyanate concentration of 5 mm (not shown). NMR spectra were then obtained as described above. Negative ion ESI-MS was carried out on a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The instrument was tuned and calibrated for negative ion operation using polypropylene glycol with the Sciex IonSpray® source. EPO (0.4 μm) and either [13C]SCN− or [12C] SCN− potassium thiocyanate (2 mm) were combined in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.4. Five 200 μm boluses of H2O2 were added at room temperature at 1-min intervals with mixing, and 40 μg/ml catalase was added to destroy excess H2O2. The samples were then placed in Microcon concentrators (Amicon, Beverly MA) with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa, centrifuged for 30 min (13,000 × gat 4 °C) to remove protein, and kept cold until ESI-MS analysis in the negative ion mode. Alternatively, for some experiments, samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm exclusion Acrodisc to remove particles and immediately analyzed. Samples were infused into the IonSpray® source at a flow rate of 5–10 μl/min using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus model 22, South Natick, MA, USA). The various instrumental parameters involved in efficient nebulization and charging of droplets were optimized to the following values: spray needle voltage (−3500 V); interface plate (−650 V); orifice skimmer (−50 to −l00V); Q0 rod offset voltage (−30V); gas curtain interface (1.2 liters/min of N2 at 60 °C); nebulizer gas (air at 1.5 liters/min). Data were acquired in the range of 10 to 100 m/z at a step size of 0.2 atomic mass units and 5–10-mc dwell time; 10–30 scans were summed over time. Collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) studies were performed on a Micromass Quatro II triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Altrincham, UK). Collision-induced mass spectra were determined in the negative ion mode by direct infusion of reaction products (formed by the EPO/SCN−/H2O2 system as described for the ESI/MS studies above) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min (Harvard Apparatus pump) and analyzed with a cone potential of 20 eV, collision energy of 30 eV, collision gas (Ar) cell at 1.7 × 10−3 millibar, source temperature 70 °C, capillary 3500 V, high voltage lens 690 V, skimmer offset of 5 V. OCN− was assayed using the method of Guilloton and Karst (33Guilloton M. Karst F. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 219-295Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 ml of a freshly prepared 10 mm solution of 2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid) prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 4.4 was incubated with 250 μl of the EPO system reaction mixture for 10 min at 40 °C and then added to 500 μl of 10n HCl. The mixture was then boiled for 1 min, allowed to cool to room temperature, and assayed spectrophotometrically at 310 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 3.56 mm−1cm−1. A standard curve using reagent KOCN− was used to determine specific concentration. This assay does not detect HOSCN/OSCN− because EPO system reaction mixtures contained the same amount of cyanate before and immediately after selective titration of HOSCN/OSCN− by the addition of dithiothreitol (not shown). To determine the relative time courses of HOSCN and cyanate generation (Fig. 5), H2O2was added to a reaction mixture containing PBS with 1 mmKSCN (pH 7.4) and 0.4 μm EPO by continuous infusion at 50 μm/min for 20 min to simulate the continuous generation of H2O2 by the respiratory burst of an activated eosinophil. An aliquot was removed from the reaction mixture before and at various time intervals after initiating the addition of H2O2, supplemented with 40 μg/ml catalase to consume unreacted H2O2, and placed on ice until subsequent assay of oxidants and cyanate as described above. To establish the peroxidase dependence of oxidant and cyanate generation by the EPO/SCN−/H2O2 system (Fig.7), the effect of either omitting EPO or adding the EPO inhibitor azide (1 mm) was assayed in a system composed of PBS (pH 7.4), 0.4 μm EPO, and 1 mm KSCN to which five consecutive increments of 100 μmH2O2 were added at 1-min intervals, and the reaction was terminated by adding 100 μg/ml catalase and placing the specimen on ice before assaying oxidants and cyanate.Figure 7Peroxidase activity dependence of OSCN− and OCN− production by the EPO/SCN−/H2O2 system.Solutions containing 0.4 μm EPO, 1 mm KSCN, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were supplemented with H2O2 (added as 100 μmincrements/min ×5), subsequent to which catalase (40 μg/ml) was added to consume excess unreacted H2O2. OSCN− and OCN− were subsequently determined in the presence of the complete system (left pair of bars), the complete system in the presence of the peroxidase inhibitor azide, 5 mm (middle pair of bars), or in a system lacking added EPO (right pair of bars). Data represent mean ± S.E.n = 3 for each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The anti-CD-16 immunomagnetic bead cell sorting system (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec Inc.) was used as described by Ide et al. (34Ide M. Weiler D. Kita H. Gleich G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 168: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Minor modifications are delineated here. 60 ml of citrated blood from eosinophilic donors (n = 3) undergoing interleukin-2 immunotherapy were mixed with 30 ml of 6% Hetastarch in a 0.9% sodium chloride solution (Abbott Laboratories). Erythrocytes were allowed to sediment for 45 min at room temperature, and the leukocyte-rich fraction was collected. This fraction was diluted with an equal volume of PBS (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 4.2 mm sodium phosphate, and 1.5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4)) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, layered atop a half-volume of isotonic Percoll (density 1.082 g/ml) in 50-ml conical tubes, and centrifuged for 30 min and 1000 × gat 4 °C. The supernatant and mononuclear cells at the interface were carefully aspirated, and the inside wall of the tube was wiped with sterile cotton tip applicators to remove residual mononuclear cells. The pellet of granulocytes and remaining erythrocytes were subjected to a hypotonic lysis by exposure to 20 ml of ice-cold sterile water for 30 s. The granulocytes were rescued with 20 ml of a 2× isotonic buffer (40 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm d-glucose, 280 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) and pelleted. The lysis was repeated if erythrocytes remained. The specimen was then incubated with anti-CD-16-coupled immunomagnetic beads and processed as described previously (35Hansel T.T. Ound J.D. Thompson R.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 127: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The resulting preparations all contained ≥98% eosinophils. Purified eosinophils were washed, suspended at 4 × 106/ml in a modified Hanks' balanced salt solution composed of 5.3 mmKCl, 138 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm potassium phosphate, 5.3 mm sodium phosphate, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). supplemented with 1 mm KSCN. Triplicate groups were then supplemented with nothing (control), 1 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or 1 μg/ml PMA and 5 mm azide, then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in capless 5-ml round-bottom tubes. The tubes were vortexed every 15 min to aid oxygenation. After the incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min, 1000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were placed in Microcon concentrators (Amicon) with membranes of 3000-Dalton molecular mass cut off and centrifuged for 30 min, 13,000 × g at 4 °C to remove degranulated proteins. The filtrates were assayed for HOSCN and cyanate quantities as described above. Human RBCs were suspended at a hematocrit of 2% in PBS (pH 7.4)) supplemented with increasing concentrations of OSCN−/OCN− generated as above by the EPO/SCN−/H2O2 system. After 30 min, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × gfor 3 min and washed 3 times in ice-cold H/H buffer. Under these conditions, only at ≥200 μmOSCN−/OCN− was there detectable hemolysis, as assayed by spectrophometric assay of supernatant hemoglobin or methhemoglobin. RBC lysates and membranes were then prepared by hypotonic lysis and assayed for glutathione and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and lactate dehydrogenase activity as described by Beutler (47Beutler E. Red Cell Metabolism : A Manual of Biochemical Methods. Grune and Stratton, Inc., Orlando, FL1974Google Scholar) and for ATPase activity as described below. Hemolysates were incubated 15 min further either with or without 10 mm dithiotheitol and reassayed for GAPDH, GST, and ATPases. Human RBC membranes were prepared by hypotonic lysis. RBC membranes were suspended at 0.2 mg of protein/ml in membrane buffer (20 mm Hepes, 5.5 mm NaCl, with 1 g/liter d-glucose, 0.10 g/liter MgCl2·6H2O, 0.10 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, and 0.4 g/liter KCl (pH 7.4)) supplemented with increasing concentrations of H2O2, HOCl (diluted from concentrated hypochlorite (Sigma)), HOBr (prepared adding excess bromide to stock HOCl, as described previously (56Slungaard A. Mahoney Jr., J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)) or OSCN−/OCN− (prepared by EPO as described above). RBC membranes were incubated with the oxidants for 15 min at 37 °C then pelleted and washed three times in ATPase buffer without oxidant. Total (i.e. Ca2+-, Mg2+-, calmodulin-, and Na+/K+-dependent) ATPase activity was assayed in 0.2 mg of protein RBC membrane aliquots suspended in 500 μl of ATPase buffer (90 mm histidine, 90 mm imidazole, 15 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 300 nm calmodulin (pH 7.4)) by adding 3 mm ATP, incubating 10 min at 37 °C, then quenching phosphate release by adding 1000 μl of 1% ascorbate in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Phosphate release was quantitated as described (57Baginski E.S. Foa P.P. Zak B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1967; 15: 155-158Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar) by the addition of 250 μl of 1% ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, incubating 5 min, then adding 500 μl of 2% sodium citrate dihydrate and 2% sodium arsenite in 2% acetic acid. The resulting solution was assayed with a spectrophotometer at 700 nm, and the concentration of phosphate was calculated from a standard curve generated using H2KPO4. Values were corrected for both spontaneous membrane phosphate release (i.e. membranes without ATP added) and spontaneous ATP hydrolysis (i.e. ATP in the absence of membranes). 10 μg of human GST-π was exposed to 200 μm[14C]OSCN−/OCN− (generated using [14C] SCN− in the EPO/SCN−/H2O2 system described above) or H/H buffer. Samples were suspended in Laemmli buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol (BME) and separated on a 3–15% SDS/PAGE gel (58Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochem"

Affected tissues include the eye, craniofacial structures, heart, circulatory, urogenital, respiratory system, limbs, and the anterior-posterior axis of the central nervous system (4Wilson J.G.

Precise control over the effective concentration of the receptor ligands, all-trans- and 9-cis-RA, is therefore a central requirement for proper receptor function and is maintained by the balance between synthesis and degradation. In retinoic acid-sensitive target tissues, ligands could be derived either by uptake from the low levels circulating in serum or through the in situ metabolism of the prohormone vitamin A (retinol) by alcohol dehydrogenases (including members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase and medium chain alcohol dehydrogenase families) and aldehyde dehydrogenases (reviewed in Refs. 9Napoli J.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 139-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Duester G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 463: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Such an intracrine mechanism has the advantage that ligand synthesis and signaling can be tightly coupled through the cell-specific regulation of the respective enzymes, a property that would be desirable in various developmental models where RA is thought to act locally as a morphogenic signal. Degradation of RA proceeds primarily through further oxidative metabolism by members of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes such as CYP26 (11White J.A. Beckett-Jones B. Guo Y.D. Dilworth F.J.

In vertebrates, phylogenetic analysis indicates 13 families of aldehyde dehydrogenases that fall into two main clades. The “class 3” group, which consists mostly of substrate-specific dehydrogenases, and the “class 1/2” dehydrogenases that have broader substrate specificity (12Perozich J. Nicholas H. Wang B.C. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The “class 1/2” group contains members that can utilize retinaldehyde at submicromolar concentrations (13Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Dave V.

Drager U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Recent reports confirm the essential role of ALDH1 and RALDH2 in RA signaling in vivo. For instance, premature expression of ALDH1 or RALDH2 by mRNA injection into Xenopus embryos results in the induction of premature RA synthesis and teratogenic effects (17Haselbeck R.J. Hoffmann I. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 353-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the targeted disruption of RALDH2 in mice has shown its essential and specific role in RA signaling during axial rotation (body turning) and heart and limb morphogenesis (18Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Studies using retinoic acid-sensitive β-galactosidase reporter transgenic mice or indicator cell lines (19Balkan W. Colbert M. Bock C. Linney E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 199: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that RA signaling is restricted to specific tissues or regions during vertebrate embryogenesis and that many of these sites, but not all, co-localize to the expression pattern of ALDH1 and RALDH2. One notable discrepancy is the ventral neural retina, where evidence from in situ hybridization and zymographs of isoelectric focusing gels in both mouse and chick support the presence of an additional high activity retinaldehyde dehydrogenase that is distinct from ALDH1 or RALDH2 (22McCaffery P. Lee M.O. Wagner M.A. Sladek N.E. Drager U.C. Development. 1992; 115: 371-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mey J. McCaffery P. Drager U.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7441-7449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a third cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase, ALDH6, that can synthesize RA and is expressed in the sensory neuroepithelia including the ventral retina. We also show that ALDH6 is able to specifically transactivate the RAR-dependent signaling pathway when transfected into cells and can sensitize cells to retinol by shifting the dose-response curve 1000-fold. Comparisons with other ALDHs suggest that ALDH6 is equivalent in efficacy to RALDH2 and 10-fold better than ALDH1 in supporting RA-dependent signaling. PCR amplicons of aldehyde dehydrogenases (1025 base pairs for mouse; 713 base pairs for chick) were amplified from 100 ng of oligo(dT)-primed mouse organ or chick embryonic day 4 (E4) ventral retina cDNA using 2.5 units of ExTaq polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) with 50 pmol each of forward and reverse degenerate primers: mouse ALDHdegF, 5′-GCW GGI TGG GCI GAY AAR ATY CAY GG-3′; mouse ALDHdegR, 5′-CCR TKI CCW GAC ATY TTR AAS CC-3′; chick ALDHdegF, 5′-CAR ATH ATH CCI TGG AAY TT-3′; chick ALDH6degR, 5′-AAI ATY TCY TCY TTI GCI AT-3′. Cycle conditions were 5 min at 95 °C and then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. Amplicons were cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and screened by restriction enzyme digestion pattern, and four clones were sequenced. The full-length open reading frame (1539 base pairs) of mouse ALDH6 (mALDH6) was amplified with 20 pmol of the gene-specific primers ALDH6ATG (5′-ATG GCT ACC ACC AAC GGG GCT-3′) and ALDH6STOP (5′-TCA GGG GTT CTT CTC CTC GAG-3′) deduced from mouse expressed sequence tag sequences AA790530 and AA499064; four independent clones were sequenced. In addition, three independent 3.26-kilobase pair ALDH6 cDNA clones that included 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions were amplified with 20 pmol each of ALDH6ESTA (5′-CCG GAG AGT GCG AAC CAG TTA-3′) and ALDH6ESTC (5′-CAC ACC ACA GGG GTA AAC CTT-3′) derived from expressed sequence tag sequences AA790530, AA560389, and AA848809. The sequence for mouse ALDH6 is available under GenBankTMaccession number AF152359. Chick ALDH6 5′ cDNA sequences were cloned with a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Life Technologies, Inc). 600 ng of E4 ventral retina RNA was reverse transcribed with the gene-specific primer YHR3 (5′-TCA TCC ACA GGG ATA GTC CTG-3′), oligo(dC)-tailed, and then amplified by two rounds of PCR with 20 pmol of the kit oligo(dG) adapter primer and the nested gene-specific primers YHR2 (5′-CCT GGT GAA ACA GAC-3′) and YHR1 (5′-CAG AGA GCC AAT GTA CAG TGA TG-3′) (30 cycles each, annealing temperature was 55 °C for 30 s). Four independent 0.6-kilobase pair clones were sequenced. Chick ALDH6 3′ cDNA sequences (approximately 3 kilobase pairs) were cloned by sequential PCR with 20 pmol of oligo(dT)-M13-M4 primer and the nested gene-specific primers YHF4 (5′-GCC ATT GAA GAC AGA GGC CTG-3′), YHF6 (5′-TAC CGA GTA TGG ACT CAC-3′), and YHF7 (5′-AGC TTC TGC TTT GCA GTC G-3′). The sequence for chick ALDH6 (cALDH6) is available under GenBankTM accession number AF152358. The RARβ retinoic acid response element-thymidine kinase luciferase reporter construct (RARE×2-tk-Luc), thymidine kinase-luciferase (tk-Luc) control plasmid, MH-100×4-Luc reporter plasmid, GAL4-nuclear receptor effector constructs (GAL-RAR, GAL-RXR, GAL-VDR, and GAL-PPAR), and β-galactosidase (pCMX-βGal) plasmid have been previously described (24Umesono K.

Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The open reading frames of chick aldehyde dehydrogenases were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (26Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar) to generate pCAGGS-cALDH1, -cRALDH2, and -cALDH6. JEG-3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method in 24-well tissue culture plates for 8 h with ALDH constructs and reporter plasmids as indicated in the figure legends and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to serum-free ITLB (5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/mlholo-transferrin, 1× Life Technologies, Inc. Defined Lipid Mix and 1.2 g/liter bovine serum albumin)-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Retinoids were added, and cells were incubated for 24–36 h before being assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. cDNA fragments encoding chick ALDH6 (nucleotides 433–1458 in sequenceAF152358), chick ALDH1 (nucleotides 597–1178 (27Godbout R. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)), mouse ALDH1 (AHD-2), and ALDH6 (nucleotides 433–1458 in sequence AF152359) were used to prepare digoxygenin-labeled antisense RNA probes. Whole mountin situ hybridization was performed as described by Wilkinson (28Wilkinson D.G. Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-83Google Scholar), and section in situ hybridization was performed as described by Ishii et al. (29Ishii Y. Fukuda K. Saiga H. Matsushita S. Yasugi S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1997; 39: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), except that both hybridization and posthybridization washes were carried out at 69 °C and RNase treatment was omitted. Chick embryos were embedded in O.C.T compound (Sakura Finetechnical Co., Ltd., Tokyo) for frozen sections. Mouse embryos and E4–E7 chick embryos were embedded in paraffin. The sections were cut at 6–12-μm thickness. Recombinant chick ALDH6 enzyme was prepared from the expression vector pBAD-cALDH6 in DH5α bacterial cultures induced with 0.2% arabinose. Purification from lysates was by sequential column chromatography with a 100 × 2.5-cm Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) developed in phosphate-buffered saline. Active fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, applied to a preparative 10 × 2.5-cm Macroprep High Q column (Bio-Rad), and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 60 min. Final purification was by a TSK-Gel DEAE-5PW (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) anion exchange column with a gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in 30 min. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was monitored by NADH-dependent formazan dye formation at 566 nm. Briefly, 1–10 μg of protein were assayed in 200 μl of enzyme buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 200 mm KCl, 250 μm NAD, 250 μm nitro blue tetrazolium, 8 μm phenomethyl sulfonate, and 0.26% gelatin) with varying concentrations of substrate aldehydes. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was confirmed by HPLC assay as described below. Protein concentrations were assayed with the Bio-Rad Protein Kit, and purity was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Kinetic parameters for aldehyde substrates and NAD were determined by HPLC quantitation of retinoic acid formation or NADH production at 340 nm. Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase activity was assayed with 0.1–0.4 μg of protein and 2 μm all-trans-retinaldehyde in 1 ml of enzyme buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm NAD, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 10 min. Retinoids were extracted by the addition of 250 μl of acetonitrile/butanol (1:1) and 200 μl of saturated potassium phosphate buffer according to the method of McLean (30McLean S.W. Rudel M.E. Gross E.G. DiGiovani J.J. Pede G.L. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), separated using a 5 × 4.1-mm C18 reverse phase TSK-Gel SuperODS column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), and quantitated by photodiode array detection. HPLC gradient conditions were as follows: flow rate, 1.5 ml/min; 100% 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.9; linear change from 0–60% acetonitrile in 3.0 min; isocratic at 60% acetonitrile for 3.0 min; linear change from 60 to 100% acetonitrile in 1.5 min; isocratic at 100% acetonitrile for 2.5 min. Kinetic data were fitted using the nonlinear regression analysis program Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). In the developing chick and mouse retina, ALDH1 is restricted to the dorsal neural retina, while RALDH2 is expressed in the pigmented retinal epithelium (31Berggren K. McCaffery P. Drager U. Forehand C.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 288-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, an additional retinaldehyde dehydrogenase activity, named V1 in mouse and C-V in chick, that is biochemically distinct from ALDH1 and RALDH2 has been detected in the ventral neural retina (22McCaffery P. Lee M.O. Wagner M.A. Sladek N.E. Drager U.C. Development. 1992; 115: 371-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mey J. McCaffery P. Drager U.C. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7441-7449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the small tissue sample size makes it impractical for classical protein purification, we isolated novel ALDH cDNA clones by designing degenerate oligonucleotide PCR primers to regions of high sequence conservation in an alignment of published human, mouse, and chick ALDH sequences for the nonallelic ALDH1/2/5/6 and RALDH2 genes. In addition to detecting the known aldehyde dehydrogenases, 4 of 26 clones from mouse and 5 of 120 clones from chick represented a new ALDH that by BLAST search of GenBankTM data base sequences shared closest homology with human ALDH6 (32Hsu L.C. Chang W.C. Hiraoka L. Hsieh C.L. Genomics. 1994; 24: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the recently described murine RALDH3 cloned from the lateral ganglionic eminence (33Li H. Wagner E. McCaffery P. Smith D. Andreadis A. Drager U.C. Mech. Dev. 2000; 95: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). On the basis of nucleotide and amino acid similarity, we assign this new ALDH as the mouse and chick homolog of human ALDH6. Fig. 1,A and B, shows the mouse and chick nucleotide sequences and deduced open reading frame of the longest cDNAs obtained by PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phylogenetic relationship between various aldehyde dehydrogenases is shown in Fig. 2 and TableI. Human, mouse, and chick ALDH6 sequences share 85–94% amino acid conservation, equivalent to that seen between species for sequences of ALDH1 (83%) or RALDH2 (96%). ALDH6 is only 69% conserved between either ALDH1 or RALDH2. The murine ALDH6 is essentially identical (99%) to RALDH-3 (Ref. 33Li H. Wagner E. McCaffery P. Smith D. Andreadis A. Drager U.C. Mech. Dev. 2000; 95: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number AF253409). The ALDH6 open reading frame contains the NAD binding motif (GXGXXXG) at residues 235–241 and the conserved cysteine (Cys314), which acts as the active site nucleophile (34Blatter E.E. Abriola D.P. Pietruszko R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, residues that are found in all catalytically active ALDHs (12Perozich J. Nicholas H. Wang B.C. Lindahl R. Hempel J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) are present in equivalent positions in an optimal alignment, suggesting that this enzyme is functional.Table ISequence pair distances of human, mouse, and chick ALDHs Open table in a new tab We performed in situ hybridization of chick and mouse embryos with antisense RNA probes of ALDH6. Figs. 3 and 4show the expression pattern of ALDH6 in whole mount and sections in chick from stage 10 to 18. No signal was detected with sense probes. ALDH6 is first detected at stage 10 in the surface epithelium anterior to the optic vesicle but is absent from ectoderm directly overlying the lens vesicle (Figs. 3 A and 4 F). By contrast, the expression of ALDH1 is first detectable as the optic vesicle makes contact with the overlying ectoderm and the lens placode begins to thicken at stage 12. ALDH1 expression is initiated in the proximal layer of the vesicle directly opposite the lens placode (Fig. 4 A). This region of strong ALDH1 expression involutes during optic cup formation and expands to form the dorsal neural retina (Fig. 4, A–E). In contrast, ALDH6 expression extends to both the proximal and distal ventral sides of the vesicle that are destined to become, respectively, the ventral halves of the neural and pigmented retina (Fig. 4, F–J). By embryonic day 4, ALDH1 and ALDH6 exhibit complementary nonoverlapping domains of expression in the dorsal and ventral neural retina (Fig. 4, E andJ). Separating these two expression domains is a region that transects the dorso-ventral axis of the retina where neither ALDH1 nor ALDH6 is expressed. Interestingly, this stripe represents the expression domain of CYP26, a cytochrome P450 enzyme that is involved in RA breakdown (11White J.A. Beckett-Jones B. Guo Y.D. Dilworth F.J. Bonasoro J.

At stage (st.) 12 (A and F), cALDH6 is expressed in the surface epithelium ventral to the optic vesicle. The dorsal limit corresponds roughly with the ventral limit of the lens placode (lp) (indicated by an arrow). This expression persists into the later stages (G–I). In the neural tissue at this stage, cALDH6 is expressed only at the junction of the eye vesicle and forebrain (arrowhead). cALDH1 is expressed in the lateral side of the eye vesicle underlying the lens placode. At stage 13 (B and G), cALDH6 is expressed in the prospective pigmented retina and ventral neural retina. cALDH1 is expressed broadly in the region of the eye cup beneath the lens placode. At stage 16 (C and H), cALDH6 expression remains basically the same as that at stage 13. cALDH1 expression becomes restricted to the dorsal portion of the neural retina. At stage 18 (D and I), cALDH6 and cALDH1 expression increase in intensity. cALDH6 expression can also be observed in the optic stalk. At E4 (E andJ), expression of both cALDH6 and cALDH1 remain basically unchanged, but the cALDH6 expression in the optic stalk is weaker than at stage 18 (indicated by an arrowhead). The central retina region where neither cALDH1 nor cALDH6 expression is detected represents the expression domain of CYP26, a P450 enzyme involved in RA breakdown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In later stages of eye development, neural retina differentiates into a well organized layered structure in which various types of cells reside at specific positions. At E10, both ALDH1 and ALDH6 were found to be expressed in the outer side of the inner nuclear layer, where amacrine cells are differentiating (Figs. 5,A, B, E, and F) (37Milam A.H. Possin D.E. Huang J. Fariss R.N. Flannery J.G. Saari J.C. Vis. Neurosci. 1997; 14: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both transcripts were also found in the ganglion cell layer, albeit faintly. By E16, expression of both ALDH1 and ALDH6 have become faint (Fig. 5,C, D, G, and H). Concurrent with its strong expression in retina, the posterior olfactory neuroepithelium and dorsal epithelium of the otic vesicle are early sites of expression (Figs. 3 C and 6, D andE). Additional sites in the developing head include a band of expression in the isthmus joining the midbrain and hind brain and Rathke's pouch (Fig. 6, C andD). Although we could not detect expression during early limb bud formation (stages 16–21), ALDH6 was observed later at E4 as diffuse staining in mesenchymal limb tissue and at E7 in the hind limb and fore limb interdigital zones and the perichondrial membranes of wing and leg buds (Fig. 6, A, B, andG). In the posterior trunk, ALDH6 staining was found in somites and a subset of spinal cord interneurons opposite the hind limb field (Fig. 6, G and H). This spinal cord expression co-localized with En-1, a specific marker for interneurons (38Burrill J.D. Moran L. Goulding M.D. Saueressig H. Development. 1997; 124: 4493-4503PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of ALDH6 expression to the sensory neuroepithelia is conserved between chick and mouse (Fig. 7 A), although some minor differences were observed. In mouse embryos, ALDH6 was not detected before E8.5 but became clearly visible by E9.5 in the dorsal and ventral margins of the optic vesicle and in a large area of overlying surface head ectoderm (Fig. 7 B). The dynamic nature of the expression pattern is identical to that reported for RALDH3 (33Li H. Wagner E. McCaffery P. Smith D. Andreadis A. Drager U.C. Mech. Dev. 2000; 95: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). By E10.5, ALDH6 expression in surface ectoderm is rapidly reduced (Fig. 7,A and C) but is reexpressed at E11.5, where the ectoderm invaginates at the dorsal and ventral margins of the optic cup (Fig. 7 D). During this period, expression in the ventral neural retina becomes more pronounced (Fig. 7, A,C, and D), and in contrast to the chick, some staining is also transiently seen in the dorsal neural retina through E11.5 (Fig. 7 D). However, by E12.5 ALDH1 and ALDH6 are separated into distinct dorsal and ventral domains in the neural retina (Fig. 7, E and F). Expression of ALDH6 in retina weakens slightly by E15.5 (Fig. 7 G). The conservation of expression between mouse and chick ALDH6 extended to the olfactory placode and otic vesicle, which give rise to the sensory neuroepithelia of the nose and ear. Whole mount and sectionin situ hybridization of mouse embryos showed initially strong uniform expression in the developing olfactory epithelium at E10.5 (Fig. 7, A and C). Starting at E11.5, ALDH6 expression became progressively more restricted to the dorso-lateral neuroepithelium (Fig. 7 D). By E15.5, transverse sections of olfactory structures exhibited a punctated cellular expression pattern in the sensory epithelium and the mesenchymal stroma directly underlying it that was restricted to discreet zones within the developing turbinates (Fig. 7 H). Expression in the otic vesicle was transient and not detected after E10.5. In coronal sections of brain at E15.5, we also confirmed expression in the lateral ganglionic eminence as described in detail by Li et al.(33Li H. Wagner E. McCaffery P. Smith D. Andreadis A. Drager U.C. Mech. Dev. 2000; 95: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that ALDH6 is indeed the retinaldehyde-specific dehydrogenase of ventral retina, we constructed inducible bacterial expression vectors containing the open reading frame. Conversion of all-trans-retinal to retinoic acid was only detected in lysates from bacterial cultures containing pBAD-ALDH6 and was dependent on induction of the protein (Fig. 8). Purified chick and mouse ALDH6 enzymes were used for determination of kinetic parameters and substrate specificity (Table II). Activity was found to be strongly stimulated with increasing pH between 7 and 8 but was constant above pH 8.0. Enzyme assays were therefore carried out at pH 8.0. ALDH6, like other dehydrogenases in the “class 1/2” clade, can utilize a variety of aldehyde substrates preferring aliphatic longer chain aldehydes; Km values for acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and octanal were 3.2 mm, 4.3 μm, and 0.24 μm, respectively. By comparison, ALDH6 used all-trans-retinal as substrate with aVmax of 48.4 ± 0.4 nmol/mg/min andK0.5 of 0.26 μm ± 0.033 and displayed positive cooperativity (H = 1.9) (Fig. 9 A). Mouse ALDH6 had very similar kinetic parameters: Vmax = 58.1 ± 1.0 nmol/mg/min, K0.5 = 0.33 ± 0.040 μm, and H = 1.8 (n = 3). The submicromolar affinity for retinaldehyde and substantialVmax support the conclusion that ALDH6 can function as a retinaldehyde-specific dehydrogenase in vivo.Table IIKinetic parameters of chick and mouse ALDH6EnzymeSubstrateKm 2-aAssays were performed at pH 8.0 and 37 °C.

To date, two specific inhibitors of HGFA have been identified, namely HGFA inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) and type 2 (HAI-2)/placental bikunin (PB). Both inhibitors are first synthesized as integral membrane proteins having two Kunitz domains and a transmembrane domain, and are subsequently released from cell surface by shedding. Here we show that an active form of HGFA is specifically complexed with membrane-form HAI-1, but not with HAI-2/PB, on the surface of epithelial cells expressing both inhibitors. This binding required the enzyme activity of HGFA. The selective binding of HGFA to the cell surface HAI-1 was further confirmed in an engineered system using Chinese hamster ovary cells, in which only the cells expressing HAI-1 retained exogenous HGFA. The binding of HGFA to HAI-1 was reversible, and no irreversible modifications affecting the enzyme activity occurred during the binding. Importantly, HAI-1 and the HGFA·HAI-1 complex were quickly released from the cell surface by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or interleukin 1β accompanying the generation of 58-kDa fragments of HAI-1, which are less potent against HGFA, as well as significant recovery of HGFA activity in the culture supernatant. This regulated shedding was completely inhibited by BB3103, a synthetic zinc-metalloproteinase inhibitor. We conclude that HAI-1 is not only an inhibitor but also a specific acceptor of active HGFA, acting as a reservoir of this enzyme on the cell surface. The latter property appears to ensure the concentrated pericellular HGFA activity in certain cellular conditions, such as tissue injury and inflammation, via the up-regulated shedding of HGFA·HAI-1 complex.

Because HGF is secreted as an inactive precursor form, proteolytic activation of the precursor form in the extracellular milieu is a critical limiting step in the HGF-induced signaling pathway. HGF activator (HGFA) is a factor XII-like serine proteinase having a critical role in the activation of HGF in injured tissue (3Shimomura T. Ochiai M. Kondo J. Morimoto Y.

Biochem. 1995; 229: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that local synthesis of HGFA inhibitors could have a critical regulatory role for HGFA activity in the injured tissue. HGFA inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) was initially identified as a potent inhibitor of HGFA present in a culture-conditioned medium of MKN45 gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (9Shimomura T. Denda K.

A second type of HGFA inhibitor (HAI-2) was subsequently identified (10Kawaguchi T. Qin L. Shimomura T. Kondo J. Matsumoto K. Denda K. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

Both HAI-1 and HAI-2/PB have two well-defined Kunitz inhibitor domains and a presumed transmembrane domain. In addition, HAI-1 has an LDL receptor-like domain between two Kunitz domains (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J.

Suganuma T. Shimomura T. Itoh H. Kitamura N. Nabeshima K. Koono M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Its localization on the cell surface as a transmembrane form integrated in the plasma membrane was also confirmed in a cultured epithelial cell line MKN45 (15Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matsumoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HAI-1 was first purified as a 40-kDa secreted protein from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Therefore, mature membrane-form HAI-1 can be proteolytically cleaved, and the resultant truncated form with Kunitz domain(s) is released into the extracellular space as a secreted form of HAI-1 (sHAI-1). Our recent observation indicated that there are multiple sites of proteolytic cleavage to release sHAI-1 and two major secreted forms, 40 and 58 kDa in size, were identified (15Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matsumoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 40-kDa sHAI-1 contains only the first Kunitz domain, whereas the 58-kDa form contains both Kunitz domains. Interestingly, the 58-kDa sHAI-1 showed a markedly lower affinity for HGFA than the initially identified 40-kDa sHAI-1 (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S.

To date, the precise functions of HAI-1 and HAI-2/PB in vivoare undefined. However, previous studies have shown that the cellular surface expression of HAI-1 is significantly up-regulated in the epithelial cells in response to tissue injury and regeneration, suggesting a potential role of HAI-1 in the survival and regeneration of the epithelial cells in vivo (14Kataoka H.

HGFA is secreted as an inactive single-chain 96-kDa zymogen (pro-HGFA) and is activated by thrombin in injured tissues via a cleavage at the bond between Arg407 and Ile408 resulting in a two-chain heterodimeric form (5Shimomura T.

Thus, it is important to investigate the regulation of HGF activation in the injured tissue in which HGFA and HAIs could be critically involved. Based on the circumstantial evidence that HAI-1, but not HAI-2/PB, is significantly up-regulated in injured and regenerating tissues (14Kataoka H. Suganuma T. Shimomura T. Itoh H. Kitamura N. Nabeshima K. Koono M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Itoh H. Kataoka H. Tomita M. Hamasuna R. Nawa Y. Kitamura N. Koono M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G635-G643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it can be hypothesized that, despite their similar molecular structures, the roles of HAI-1 and HAI-2/PB may be distinct from each other, and HAI-1 may have an undefined, selective, and important role in the injured tissue. It also remains to be determined whether membrane forms of HAI-1 and HAI-2/PB in fact interact with HGFA on the cellular surface.In this report, we describe evidence showing that active HGFA selectively binds to the membrane-form HAI-1, but not to HAI-2/PB, of epithelial cells, and that this binding is reversible. Further investigation revealed that membrane-form HAI-1 acts not only as a cellular surface inhibitor of HGFA but also as a reservoir for this enzyme. The latter function of HAI-1 paradoxically contributed to ensure the pericellular HGFA activity in certain cellular conditions via up-regulated shedding of the HGFA·HAI-1 complex from the cell surface followed by the recovery of HGFA activity. These results propose a novel important role of the membrane-type Kunitz inhibitor in the regulation of pericellular proteolysis.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we showed that only an active form of HGFA was bound to the epithelial cell surface. This binding was mediated by membrane-form HAI-1 and was considered to be a proteinase-proteinase inhibitor interaction, because the pretreatment of active HGFA with low molecular weight synthetic serine proteinase inhibitors abolished the binding completely. Therefore, it can be postulated that the membrane-form HAI-1 is a specific inhibitor of active HGFA acting on the epithelial cell surface. Rather surprisingly, although the molecular structure of HAI-2/PB is similar to HAI-1 having a transmembrane domain and two Kunitz domains, active HGFA was not complexed with the cellular HAI-2/PB. Thus, the membrane-form HAI-2/PB does not act as an HGFA inhibitor on the cell surface, although the secreted form of HAI-2/PB shows potent anti-HGFA activity in vitro (10Kawaguchi T. Qin L. Shimomura T. Kondo J. Matsumoto K. Denda K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27558-27564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 28Qin L. Denda K. Shimomura T. Kawaguchi T. Kitamura N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These observations support a hypothesis that HAI-1 and HAI-2/PB acquire distinct biological roles in vivoduring their evolution, although they might be derived from the same ancestor gene (29Itoh H. Yamauchi M. Kataoka H. Hamasuna R. Kitamura N. Koono M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3351-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HAI-1 has an LDL receptor-like domain that is absent in HAI-2/PB between two Kunitz inhibitor domains. Thus, it may be that the LDL receptor-like domain is somehow involved in the accessibility of active HGFA to the membrane-form HAI-1. Another possibility is that a Kunitz-containing part of HAI-2/PB is not exposed to the extracellular milieu but is exposed to a lumen of a vesicular compartment depending on its post-Golgi trafficking pathway. Although convincing evidence supporting this possibility is lacking at present, our previous immunohistochemical study showed that HAI-2/PB was preferentially stained intracellularly in the epithelial cells, whereas HAI-1 was stained on the basolateral cellular surface (14Kataoka H.

Alternatively, HAI-2/PB may be very quickly released from the cell surface.The most important aspect of this study is the demonstration that HGFA proteins complexed with membrane-form HAI-1 were released into the extracellular milieu by regulated shedding of the membrane-form HAI-1 followed by a considerable recovery of HGFA activity. This shedding was significantly enhanced by PMA or IL-1β in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner, accompanying the generation of 58-kDa sHAI-1 fragments. Previous study has revealed that this 58-kDa sHAI-1 shows a significantly lower affinity for HGFA than the 40-kDa one that was initially identified as an HGFA inhibitor in a conditioned medium of MKN45 cells (9Shimomura T.

Indeed, immunoprecipitation study indicated that only a minor portion of HGFA proteins was tightly complexed with 58-kDa sHAI-1 in the PMA-treated culture supernatant. Therefore, it is conceivable that, after regulated shedding of the HGFA·HAI-1 complex, an equation among the inhibitor (58-kDa sHAI-1), enzyme (active HGFA), and substrate (single-chain HGF) shifts in favor of the enzyme·substrate complex, eventually resulting in an efficient generation of an active two-chain form of HGF. Currently, the precise biochemical mechanism underlying the decreased affinity of 58-kDa sHAI-1 to HGFA is undefined. Because the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the 58-kDa form is identical to those of membrane-form HAI-1 and 40-kDa sHAI-1 (15Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matsumoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the 58-kDa form appears to be generated by the cleavage at the COOH-terminal region of the extracellular part of membrane-form HAI-1 (15Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matsumoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The similar immunoreactivity of 58-kDa sHAI-1 to C76-18 mAb and 1N7 mAb, recognized around the first and second Kunitz domains, respectively, confirmed the existence of both Kunitz domains in this form. The presence of the second Kunitz domain and free COOH terminus may somehow interfere with the binding of HGFA to the first domain that is responsible to the inhibition of HGFA (9Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

For instance, bikunin (the light chain of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor) also has two Kunitz domains, and proteinase binding to the second domain is affected by the presence of the first domain (30Morishita H. Yamakawa T. Matsusue T. Kusuyama T. Sameshima-Aruga R. Hirose J. Nii A. Miura T. Isaji M. Horisawa-Nakano R. Nagase Y. Kanamori T. Nobuhara M. Tanaka R. Koyama S. Nakatsuka M. Thromb.

Although the molecular mechanism involved in the dissociation of 58-kDa sHAI-1 and HGFA after regulated shedding remains to be clarified, these observations propose a novel and unexpected mechanism for the regulation of serine proteinase activity in the pericellular microenvironment, as well as on the cell surface, mediated by an integral membrane Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitor. In Fig. 10, we propose a hypothetical model for the regulation of pericellular HGFA activity by HAI-1 in which the membrane-form HAI-1 is acting not only as a cell-surface inhibitor of active HGFA but also as a reservoir for this enzyme protecting the active enzyme from other possibly co-existing inhibitor(s) of HGFA and concentrating the enzyme on the cell surface. This reservoir function would be terminated by the regulated shedding of the 58-kDa low affinity form of sHAI-1 followed by dissociation of active HGFA from 58-kDa sHAI-1 in the extracellular space, resulting in efficient activation of HGF in the pericellular microenvironment. In this model, the epithelial cell can utilize a single molecule (HAI-1) as a negative or positive regulator of pericellular proteinase activity depending on the cellular conditions, these being the levels of protein kinase C activation and presence or absence of cytokine stimulation. Importantly, HAI-1 inhibits not only HGFA but also other serine proteinases such as plasmin 2H. Kataoka, R. Hamasuna, H. Itoh, and M. Koono, unpublished observation.and matriptase, a recently identified matrix-degrading serine proteinase (32Lin C.-Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to test the possibility of whether the membrane-form HAI-1 can also serve as a reservoir for these enzymes and recruit the enzyme activity in the pericellular microenvironment. It is also interesting to know whether another integral membrane Kunitz-type inhibitor also exhibits the diverse functions similar to HAI-1 against its target proteinase. To date, three Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitors having a transmembrane domain have been reported in human species in addition to HAI-1. These include amyloid β protein precursor (APP), APP-like protein-2, and HAI-2/PB. All are type-I integral membrane proteins having one (APP and APP-like protein-2) or two (HAI-1 and HAI-2/PB) Kunitz domains, and their physiological functions have been poorly understood.A significant body of evidence is accumulating in favor of the existence of a general regulated shedding machinery acting on diverse groups of transmembrane proteins (34Hooper N.E. Karran E.C. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the proteinase responsible for the shedding of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is also involved in the shedding of various other proteins such as APP, L-selectin, and transforming growth factor-α (35Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J.

This TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) is a family member of the cell surface zinc-metalloproteinase called ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) (37Werb Z. Yan Y. Science. 1998; 282: 1279-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the shedding mediated by TACE has been shown to be significantly enhanced by PMA (35Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L.

Our observations, that the regulated shedding of HAI-1 was significantly enhanced by PMA and was completely inhibited by BB3103, a hydroxamic acid-based zinc-metalloproteinase inhibitor, suggest the crucial involvement of TACE or a TACE-like proteinase such as ADAM10, in this phenomenon, because BB3103 is a very efficient inhibitor for these proteinases (38Mitsiades N. Poulaki V. Kotoula V. Leone A. Tsokos M Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1947-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Shedding of the transmembrane proteins by TACE is caused by a cleavage of the juxtamembrane extracellular region of the transmembrane proteins. For example, the numbers of amino acids from the predicted transmembrane domain to the cleavage site are 20, 12, 11, and 9 in the shedding of TNFα, APP, L-selectin, and transforming growth factor-α, respectively (34Hooper N.E. Karran E.C. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Although we tried to determine the COOH-terminal amino acid sequence of 58-kDa sHAI-1, it was not successful. However, from this evidence, it seems likely that the distance of cleavage site for the generation of 58-kDa sHAI-1 from the predicted transmembrane domain may be around 10–20 amino acids. The identification of the precise cleavage site for the shedding of 58-kDa sHAI-1 would be necessary to clarify the mechanism of decreased affinity of this secreted form for active HGFA.Like APP (39Buxbaum J.D. Oishi M. Chen H.I. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Jaffe E.A. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10075-10078Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 40Seguchi K. Kataoka H.

Chem. 1999; 380: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the shedding of membrane-form HAI-1 and the HGFA·HAI-1 complex were also significantly enhanced by an inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. This finding may have an important implication for the understanding of HAI-1's role in vivo, because HAI-1 expression is up-regulated in the epithelial cells of injured and regenerating tissues (14Kataoka H.

Using human muscle cells we find that glycogen synthesis is stimulated by treatment of the cells with lithium ions, which inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3. Insulin further stimulates glycogen synthesis in the presence of lithium ions, an effect abolished by wortmannin and rapamycin. We report also that amino acids stimulate glycogen synthesis and glycogen synthase, these effects also being blocked by rapamycin and wortmannin. Amino acids stimulate p70 s6k and transiently inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3 without effects on the activity of protein kinase B or the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation decreases GS activity, and the extent of this inactivation depends on the sites phosphorylated and on the concentrations of allosteric effector molecules such as glucose-6-phosphate. Activation of GS by insulin results from dephosphorylation principally at a cluster of 3 serine residues collectively termed “site 3” located at the carboxyl terminus of GS (2Parker P.J. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Further evidence indicates that the phosphorylation state of site 2 (or 2a or both) is also decreased in response to insulin (3Skurat A.V. Dietrich A.D. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at site 3 is catalyzed principally by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), and dephosphorylation is catalyzed by the glycogen-bound form of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1; Refs. 1Cohen P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 4Lawrence J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both PP1 and PP2A can dephosphorylate sites 2 and 3 in vitro (2Parker P.J. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and there is evidence for a mechanism of the glycogen-bound form of PP1 activation by insulin that is mediated by p90 rsk (5Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Caudwell F.B. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 248: 302-308Crossref Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 6Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This provides an attractive theory for insulin exerting this stimulatory effect on GS by activating the glycogen-bound form of PP1. Recent evidence, however, has questioned this theory. Of particular significance is the finding that PD98059, which blocks activation of p90 rsk (7Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Attention has since focused on the effects of insulin on GSK-3. GSK-3 is inactivated in response to insulin or growth factors by phosphorylation at a single serine residue close to its amino terminus (11Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 12Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Three insulin-stimulated kinases, namely p70 s6k , p90 rsk , and protein kinase B (PKB), have been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3 in vitro (12Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). However, agents that prevent the activation of both p70 s6k and p90 rsk by insulin do not block the inactivation of GSK-3, strongly suggesting that the kinase acting under these conditions is PKB (14Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Despite accumulating evidence for a key role of PKB and GSK-3 in controlling GS, there is evidence for one or more alternative pathways contributing to the effect of insulin. First, GSK-3 does not phosphorylate GS at site 2, which is also dephosphorylated in response to insulin (3Skurat A.V. Dietrich A.D. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, use of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, which prevents the activation of p70 s6k (15Chung J. Kuo C.J.

Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), has provided evidence for contribution of a rapamycin-sensitive pathway to the activation of glycogen synthesis and GS by insulin in skeletal muscle, adipocytes, and hepatoma cells (10Hurel S.J.

In human muscle cells in culture, the activation of glycogen synthesis and GS by both insulin and epidermal growth factor is partly blocked by preincubation of the cells with rapamycin, which, however, is without effect on the inactivation of GSK-3 by these hormones (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Halse R. Rochford J.J. McCormack J.G.

This suggests that two pathways are contributing to the activation of glycogen synthesis in this system, the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1-PKB-GSK-3 pathway and a rapamycin-sensitive pathway, which can act downstream of, or independent of, GSK-3. To investigate this further, one approach is to activate the two pathways independently. Recent work has established that activation of p70 s6k can be regulated by the availability of amino acids. Amino acid starvation causes inactivation of p70 s6k , which can be reversed by the readdition of amino acids, a process that is rapamycin sensitive and that does not involve activation of PKB or p90 rsk (21Iiboshi Y.

After a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, 40 μl were spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper squares. After washing in 175 mm phosphoric acid with four changes, the papers were dried, and phosphate incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activity was defined as that which catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of phosphate into peptide substrate in 1 min. GSK-3 activity is that in the absence of Li+ minus that in its presence. PKBα was assayed after immunoprecipitation as described previously (28Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, the effect of the inhibitors wortmannin, rapamycin, and lithium on insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis was investigated in cultured human myoblasts (Fig.1). Insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis from extracellular glucose by ∼3-fold. This activation was completely blocked by wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, whereas only 40% inhibition was observed with rapamycin, which prevents the activation of p70 s6k . Rapamycin alone had little effect on basal glycogen synthesis, decreasing it by ∼10% (data not shown). Wortmannin alone, however, induced a decrease of ∼70%, implying that a wortmannin-sensitive mechanism is involved in basal glycogen synthesis. This is consistent with previous work from this laboratory (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem.

Work from several laboratories has indicated that the inactivation of GSK-3 is primarily responsible for dephosphorylation and activation of GS in response to insulin (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J.

Lithium is an allosteric inhibitor of GSK-3, mimicking the effect of insulin without affecting the activity of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (31Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with lithium chloride for 1 h caused a 3-fold increase in basal glycogen synthesis (Fig. 1), whereas no significant difference was observed in cells treated with an equal concentration of sodium chloride to correct for osmolarity changes (data not shown). This increase was not reduced significantly by wortmannin or by rapamycin (data not shown). In the presence of lithium, insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis a further 1.5-fold, an effect completely blocked by rapamycin (Fig. 1) or wortmannin (data not shown). Taken together, these data provide further support for a key role of GSK-3 and the presence of a rapamycin-sensitive, insulin-stimulated pathway in the control of glycogen synthesis. To investigate the role of this rapamycin-sensitive pathway further, amino acids were used to activate p70 s6k selectively (21Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), and the activity of GS and glycogen synthesis was measured (Fig.2). Myoblasts starved of amino acids for 5 h were then incubated in MEMS containing 2× concentrations of amino acids for various times. GS activity was measured, and the values are shown as a ratio of the GS fractional activity in the presence over the absence of amino acids in the culture medium. GS activity increased 2.5- and 2.0-fold in response to 2× concentrations of amino acids for 1 and 2 h, respectively. Glycogen synthesis increased ∼1.5-fold in response to 2× concentrations of amino acids for 2 h. Both of these responses were completely inhibited by wortmannin and rapamycin. PD98059 had no significant effect on the amino acid stimulation, inhibiting basal and stimulated values to similar extents (data not shown). To evaluate a possible role for p70 s6k in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis, the phosphorylation of this protein was measured under identical conditions. Fig.3 A shows that after 5 h of amino acid deprivation, readdition of 1× or 2× concentrations of amino acids resulted in the phosphorylation of p70 s6k at Thr389, the phosphorylation of which is most closely related to the activation of p70 s6k in vivo (32Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was further increased in response to insulin. This phosphorylation in response to amino acids was completely blocked by rapamycin, indicating that the amino acid activation of p70 s6k involves the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). A threshold level of amino acids is also required for the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of p70 s6k , because the increase in phosphorylation in response to insulin was reduced by ∼72% in cells incubated in the absence of amino acids compared with cells in the presence of amino acids (Fig.3 A), consistent with earlier findings (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 33Campbell L.E. Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p70 s6k in response to amino acids is time dependent, with a significant increase in phosphorylation appearing after 10 min and persisting for at least 2 h (Fig. 3 B). In all experiments endogenous levels of p70 s6k protein did not change, as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). To investigate whether amino acid deprivation and readdition were affecting GSK-3, its activity and phosphorylation status were established under identical conditions. Fig.4 shows that GSK-3 was inactivated by ∼30% in response to amino acids, an effect seen within 10 min of amino acid addition and which was reversed after 30 min. Following a recent publication showing the inactivation of GSK3 in response to exercise without corresponding phosphorylation (34Markuns J.F. Wojtaszewski J.F.P. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24896-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation status of GSK-3 was also measured. Corresponding Western blots show a direct correlation of inactivation with phosphorylation (Fig. 4). During this experiment there was no significant change in GSK-3 protein expression. Although these effects are consistent with p70 s6k causing inactivation of GSK-3 and activation of GS, it is important to exclude the involvement of PKB or the MAP kinase pathway. Importantly, there was no significant change in PKB activity under matching conditions (Fig.5), and the phosphorylation status of MAP kinase did not alter after amino acid withdrawal and readdition (data not shown). Wortmannin completely blocked the amino acid-induced inactivation and phosphorylation (Fig. 6) of GSK-3, whereas PD98059 was without effect (data not shown). Rapamycin essentially blocks the amino acid-induced phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3 (Fig. 6), indicating that the mTOR-p70 s6k pathway is principally responsible for the effects on GSK-3.Figure 5Effect of amino acids on PKB activity.Myoblasts were incubated in MEMS for 5 h before replacement of media with MEMS plus 2× AA for the times indicated or treated with 100 nm insulin for 10 min (I).

Stimulation of GS by insulin involves the net dephosphorylation of specific serine residues, termed sites 2 and 3 (35Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of GSK-3 has been shown to be principally responsible for dephosphorylation of site 3, but the factor regulating site 2 dephosphorylation remains unidentified. Glycogen synthesis can also be stimulated in an insulin-independent manner, for example, after exercise, a process associated with glycogen depletion (36Price T.B. Rothman D.L. Taylor R. Avison M.J. Shulman G.I. Shulman R.G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After glycogen depletion in cultured human muscle cells, readdition of glucose leads to the stimulation of GS by an as yet unknown mechanism but one that apparently does not involve phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3. 2J. L. Armstrong, S. M. Bonavaud, R. Halse, and S. J. Yeaman, unpublished data.Therefore, the role of GSK-3 in controlling glycogen synthesis was further investigated using its allosteric inhibitor lithium ions. Incubation of human myoblasts with lithium resulted in a significant increase in glycogen synthesis in these cells, which is consistent with a major role for GSK-3 in controlling glycogen synthesis. However, the addition of insulin resulted in a further, rapamycin-sensitive increase in glycogen synthesis, indicating a contribution by an alternative insulin- and rapamycin-sensitive pathway. The obvious candidate is the p70 s6k signaling pathway, which fulfills both these criteria and for which we and others have obtained evidence previously (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,17Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Siddle K. Biochem.

To investigate this further we have used the findings that it is possible to activate p70 s6k in a rapamycin-sensitive manner using amino acids, without the parallel activation of PKB or MAP kinase that occurs with insulin stimulation (21Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1092-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Wang X. Campbell L.E.

We show here that amino acid depletion and subsequent readdition also lead to the stimulation of GS and glycogen synthesis (Fig. 2, A and B), effects that are completely blocked by both wortmannin and rapamycin. A key question is whether this activation involves inhibition of GSK-3. As shown in Fig. 4, GSK-3 is phosphorylated and inactivated in response to amino acids. Three kinases, namely p70 s6k , p90 rsk , and PKB, have been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3 in vitro(12Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Importantly, the present work and previous data (21Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1092-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Wang X. Campbell L.E. Miller C.M. Proud C.G. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) show that amino acids failed to activate PKB or the MAP kinase pathway. However, p70 s6k is phosphorylated and presumably activated by amino acids (Fig. 3). Furthermore, GSK-3 inhibition is completely blocked by both wortmannin and rapamycin, implying that the p70 s6k pathway is primarily responsible for the inactivation of GSK-3 in response to amino acids. Very recent work on amino acid transport in rat L6 myotubes has shown that leucine inactivates GSK-3 in a rapamycin-sensitive manner without activation of either PKB or the MAP kinase pathway (37Peyrollier K. Hajduch E. Blair A.S. Hyde R. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The transient nature of the inhibition of GSK-3 (maximal after 15 min) does not coincide with the prolonged activation of GS and p70 s6k , which persists up to 2 h (Fig. 2 A). It is possible that transient inactivation of GSK-3 triggers the activation of GS, which could then be maintained by a further rapamycin-sensitive pathway, perhaps acting on GS without involvement of GSK-3. This is supported by the data in Fig. 1, which indicate that when GSK-3 is inhibited by lithium ions, insulin can further stimulate glycogen synthesis in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. This would be consistent also with earlier work on insulin effects in human muscle cells (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Halse R. Rochford J.J. McCormack J.G. Vandenheede J.R. Hemmings B.A. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) that showed that rapamycin has no effect on the activation of GS in skeletal muscle up to 5 min after stimulation by insulin but has a significant inhibitory effect at longer time points. The amino acid-stimulated activation of p70 s6k observed in the human muscle cell lines is wortmannin and rapamycin sensitive. Rapamycin acts by associating with a cellular protein, FKBP12, and this complex then binds to mTOR, thus inhibiting its kinase activity. This would therefore indicate that mTOR is required for the response to amino acids, either directly or through the regulation of a downstream element, such as p70 s6k or a protein phosphatase. Although mTOR has been shown to phosphorylate p70 s6k directly in vitro (39Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), recent evidence points to the existence of a phosphatase, which is activated by rapamycin, via the inhibition of mTOR (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 40Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is also implicated because of its wortmannin sensitivity, but it has previously been reported that wortmannin can selectively inhibit mTOR directly by binding to the catalytic domain at concentrations of 0.1–1 μm (41Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 42Withers D.J. Ouwens D.M. Nave B.T. van der Zon G.C.M.

Therefore, it is possible that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase does not play a role in this mechanism despite the wortmannin-sensitive nature of the process. It has also recently been reported that phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 can phosphorylate p70 s6k in vivo (43Balendran A. Currie R. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence to date to suggest that phosphinositide-dependent kinase 1 kinase activity is increased in response to amino acids, especially because PKB activity does not increase (Fig. 5). Because of the sustained amino acid-stimulated activation of p70 s6k and the sensitivity to both wortmannin and rapamycin, this leads to the reasoning that this enzyme is part of the signal mechanism involved in the amino acid-stimulated increase in GS and glycogen synthesis activities. It is important to point out that p70 s6k itself may not play a role, and events may stem directly from mTOR. It has recently been discovered that mTOR is involved in the regulation of PP2A (40Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), a phosphatase known to act on GSK-3 in vitro. This could provide evidence to support a theory whereby GSK-3 is regulated by this phosphatase in response to amino acid availability. PP2A also has the ability to dephosphorylate GS at sites 2 and 3, leading to its activation; therefore, this phosphatase may play a coordinating role in the overall process. In summary, the work reported here demonstrates that amino acid availability can regulate glycogen synthesis. Furthermore, it demonstrates that GSK-3 can be inactivated within cells independent of activation of PKB and p90 rsk .

Three models for the processing of ligands bound to cell surface HSPGs have been proposed. The simplest conceptually is endocytosis mediated directly by the HSPGs, a process for which substantial evidence now exists (reviewed in Refs. 4Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin.

The second model involves an initial binding of ligands to HSPGs followed by recruitment of auxiliary cell surface molecules, such as LDL receptor family members, that then mediate ligand internalization (9Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P-H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14168-14175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Beisiegel U. Krapp A. Weber W.

The precise mechanism for this cooperation between HSPGs and LDL receptor family members may involve ligand transfer or ternary complex formation, although no direct evidence to date can distinguish between these possibilities. The third model involves binding to HSPGs followed by conformational changes that then allow the ligand to interact with a high affinity, proteinaceous receptor, such as the HSPG-dependent binding of fibroblast growth factor-2 to its tyrosine kinase-linked receptor (13Rapraeger A.C.

For each of these three models, but particularly the first, the nature of the cell surface HSPG is a key determinant of subsequent cellular catabolism (4Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin.

We previously reported that lipoprotein lipase (LpL), a heparin-binding protein, enhances cellular catabolism of atherogenic lipoproteinsin vitro by bridging between the lipoproteins and cell surface HSPGs (17Williams K.J.

Interestingly, HSPG-mediated catabolism of LpL-enriched lipoproteins in vitro exhibits at least two kinetically distinct components, one leading to lysosomal degradation of ligand within 4 h and the other apparently much slower (18Williams K.J.

Very slow catabolism of HSPG-bound ligands has also been found in the liver in vivo (28Windler E. Greeve J. Robenek H. Rinninger F. Greten H. Jäckle S. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 344-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), particularly in the absence of LDL receptors (24Mortimer B.C. Beveridge D.J. Martins I.J. Redgrave T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28767-28776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In exploring the molecular basis of these observations, we recently discovered that the syndecan family of transmembrane HSPGs directly mediates efficient endocytosis of multimeric ligands, with a t1/2 for internalization of ∼1 h, through a pathway that is triggered by clustering, acts independently of coated pits, and relies upon cholesterol-rich membrane rafts and the cytoskeleton (4Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 252-261Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J.

Importantly, syndecan-mediated ligand catabolism leads to nearly complete degradation in lysosomes within 4 h (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the current study, we focused on ligand catabolism via the perlecan HSPG, a completely extracellular molecule that is genetically distinct from the syndecan family (31Noonan D.M. Fulle A.

Dyn. 1997; 210: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Perlecan is an attractive candidate for mediating ligand catabolism, because this molecule is abundant in the hepatic space of Disse and within the arterial wall (32Iozzo R.V. Cohen I.R. Grassel S.

Ross R. Gold L.I. Wight T.N. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 533-546PubMed Google Scholar), two important locations of HSPG-mediated ligand catabolism in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that cell surface perlecan HSPG mediates a distinct pathway for ligand internalization and lysosomal delivery that is kinetically and biochemically distinct from either coated pit internalization or syndecan-mediated catabolism but is consistent with the second, slower pathway for direct HSPG-mediated processing of ligands. Unless otherwise indicated, chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma. Bovine LpL (EC3.1.1.34) was purified from milk by heparin-agarose chromatography (39Socorro L. Green C.C.

LDL was isolated from fresh human plasma by ultracentrifugation (1.019 <d < 1.063 g/ml) and then radioiodinated by the iodine monochloride method (42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). To allow examination of LDL receptor-independent pathways, most preparations of125I-labeled LDL were reductively methylated (125I-mLDL) to modify approximately 35% of the lysine residues, thereby abolishing LDL receptor binding (43Jentoft N.

Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol.

Inhibitory antibodies against β1 integrins were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Genistein was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Because of its extremely large size (∼467 kDa), no expression vectors to date exist for the perlecan core protein. Instead, we relied upon a variant colon carcinoma cell line, WiDr (ATCC no. CCL 218, also known as HT-29) (48Chen T.R. Drabkowski D. Hay R.J. Macy M. Peterson Jr., W. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1987; 27: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), that synthesizes perlecan but no other proteoglycans and incorporates [35S]sulfate nearly completely (>95%) into the heparan sulfate side chains covalently linked to the perlecan core protein (49Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 50Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1888-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Dodge G.R. Kovalszky I. Hassell J.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18023-18029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other proteoglycans, if present, are below the limits of detection. This key property of WiDr cells has been verified by several independent methods, including the identification of the perlecan core protein based on its unusual size and reactivity to specific antibodies and identification of the side chains by digestion with nitrous acid or heparitinase (49Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 403-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 50Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1888-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Dodge G.R. Kovalszky I.

The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, transfected with an expression vector for the human syndecan-1 core protein (CHO-Synd1), was described previously (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R.

The CHO mutant line pgsD-677 (CHO-677), which is specifically deficient in both N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and glucuronosyltransferase activities and hence lacks heparan sulfate (52Esko J.D.

WiDr cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and both types of CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in 15-mm wells to approximately 90% confluence in serum-supplemented media. For all experimental incubations, cells were changed to 0.5 ml of the corresponding serum-free medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma catalog no. A-8806), 125I-labeled lipoproteins, or125I-LpL (5 μg of protein/ml) and either unlabeled LpL (5 μg of protein/ml) or a matching volume of lipase buffer (54Williams K.J. Petrie K.A. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 or 21 h in these media, and then surface-bound (heparin-releasable), intracellular (heparin-resistant), and degraded (assessed by trichloroacetic acid-soluble, CHCl3-insoluble radioactivity in media) ligand was quantitated (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 54Williams K.J. Petrie K.A. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To assess the efficiency of endocytosis, we calculated ligand internalization as the sum of intracellular accumulation plus degradation, as described previously (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Internalization calculated in this fashion takes into account ligand still within the cells, as well as ligand that had been taken up by cells but then degraded into amino acids, which the cells release to the culture media. In initial experiments, we followed the common procedure of placing labeled ligands into the cell culture medium and then leaving a continuous supply of unbound ligands throughout the course of the incubations at 37 °C (42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Subsequently, to examine in detail the kinetics of ligand internalization and degradation, labeled ligands were incubated with cells in serum-free medium for 1 h at 4 °C, to allow surface binding without further catabolism, and the cells were washed at 4 °C to remove unbound material. Fresh media at 37 °C with no ligands were then added, and incubations were continued at 37 °C for the indicated times (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Assays for surface-bound, intracellular, and degraded ligand were then performed, and ligand internalization was calculated as above. Although deiodination of labeled protein has been shown to be at most a minor cellular process during incubations at 37 °C lasting up to 5 h (42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), our control experiments indicated accumulation of CHCl3-soluble radioactivity in culture media during prolonged incubations (overnight or longer), due to cell-mediated deiodination of extracellular125I-amino acids. Thus, our measurements of degradation during prolonged incubations to characterize the kinetics of the perlecan pathway included all trichloroacetic acid-soluble125I radioactivity. In some experiments, trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the media was also quantified, as an indication of retroendocytosis or desorption of intact ligand from the cell surface during the incubation at 37 °C. To verify the role of heparan sulfate side chains of perlecan in binding and catabolism of LpL·125I-mLDL, cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37 °C with heparitinase (5.5 units/ml; Sigma catalogue no. H 8891), and heparitinase was kept in the incubation medium at 37 °C with labeled ligand until the end of the experiment, to prevent reassembly of HS side chains (see Ref. 18Williams K.J. Fless G.M. Petrie K.A. Snyder M.L. Brocia R.W. Swenson T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13284-13292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because heparan-binding components of serum may interfere with heparitinase digestion, these cells were placed into serum-free medium at least 1 h before the heparitinase pretreatment and kept serum-free until the end of the experiment (55Tabas I. Li Y. Brocia R.W. Xu S.W. Swenson T.L. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20419-20432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the role of lysosomes in ligand degradation, we incubated cells at 37 °C with ligand in the presence of chloroquine (150 μm), an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases (42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). To manipulate LDL receptors (42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), some experiments with WiDr cells included an 18-h preincubation without serum supplementation, in the absence or presence of a mixture of 2 μg of 25-hydroxycholesterol with 40 μg of cholesterol per ml. To examine intracellular processes involved in ligand catabolism via the perlecan HSPG, LpL·125I-mLDL was bound to the cell surface at 4 °C, and residual unbound ligand was washed away, as described above. Specific inhibitors were then added simultaneously with fresh medium at 37 °C, without additional ligand, and the extent of internalization of LpL·125I-mLDL from the cell surface was assessed after 2 h at 37 °C. The inhibitors included freshly prepared genistein (0–400 μm), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (56Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that blocks syndecan-mediated endocytosis (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and cytochalasin D (0–2 μm), which disrupts the cytoskeleton (57Miranda A.F. Godman G.C. Tanenbaum S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 62: 406-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and inhibits the syndecan internalization pathway (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In control experiments to examine the effects of these inhibitors on internalization mediated by syndecan HSPGs or by LDL receptors, which proceed at different rates, we followed our previous approach of assessing the extent of ligand internalization after 45 min and 10 min, respectively (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This design produces similar degrees of ligand internalization for all three pathways in the absence of inhibitors (∼30–50% of the initially surface-bound ligand becomes internalized during the incubations at 37 °C). Because coated pit-mediated internalization is so rapid (t1/2 ∼ 5–10 min) (58Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar) and may finish before inhibitors have time to act, our experiments examining the LDL receptor pathway also included a 30-min preincubation at 37 °C with each inhibitor before chilling the cells to 4 °C for binding125I-labeled native LDL to the cell surface (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The effect of genistein has been reported to fade (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 60Luton F. Buferne M. Davoust J. Schmitt-Verhulst A.M. Boyer C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar), so cells were exposed to this agent for a maximum of 2 h. We also examined the effects of excess, unlabeled RAP on perlecan-mediated internalization. To maximize its effect, RAP (50 μg/ml) was present in these experiments during three periods: a 30-min preincubation at 37 °C, the incubation at 4 °C to allow surface binding of LpL-enriched 125I-mLDL, and the final incubation at 37 °C to allow cellular catabolism of surface-bound LpL·125I-mLDL. Studies of the effects of antibodies against β1 integrins (10 μg/ml) followed the same protocol used for RAP. All results for 125I-lipoprotein catabolism were normalized to cellular protein (61Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5307) Google Scholar), which averaged 181 μg/well (WiDr) and 67 μg/well (all types of CHO cells). To perform these experiments, we took advantage of the fact that most perlecan from WiDr cells is secreted, not surface-bound, so WiDr-conditioned medium is a rich source of this molecule. Moreover, even cell surface-bound perlecan HSPG is still entirely extracellular, so other cell types can be enriched in this molecule simply by incubation in WiDr-conditioned medium. As our target cell for enrichment with perlecan HSPG, the CHO-677 mutant was chosen for several reasons. First, LDL receptors (62Sege R.D. Kozarsky K.F. Krieger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3268-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the LRP (63FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and direct syndecan-mediated endocytosis (29Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) have all been examined in CHO cells, thereby allowing comparison with perlecan-mediated catabolism in a single cell type. Second, in our preliminary control experiments, Northern blotting of CHO mRNA revealed no detectable levels of the perlecan core protein message (data not shown). Third, the CHO-677 mutant makes no HS side chains (52Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which eliminates background from other HSPGs. WiDr-conditioned medium was prepared by incubating six 100-mm dishes of confluent WiDr monolayers for 24 h at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM.

https://openalex.org/W2075082852,"The nuclear genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes 35 members of a family of membrane proteins. Known members transport substrates and products across the inner membranes of mitochondria. We have localized two hitherto unidentified family members, Odc1p and Odc2p, to the inner membranes of mitochondria. They are isoforms with 61% sequence identity, and we have shown in reconstituted liposomes that they transport the oxodicarboxylates 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate by a strict counter exchange mechanism. Intraliposomal adipate and glutarate and to a lesser extent malate and citrate supported [14C]oxoglutarate uptake. The expression of Odc1p, the more abundant isoform, made in the presence of nonfermentable carbon sources, is repressed by glucose. The main physiological roles of Odc1p and Odc2p are probably to supply 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol where they are used in the biosynthesis of lysine and glutamate, respectively, and in lysine catabolism.

Papa S. Guerrieri F. Tager J.M. Frontiers in Cellular Bioenergetics. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 489-519Google Scholar). The sequences of members of this family are made of three related domains of about 100 amino acids repeated in tandem, each probably being folded into two transmembrane α-helices joined by an extensive hydrophilic sequence. The three repeats are linked by shorter hydrophilic sequences. The repeats in the various family members are all related, and various sequence features are conserved (2Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 519-526Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The nuclear genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes 35 members of this family (4Palmieri L. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). They include three isoforms of the ADP/ATP translocase and the carriers for phosphate, citrate, dicarboxylate, ornithine, succinate-fumarate, oxaloacetate-sulfate, and carnitine (see Ref. 5Palmieri L.

As described here, they have been overexpressed in S. cerevisiae and shown to be isoforms in the inner mitochondrial membrane where they transport C5–C7 oxodicarboxylic acids, including 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate, by a counter exchange mechanism. The main physiological roles of these novel transporters are likely to be in cytoplasmic biosynthesis of lysine and glutamate by supplying 2-oxoadipate and 2-oxoglutarate from the mitochondrial matrix and in lysine catabolism. Deletion of the yeast nuclear genes ODC1 (ORF YPL134c) and ODC2 (ORF Y0R222w) was accomplished by sequential homologous recombination of the auxotrophic markers TRP1 and HIS3 at the respective loci of S. cerevisiae YPH499 strain (wild type: MATa ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3-52 trp1-Δ63 lys2-801). Deletants were verified by polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Yeast cells were precultured on synthetic complete medium (8Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) supplemented with 3% glycerol and 0.1% glucose. Tryptophan, histidine, and uracil were omitted where the genotype permitted. For growth studies, exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with growth medium and diluted with the same medium until a final optical density of 5 × 10−3 at 600 nm was reached. For the preparation of mitochondria, precultures were diluted 35-fold in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, pH adjusted to 4.8 with HCl) and grown in the presence of the same carbon sources to mid exponential phase. Galactose (0.45%) was added 6 h before harvesting. For the estimation of the expression of ODCs, yeast cells were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase in YP medium supplemented with either 2% glucose, 2% galactose, 3% glycerol, 2% ethanol, or 3% lactate and then harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 5 min). Extractions of mitochondria with sodium carbonate or with digitonin were performed as described previously (6Palmieri L. Vozza A. Agrimi G. De Marco V. Runswick M.J. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22184-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine the amount of Odc1p and Odc2p in wild type mitochondria, standard calibration curves were constructed using 10–500 ng of pure recombinant ODC proteins as standards. After transfer of the proteins to the same nitrocellulose membrane, the standards and the mitochondrial samples were immunodecorated simultaneously. Once it had been verified that the sample loading was within the linear range of the calibration curves, the densitometric signal intensity was used to measure the amount of Odc1p and Odc2p. The coding sequences of ODC1 and ODC2 were amplified from S. cerevisiaegenomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to the extremities of the ODC sequences with additional HindIII andBamHI sites, respectively. The reverse primers also contained 18 additional bases encoding a six-histidine tag immediately before the translational termination codon. The products of polymerase chain reaction were cloned into the expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The resulting expression plasmids (pODC1 or pODC2) were introduced in the odc1Δodc2Δ double mutant, and transformants (odc1Δodc2Δ/pODC1 or odc1Δodc2Δ/pODC2 cells) were selected for uracil auxotrophy. Other experimental conditions have been described before (9Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24754-24759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from odc1Δodc2Δ/pODC1 or odc1Δodc2Δ/pODC2 cells according to standard procedures (10Daum G. Gasser S.M. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13075-13080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and solubilized in buffer A (500 mm NaCl, 10 mmPIPES, pH 7.0)2 containing 0.8% digitonin (w/v) and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 0.2–0.4 mg protein/ml. After incubation for 20 min at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged (138,000 × g, 20 min). The supernatant (1.1 ml) was mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 0.45 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) previously equilibrated with buffer A. Then the resin was packed into a column (0.5-cm internal diameter) and washed extensively with the following buffers: B, 500 mm NaCl, 0.8% digitonin, 10 mmimidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 7.5% glycerol, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.5 (2 ml); C, 300 mm NaCl, 0.8% digitonin, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.5 (2 ml); D, 100 mm NaCl, 0.6% digitonin, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.5 (1 ml); and E, 50 mm NaCl, 0.3% digitonin, 10 mm imidazole, glycerol 0.5%, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0 (1 ml). Finally pure ODC proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 50 mmNaCl, 0.1% digitonin, 80 mm imidazole, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0. Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method modified for the presence of detergent (11Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) or by laser densitometry (9Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24754-24759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 17.5% gels (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) and either stained with Coomassie blue dye or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The identities of purified Odc1p and Odc2p were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of trypsin digests of the corresponding bands excised from a Coomassie-stained gel. Western blotting was carried out with rabbit antibodies against the bacterially expressed ODC proteins. The overproduction of ODC isoforms as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytosol and the purification of the inclusion bodies in host strainEscherichia coli C0214(DE3) have been described previously (9Fiermonte G. Palmieri L. Dolce V. Lasorsa F.M. Palmieri F. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24754-24759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The films were scanned with an LKB 2202 Ultroscan laser densitometer. Purified ODC proteins were reconstituted by cyclic removal of the detergent with a hydrophobic column (13Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The composition of the initial mixture used for reconstitution was: 200 μl of purified isoform (0.3–0.4 μg of protein), 70 μl of 10% Triton X-114, 100 μl of 10% phospholipids in the form of sonicated liposomes, 20 mm oxoglutarate (except where otherwise indicated), 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.7 mg of cardiolipin (Sigma), and water to a final volume of 700 μl. These components were mixed throughly, and the mixture was recycled 13 times through an Amberlite column (Supelco) (3.0 × 0.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, and with the substrate at the same concentration as in the starting mixture. All operations were performed at 4 °C, except the passages through Amberlite, which were carried out at room temperature. External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on a Sephadex G-75 column preequilibrated with buffer F (50 mm NaCl and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0). Transport at 25 °C was started by adding [14C]oxoglutarate (unless otherwise indicated) to the proteoliposomes and terminated by addition of 30 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and 10 mm bathophenanthroline (the “inhibitor stop” method (13Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). In controls, inhibitors were added with the labeled substrate. The external radioactivity was removed on Sephadex G-75, and the internal radioactivity was measured. The transport activity was the difference between experimental and control values. The initial rate of transport was calculated in mmol/min/g protein from the time course of isotope equilibration (13Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Various other transport activities were also assayed by the inhibitor stop method. For efflux measurements, the internal substrate pool of the proteoliposomes was made radioactive by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration (13Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) with 0.1 mm[14C]oxoglutarate added at high specific radioactivity. After 60 min, the residual external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes again through a column of Sephadex G-75. Efflux was started by adding unlabeled external substrate or buffer F alone and terminated by adding the inhibitors indicated above. Immunoreactive bands on SDS-PAGE gels were detected with antibodies against Odc1p and Odc2p. Bands with apparent molecular masses of about 36.5 and 35.0 kDa, respectively, were detected in wild type mitochondria (Fig.1, lane 1) but not in mitochondria from the odc1Δodc2Δ double mutant (Fig. 1, lane 2). The antibody against Odc2p cross-reacted with Odc1p (upper band), and both antibodies reacted with an unidentified band of about 33.0 kDa that was also present in the odc1Δodc2Δ mitochondria. The contents of the ADP/ATP carrier and (not shown) the phosphate, succinate-fumarate and dicarboxylate carriers detected with specific antibodies were essentially the same in both wild type and odc1Δodc2Δ mitochondria. Therefore, the absence of both ODC proteins from the double mutant does not affect the expression of other mitochondrial carriers. Furthermore, the phenotype of the odc1Δodc2Δ strain was studied by comparison of the growth of the mutant cell with the parental strain in shake flask cultures on different media. Both the wild type and the deletion strain yeast exhibited substantial and similar growth on either rich medium (YP) or synthetic complete medium supplemented with either 2% glucose, 2% galactose, 3% glycerol, 2% ethanol or 3% lactate, indicating that the absence of the ODC proteins does not impair the respiratory function of mitochondria. The submitochondrial location of Odc1p and Odc2p was examined by separation of soluble and peripheral proteins from integral membrane proteins of wild type mitochondria by carbonate treatment (Fig.2). Both Odc1p and Odc2p remained in the membrane protein fraction, as did the ADP/ATP carrier and (not shown) Tom40p (marker proteins of inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, respectively), but the matrix protein hsp70 and (not shown) the intermembrane space protein cytochrome b 2 were in the soluble and peripheral protein fraction. In other experiments, at 0.3% digitonin more than 80% of the outer membrane protein Tom40p, and less than 10% of Odc1p, Odc2p and the ADP/ATP carrier, were solubilized from wild type mitochondria. At higher levels of digitonin, Odc1p and Odc2p were solubilized progressively in parallel with the ADP/ATP carrier (data not shown). Therefore, Odc1p and Odc2p are integral proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Odc1p and Odc2p were overexpressed at high levels in aS. cerevisiae strain devoid of both corresponding genes (odc1Δodc2Δ strain) (Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 4). Their apparent molecular masses were about 38 and 37 kDa (the calculated values including the initiator methionine and the histidine tail were 35,006 and 34,807 Da, respectively). The successful overexpression and targeting of the episomal Odc1p and Odc2p to mitochondria was confirmed by Western blotting of isolated mitochondria from the odc1Δodc2Δ/p0DC strains (Fig. 1, lane 3), because the amount of mitochondrial protein applied in lane 3 of Fig. 1 was 2.5 (from odc1Δodc2Δ/p0DC1 cells) and 25 (from odc1Δodc2Δ/p0DC2 cells) times less than the amount of wild type mitochondrial protein applied in lane 1 of Fig. 1. The differences in the molecular mass of immunodecorated bands in lane 3 (odc1Δodc2Δ/p0DC mitochondria) and lane 1 (wild type mitochondria) are a reflection of the presence of a C-terminal histidine tag in the recombinant proteins. The presence of the histidine tail at the C-terminal end of the expressed ODC isoforms allowed their purification by a Ni+-agarose affinity column (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and6, and Fig. 1, lane 4). About 0.7 mg of Odc1p and about 0.1 mg of Odc2p were obtained per liter of culture. The identity of purified Odc1p and Odc2p was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with digitonin-solubilized mitochondria isolated from odc1Δodc2Δ/p0DC1 or odc1Δodc2Δ/p0DC2 strains were able to catalyze an active [14C]oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate homoexchange (TableI). A lower oxoglutarate transport was observed upon reconstitution of the digitonin extract from wild type mitochondria, whereas liposomes reconstituted with the extract from odc1Δodc2Δ mitochondria showed a very low but reproducible oxoglutarate exchange. Furthermore, oxoglutarate transport measured upon reconstitution of the mitochondrial extract isolated from the double deletion strain transformed with the pYES2 vector harboring the sequence encoding the yeast oxaloacetate carrier (odc1Δodc2Δ/pOAC1 strain) (6Palmieri L.

Open table in a new tab Proteoliposomes were preloaded internally with 20 mmoxoglutarate. Transport was started by the external addition of 0.1 mm [14C]oxoglutarate. The data represent the means ± S.D. of at least three different experiments. The purified and reconstituted Odc1p and Odc2p catalyzed a very active [14C]oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange, which was inhibited by a mixture of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline. No such activity was found with Odc1p and Odc2p that had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes. Likewise, no [14C]oxoglutarate uptake was observed into proteoliposomes that did not contain internal oxoglutarate, indicating that Odc1p and Odc2p do not catalyze a unidirectional transport (uniport) of oxoglutarate but only the exchange reaction. To obtain further information about the mechanism of transport catalyzed by Odc1p and Odc2p, the efflux of [14C]oxoglutarate from prelabeled active proteoliposomes was investigated because it provides a more convenient assay for unidirectional transport (13Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). An experiment performed with proteoliposomes reconstituted with Odc1p is shown in Fig. 4. In the absence of external substrate, no efflux was observed even after incubation for 1 h. However, upon addition of external oxoglutarate, an extensive efflux of intraliposomal radioactivity occurred, and this efflux was prevented completely by the presence of the inhibitors pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline (Fig. 4). Similar data were obtained using Odc2p instead of Odc1p. These results show clearly that reconstituted Odc1p and Odc2p catalyze an obligatory exchange reaction of internal oxoglutarate for external oxoglutarate. Furthermore, the proteoliposomes did not catalyze homoexchanges for glutamate, aspartate, 2-oxoisocaproate, glutamine, ornithine, ADP, phosphate, sulfate, and carnitine (internal concentration, 10 mm; external concentration, 1 mm). The substrate specificity of purified Odc1p and Odc2p was investigated further by measuring the uptake of [14C]oxoglutarate into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with various substrates. As shown in Table II, [14C]oxoglutarate was taken up efficiently by proteoliposomes containing internal oxoglutarate, 2-oxoadipate, 2-oxopimelate, glutarate, adipate, pimelate, l-malate, andd-malate. A much lower activity was observed in the presence of internal oxaloacetate, succinate, citrate, and isocitrate. A very low activity was found with internal malonate, suberate, fumarate, and maleate, and (not shown) no exchange was found with oxalate, aspartate, glutamate, 2-aminoadipate, 2-aminopimelate, pyruvate, 2-oxobutyrate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, 2-oxovalerate, 2-oxoisocaproate, phosphate, sulfate, thiosulfate, ADP, ATP, ornithine, glutamine, and carnitine.Table IIDependence on internal substrate of the transport properties of proteoliposomes reconstituted with recombinant Odc1p or Odc2pInternal substrate[14C]Oxoglutarate transportOdc1pOdc2pmmol/min/g proteinNone (Cl− present)0.40.2Oxaloacetate31.85.52-Oxoglutarate112.527.82-Oxoadipate85.022.12-Oxopimelate71.614.8Malonate4.82.2Succinate19.14.3Glutarate81.117.6Adipate65.016.7Pimelate48.410.4Suberate2.80.4l-Malate56.411.4d-Malate52.110.5Fumarate8.92.4Maleate7.12.6Citrate28.68.0l-Isocitrate19.43.7Proteoliposomes were preloaded internally with various substrates (concentration, 20 mm).

The [14C]oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange reactions catalyzed by reconstituted Odc1p and Odc2p were inhibited strongly by mercurials (mersalyl, p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate, and mercuric chloride), by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, by bathophenanthroline, and by α-cyanocinnamate (Table III). Also, both Odc1p and Odc2p were inhibited considerably byN-ethylmaleimide. The impermeable dicarboxylate analogues butylmalonate and phenylsuccinate, which are known to be powerful inhibitors of the oxoglutarate and dicarboxylate carriers (14Palmieri F. Quagliariello E.

Also, the tricarboxylate analogue 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate, a very efficient inhibitor of the citrate carrier (16Palmieri F. Stipani I. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J.

Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments in duplicate. In addition, the ability of nonradioactive potential substrates to inhibit the oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange was examined. The effectiveness of dicarboxylates and 2-oxodicarboxylates with different carbon chain length on the rate of oxoglutarate uptake are compared in Fig. 5. With both reconstituted Odc1p and (not shown) Odc2p, glutarate, adipate, and pimelate with 5–7 carbon atoms caused a significant inhibition of oxoglutarate uptake, whereas oxalate, malonate, succinate, and suberate had virtually no effect. The presence of a carbonyl group on the dicarboxylate molecule enhanced the inhibitory effect of the compounds with a maximum of inhibition at six carbon atoms. In similar experiments (not shown) the effect of other dicarboxylates on the rate of oxoglutarate uptake catalyzed by the recombinant and reconstituted Odc1p and Odc2p was also tested. The presence of a hydroxyl group on the C4dicarboxylate molecule (as in malate) increased about 10-fold the extent of the inhibition of oxoglutarate uptake with respect to the corresponding dicarboxylate. Also, l- andd-tartrate inhibited the uptake of oxoglutarate more efficiently than succinate, their inhibitory effect being comparable with that of malate. However, the C5 hydroxydicarboxylate, hydroxyglutarate, was slightly less effective than glutarate, and the C3 hydroxydicarboxylate (tartronate) was completely ineffective like the corresponding dicarboxylate. Both thecis- and trans-unsaturated dicarboxylates, fumarate and maleate, had no effect, nor had the aminodicarboxylates.d,l-Threo-hydroxyaspartate has been reported to inhibit the uptake of oxoglutarate into intact yeast mitochondria (18Perkins M. Haslam J.M. Linnane A.W. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but it had no effect on oxoglutarate transport catalyzed by reconstituted Odc1p and Odc2p. In view of the inhibition of oxoglutarate uptake by dicarboxylates carrying a carbonyl group, the effect of oxomonocarboxylates on the rate of uptake of 0.4 mm oxoglutarate was also tested. Pyruvate, 2-oxovalerate 2-oxobutyrate, 2-oxoisocaproate, and 5-oxohexanoate (all at 8 mm concentration, i.e. 20 times greater than the substrate) did not influence the rate of oxoglutarate uptake (data not shown). Finally, several aminomonocarboxylates, (glycine, alanine, valine, threonine, and serine), and other amino acids (glutamine, asparagine, lysine, arginine, histidine, and ornithine) had no effect on the oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange (data not shown). The kinetic constants of the recombinant purified Odc1p and Odc2p were determined by measuring the initial transport rate at various external [14C]oxoglutarate concentrations, in the presence of a constant saturating internal concentration of 20 mmoxoglutarate. The transport affinities (K m ) and the specific activities (V max) for the oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange at 25 °C, were 0.52 ± 0.08 mm and 252 ± 53 mmol/min/g protein for Odc1p (24 experiments) and 0.47 ± 0.07 mm and 73 ± 17 mmol/min/g protein for Odc2p (16 experiments). All of the compounds summarized in Table IV inhibited oxoglutarate uptake by both isoforms competitively, because they were found to increase the apparent K m without changing the V max of oxoglutarate uptake (not shown). The inhibition constants (K i ) of 2-oxoadipate are only about 2-fold lower than the K m of oxoglutarate but are about 5–7 times lower than the K i values of malate and 2-oxopimelate and more than 50 times lower than those of oxaloacetate and succinate. The K i values of malate and citrate are similar to the K m values of the same substrates for the reconstituted Odc1p, as determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots of the rate of [14C]malate or [14C]citrate uptake in the presence of a constant internal oxoglutarate concentration of 20 mm.

We recently showed that PTTG overexpression is associated with apoptosis and therefore have now studied the role of p53 in this process. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells that express wild type p53, PTTG overexpression caused apoptosis. p53 was translocated to the nuclei in cells expressing PTTG. Overexpression of p53, along with PTTG, augmented apoptosis, whereas expression of the human papillomavirus E6 protein inhibited PTTG-induced apoptosis. In MG-63 osteosarcoma cells that are deficient in p53, PTTG caused cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis that was inhibited by caspase inhibitors. A proteasome inhibitor augmented PTTG expression in stable PTTG transfectants, suggesting that down-regulated PTTG expression is required for cell survival. Finally, MG-63 cells expressing PTTG showed signs of aneuploidy including the presence of micronuclei and multiple nuclei. These results indicate that PTTG overexpression causes p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis. In the absence of p53, PTTG causes aneuploidy.

Our results show that PTTG overexpression causes p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis. Aneuploidy arises as a result of PTTG overexpression in p53-negative cells. These results suggest that aneuploidy may be a mechanism for PTTG-induced tumorigenesis. MCF-7 and MG-63 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum in a 37 °C, humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were synchronized with double thymidine block (9Yu R. Ren S. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cell cycle was analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Plasmids encoding wild type and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged human PTTG and the parental plasmid pEGFP-N3 were described before (9Yu R. Ren S. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding p53 and R175H p53 were gifts from Dr. C. W. Miller (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA). Plasmid encoding human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 protein was described before (15Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with FuGene (Hoffmann-La Roche). Stable MG-63 cell lines expressing EGFP or PTTG-EGFP were established by incubating cells with 1 mg/ml G418 after transfection. Caspase inhibitors I and III were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cells transfected with EGFP or PTTG-EGFP were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.6% Tween 20 and stained with Hoechst 33258 (1:10,000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were observed with a 40× objective, and green cells with apoptotic nuclear characteristics such as nuclear condensation and fragmentation were scored as apoptotic. Apoptosis was confirmed by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining. 200–300 green cells were examined on each slide. Nuclear morphology of green cells was also examined for signs of aneuploidy such as micronuclei and macronuclei. Immunofluorescent staining and fluorescence microscopy were performed as described (9Yu R. Ren S. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An antibody to p53 (1:1,000; Calbiochem) or to mdm2 (16Chen J. Marecahl V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) was used and detected with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes). Cells were finally stained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes). Several hundred cells were observed in each of the 2 to 3 staining experiments, and representative cells are depicted. Western blotting of PTTG-EGFP was performed as described (9Yu R. Ren S. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Growing cells were treated with 100 ng/ml colcemid (Calbiochem) for 90 min, and G2/M cells were isolated by brief trypsinization and gentle tapping. These cells were incubated with 75 mm KCl for 30 min and fixed and washed with methanol-acetic acid (3:1) and dropped onto glass slides. Metaphase chromosomes were observed. Human breast cancer MCF-7 cells express wild type p53 (17Elstner E. Linker-Israeli M. Said J. Umiel T. de Vos S. Shintaku I.P. Heber D. Binderup L. Uskokovic M. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2822-2830PubMed Google Scholar), and human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells are deficient in p53 (18Chandar N. Billig B. McMaster J. Novak J. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both MCF-7 and MG-63 cells express PTTG mRNA (data not shown). EGFP had no significant effect on apoptosis in either MCF-7 or MG-63 cells (Fig.1). Expression of PTTG-EGFP caused apoptosis in both MCF-7 and MG-63 cells. In MCF-7 cells, apoptosis occurred earlier. These results demonstrate that PTTG-induced apoptosis occurs independently of the presence of p53. p53 mostly distributes in the cytoplasm in normal MCF-7 cells. 64 of 215 cells (30%) expressing PTTG-EGFP had bright nuclear p53 staining (Fig.2 a), versus 20 of 217 cells (9%) expressing EGFP (p < 0.05), suggesting that p53 is translocated to the nuclei as a result of PTTG expression. Very few cells (<1%) expressing PTTG-EGFP revealed nuclear staining of mdm2, a negative regulator of p53, suggesting that mdm2-induced inhibition of p53 export from the nucleus is not responsible for p53 up-regulation. Overexpression of wild type p53 increased apoptosis of MCF-7 cells expressing either EGFP or PTTG-EGFP; however, a preferential increase of apoptosis in cells expressing PTTG-EGFP was observed (Fig. 2 b). Overexpression of mutant (R175H) p53 did not have a significant impact on MCF-7 cell death. Overexpression of E6, a protein that targets p53 to degradation, eliminated p53 immunoreactivity in most cells expressing PTTG-EGFP (Fig.2 b, inset). E6 promoted death of cells expressing EGFP, possibly because of lowered checkpoint function, but it protected MCF-7 cells from death induced by PTTG-EGFP. Similar experiments on MG-63 cells showed that p53 did not affect apoptosis induced by PTTG (Fig. 2 c). To investigate the relationship between apoptosis and cell cycle changes induced by PTTG, we first observed the same live cells expressing either EGFP or PTTG-EGFP after they were released from a double thymidine block, using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3 a). In the 18 h after release, 16 of 39 cells (41%) expressing EGFP divided, 1 cell (3%) died, and 22 cells (56%) did not change appreciably. EGFP fluorescence was stable among all cells expressing EGFP alone. During the same period, none of the cells expressing PTTG-EGFP divided, 6 of 30 cells (20%) died, EGFP fluorescence disappeared in 3 cells (10%), and 21 cells (70%) exhibited no obvious change. Consistent with our previous observation (9Yu R. Ren S. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), these results demonstrated that PTTG blocked mitosis, and cells were able to degrade PTTG in interphase.Figure 1PTTG induces apoptosis in MCF-7 and MG-63 cells. MCF-7 (left) and MG-63 (right) cells were transfected with EGFP or PTTG-EGFP. On each day after transfection, cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33258. Nuclei of green cells were examined with fluorescence microscopy, and the number of cells with apoptotic nuclei was divided by the number of all green cells examined. 200–300 cells were examined for each point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3PTTG arrests MG-63 cell growth. a, MG-63 cells transiently transfected with EGFP or PTTG-EGFP were synchronized with double thymidine block and released. The same live cells were continuously observed for 18 h after double thymidine block. Shown are the numbers of cells that remained unchanged, divided, degraded EGFP, or died. 39 EGFP-expressing and 30 PTTG-EGFP-expressing cells were observed. b, MG-63 cells were transfected with EGFP (left) or PTTG-EGFP (right). 2 days later, cells were fixed and cell-cycle analyzed for cells that express EGFP or PTTG-EGFP only and all cells (Total) including green and non-green cells. c, 2,000 MG-63 cells were plated in each well of a 48-well plate. Cells were transfected the next day with PTTG-EGFP and treated with 1% Me2SO or 100 μm caspase inhibitor I (Inh. I) or III (Inh. III). Medium was changed every day with fresh drugs added. Shown are total numbers of green cells (Total) including live and apoptotic cells and the number of live cells on day 5 after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine where the cell cycle was blocked by PTTG, we analyzed the cell cycle of unsynchronized MG-63 cells expressing EGFP or PTTG-EGFP 48 h after transfection (Fig. 3 b). EGFP itself did not affect the cell cycle (Fig. 3 b, left). PTTG-EGFP-expressing cells had a similar number of cells in S phase (Fig. 3 b, right), but a prominent G2/M phase (14%) and a corresponding smaller G1 phase were observed, suggesting a blockade on exit from mitosis. Caspases have been implicated in apoptosis induced by taxol and human immunodeficiency virus viral protein R (19Panvichian R. Orth K. Day M.L. Day K.C. Pilat M.J. Pienta K.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4667-4672PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shostak L.D. Ludlow J. Fisk J. Pursell S. Rimel B.J. Nguyen D. Rosenblatt J.D. Planelles V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), both blocking cell cycle at G2/M phase. We used the total number of green cells and the number of live green cells on day 5 after transfection with PTTG-EGFP as indicators of cell survival. Both caspase inhibitor I (Z-VAD-FMK) and III (Boc-d-FMK) promoted survival of PTTG-EGFP-expressing cells (Fig.3 c). 7 h after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, LLnL, there was no significant change in EGFP fluorescence (Fig.4 a) or in EGFP protein level, revealed by Western blotting of MG-63 cells stably expressing EGFP (Fig. 4 b). In cells stably expressing PTTG-EGFP, PTTG-EGFP fluorescence and PTTG-EGFP protein level were both enhanced after LLnL treatment. These results show that PTTG-EGFP was continuously degraded through the ubiquitin pathway and suggested that cells stably expressing PTTG escape apoptosis by down-regulating PTTG. Because PTTG is a mammalian securin that helps keep sister chromatids together, its overexpression may cause abnormal chromosomal separation. In both the parental MG-63 cells and in cells expressing EGFP, signs of aneuploidy were uncommon. In MG-63 cells transiently or stably expressing PTTG-EGFP, the severity and frequency of aneuploidy signs such as micronuclei, macronuclei, or chromosomal bridges were both enhanced (Fig. 5). In a representative experiment, only 3 of 253 cells (1%) transiently expressing EGFP were aneuploid, whereas 45 of 133 cells (34%) transiently expressing PTTG-EGFP were aneuploid. In MG-63 cells stably expressing EGFP or PTTG-EGFP, the observed differences in aneuploidy were less dramatic. In a representative counting, 12 of 244 cells (5%) stably expressing EGFP were aneuploid, whereas 21 of 203 cells (10%) stably expressing PTTG-EGFP were aneuploid. The modal number of chromosomes was counted on metaphase chromosome spreads derived from cells stably expressing EGFP or PTTG-EGFP. Both cells had a modal chromosome number of 56, and occasionally (<5%) tetraploid chromosomes were observed with a modal number of about 100. There was no significant difference in the frequency of tetraploid chromosomes between cells expressing EGFP or PTTG-EGFP. The lack of differing in chromosome numbers may be because most aneuploid cells did not divide or because of the low frequency of aneuploid cells. PTTG-EGFP did not induce aneuploidy in MCF-7 and human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, which also express wild type p53 (data not shown). Aneuploidy was observed in some MCF-7 and JEG-3 cells transfected with PTTG-EGFP and HPV E6 protein. Because the transfection efficiency in MCF-7 cells was low, we counted the rate of aneuploidy only in JEG-3 cells where transfection efficiency was higher. In one representative experiment, 24 of 650 cells (3.7%) expressing PTTG-EGFP and HPV E6 protein were aneuploid, whereas only 5 of 647 cells (0.8%) expressing EGFP and HPV E6 protein were aneuploid. These results suggested that p53 prevents aneuploidy induced by PTTG. In this study, we have elucidated mechanisms for PTTG-induced apoptosis. Although all results shown were derived from the comparison of PTTG-EGFP and EGFP, PTTG-EGFP appears to faithfully represent PTTG, because they exhibit similar cellular characteristics (9Yu R. Ren S. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and caused similar cell death (data not shown). Several lines of evidence from our study indicate that p53 mediates PTTG-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. PTTG up-regulated and translocated p53 to the nucleus, overexpression of p53 augmented PTTG-induced apoptosis, and the HPV E6 protein, a p53 inactivator, prevented PTTG-induced apoptosis. It is not clear, however, how p53 is activated by PTTG. myc andras activate p53 by activating ARF, a tumor suppressor protein (12Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J, L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 21Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) that in turn causes nuclear accumulation of mdm2, preventing p53 nuclear export and subsequent degradation (22Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar,23Lu W. Pochampally R. Chen L. Traidej M. Wang Y. Chen J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We did not observe a simultaneous nuclear accumulation of p53 and mdm2, suggesting that the ARF mechanism may not apply to PTTG-induced apoptosis, yet PTTG may induce p53 nuclear accumulation by inhibiting mdm2 expression through other mechanisms (23Lu W. Pochampally R. Chen L. Traidej M. Wang Y. Chen J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The dominant negative p53 mutant did not inhibit PTTG-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, possibly indicating that the mutant p53 may not completely inhibit endogenous p53 activity as effectively as the HPV E6 protein. It is also likely that mechanisms other than p53 are also involved in PTTG-induced apoptosis. PTTG caused apoptosis in p53-negative MG-63 cells, demonstrating that PTTG-induced apoptosis can be p53-independent. It appeared that PTTG causes cell cycle arrest prior to apoptosis. This was evident inasmuch as cells expressing PTTG did not divide after release from double thymidine block, and cycling PTTG-expressing cells were also partially blocked at G2/M. The PTTG effect on the cell cycle may therefore be both direct and indirect. The securin function of PTTG (8Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar,9Yu R. Ren S. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) would predict that exit from mitosis is inhibited in cells overexpressing PTTG, and overexpression of a nondegradable PTTG disrupts sister chromatid separation (8Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The direct impact of PTTG overexpression on mitosis does not explain why only a small percentage of cells were blocked at G2/M after one to two doubling times, therefore suggesting an additional indirect mechanism,i.e. that PTTG activates a surveillance mechanism other than p53, which in turn causes cell cycle arrest. The nature of this surveillance is not clear, but the checkpoint kinases chk1 and chk2 are possible candidates, because they have been involved in p53-independent apoptosis induced by DNA damage (24Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 25Suganuma M. Kawabe T. Hori H. Funabiki T. Okamoto T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5887-5891PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis may thus result from PTTG-induced cell cycle arrest. We show evidence that PTTG causes aneuploidy in MG-63 cells. Transient and stable PTTG expression is associated with a higher frequency of aneuploidy. PTTG degradation is required to start the anaphase (8Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 9Yu R. Ren S. Horwitz G.A. Wang Z. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When a cell overexpresses PTTG, sister chromatids may not separate completely, resulting in a cell with one or more extra chromosomes manifesting as micronuclei. Sister chromatids may not separate at all, forming cells with multiple nuclei or macronuclei. It appears that p53 plays a role in preventing PTTG-induced aneuploidy, because aneuploidy was evident in p53-deficient MG-63 cells and in MCF-7 and JEG-3 cells after endogenous p53 was inhibited. Similar observations have been made on the myc (26Yin X.Y. Grove L. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and ras (27Hundley J.E. Koester S.K. Troyer D.A. Hilsenbeck S.G. Subler M.A. Windle J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) oncogenes that induce chromosome instability only after p53 is inactivated. The dual effects of PTTG on apoptosis and aneuploidy are distinct but closely related in tumorigenesis. Apoptosis does not occur as a result of aneuploidy, because the majority of cells were not aneuploid before they entered apoptosis. Rather, by clearing cells that can become aneuploid, apoptosis appears to be a means of protecting against aneuploidy and the resultant tumorigenesis. The dual effects of PTTG on apoptosis and aneuploidy suggest a mechanism for PTTG-induced tumorigenesis. PTTG overexpression activates p53 and a p53-independent apoptosis pathway. Where both apoptotic systems fail, PTTG-induced aneuploid cells survive and divide, prompting daughter cells to be tumorous. This model implies that PTTG-induced tumorigenesis is a slow process, and tumors do not form until apoptosis surveillance systems fail. On the other hand, if PTTG expression is down-regulated by the ubiquitin pathway as we show in this paper, the resultant slightly increased PTTG expression may still escape surveillance and cause aneuploidy. Thus PTTG potentially can contribute to tumorigenesis even when the apoptosis surveillance systems are intact. Because aneuploidy is assumed to be less severe when PTTG is down-regulated, tumorigenesis should also be slow. In summary, we show that PTTG induced both apoptosis and aneuploidy, and the results suggest that apoptosis may play an important role in preventing tumorigenesis. We have now established mice deficient in PTTG 2Z. Wang, R. Yu, and S. Melmed, manuscript in preparation. and will more directly address the mechanism of PTTG-induced tumorigenesis in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W2076160519,"In order to understand the mechanism for insoluble neurotoxic protein polymerization in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain neurons, we examined protein and gene expression for transglutaminase (TGase 2; tissue transglutaminase (tTG)) in hippocampus and isocortex. We found co-localization of tTG protein and activity with tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles, whereas mRNA and sequence analysis indicated an absolute increase in tTG synthesized. Although apoptosis in AD hippocampus is now an established mode of neuronal cell death, no definite underlying mechanism(s) is known. Since TGase-mediated protein aggregation is implicated in polyglutamine ((CAG)n/Qn expansion) disorder apoptosis, and expanded Qn repeats are excellent TGase substrates, a role for TGase in AD is possible. However, despite such suggestions almost 20 years ago, the molecular mechanism remained elusive. We now present one possible molecular mechanism for tTG-mediated, neurotoxic protein polymerization leading to neuronal apoptosis in AD that involves not its substrates (like Qn repeats) but rather the unique presence of alternative transcripts of tTG mRNA. In addition to a full-length (L) isoform in aged non-demented brains, we found a short isoform (S) lacking a binding domain in all AD brains. Our current results identify intron-exon “switching” between L and S isoforms, implicating G-protein-coupled signaling pathways associated with tTG that may help to determine the dual roles of this enzyme in neuronal life and death processes.

These enzymes are involved in a variety of key metabolic processes that range from blood coagulation to cell death.

In this context, the history of tTG in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis began almost 20 years ago with the report that brain tTG catalyzed cross-linking of neurofilament molecules (18Selkoe D.J. Abraham C. Ihara Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6070-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A decade later, Aβ peptide (19Ikura K. Takahata K. Sasaki R.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were shown to be cross-linked by tTG. Subsequently, tTG protein was demonstrated within amyloid plaques in AD brains (22Zhang W. Johnson B.R. Suri D.E. Martinez J. Bjornsson T.D. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 96: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By using immunohistochemistry and an antibody to coagulation factor XIII, an extracellular TGase that cross-reacts with tTG, co-localization with paired helical filaments, the major components of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD neurons were reported further suggesting a role for tTG in AD pathogenesis (23Appelt D.M. Kopen G.C. Boyne L.J. Balin B.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, the phosphorylated microtubule protein, tau, a molecular component of NFTs and paired helical filaments, associates with tTG to form insoluble filaments (24Appelt D.M. Balin B.J. Brain Res. 1997; 745: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In recent studies, tTG activity was found to be increased in the most severely affected brain region in AD, the hippocampus (25Johnson G.V. Cox T.M. Lockhart J.P. Zinnerman M.D. Miller M.L. Powers R.E. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the last few years, tTG was shown to be a bifunctional enzyme, a G-protein possessing GTPase activity (26Fraij B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

An important discovery was the appearance of an alternatively spliced short (S) form lacking the GTP-binding site when rat brain astrocytes in culture were treated with the cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) or tumor necrosis factor-α. With translation of this S form, cross-linking activity would no longer be negatively regulated by GTP (33Monsonego A. Shani Y. Friedmann I. Paas Y. Eizenberg O. Schwartz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3724-3732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This loss-of-function might impact on AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, where apoptosis is prominent (34Bredesen D.E. Ann.

This finding led us to consider first whether alternatively spliced variants were produced in response to injury. We have found evidence of such alternative transcripts in rat spinal cord within the first 8 h after controlled contusion injury. 2B. W. Festoff, C. Yong, K. SantaCruz, P. M. Arnold, C. T. Sebastian, P. J. A. Davies, and B. A. Citron, submitted for publication.2B. W. Festoff, C. Yong, K. SantaCruz, P. M. Arnold, C. T. Sebastian, P. J. A. Davies, and B. A. Citron, submitted for publication. We reasoned that if injury could rapidly induce S isoforms that are more associated with apoptotic cell death, a search for similar splice variants in neurodegenerative diseases might be revealing. Therefore, we examined cortical and hippocampal regions of AD patients and non-demented matched controls for tTG, isodipeptide bonds, TGase enzymatic activity, and gene expression for the full-length tTG gene (TGM2) in parallel with tau in NFTs. Finally, using specific oligonucleotide primers, we determined which mRNA transcripts were produced in AD, and we compared these with non-demented, aged brains. Our results confirm several recent reports that TGase enzymatic activity is increased in hippocampal regions of neuropathologically confirmed AD brains (25Johnson G.V. Cox T.M. Lockhart J.P. Zinnerman M.D. Miller M.L. Powers R.E. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 39Kim S.Y. Grant P. Lee J.H. Pant H.C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

We further found that increased activity correlates with increased expression of TGM2 in these same brain regions. Finally, we report the novel finding in human tissue that alternative mRNA processing for TGM2 occurs in AD. This alternative splicing is accompanied by protein precipitation in the form of insoluble inclusions, in situ isodipeptide bond formation, and increased TGase activity levels. 3Citron, B.

Brain samples were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Center Neurospecimen Brain Bank at the University of Kansas Medical Center. All AD brains came from patients with the clinical, ante-mortem diagnosis of AD. The 9 AD brains used in these studies ranged in age at death from 69 to 93 years, except for one 51-year-old patient with both trisomy 21 and AD. Numerous neuritic plaques and NFTs were identified in modified Bielschowsky-stained sections of isocortex as well as hippocampus. The neuritic plaques were in sufficient quantities for the diagnosis of AD using Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease criteria (40Trojanowski J.Q. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18 Suppl. 4: 1-2Google Scholar, 41Hyman B.T. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 1095-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Controls came from age-matched, non-demented individuals. All samples for biochemical studies had been rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen within 8 h of death and preserved at −70 °C. Sections for immunohistochemistry were processed routinely with formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at the University of Kansas Medical Center Biotech support facility. Bicinchoninic acid kit was purchased from Pierce. Guinea pig liver tTG,N,N-dimethylcasein, and diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen were bought from Sigma. [3H]Putrescine (7.77·1012 dpm/mol) was obtained from New England Nuclear. Trizol reagent was bought from Life Technologies, Inc. PCR mix was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; reverse transcriptase, Superscript II, was from Life Technologies, Inc. Antibody to tTG was purchased from the Neomarkers Division of Lab Vision Corp. (Fremont, CA). Rabbit anti-human tau polyclonal antibody was from Dako (Carpenteria, CA) as was a labeled streptavidin-biotin kit used for visualization. Monoclonal antibody that recognizes theN-ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide bonds produced by the action of TGase activity (42el Alaoui S. Legastelois S. Roch A.M. Chantepie J. Quash G. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 221-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was 811-MAG purchased from Covalab (Lyon, France). Both frozen and fixed tissue reacted equally well with tTG and isodipeptide antibodies. The results and photomicrographs reported here are from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue that were deparaffinized and microwaved in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. For double labeling experiments, the sections were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin. The primary antibodies were applied sequentially; the first antibody was a rabbit anti-human tau, made against four repeated sequences involved in microtubule binding from the COOH-terminal part of the human tau protein (43Ksiezak-Reding H. Shafit-Zagardo B. Yen S.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41 (553): 583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG, and this was followed by streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by Fast Red as chromogen for visualization. The tTG antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody made against purified guinea pig liver TGase 2. A secondary biotinylated anti-mouse antibody was followed by streptavidin labeled with horseradish peroxidase. The DAB chromogen used for horseradish peroxidase visualization gave a brown precipitate. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with 7-μm formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. Mouse monoclonal anti-tTG was used at 1:100 dilution and visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Controls included preimmune serum in place of the primary antibody. The mouse monoclonal antibody to isodipeptide bonds was used at a 1:100 dilution and was visualized with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to CY3 (42el Alaoui S. Legastelois S. Roch A.M. Chantepie J. Quash G. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 221-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44Gill L.S. Pabbathi V.K. Vignes M. Haynes L.W. Brain Res. 1998; 788: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was captured on a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 fluorescence microscope linked to a Bio-Rad MicroRadiance Plus confocal system utilizing HyQ filters for direct observation on the microscope and 543 and 488 nm laser lines on the confocal system for CY3 and FITC, respectively. In some experiments, stained sections were also viewed on a Leitz Orthoplan microscope under epifluorescence using Ploem filters. Double-stained sections were photographed on a Nikon UFX automatic camera and digitized, and images were collected and analyzed on a Macintosh G3 computer using Adobe Photoshop 4.0. Brain tissue samples weighing 35–55 mg were homogenized in 10 ml/g of 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 125 mm potassium thiocyanate, 1% Lubrol-PX, with a Polytron (Brinkman, Westbury, NY) at 4 °C 3 times at 5-s bursts. Protein concentrations were determined with a micro-bicinchoninic acid assay (45Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18586) Google Scholar). TGase activity was determined by a modified assay (46Ando M. Kunii S. Tatematsu T. Nagata Y. Brain. Res. 1993; 604: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 47Citron B.A. Gregory E.J. Steigerwalt D.S. Qin F. Festoff B.W. Neurochem. Int. 2000; 37: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in which brain protein extracts (50-μl aliquots) were added to 0.7 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1.3 mmCaCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/mlN,N-dimethylcasein, 0.4 mm[3H]putrescine and incubated for 150 min at 37 °C, after confirmation of linearity over the period. Gunea pig liver tTG was used for the standard curve. The incorporated putrescine was measured by precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid, resuspension in NaOH, and scintillation counting of triplicate samples in a Packard 2200CA Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. Negative controls included reactions without substrate, and blanks were without enzyme source. RNA was extracted (48Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) with denaturing phenol (Trizol reagent). Tissue was powdered under liquid N2 and homogenized on ice with a Polytron. Nucleoprotein complexes were dissociated at room temperature for 5 min and then 0.2× volume of chloroform was added, and the solution was first agitated for 15 s and then incubated at room temperature for 3 min. The aqueous phase, obtained after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, was precipitated with 2-propanol, washed with 75% ethanol, and resuspended in H2O. The RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm and electrophoresis in formaldehyde-agarose gels. RNA samples were first reverse-transcribed to produce cDNA with the downstream primer (5′-TGGTAGATGAAGCCCTGTTG). These were performed in 20-μl reactions with 1 μg of total brain RNA, 1 mm dNTPs, 1× PCR mix, 10 pmol of primer, and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript II). Primers were annealed at room temperature for 10 min followed by cDNA synthesis at 42 °C for 30 min, then 5 min denaturation at 95 °C, and then quick cooling. The cDNA was amplified in PCR brought to 100 μl containing a total of 50 pmol of each of the upstream (5′-GCTGCTCCTGGAGAGGTGTG) and downstream primers and 200 μm dNTPs. The reactions were first denatured at 98 °C for 10 min, cooled to 90 °C for addition of 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Amplitaq, PerkinElmer Life Sciences or Biolase, Bioline), and followed by 30–35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 45 s. Products were visualized under UV light after agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, and band intensities were measured by direct CCD camera capture and analysis with NIH Image (49O'Neill R.R. Mitchell L.G. Merril C.R. Rasband W.S. Appl. Theor. Electrophor. 1989; 1: 163-167PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify tTG (TGase 2) mRNA levels, we turned to a method previously exploited to quantify message in liver (50Ritter S.J. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12798-12806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We measured the displacement of fluorescently labeled and quenching dye-labeled internal oligonucleotides by the PCR amplification and a real time system (ABI Prism 7700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) used according to manufacturer's recommendations. Amplifications with primers spanning the entire coding region as well as primers directed toward the COOH-terminal region were employed to analyze for alternative tTG transcripts in AD versus non-demented control brain mRNA. The primers utilized in these experiments included the upstream primer (5′-GGAGCCAGTTATCAACAG) and the downstream primer (5′-GGGTTATAAATGGAGCAG). The RT-PCR amplifications were performed as described above. To identify unambiguously the potential alternative tTG transcripts, we isolated RT-PCR products, removed primers with two ethanol precipitations, and sequenced these on an ABI fluorescent automated sequencer, Prism model 377. Nested primers were included for the sequencing reactions, or RT-PCR products were subcloned into pCRII utilizing the TOPO T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's directions, and plasmids were purified with a spun column miniprep procedure (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA). Data were examined with Applied Biosystems Editview software and the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computing Group Software (51Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). To establish the distribution of tTG in our AD patient samples (ranging in age from 65 to 81, n = 5), brain sections were characterized using tTG, and tau immunohistochemistry sections examined included the hippocampus at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, superior temporal lobe, mid-frontal gyrus, and striate cortex. All of the AD patients showed severe NFT formation in all sections examined except the occipital cortex consistent with Braak and Braak stage 5 out of 6 (52Braak H. Braak E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18 Suppl. 4: 85-88Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Using tau immunohistochemistry, NFTs were not seen in any location in the control brains. Frequent neuritic plaques were also present in all sections of cortex examined, and these were in sufficient quantities to confirm the clinical impression of AD using Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease criteria. With tTG immunohistochemistry, staining of blood vessels was present in all brains; of interest, vascular staining was less prominent in AD brains. In stark contrast, neuronal staining was only seen in the AD brains. The most obvious tTG-positive staining was present in the hippocampus and adjacent regions (subiculum, transentorhinal, and entorhinal cortex). In addition, with tTG antibody many pyramidal neurons showed fine granular staining, whereas a minority showed additional weak diffuse staining. Isocortical neuronal tTG staining was also present in each AD brain examined, and again, this was most obvious in the large pyramidal neurons. As in hippocampus, isocortical immunostaining was occasionally granular but more often weak and diffuse. Although one control brain showed weak tTG staining in the lateral geniculate nucleus, no definite hippocampal or isocortical tTG immunostaining was present. Fig. 1 shows that hippocampal brain regions of AD patients contained significant numbers of diffuse and neuritic plaques, numerous intraneuronal NFTs (Fig. 1, C andD, small arrows), significant cell loss, and gliosis. Antibody to tTG, visualized by the brown DAB stain, was detected in both hippocampal regions (Fig. 1, C and D,arrowheads) as well as in the cortex (Fig. 1, A and B, arrowheads). Differences in tTG immuoreactivity between AD and control brains were detected, since both endothelial cells (Fig. 1 A, linear small arrow s) and neurons stained in AD, whereas staining was exclusively in endothelial cells in control brains (not shown). The next important question concerned whether tTG was functioning as a cross-linking agent at these brain locations. As evidence that the localized tTG in these AD neurons was active in situ to cross-link one or more neuronal proteins, novel immunohistochemical evidence of isodipeptide bond formation was detected in regions showing increased immunoreactive tTG (Fig.2 A). As found with tTG, in some neurons isodipeptide immunoreactivity was in the form of diffuse neuronal staining (Fig. 2 A, arrowhead), but in other hippocampal neurons granulovacuolar material was stained (Fig.2 A, arrows). Significantly, in no non-demented brain could significant anti-isodipeptide bond staining be found (Fig.2 B). Fig. 2 shows neurons with in situ isodipeptide bonds in the AD-affected brain regions, which were also positive for tau (Fig. 1). As shown in the figure, double labeling enabled the determination that isodipeptide bonds were co-localized with intraneuronal inclusions (NFTs). To confirm this further, we examined fluorescently labeled samples with laser scanning confocal microscopy. Through fluorescent staining techniques, we were also able to confirm co-localization (Fig.3) of isodipeptide bonds (Fig.3 D) with tTG antigen (Fig. 3 C), and these occurred along with intraneuronal inclusions (NFTs, Fig. 3,A and B, arrows) in these tau-positive regions. In support of these immunocytochemical results, we found that tTG cross-linking enzymatic activity was increased in brain hippocampal regions of AD patients (53McLean C.A. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18 Suppl. 4: 89-90Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 54Jellinger K.A. Bancher C. J. Neural. Transm. 1998; 54 (suppl.): 77-95Google Scholar) (Fig. 4), confirming a previous report (25Johnson G.V. Cox T.M. Lockhart J.P. Zinnerman M.D. Miller M.L. Powers R.E. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was increased 1.5–8 fold in these AD brains compared with non-demented controls (Fig. 4), with a statistically significant p value (<0.04). Of interest, relative to unaffected AD brain regions, AD brain hippocampus and cortex had elevated tTG activity by a factor of 3.5 ± 1.2. It still remained to be shown to what extent alterations in tTG expression would account for the elevated cross-linking activity. Activity measurements cannot distinguish among the genes now known to transcribe proteins with TGase activity (55Aeschlimann D. Koeller M.K. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3452-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant given the recent report of TGase 1 and 3, in addition to tTG, in human brain (39Kim S.Y. Grant P. Lee J.H. Pant H.C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30715-30721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Consequently, we employed specific primers to examine message corresponding to TGase C/TGase 2 (intracellular tTG), encoded by the gene TGM2(56Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O.

Brain cortical RNA extracts were examined by RT-PCR analysis (Fig.5), and appropriately sized products were obtained corresponding to tTG. Although intended to characterize the presence or absence of the TGM2 message, the reactions were conducted to subplateau levels by testing amplifications with different parameters including cycle numbers. In these semi-quantitative experiments, we found that elevated mRNA levels from this gene (Fig. 5) followed the activity levels we had seen (Fig. 4). The highest mRNA values, normalized to the product seen in control brains (100%), were 5-fold higher. Overall, these RNA levels were elevated 3.9-fold with a p value of"

Here we show that phosphorylation of serine 142 in CREB by CamKII leads to dissociation of the CREB dimer without impeding DNA binding capacity. CamKII-modified CREB binds to DNA efficiently as a monomer; however, monomeric CREB is unable to recruit the CREB-binding protein (CBP) even when phosphorylated at serine 133. Thus, CamKII confers a dominant inhibitory effect on transcription by preventing dimerization of CREB, and this mechanism may account for the attenuation of gene expression.

Mammalian expression vectors for CREB proteins were previously constructed by modifying a vector containing a RSV promoter and a histidine fusion of the entire rat CREB (pET22b(+)His6-CREB) (29Wu X.

Mutant forms of CREB lacking serine phosphorylation sites were generated by overlap polymerase chain reaction using primers which contained a T→G point mutation in the first residue of the serine codon (TCT), altering it to an alanine codon (GCT). All plasmids were verified by sequencing.

Added protein ranged from 20.0 to 150.0 pmol and was incubated with 25.0 pmol of32P-endlabeled probe. A carboxyl-terminal truncation of the CBP fusion protein (His6-CBP-(1–682)) was expressed inE. coli strain BL21(DE3) using a His6-mCBP-(1–682)pET15b vector (29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T.

DynCRE3 oligonucleotides were synthesized with a biotin label (5′ABTABTGTGGCTGCTG-CGTCAGAGCATGA-3′) (Mayo core facility) and bound to streptavidin-agarose columns. DNA was added to the column and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking to allow maximal DNA binding, after which the beads were washed extensively with binding buffer to repack the column. CREB·DNA complexes were formed by the addition of native or mutant CREB to the immobilized DNA in the column. For all experiments, CREB was added to obtain a constant subsaturated protein/DNA ratio (between 0.3 and 0.4) to ensure complete binding of all dimeric or monomeric CREB. Finally, CBP was added at a ratio of 1 CBP molecule per CREB·DNA complex and incubated in a similar manner as for CREB. CBP or CREB proteins were eluted in 20.0 mm Tris, 1.0 m KCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10.0% glycerol, pH 6.8. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc) and detected with antibodies specific for CREB or CBP (1:500 dilution of a rabbit anti-CBP polyclonal antibody, CBP (A22)) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The relative amount of His6-CREB and His6-CBP-(1–682) were evaluated by antibody detection (29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) of an equal volume of eluate obtained under identical column conditions. Each experiment was repeated at least four times. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed on an Optima XL-A equipped with UV-vis detection system (Beckman Instruments) as described previously (29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T.

For DNA/protein complexes, His6-CREB and P-His6-CREB were incubated with 1.0–2.5 μmsomatostatin CRE (5′-GCCTCCTTGGCTGACG-TCAGAGAGAG-3′) or dynorphin CRE3 (5′-GTGGCTGCTGCGTCAGAGCATGA-3′) that was endlabeled with fluorescein as described previously (29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Complexes were formed after incubation of protein with DNA overnight at room temperature. Samples were analyzed only using double sector cells to increase the column length. Each sample was analyzed at multiple rotor speeds (between 8,000 and 20,000 rpm) and at multiple concentrations. Experiments were carried out at 20 °C in an ANTi60 rotor until equilibrium was achieved. Equilibrium distributions were detected by scanning the absorbance across the cell at 494 nm, the maximum absorbance wavelength for fluorescein. The use of fluorescein tag on the DNA allows analysis of DNA/protein complexes without interference from free protein or DNA as long as the DNA is fully bound. Neither His6-CREB nor P-His6-CREB absorb at 494 mm. Boundaries were analyzed as described above using relevant partial specific volumes. The partial specific volume (νo) of the fluorescein-labeled CRE-containing oligonucleotides were calculated as described previously (29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 45Zhang F. Lemieux S. Wu X. St.-Armaud D. McMurray C.T. Major F. Anderson D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 141-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The νo of the DNA/protein complex was 0.695 ml/g for a His6-CREB dimer and 0.679 ml/g for a His6-CREB monomer. For fitting, data from multiple rotor speeds and multiple concentrations were fit simultaneously to obtain a best value using a nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt fitting routine incorporated into a macro using Kaleidograph (29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or using NONLIN (46Johnson M.L. Correia J.J Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Fitting from both routines yielded similar results. Molecular weights for one or two components were obtained from the best fit of the data using nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt fitting routine (47Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vettering W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C. Cambridge University Press, New York1992: 656-706Google Scholar) according to the following, A(r)=A(rb)eω2M(1−νη0)(r2−ra2)/RTEquation 1 where A is the absorbance, ra is the distance of meniscus to the axis of the rotor, r is the distance of each point on the boundary to the rotor axis, ω is the angular speed, νo is the partial specific volume of the component, andM is the molecular weight of the component, which is obtained from the fitting. Under subsaturating conditions, fitting was performed assuming a two component system in which one component was fixed to be the free DNA. CamKII inhibits transcription of many CRE-dependent reporter genes, and inhibition is independent of the CRE symmetry or CRE number (Fig. 1). In contrast to either CamKIV or PKA, constitutively active CamKII represses expression of CRE-containing CAT reporter constructs when co-transfected in mammalian cells (Fig. 1 A). CamKII mediates the dominant inhibitory effect because overexpression of an inactive form of CamKII abrogates inhibition of either the SomCAT or DynCAT reporter genes (data not shown). SomCAT and DynCAT expression are inhibited by co-expression of CamKII with either CamKIV (not shown) or PKA (Fig.1A), to the same extent as CamKII alone (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, CamKII produces a dominant inhibitory effect that overcomes stimulation by either CamKIV or PKA (Fig. 1 A). CREB-1 is the major factor that mediates transcriptional regulation of both somatostatin (27Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar) and prodynorphin by PKA (28Collins-Hicok J. Lin L. Spiro C. Laybourn P.J. Tschumper R. Rapacz B. McMurray C.T. Mol.

For both Dyn (Fig.1 B) and Som (Fig. 1 C) constructs, we find that the inhibitory effect of CamKII is mediated by CREB and occurs at CRE elements required for stimulation by CamKIV or PKA. CRE-3 is the major site for CREB-dependent regulation of prodynorphin (28Collins-Hicok J. Lin L. Spiro C. Laybourn P.J. Tschumper R. Rapacz B. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2837-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the presence of CamKII, DynCAT expression is inhibited relative to control (Fig. 1 B). However, deletion or point mutations that abolish CREB-1 binding at the CRE-3 of prodynorphin (28Collins-Hicok J. Lin L. Spiro C. Laybourn P.J. Tschumper R. Rapacz B. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2837-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) also relieve CamKII-dependent inhibition (Fig. 1 B) relative to control. A mutant CREB (CREB-K304E (28Collins-Hicok J. Lin L. Spiro C. Laybourn P.J. Tschumper R. Rapacz B. McMurray C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2837-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) that cannot bind to the CRE but is a substrate for CamKII phosphorylation relieves CamKII-dependent inhibition of either SomCAT (Fig.1 C) or DynCAT (Fig. 1 D) promoters. Thus, gene activation by either CamKIV or PKA and inhibition by CamKII appear to involve modification of the same CREB·CRE complex. CamKII modifies CREB-1 at two positions, serine 142 and serine 133 (Fig. 2 A). In CV-1 cells, transcription of SomCAT is inhibited by expression of CamKII (Fig.2 B). To determine the relationship between CREB phosphorylation and CaMKII-mediated inhibition, we constructed and expressed native and three mutant forms of CREB. Each mutant contains a serine to an alanine change at either or both phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2 A). In the absence of kinase, native CREB, S142A, and S142A/S133A displayed similar activity (Fig.2 A, Native CREB, −Kinase). In the presence of CamKII, SomCAT expression is inhibited by expression of either native CREB or the S133A mutant, both of which can be phosphorylated at serine 142 (Fig. 2 B, Native versus A133). Relative to native CREB, inhibition of SomCAT is relieved in the presence of the S142A and S133A/S142A mutants, neither of which can be phosphorylated at serine 142 (Fig. 2 B, Native versus A142 andA133A142). Because inhibition is not significantly different between native CREB and the CREB-S133A mutant, the data indicate that inhibition is not a cooperative effect of modification at both sites. Rather, the inhibitory effect of CamKII requires only CREB phosphorylation at Ser-142. Interestingly, we never see expression of SomCAT with S142A in the presence of kinase equal to native CREB in the presence of the kinase. However, there is endogenous CREB in the cells. Therefore, we expect that in some cases the S142A mutant will dimerize with a native CREB molecule that contains an intact 142 site hence lowering expression of the reporter. We next examined why phosphorylation of CREB at 142 is inhibitory. Phosphorylation at serine 142 by CamKII might be preferred and might negatively influence the extent of phosphorylation at serine 133. In this case, the inability to efficiently modify CREB at 133 may explain the inhibitory effect. To test whether the serine 142 site is preferred, we evaluated the efficiency of CREB phosphorylation by CamKII at each site. Native or mutant CREB was incubated with CamKII or PKA in the presence of [32P]ATP and the extent of phosphorylation was measured in vitro (Fig. 2 C). We find that CaMKII alone efficiently modifies native CREB at both 133 and 142. CREB contains twice as much incorporated label after CamKII phosphorylation as after PKA phosphorylation. Modification of either S133A or S142A by CamKII occurs equally and about half as well as for the native CREB (Fig. 2 C). In all cases, mutant CREB proteins are equally expressed and are appropriate substrates for phosphorylation. Mutant S142A cannot be phosphorylated on serine 142 and is phosphorylated to the same extent by CamKII as is native CREB by PKA. Additionally, S133A is not a substrate for PKA, and the double mutant is not a substrate for PKA or CamKII (Fig. 2 C). Finally, CREB modification at the inhibitory site 142 occurs at an equal rate as for the stimulatory site at 133 (Fig. 2 D). Thus, inhibition by CamKII does not occur because serine 133 is slowly modified. We conclude that CamKII displays no site preference and modifies either the 133 or the 142 site to the same extent. Using these mutants, we also confirmed that CamKII modification of CREB at these two sites is not cooperative. Phosphorylation of CREB by PKA at serine 133 does not prevent or influence modification at serine 142 by CamKII (Fig. 2 C). This is evident from the fact that incorporated label at site 142 in native CREB by CamKII is roughly the same before or after phosphorylation at 133. This means that CamKII can fully modify CREB even after phosphorylation by PKA or CamKIV (Fig.2 C). Similarly, mixing CamKII-modified S133A and native CREB does not prevent efficient phosphorylation at serine 133 (not shown). Thus, CamKII efficiently phosphorylates either site independent of modification at the other. We conclude that CamKII-mediated inhibition can prevent stimulation by PKA or CamKIV, but PKA or CamKIV modification does not prevent a subsequent inhibitory modification at 142. Phosphorylation of CREB at serine 142 by CamKII is necessary and sufficient for the dominant inhibitory effect of CamKII on transcription. However, differential phosphorylation does not explain inhibition. CamKII-modified CREB might inhibit transcription by reducing binding of CREB at the CRE site. We find, however, that CamKII does not decrease and, in fact, modestly increases binding of purified CREB to either the SomCAT (Fig. 3 A) or DynCAT CREs (Fig. 3 B). Because binding of CREB is required for activity of the somatostatin promoter, it is unlikely that transcriptional attenuation by CamKII is caused by increasing DNA binding activity there. Instead, we find that CamKII-mediated phosphorylation of serine 142 attenuates dimerization of full-length CREB (Fig. 3, C andD). The self-association state of CREB is measured by sedimentation equilibrium using fluorescein-labeled DNA templates (Fig.3 C and Ref. 29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The use of fluorescein labels allows detection of the protein/DNA complex using visible light without interference from the free protein (29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under conditions of transcriptional activity, native CREB is a dimer and activity is enhanced by phosphorylation at serine 133 (Fig. 3 D,Native −kinase and +CamKIV/PKA). Transcription is also supported by both CamKII-modified S142A mutant and the S133A/S142A double mutant (Fig. 3 D). Neither mutant can be phosphorylated at serine 142 and both are dimers on DNA. In contrast, transcription is inhibited when CamKII modifies the native or S133A mutant, both of which are phosphorylated at position 142. It has been clearly demonstrated that unphosphorylated CREB or PKA-modified CREB binds to DNA as a dimer (9Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 9046-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, after modification by CamKII, CREB binds DNA efficiently as a monomer, but monomer binding is not associated with transcriptional stimulation (Figs. 3,D–F, 1 A, and 2 B). When serine 142 is phosphorylated, the monomer-dimer equilibrium is shifted far toward monomer because dimer assembly is prevented even under high concentrations of CREB (Fig. 3, E and F). For the native protein, transcription is inhibited and dimerization is prevented even when serine 133 is modified (Fig. 3 D,Native + CamKII). Modification of CREB at serine 142 prevents CREB dimer assembly at the CRE. If modification at serine 142 also causes previously bound dimers to dissociate, then loss of dimerization might explain the dominant inhibitory effect of CamKII on transcription. Indeed, bound CREB dimers dissociate after CamKII modification before or after serine 133 modification by PKA (Fig.3 G). We conclude that CamKII inhibits transcription by preventing CREB dimerization on DNA. It is well documented that CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 stimulates transcription by increasing the binding affinity of CBP (20Parker D. Jhala U.S. Radhakrishnan I. Yaffe M.B. Reyes C.

Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In contrast, protein-protein association of a 59-amino acid KID domain peptide in CREB with the KIX domain peptide fragment in CBP is inhibited by phosphorylation at serine 142 (20Parker D. Jhala U.S. Radhakrishnan I. Yaffe M.B. Reyes C. Shulman A.I. Cantley L.C. Wright P.E. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 353-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We, therefore, asked whether phosphorylation at 142 and loss of CREB dimerization inhibit transcription by weakening CBP binding to full-length CREB bound to DNA. Full-length native or mutant CREB was bound (ratio of 0.4) to immobilized biotin-labeled dynorphin CRE3. Purified CBP was added last to the CREB·DNA complex, and CBP binding was evaluated. CBP binds modestly to unphosphorylated CREB, and binding is significantly enhanced by PKA modification at serine 133 (Fig.4). Under these conditions, CREB is a dimer (Fig. 4). In contrast, CBP binding is not enhanced on native CREB after CaMKII modification even though serine 133 is modified (Fig.4 A). CBP binding is also not enhanced for the S133A mutant after modification by CamKII. Under these conditions, native CREB and the S133A mutant are monomers (Fig. 4). In all CBP binding experiments, the amount of CREB substrate is similar (Fig. 4, far right panel). Thus, monomers of CREB efficiently bind to DNA when modified by CamKII, but CBP is unable to bind to monomeric CREB even when serine 133 is phosphorylated. In other words, phosphorylation at Ser-133 is necessary but not sufficient for recruiting CBP to the CREB·CRE complex. CREB dimerization is also required. The mechanism by which CamKII inhibits CREB-dependent reporter activity is not well understood. We show here that phosphorylation of CREB at serine 142 prevents dimerization and uncouples CBP binding. Many studies have shown that CREB is a dimer in its unphosphorylated state and when modified by PKA (9Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 9046-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results suggest a model in which CREB dimerization acts as a transcriptional switch that operates through phosphorylation and allows a distinct response depending on the kinase. The data reveal several features that may be important with respect to CREB interactions in vivo. First, CamKII-induced loss of CBP association and CREB dimerization occurs when CREB is bound to DNA. Therefore, these events can directly lead to transcriptional inhibition. It had previously been shown that casein kinase II modification of a 59-amino acid region of the CREB KID domain inhibited protein-protein association with a KIX domain peptide of CBP (20Parker D. Jhala U.S. Radhakrishnan I. Yaffe M.B. Reyes C. Shulman A.I. Cantley L.C. Wright P.E. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 353-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at serine 142 likely disrupts interaction with a Tyr-650 that is an essential residue for the KID/KIK binding interface and the hydrophobic interface (20Parker D. Jhala U.S. Radhakrishnan I. Yaffe M.B. Reyes C. Shulman A.I. Cantley L.C. Wright P.E. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 353-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 33Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). However, casein kinase II modifies at least four other sites within the KID domain. Heretofore, it was not known whether CBP dissociation occurred in the full-length CREB protein, whether dissociation occurred when CREB was bound to DNA, or whether dissociation involved CREB dimerization. Our results not only confirm that CREB modification at serine 142 is sufficient to account for the negative effects on transcription but also reveal that CREB dimerization is involved. Second, CREB when modified by CamKII binds to DNA as a monomer. This was surprising because early studies using model leucine zipper and DNA binding domains suggested that dimerization was essential for CREB binding (34Dwarki V.J. Montminy M.R. Verma I.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Recently, however, detailed spectroscopic and kinetic studies using full-length proteins have revealed that CREB monomers sequentially assemble into a dimer on DNA (29Wu X. Spiro C. Owen W.G. McMurray C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Metallo S.J. Schepartz A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Monomeric forms of CREB have also been reported to activate transcription (36Krajewski W. Lee K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7204-7210Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sequential monomer binding is also observed for other bZip peptides including GCN4 and BLH (37Schepartz A. Metallo S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have used sedimentation equilibrium to calculate the mass of the CREB·DNA complex. The analysis conclusively demonstrates that CamKII-modified CREB is a monomer when bound to DNA. This is in contrast to dimer binding of either unphosphorylated or PKA-modified CREB within the same experiment (Fig. 3 D). Sedimentation equilibrium can be used reliably to evaluate monomer or dimer states in proteins because the calculated mass is independent of either the shape or the charge of the complex (38Van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1985Google Scholar). Gel shift analysis also confirms that CREB remains bound to DNA when modified by CamKII. However, gel shift analysis cannot unambiguously confirm a monomer-dimer complex, especially when there has been a change in the phosphorylation state. It is well documented that proteins of very different mass can migrate at the same position on gels because of charge and shape effects (39Ornstein L. Annals N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar,40Orr M.D. Blakley R.I. Pangou D. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 45: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This is because gel mobility in an electric field is proportional to the ratio of the charge to the frictional coefficient (37Schepartz A. Metallo S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11735-11739Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), both of which are altered by CREB phosphorylation (20Parker D. Jhala U.S. Radhakrishnan I. Yaffe M.B. Reyes C. Shulman A.I. Cantley L.C. Wright P.E. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 353-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Indeed, the slower mobility of the CamKII-modified CREB·DNA complex relative to the native CREB·DNA complex implies that conformational change in CREB has occurred because the addition of two phosphate groups should enhance mobility if charge were the only factor. Although monomeric CREB can bind DNA, a CamKII-modified monomer cannot sustain productive interactions with CBP and the transcription machinery. Finally, loss of CREB dimerization and CBP binding after phosphorylation by CamKII suggests a mechanism for the dominant negative effect on transcription at some genes as well as activation of others. CREB dimerization serves as a molecular switch that integrates calcium and cAMP signals and coordinates gene expression (Fig.5). PKA or CamKIV can stimulate expression of CRE-dependent genes by CREB phosphorylation at serine 133. Under these conditions, CREB exists as a dimer on DNA and successfully attracts CBP to the target gene. However, in the presence of CamKII or other kinases that may modify CREB at serine 142, CREB dimerization is prevented and CREB is no longer able to compete for CBP binding (Fig. 5). Phosphorylation at serine 142 prevents CREB dimerization on DNA before or after binding. Because dimer dissociation can also occur before or after modification of Ser-133 by another kinase, phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-142 produces a dominant inhibitory effect. CamKII is highly concentrated in the dendrites where it constitutes the major protein of post-synaptic structures (25Tompa P. Friedrich P. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 97-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W.

A. 1983; 80: 7357-7361Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Because kinases often translocate slowly from synapse to nucleus, the timing may allow a window of opportunity for gene expression to occur before attenuation by CREB modification at serine 142. Thus, kinase modification of CREB at serine 142 can program gene expression by shifting the CREB dimer-monomer equilibrium. Whereas CamKII widely inhibits expression of reporter genes, a role for CamKII in transcriptional inhibition in vivo has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, regulation in vivo is likely to be more complex then is suggested by a simple reporter system. However, the ability of serine 142 phosphorylation to regulate CREB dimerization may also explain gene activation by CamKII. For gene activation, it is possible that modification at serine 142 and CREB dimer dissociation allow the formation of new heterodimers that restore affinity for CBP. Phosphorylation of CREB provides a mechanism for regulation of transcription because either the dimer or monomer can receive signals that influence the choice of partner. Differential phosphorylation may control selection of a new dimerization partnerin vivo through a monomer intermediate. These effects are likely to play a role in response specificity and may broadly apply to other kinases. The ability to control CREB dimerization and CBP binding by phosphorylation at 142 provides a common mechanism by which signals from diverse pathways can be integrated to control diverse function and neuronal plasticity.

By performing pulse-chase experiments in these cells, we found that LDL-derived cholesterol initially moves from the hydrolytic compartment/lysosome to the plasma membrane (PM) independent of NPC1.

Thus to fully understand the etiology of the NPC disease, it is important to elucidate the intracellular trafficking of endogenous cholesterol from its site of synthesis in the ER and its movement to the PM. The majority of the newly synthesized cholesterol is rapidly transported from the ER to cholesterol-rich microdomains of the PM, termed caveolae (or lipid rafts) by an energy-dependent process (13DeGrella R.F.

The initial movement of the newly synthesized cholesterol to the PM is independent of NPC1 (6Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J.

In this report, we examine the role of NPC1 in the intracellular trafficking of endogenously synthesized cholesterol in both CHO and Hf cells defective in NPC1, testing the hypothesis that NPC1 is involved in the post-PM trafficking of both endogenously synthesized cholesterol and LDL-derived cholesterol. Our results reveal that the ultimate fate of both cholesterol sources with regards to NPC1 is similar: trafficking of both endogenously synthesized cholesterol and LDL-derived cholesterol between the PM and the ER involves NPC1. We also show that, after arriving at the PM, the initial fate of the two sources of cholesterol before entering the NPC1-associated compartment is different. Finally, we demonstrate that the trafficking defect of endogenously synthesized cholesterol in NPC1 cells is not caused by cellular ganglioside accumulation. [3H]Acetate (20 Ci/mmol), [1-14C]acetate (56.7 mCi/mmol), [4-14C]cholesterol (50–60 mCi/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals; [1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl linoleate (30–60 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD),N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), and various glycosphingolipids as thin layer chromatography (TLC) standards were from Sigma; [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL ([3H]CL-LDL), specific radioactivity ranging between 5 and 15 μCi/mg of protein, was prepared as described previously (8Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 25RA cells are a CHO cell line resistant to the cytotoxicity of 25-hydroxycholesterol (20Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7787-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing a gain of function mutation in the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) (21Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). CT43 cells are derived from 25RA cells and are defective in NPC1 (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CT43NPC1-1 is a previously characterized cell line derived from CT43 cells that stably expresses hamster NPC1 (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). CT43NPC1-2 and CT43NPC1-3 are two additional independently isolated hamster NPC1 stable transfectants derived from CT43 cells. Estimation of the mRNA levels by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in CT43NPC1-1 cells had been previously reported (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The level of hamster NPC1 mRNA expressed in these transfectants is relatively low (approximately 5% of the level present in 25RA cells); similar experiments using the CT43NPC1-2and CT43NPC1-3 cells yielded the same result. It should be noted that it had been very difficult for our and other laboratories to obtain stable transfectants expressing normal levels of NPC1 using conventional transfection procedures. However, very recently, a study (22Millard E.E. Srivastava K. Traub L.M. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38445-38451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using a more efficient method for gene delivery (retroviral infection) reported the isolation of CHO cells expressing normal and very high levels of NPC1. Hf NPC cells (93.11 and 94.71) were a generous gift of Peter Pentchev (National Institute of Health). CHO cells were seeded in medium A (Ham's F-12, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin) as monolayers at 37 °C with 5% CO2 on day 1. On day 2, cells were incubated with medium D at 37 °C. When used at 37 °C, medium D refers to Ham's F-12 with 5% delipidated fetal bovine serum (23Chin J. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6304-6310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 35 μm oleic acid, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin; when used at 14 °C, medium D refers to the same medium without sodium bicarbonate and supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7. All experiments were conducted on day 4, when the cells were 80–90% confluent. Similar culture conditions were performed with Hf cell lines, except that Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Pen-Strep (100 units/ml) were used instead of Ham's F-12 and gentamicin, respectively. CHO and Hf cells were grown and cultured in six-well dishes as described under “Cell Culture.” On day 4, CHO cells were prechilled in medium D for 30 min at 4 °C and then pulse-labeled for 2–3 h at 14 °C with 10 μCi of [3H]acetate/well for single-labeling experiments or with 1 μCi of [3H]CL-LDL and 0.5 μCi of [14C]acetate/well for double-labeling experiments, unless otherwise indicated. On day 4, Hf cells were subjected to pulse-chase conditions as described in the figure legends, using 25 μCi of [3H]acetate or 0.5 μCi of [14C]cholesterol/well. After the pulses, the cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and twice with PBS without BSA. For cholesterol efflux experiments in CHO cells: to measure pre-PM cholesterol trafficking, cells were immediately incubated with 2% cyclodextrin in medium D at 37 °C for the indicated times; to measure post-PM cholesterol trafficking, cells were chased in medium D at 37 °C for the indicated times and then incubated with 2% cyclodextrin in medium D for 30 min at 37 °C (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To measure cholesterol esterification, after the pulse-labeling, cells were chased in medium D without cyclodextrin at 37 °C for the indicated times. The radiolabeled lipids were extracted and separated via TLC; the respective14C or 3H label counts were measured in a liquid scintillation counter using a dual-labeling program. In [14C]- or [3H]acetate labeling experiments, both cholesterol and fatty acids were labeled. To analyze the label distribution of cholesteryl esters in cholesterol and fatty acids, the labeled cholesteryl esters scraped off the TLC underwent saponification and re-extraction; the separated cholesterol and fatty acid components were then quantified by TLC according to procedures previously employed (24Limanek J.S. Chin J. Chang T.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5452-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Chang C.C.Y. Doolittle G.M. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1693-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The result showed that over 95% of the recovered label was cholesterol. Other methods, including the percentage of cholesterol efflux, percentage of (re)esterification, and percentage of hydrolysis were determined as described previously (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were grown and cultured in 2 × 150-mm dishes as described under “Cell Culture,” except that cells were incubated with medium D on day 3. On day 4, cells were prechilled in medium D for 30 min at 4 °C and then pulse-labeled for 3 h at 14 °C with 10 μCi of [3H]CL-LDL and 5 μCi of [14C]acetate/dish. The cells were washed once with PBS plus 5 mg/ml BSA, washed twice with PBS without BSA, and chased in medium D for 2 or 24 h at 37 °C. The method to isolate the PM and internal membrane (IM) fractions, adapted from a previously described procedure (16Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), is described as follows. After the pulse-chase, all of the subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. Cells were washed two times with buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8), scraped, and collected by centrifugation (1400 × g, 5 min). The cell pellet was homogenized in 1 ml of buffer A, using 10 strokes of a 2-ml “Dura-Grind” stainless steel homogenizer (Wheaton). The homogenate was centrifuged (1000 × g, 10 min), the post-nuclear supernatant was collected, and the pellet was homogenized and centrifuged again. The post-nuclear supernatants were combined and loaded onto a Percoll gradient (30% in buffer A, 23.5 ml) and centrifuged (84,000 × g, 30 min), and 25 fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top. The PM usually localized to fractions 9 and 10, as evidenced by a visible white membrane band and the enrichment of Na+/K+ ATPase enzyme activity (26Spillane D.M. Reagan Jr., J.W. Kennedy N.J. Schneider D.L. Chang T.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and anti-caveolin-1 expression as determined by immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal caveolin-1 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Protein determinations were as described (27Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7065) Google Scholar). On day 1, cells were cultured in medium A. On day 2, the medium was changed to medium D supplemented withNB-DNJ as described in the figure legend. On day 5, cells were harvested by cell scraping, pelleted by centrifugation, and washed three times with PBS. For glycolipid analysis, a method previously described was employed (28Platt F.M. Reinkensmeier G. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19365-19372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The lipids were extracted from the pellet three times by adding 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1) with vortexing, first overnight at 4 °C and then for 3 h at room temperature, pooled, and dried under nitrogen. The lipid fraction was analyzed by TLC, using a solvent system of chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4, v/v). The TLC plate was air-dried, and the glycolipids were identified by spraying with α-napthol (1% (w/v), in methanol) followed by 50% (v/v) sulfuric acid and heat-treated (80 °C for 10 min). We pulse-labeled mutant CT43 cells and their parental 25RA cells with [3H]acetate at 14 °C then chased the cells at 37 °C. Acetate is the principal metabolite from which cholesterol is biosynthesized. Early work has shown that, when cells are pulsed with radiolabeled acetate at 14 °C, most of the newly synthesized cholesterol remains in the ER as free, unesterified cholesterol; upon warming the cells at 37 °C, the labeled cholesterol moves to the PM within minutes (29Kaplan M.R. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To monitor the arrival of cholesterol at the PM, we chased cells with cyclodextrin to measure cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol efflux (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). We found significant amounts of endogenous cholesterol rapidly appeared at the PM in both cell types within 10–20 min (Fig. 1 A). In agreement with earlier studies (6Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 19Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), this result indicates that the movement of endogenous cholesterol from the ER to the PM does not involve NPC1. To monitor the post-PM fate of endogenous cholesterol, we used the same protocol for the pulse period, but chased the cells without cyclodextrin, then determined the amount of labeled cholesterol esterified by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1), a resident ER protein (31Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The results revealed that CT43 cells are severely defective in esterifying endogenous cholesterol throughout the chase period (up to 21 h) (Fig. 1 B). The inability of CT43 cells to esterify endogenous cholesterol was not due to defects in the ACAT-1 enzyme, for ACAT-1 activity was normal in CT43 cells. By using a reconstituted ACAT enzyme assay (32Chang C.C.Y. Lee C-Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we found that the ACAT specific activity in 25RA and CT43 cells was 119.4 ± 12.3 and 99.2 ± 14.1 pmol/min/mg, respectively. To ascertain that the observed defect in endogenous cholesterol esterification is due to mutation within the NPC1 gene in CT43 cells, we compared the percentage of endogenous cholesterol esterifications in 25RA, CT43, and three NPC1 stable transfectant cell lines independently isolated from CT43 cells. We found that the percentage of endogenous cholesterol esterification values in NPC1 stable transfectant cells were significantly higher (by up to 2.7-fold) than the value in CT43 cells, although not as high as the value in 25RA cells (Fig. 1 C). The partial restoration in ability to esterify endogenous cholesterol may be explained by the low expression level of the transfected hamster NPC1 seen in the stable transfectant clones (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These cumulative findings imply that NPC1 is functionally involved in the post-PM trafficking of endogenous cholesterol from the PM to the ER. Both mutant CT43 cells and their parental 25RA cells contain a gain of function mutation in the protein SCAP (20Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7787-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), rendering these cells resistant to sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation. It may be argued that the phenotype demonstrated in CT43 cells may not be seen in NPC cells without the SCAP mutation. To address this concern, we examined two independent Hf NPC cells, NPC 93.22 and NPC 94.71. Both NPC 93.22 and NPC 94.71 cells stained positively with filipin, indicative of an accumulation of free intracellular cholesterol (Fig. 2 A). We then examined the ability of these cells to esterify cholesterol delivered via different routes and found that both NPC 93.22 and NPC 94.71 cells were defective in re-esterifying LDL-derived cholesterol (Fig. 2 B), with NPC 94.71 cells exhibiting a more serious defect. When esterification of endogenously synthesized cholesterol (Fig. 2 C) or cholesterol delivered from the growth medium (Fig. 2 D) was examined, we discovered that only NPC 94.71 cells but not NPC 93.22 cells exhibited a defect relative to control cells. These results indicate that the various cholesterol esterification defects observed in CT43 cells can be seen in some but not all of Hf NPC cells. Once arriving at the PM, endogenous cholesterol may be internalized and recycle between an internal compartment and the PM in a similar manner as demonstrated for LDL-derived cholesterol (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we used the same protocol for the pulse period as described earlier but chased the cells in medium without cyclodextrin for various periods of time at 37 °C, thus allowing cholesterol arriving at the PM to be internalized. Afterward, cells were incubated with cyclodextrin for 30 min to monitor the movement of internalized cholesterol back to the PM. We found that CT43 cells exhibited no defect after an 8-h chase but displayed a partial defect after a 24-h chase (Fig. 3 A). To directly compare the kinetics of this post-PM trafficking step between endogenous cholesterol and LDL-derived cholesterol, we simultaneously pulse-labeled 25RA and CT43 cells with [14C]acetate and [3H]CL-LDL at 14 °C, then subjected the cells to the same chase conditions described above. The result revealed that CT43 cells exhibited a defect in endogenous cholesterol efflux only after a 24-h chase but not after a 2-, 4-, or 8-h chase (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, a defect in LDL-derived cholesterol efflux in the same cells was found as early as after a 2-h chase 2As the chase period increased, the defect in LDL-derived cholesterol in these cells gradually decreased. This result may be due to the existence of a default pathway that occurs in NPC1 cells, when the cholesterol sorting compartment fuses with the lysosome, permitting cholesterol to be released from the lysosome to the PM (10Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). (Fig. 3 B). These findings are consistent with the interpretation that both endogenous cholesterol and LDL-derived cholesterol enter an internal cholesterol pool that requires NPC1 for further cholesterol trafficking and sorting. However, the pathways by which each cholesterol source enters the internal cholesterol pool are different. To further compare the involvement of NPC1 in endogenous cholesterol and LDL-derived cholesterol trafficking pathways, we examined the initial arrival at the PM of both endogenous and LDL-derived cholesterol in 25RA and CT43 cells. We pulse-labeled cells with [14C]acetate and [3H]CL-LDL at 14 °C then chased the cells with cyclodextrin at 37 °C for the indicated times. We found that, in both cell types, the trafficking of endogenous cholesterol to the PM was much more rapid than that of LDL-derived cholesterol 3Additional experiments showed that, with longer incubation time (>90 min), the LDL-derived cholesterol eventually became readily accessible to cyclodextrin (data not shown). (Fig. 4 A). The slower appearance of LDL-derived cholesterol at the PM can only be partially accounted for by the limited cholesteryl ester hydrolysis of LDL at the earlier time points (before or at 30 min; Fig. 4 B). To compare the post-PM movements of endogenous cholesterol and LDL-derived cholesterol to the ER, we chased the cells without cyclodextrin for the various indicated times to monitor the esterification rates of the two cholesterol sources. In 25RA cells, we found that endogenous cholesterol was esterified at a slower rate than that of LDL-derived cholesterol (Fig. 4 C). As replotted in Fig. 4 D, after a 180-min chase, the relative increase in esterification of endogenous cholesterol was calculated to be approximately one-third that of LDL-derived cholesterol. The control experiment showed that each cholesterol source was esterified to a much less extent in CT43 cells than in 25RA cells. 4We noted that, at the zero time point, the percentage of esterification was higher for endogenous cholesterolversus LDL-derived cholesterol in both cell types (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that a small portion of newly synthesized cholesterol in the ER is available as a substrate for ACAT-1 without first traversing the PM. Thus, in 25RA cells, although endogenous cholesterol arrives at the PM faster than LDL-derived cholesterol (Fig. 4A), the subsequent post-PM movement of endogenous cholesterol to the ER for esterification is slower than that of LDL-derived cholesterol (Fig. 4 D). These findings provide further evidence to support the notion that both endogenous cholesterol and LDL-derived cholesterol enter an internal cholesterol pool for NPC1-dependent cholesterol trafficking and esterification, but the pathways by which each cholesterol source enters this pool are different. To biochemically compare the initial and ultimate fates of endogenous cholesterol and LDL-derived cholesterol, we used the double-labeling procedure described earlier to perform pulse-chase experiments in 25RA and CT43 cells then analyzed the cell homogenates using a 30% Percoll gradient (16Smart E.J.

It is particularly noteworthy that pneumocandin inhibitors of β-glucan synthesis have been shown to rapidly inhibitP. carinii growth in rodent models (33Schmatz D.M. Romancheck M.A. Pittarelli L.A.

Such studies provide evidence of the importance of β-glucan generation during life cycle progression of this organism. Despite the considerable importance of β-glucan assembly in life cycle expression of this organism, in immune recognition during infection, and as a potential therapeutic target for pneumonia, the mechanisms of β-1,3-glucan assembly by P. carinii are not yet fully understood.The current investigation was undertaken to accomplish the following: 1) to establish whether P. carinii cell wall assembly occurs through action of a Gsc-1 protein mediating β-1,3-glucan synthesis; 2) to clone and characterize the respective gsc-1 encoding this activity in P. carinii; and finally 3) to evaluate expression of P. carinii gsc-1 over the life cycle of the organism.DISCUSSIONP. carinii membrane isolates possess the ability to incorporate UDP-[14C]glucose into insoluble carbohydrate, which is inhibited by the pneumocandin L-733,560 antagonist of Gsc-1-type β-1,3-glucan synthetases. Molecular cloning of theP. carinii gsc-1 gene predicts a mature protein with both similarities and unique differences to other fungal β-1,3-glucan synthetases. Specifically, the mRNA and protein expression ofP. carinii gsc-1 are highly regulated over the life cycle of the organism being predominantly expressed by cystic forms of the organism. A protein corresponding to the predicted sequence of the cloned gsc-1 gene was present in P. cariniimembrane isolates. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of the putativeP. carinii Gsc-1 protein with a synthetic peptide antibody yielded a product capable of mediating incorporation of UDP-Glc into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material, consistent with glucan.P. carinii Gsc-1 glucan synthetase exhibits several unique features. As discussed, structural differences were detected in the domain configuration of P. carinii Gsc-1 compared withS. cerevisiae and Aspergillus (26Castro C. Ribas J.C. Valdivieso M.H. Varona R. Ray F.D. Duran A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5732-5739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Douglas C.M. Foor F. Marrinan J.A. Morin N. Nielsen J.B. Dahl J.A. Mazur P. Baginsky W. Li W. El-Sherbeini M.

J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4381-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Of further contrast, is the significant restriction of gsc-1expression predominantly to the cystic forms of the P. carinii. Most other fungi, including ascomycetous fungi, exhibit cell wall assembly constitutively throughout the life cycle (55Carlson C.R. Grallert B. Bernander R. Stokke T. Boye E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our immunoblot and Northern analyses are complementary to previous immune localization studies, which also indicate that β-1,3-glucan is largely found within cysts (6Campbell W.G. Arch. Pathol. 1972; 93: 312-330PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nollstadt K.H. Powles M.A. Fujioka H. Aikawa M. Schmatz D.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2258-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Because mammalian hosts do not possess an equivalent to Gsc-1, inhibition of β-1,3-glucan synthesis represents an attractive target for treatment of fungal infections. Echinocandins and pneumocandins are selective lipopeptide inhibitors that may expand our armamentaria for fungal infections, including those organisms resistant to standard agents (32Kurtz M.B. Abruzzo G. Flattery A. Bartizal K. Marrinan J.A. Li W. Milligan J. Nollstadt K. Douglas C.M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3244-3251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Schmatz and colleagues (33Schmatz D.M. Romancheck M.A. Pittarelli L.A. Schwartz R.E. Fromtling R.A. Nollstadt K.H. Vanmiddlesworth F.L. Wilson K.E. Turner M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown rapid reduction of organisms in rat and mouse models of P. cariniipneumonia. One pneumocandin in particular, L-671,329 has shown remarkable activity in the P. carinii rat model with >98% of cysts being eliminated (33Schmatz D.M. Romancheck M.A. Pittarelli L.A. Schwartz R.E. Fromtling R.A. Nollstadt K.H. Vanmiddlesworth F.L. Wilson K.E. Turner M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5950-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Concern had arisen that pneumocandins might only be effective against cystic forms of P. carinii, thereby limiting efficacy of such compounds during P. carinii pneumonia. The striking results of pneumocandins in animal models of P. cariniipneumonia strongly argue to the contrary (34Schmatz D.M. Powles M.A. McFadden D. Nollstadt K. Bouffard F.A. Dropinski J.F. Liberator P. Andersen J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1320-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings do suggest, however, that progression of trophic forms into cysts represents an essential component of life cycle progression in P. carinii, rather than an elective form utilized only under hostile conditions (7Limper A.H. Thomas C.F. Anders R.A. Leof E.B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1997; 130: 132-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Other investigators have also found some effect of echinocandins on trophic structure after in vitro exposure (36Bartlett M.S. Current W.L. Goheen M.P. Boylan C.J. Lee C.H. Shaw M.M. Queener S.F. Smith J.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although our study demonstrates low levels of gsc-1mRNA expression in trophic forms, small residual amounts of Gsc-1 protein were detected by Western analysis to remain within trophic forms. In addition, echinocandin and pneumocandin compounds may also effect other targets within P. carinii.Until recently, the lack of a reliable culture system has hindered studies of life cycle regulation by P. carinii (56Sloand E. Laughon B. Armstrong B. Bartlett M.S. Blumenfeld W. Cushion M. Kalica A. Kovacs J.A. Martin W.J. Pitt E. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recent studies implicate a cyclin-dependent kinase cell cycle control system, which exhibits regulated activity during progression ofP. carinii trophic forms to cysts (44Thomas Jr., C.F. Anders R.A.

Leof E.B. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1997; 44: 32SCrossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Considerable questions remain as to how assembly of the thickened β-glucan-rich pellicle is specifically limited to the cystic form of the organism. A variety of potential environmental signals, including interaction with lung epithelium, availability of nitrogen and lipid substrates, and the presence of differential mating types might initiate progression to cyst formation. Recently, Merali and Clarkson (58Merali S. Frevert U. Williams H. Chin K. Bryan R. Clarkson Jr., A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have reported continuous axenic culture of P. carinii. Further exploitation of this system using the molecular tools we report should provide essential insights into regulation of the P. cariniilife cycle.Exposed β-1,3-glucan on the surface of fungi also represents a major target of host recognition and inflammatory response (11Hoffman O.A. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3932-3940PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hidalgo H.A. Helmke R.J. German V.F. Mangos J.A. J. Protozool. 1991; 38: 30S-31SCrossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Binding of β-glucan to receptors on macrophages participates in phagocytic uptake of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (59Janusz M.J. Austen K.F. Czop J.K.

Immunol. Lett. 1993; 37: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). With respect to P. carinii, surface β-1,3-glucan on the organism can mediate alveolar macrophage uptake of P. carinii and also serve as a potent stimulant of release of TNFα and reactive oxidants (11Hoffman O.A.

A corresponding protein of appropriate 219.5-kDa molecular mass was present in P. carinii using an antibody generated to the predicted Gsc-1 protein. The expression of P. carinii gsc-1 is regulated over the life cycle of the organisms. In view of its central role in assembly of the P. carinii cyst wall, the Gsc-1 β-1,3-glucan synthetase is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of P. carinii pneumonia.

Fungal β-glucans are assembled by a multisubunit enzyme complex within the organism's cell membrane. Gsc-1 proteins mediate the polymerization of uridine 5′-diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glc)1 into the insoluble β-1,3-glucan core required for cell wall assembly (26Castro C. Ribas J.C. Valdivieso M.H.

Because mammalian cells do not possess glucan biosynthetic pathways, cell wall assembly represents an attractive target for the treatment of fungal infection. It is particularly noteworthy that pneumocandin inhibitors of β-glucan synthesis have been shown to rapidly inhibitP. carinii growth in rodent models (33Schmatz D.M. Romancheck M.A. Pittarelli L.A.

Such studies provide evidence of the importance of β-glucan generation during life cycle progression of this organism. Despite the considerable importance of β-glucan assembly in life cycle expression of this organism, in immune recognition during infection, and as a potential therapeutic target for pneumonia, the mechanisms of β-1,3-glucan assembly by P. carinii are not yet fully understood. The current investigation was undertaken to accomplish the following: 1) to establish whether P. carinii cell wall assembly occurs through action of a Gsc-1 protein mediating β-1,3-glucan synthesis; 2) to clone and characterize the respective gsc-1 encoding this activity in P. carinii; and finally 3) to evaluate expression of P. carinii gsc-1 over the life cycle of the organism. DISCUSSIONP. carinii membrane isolates possess the ability to incorporate UDP-[14C]glucose into insoluble carbohydrate, which is inhibited by the pneumocandin L-733,560 antagonist of Gsc-1-type β-1,3-glucan synthetases. Molecular cloning of theP. carinii gsc-1 gene predicts a mature protein with both similarities and unique differences to other fungal β-1,3-glucan synthetases. Specifically, the mRNA and protein expression ofP. carinii gsc-1 are highly regulated over the life cycle of the organism being predominantly expressed by cystic forms of the organism. A protein corresponding to the predicted sequence of the cloned gsc-1 gene was present in P. cariniimembrane isolates. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of the putativeP. carinii Gsc-1 protein with a synthetic peptide antibody yielded a product capable of mediating incorporation of UDP-Glc into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material, consistent with glucan.P. carinii Gsc-1 glucan synthetase exhibits several unique features. As discussed, structural differences were detected in the domain configuration of P. carinii Gsc-1 compared withS. cerevisiae and Aspergillus (26Castro C. Ribas J.C. Valdivieso M.H. Varona R.

Of further contrast, is the significant restriction of gsc-1expression predominantly to the cystic forms of the P. carinii. Most other fungi, including ascomycetous fungi, exhibit cell wall assembly constitutively throughout the life cycle (55Carlson C.R. Grallert B. Bernander R. Stokke T. Boye E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our immunoblot and Northern analyses are complementary to previous immune localization studies, which also indicate that β-1,3-glucan is largely found within cysts (6Campbell W.G. Arch.

The histone fold motifs of p17 and DPB4 are related to that of subunit A of the CCAAT binding factor, whereas the histone fold motifs found in p12 and DPB3 are homologous to that in subunit C of CCAAT binding factor. p17 together with p12, but not p17 or p12 alone, interact with both p261 and p59 subunits of HeLa pol ε. The genes for p17 and p12 can be assigned to chromosome locations 9q33 and 2p12, respectively. HeLa DNA polymerase ε (pol ε), possibly involved in both DNA replication and DNA repair, was previously isolated as a complex of a 261-kDa catalytic subunit and a tightly bound 59-kDa accessory protein. Saccharomyces cerevisiaepol ε, however, consists of four subunits: a 256-kDa catalytic subunit with 39% identity to HeLa pol ε p261, a 80-kDa subunit (DPB2) with 26% identity to HeLa pol ε p59, a 23-kDa subunit (DPB3), and a 22-kDa subunit (DPB4). We report here the identification and the cloning of two additional subunits of HeLa pol ε, p17, and p12. Both proteins contain histone fold motifs which are present also in S. cerevisiae DPB4 and DPB3. The histone fold motifs of p17 and DPB4 are related to that of subunit A of the CCAAT binding factor, whereas the histone fold motifs found in p12 and DPB3 are homologous to that in subunit C of CCAAT binding factor. p17 together with p12, but not p17 or p12 alone, interact with both p261 and p59 subunits of HeLa pol ε. The genes for p17 and p12 can be assigned to chromosome locations 9q33 and 2p12, respectively.

Full-Text PDF Open Access polymerase polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis CCAAT binding factor nucleotide excision repair expressed sequence tag DNA polymerase ε is one of eight mammalian DNA template-directed DNA polymerases whose activities have been reported. Similar to pol δ,1 pol ε possesses an intrinsic proofreading exonuclease activity, has high processivity, lacks primase activity, and prefers poly(dA)-oligo(dT) as a template-primer (1Syväoja J.

Unlike pol δ, however, pol ε is highly processive even in the absence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (2Syväoja J. Linn S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15557-15564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of our understanding about the function of pol ε comes from genetic studies in S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae pol ε is an essential replicative polymerase, because pol 2 mutants arrest at the early stage of S phase with the dumbbell phenotype, which is characteristic of DNA synthesis mutants (4Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae pol ε is also a repair polymerase because it catalyzes UV-induced repair DNA synthesis in vivo (7Araki H. Ropp P.A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Morrison A. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2173-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and extracts from pol 2 mutants failed to support normal levels of NER and BER reactions in vitro (9Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast pol ε has been proposed to exert an S phase checkpoint function by sensing DNA replication blocks and DNA damage (10Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In contrast to the success in S. cerevisiae, progress in understanding the function of mammalian pol ε has been problematic because of the deficiency of amenable genetics and the lack of a suitable cell-free reconstituted DNA replication or DNA repair system that can faithfully mimic the in vivo situation. HeLa pol ε was initially purified as a soluble factor that restored repair synthesis to cytosol-depleted, UV-irradiated permeabilized human fibroblasts (11Nishida C. Reinhard P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 501-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By reconstituting the nucleotide excision repair (NER) process from purified proteins, Shivji et al. (12Shivji M.K. Podust V.N. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) further showed that mammalian pol ε was the most efficient enzyme in performing gap-filling DNA synthesis during NER. However, Zeng et al. (13Zeng X.R. Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Hao H. Lee M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13748-13751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reached a different conclusion by studying NER reactions catalyzed by cell-free extracts. They found that the monoclonal antibody against pol δ, which did not cross-react with pol ε, markedly inhibited the repair of UV-irradiated plasmid DNA up to 85%. Their findings strongly indicated that pol δ instead of pol ε, was the major, if not the only, polymerase involved in NER. Of course, the discrepancy of these results may be due to the difference in variousin vitro assay conditions. A complex scenario also occurs in studying the role of mammalian pol ε in DNA replication. HeLa pol ε has been implicated in DNA replication in vivo because it is associated with actively replicating cellular DNA (14Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mitogenic stimulation enhanced the UV cross-linking of pol ε to nascent DNA along with that of the replicative polymerases pol α and pol δ (14Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, pol ε has no essential function in the in vitro replication assay using SV-40 DNA as template; moreover, it cannot replace pol δ in the reaction (15Tsurimoto T. Melendy T. Stillman B. Nature. 1990; 346: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 16Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol.

Does HeLa pol ε have similar functions to those of S. cerevisiae pol ε? In fact, the previously known subunit structures of the two enzymes were different. S. cerevisiaepol ε is isolated as a catalytic subunit of 256 kDa and three accessory proteins of molecular weights 79,461 (DPB2), 23,005 (DPB3), and 21,998 (DPB4) (18Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa pol ε has a catalytic subunit of 261 kDa with 39% peptide sequence identity to the yeast catalytic subunit (19Kesti T. Frantti H. Syvaoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10238-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but only a 59-kDa accessory protein with 26% peptide sequence identity to the yeast DPB2 subunit has been reported to date (20Li Y. Asahara H. Patel V.S. Zhou S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32337-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Jokela M. Makiniemi M. Lehtonen S. Szpirer C. Hellman U. Syvaoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the cDNA cloning of two proteins of 17 and 12 kDa that interact with HeLa pol ε. Both p17 and p12 contain histone fold motifs similar to those found in the S. cerevisiae pol ε subunits DPB4 and DPB3, respectively. Hydroxyurea and dimethylpimelimidate were from Sigma. pBluescriptKS(+/−) and a HeLa Uni-ZAPTM XR cDNA library in λ phage were from Stratagene. pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1/V5- His-TOPO were from Invitrogen, and pCMV-Tag2 was from Stratagene. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (recA1endA1gyrA96thi-1hsdR17supE44 relA1lac[F′proAB lacIqZ M15 Tn10 (Tetr)]c was used for plasmid maintenance and propagation. Monoclonal antibodies against HeLa pol ε p59 and p261 from the hybridoma cell lines generated and characterized by Drs. G. Chui and P. H. Hwang (22Chui G.S. Ph.D. Thesis . Characterization of HeLa DNA Polymerase Epsilon. University of California, Berkeley, California1995Google Scholar, 23Hwang P. Ph.D. Thesis . 1. Studies on associated proteins of DNA Polymerase Epsilon from human HeLa cells 2. Cloning of infc from Bacillus subtilids. University of California, Berkeley, California1995Google Scholar) were purified using protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitating IgG, 3B4.12.9 directed against p59, was used for affinity purification; IgG 3A5.6 and IgG 3C5.1 directed against p59 and p261, respectively, were used for immunoblotting. Anti-V5 antibody was from Invitrogen and anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma. After a challenge with 2 mmhydroxyurea at 37 °C for 10 h, 40 liters of HeLa cells at a density of 5 × 105/ml were harvested and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Soluble extracts were prepared as described by Syväoja et al. (1Syväoja J. Suomensaari S. Nishida C. Goldsmith J.S. Chui G.S. Jain S. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The extract was fractionated by 30–50% ammonium sulfate precipitation and then dialyzed overnight in antibody binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The dialyzed extract was mixed with 3 ml of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h to eliminate proteins that bind nonspecifically to protein G. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 1500 × gfor 5 min was mixed with 5 mg of IgG 3B4.12.9, covalently cross-linked to 2.5 ml of protein G-Sepharose beads with dimethylpimelimidate (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunoabsorption was carried out for 4 h at 4 °C, after which the beads were washed successively with 30 ml of antibody binding buffer, 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol. Bound proteins were then eluted with 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 13.0) and 10% glycerol, and the eluted fraction was immediately neutralized with 1 m phosphoric acid, dialyzedversus 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% SDS, and dried in a speed vac. The immnopurified proteins were resuspended in Laemmli gel loading buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and subjected to 6–20% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue followed by destaining in water. The protein bands of interest were removed and sent to the Protein Structure Laboratory at the University of California at Davis for in-gel Lys-C (Wako Biochemicals) digestion, high pressure liquid chromatography separation of the resultant peptides, and Edman degradation for peptide sequencing. Human expressed sequence tags (EST) were searched for sequences encoding the two peptides from p17 (TLNXSDVLSAMEEME and FVTPLK) by using the NCBI, National Institutes of Health BLAST server and the TBLASTN program (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Seven human ESTs were identified and aligned with the SeqMan program (DNASTAR Co.), and a continuous sequence was assembled from the alignment. When sequence variants occurred, the majority sequence was taken as the correct one. The assembled continuous DNA sequence was used to design two primers: sense 1, GAGGACCTAAACCTGCCCAAT (nucleotides 81–101), and antisense 1, CTTTCAATGGGGTAACGAACC (nucleotides 304–324). A HeLa Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library (Stratagene) was then screened for a clone containing these two primers by a PCR-based method described by Israel (26Israel D.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105clones of the library were divided into 64 wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning). Each well contained about 1500 clones that were then propagated in E. coli XL1-Blue for 6 h. Amplified phage from each of 8 wells across columns, and each of 8 wells down rows, were pooled. The pooled phage were screened for the presence of the p17 cDNA by PCR using primers sense 1 and antisense 1. The clones from a single positive well were divided into 64 wells and screened again by PCR. The screening process was repeated several times until an individual positive clone was obtained. Eleven human ESTs were identified to have significant homology to the S. cerevisiaepol ε DPB3 peptide sequences by using the NCBI BLAST server and the TBLASTN program (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). A continuous sequence was assembled from these ESTs and was used to design two primers: sense1, ACGCCCGAGAGGAGGAGGTAC (nucleotides 53–74), and antisense1, GATGAGATCTCTGCTTATCCCG (nucleotides 506–527). A HeLa Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library (Stratagene) was then screened for a clone containing those two primers by a PCR-based method described by Israel (26Israel D.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For sequencing, plasmid DNAs were purified using the QIAprep Spin plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen), and PCR products were purified using the UltraCleanTM 15 kit (Mo Bio Labs, Inc.). DNA sequencing was carried out by the University of California at Berkeley Sequencing facility using an automated ABI373 DNA Analysis System (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Both strands of the cDNAs of p17 and p12 were sequenced. The sequences obtained from different reactions were aligned by using the SeqMan program (DNASTAR Inc.). Continuous sequences were assembled from the observed overlaps. The open reading frame of the p17 cDNA or the p12 cDNA with its Kozak sequence was cloned into the pBluescript KS(+/−) vector (Stratagene) with the 5′-end proximal to the T7 promoter. In vitro transcription and translation was carried out with the TNT® T7 Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols in a reaction volume of 25 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, the reaction was chilled on ice and then terminated. The full-length cDNA of HeLa pol ε p261 or p59 was transcribed and translated in a reaction volume of 25 μl using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine as described above. 5 μl of the translated p261 or p59 was mixed with 10 μl of the in vitro translated p17 and/or 10 μl of the in vitro translated p12. The same volume of Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was added to the mixture to give rise to a final concentration of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, 0.2 μg of the anti-p261 IgG (3A3.2) or the anti-p59 IgG (3B4.12.9) was added to the reaction, and immunoprecipitation was allowed to occur at 37 °C for 1 h. The proteins immunoprecipitated by the IgG were collected onto 20 μl of protein G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed three times with the Nonidet P-40 buffer and then resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli gel loading buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins bound to the protein G beads were released by incubating at 85 °C for 10 min and then separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter that was autoradiographed. All eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed by standard PCR and molecular biology techniques. The open reading frame of the p261 cDNA with its Kozak sequence was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). An expression vector for FLAG-tagged p17 was constructed in pCMV-Tag 2 (Stratagene). Expression vectors for V5-tagged p12 or V5-tagged p59 were constructed in pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney 293E cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfections, cells were grown to 70% confluence in 100-mm cell culture dishes and transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE™6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Resulting cell-free extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies recognizing the epitope tags. Immunoprecipitates were washed in the lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subsequently analyzed by protein immunoblotting. A protein band corresponding in position following SDS-PAGE to a relative molecular mass of 19 kDa was initially identified with the pol ε p261 and p59 subunits purified from HeLa cells that had been treated for 10 h with 2 mm hydroxyurea (Fig.1). Using a 6–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel instead of the standard 7.5% gel (20Li Y. Asahara H. Patel V.S. Zhou S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32337-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), this band was then identified in our purified pol ε preparations from untreated HeLa cells (data not shown). To obtain partial amino acid sequence, the protein band corresponding to a relative molecular mass of 19 kDa was in-gel digested with Lys-C protease (Wako Biochemicals), and the resultant peptides were resolved by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and sequenced by Edman degradation. Two peptides (TLNXSDVLSAMEEME and FVTPLK) were identified in this way. The current data bases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information were searched for sequences containing these two peptides. No protein sequences were identified by the BLASTP algorithm (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein with a relative molecular mass of 19 kDa is a novel protein. However, seven human ESTs were found to encode the two peptides. These ESTs were aligned and assembled into a continuous sequence. Two primers were chosen from the continuous sequence and then used to screen a HeLa Uni-ZAP XR cDNA library (Stratagene) by the PCR-based method of Israel (26Israel D.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A 2105-base pair cDNA clone containing these two primer sequences was obtained. The sequence codes for an open reading frame (starting from ATG) of 444 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 147 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 16,907 Da and a predicted pI of 4.72. Sixty-five nucleotides of 5′-untranslated sequence and 1596 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated sequence were also present. The first ATG was identified as the translation start codon because it was within the sequence GGCATGG, the consensus Kozak sequence for translation initiation (27Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In addition, one stop codon in frame with the ATG is located 45 base pairs upstream from the start codon. The stop codon of the cDNA is TGA, and a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is 9 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail. The predicted molecular mass of p17, 16,907 Da, is smaller than its apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE. The discrepancy is probably caused by the acidic pI of this protein. To test this hypothesis, the open reading frame of p17 was expressed in anin vitro rabbit reticulocyte system, and the product was analyzed on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As shown in lane 1 of each panel of the experiments in Fig. 5below, the in vitro translated protein migrates at a position corresponding to 19 kDa, which agrees with the apparent molecular mass of the protein purified from HeLa cells. By searching the UniGene data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, an EST (accession number W03622), which is identical to a cDNA fragment of the human p17 gene, was assigned to the UniGene cluster Hs. 108112. Hs. 108112 has been mapped to a region of chromosome 9q33, which is between marks D9S177 and D9S154 (28Deloukas P. Schuler G.D. Gyapay G. Beasley E.M. Soderlund C. Rodriguez-Tome P. Hui L. Matise T.C. McKusick K.B. Beckmann J.S. Bentolila S. Bihoreau M. Birren B.B. Browne J. Butler A. Castle A.B. Chiannilkulchai N. Clee C. Day P.J. Dehejia A. Dibling T. Drouot N. Duprat S. Fizames C. Bentley D.R. Science. 1998; 282: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Thus, the gene of human p17 can be assigned to chromosome 9, region q33. HeLa p17 has 36.5% identity to an unknown protein of S. pombe (accession number 2117305) and 32.7% identity to S. cerevisiae pol ε DPB4 subunit. The alignment of the three proteins using the program ClustalW 1.7 (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 2. Two conserved regions were identified by the Block Maker program, which included the histone fold motif at the N-terminal region and an acidic amino acid-rich domain at the C-terminal region. The histone fold motif resembles an extended helix-strand-helix motif first identified in the core histone proteins as being primarily responsible for dimerization of the H2A/H2B and H3/H4 histone pairs (30Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Recently a number of proteins engaged in protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, such as TAFIIB (transcription factor IIB), CBF, and DR1 (TATA-binding protein-associated phosphoprotein), have been found to contain the histone fold motifs (31Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The histone fold motif found in HeLa p17 is most related to that of CBF-A (Fig. 2). Similar to CBF-A, p17 also has an acidic amino acid-rich region following the histone fold motif. p17 is the homologue to S. cerevisiae pol ε DPB4. We thus asked whether there exists a human homologue for S. cerevisiae pol ε DPB3. Eleven human ESTs were identified to have significant homology to S. cerevisiae DPB3. The continuous sequence assembled from these ESTs forms an open reading frame of 348 residues that encodes a polypeptide of 116 amino acid residues that contains a histone fold motif similar to that of DPB3. However, this cDNA fragment did not likely contain coding sequence for the 5′ terminus because it did not contain a start ATG codon in the correct reading frame. Therefore, to obtain the full-length cDNA sequence, a HeLa λZAP cDNA library was screened with two oligonucleotides derived from the assembled EST sequence. A 803-base pair cDNA clone containing the two oligonucleotide sequences was identified after six rounds of screening. This cDNA codes for an open reading frame (starting from ATG) of 351 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 117 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 12,251 Da and a predicted pI of 4.87. The first ATG was identified as the translation start codon because it was within the sequence GGGATGG, the consensus Kozak sequence for translation initiation (27Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). In addition, one TAG stop codon in frame with the ATG initiation codon was present 60 nucleotides upstream. The 3′ noncoding region was found to consist of 427 nucleotides with a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) 17 nucleotides upstream from the poly(A) tail. Moreover, the p12 gene is part of a Unigene cluster, Hs. 19980, which has been mapped to chromosome 2, region p12 (between marker D2S292 and S2S145) (28Deloukas P. Schuler G.D. Gyapay G. Beasley E.M. Soderlund C. Rodriguez-Tome P. Hui L. Matise T.C. McKusick K.B. Beckmann J.S. Bentolila S. Bihoreau M. Birren B.B. Browne J. Butler A. Castle A.B. Chiannilkulchai N. Clee C. Day P.J. Dehejia A. Dibling T. Drouot N. Duprat S. Fizames C. Bentley D.R. Science. 1998; 282: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Thus, the p12 gene locus can be assigned to chromosome 2p12. The open reading frame of p12 was expressed in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte system, and the product was analyzed on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As shown in lane 2 of each panel of the experiments in Fig. 5 below, the in vitro translated protein migrates to a position corresponding to 19 kDa on such a gel. Interestingly, despite the difference in their calculated molecular masses, p12 and p17 comigrate on SDS-polyacylamide gel. p12 has a histone fold motif that is 34% identical and 52% similar to that of DPB3. Different from the motif found in p17, the histone fold motifs of p12 and DPB3 are more homologous to that of subunit C of CBF (Fig. 3). p17 and p12 are homologous to subunits A and C of CBF, respectively. Because the histone fold motifs of CBF-A and CBF-C can interact with each other to form the CBF-A-CBF-C heterodimer (32Kim I.S. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4003-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we tested whether there is physical interaction between p17 and p12. Human embryonic kidney 293E cells were transfected with expressions vectors for FLAG-p17 and/or p12-V5. Cell lysates were prepared from the transfected cells and were then immoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody or anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that p12-V5 can be immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody only in the presence of FLAG-p17 (Fig.4), whereas FLAG-p17 can be immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody only in the presence of p12-V5 (Fig. 4). Taken together, p17 and p12 do indeed interact. To investigate whether p17 and/or p12 directly interact with HeLa pol ε, the full-length cDNAs of pol ε p261 and p59 were transcribed and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the expressed proteins were incubated with in vitrotranslated p17 and/or p12. The mixtures were then immunoprecipitated with an antibody against p59 (3B4.12.9). Fig.5 A clearly shows that p17 combined with p12 (lane 6), but not p17 alone (lane 4) or p12 (lane 5) alone, can be coimmunoprecipitated with HeLa pol ε p261 and p59. (Of course, because p17 and p12 comigrate, this experiment does not distinguish whether one or both of p17 and p12 were bound to p261/p59.) The catalytic subunit of S. cerevisiae pol ε has been shown to be essential for binding of all three subunits (4Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and pol ε in the pol 2-1 mutants lacked the associated subunits (4Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). For HeLa pol ε, the 261-kDa catalytic subunit is also important for binding of p17 and p12. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 B, p17 together with p12 (lane 5), but not p17 alone (lane 3) or p12 (lane 4) alone, can be coimmunoprecipitated with HeLa pol ε p261. p261 therefore appears to be sufficient for binding of p17/p12. However, it is not the only pol ε subunit to interact with p17/p12. As shown in Fig. 5 C, HeLa pol ε p59 alone was also able to be coimmunoprecipitated with p17/p12 (lane 6). Taken together, when both p17 and p12 are both present, p17 and/or p12 can interact with both p261 and p59 of HeLa pol ε. Because p17 and p12 comigrate during SDS-PAGE, the above experiments do not show whether p12 and p17 are both present in the immunoprecipitates, only that both must be present so that at least one of them can interact. To be sure that a heterocomplex of all four subunits can be formed, human embryonic kidney 293E cells were cotransfected with combinations of the expression plasmids for p261, p59-V5, FLAG-p17, and p12-V5. Cell lysates were then probed by immunoblots directly (Fig. 6 A) or after immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.6 B). Expression was as predicted in each case (Fig.6 A). In the lysates prepared from the four cDNA cotransfected cells, not only FLAG-p17, but also p261, p59-V5, and p12-V5 were each also precipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody. In contrast, p261 with p59-V5 alone cannot be precipitated by anti-FLAG antibody. This result clearly demonstrates that p261, p59, p17, and p12 can form a protein complex in vivo. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that p17 and p12 are subunits of HeLa pol ε. First, p17 and p12 interact with p261 and p59 subunits of HeLa pol ε in vitro but only when both p17 and p12 are present. Secondly, p17 and p12 interact with each other. Thirdly, p17, p12, p261, and p59 are able to form a protein complex after their cDNAs were cotransfected into 293E cells. Fourthly, the endogenous p17 can be coimmunoprecipitated with pol ε p261 and p59 subunits from HeLa cell-free extracts. For these reasons it seems reasonable to assume that p12 also exists in the endogenous pol ε complex. p17 and p12 contain histone fold motifs that also exist in S. cerevisiae pol ε DPB4 and DPB3, respectively. By sequence homology, p12 appears to be the mammalian counterpart of S. cerevisiae DPB3. p17, however, is more homologous to S. cerevisiae DPB4. The histone fold motifs of p17 (DPB4) and p12 (DPB3) are related to those of subunits A and C of human CBF, respectively. An essential function of the histone fold motifs of the CBF subunits is to create a protein-protein interaction surface for binding to the histone acetyl transferase enzymes such as GCN5 and p/CAF (33Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1430-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These associated histone acetyltransferases can activate CBF transactivation potential in vivo, possibly by acetylation of the N-terminal lysine residues of the histones, which results in disruption of local chromatin structure, thereby facilitating CBF access to its CCAAT promoter sites. p17 and p12 may be performing a similar role by creating a protein-protein interaction surface allowing pol ε to interact with other proteins, possibly also proteins that modify chromatin structure so as to allow pol ε to carry out its replication and/or repair functions. Compared with the rich knowledge of the influence of histone acetylation on transcription, little is known of the exact role of chromatin structure in replication. It is a speculative proposal that local disruption of chromatin structure by histone acetylation might facilitate access of replication factors to nucleosomal DNA. An investigation of the possible interaction between pol ε subunits and proteins including histone acetyl transferases will further our understanding of the function of pol ε in chromosomal replication and provide insight into the DNA replication process.

Seven members of this superfamily have been identified thus far in vertebrates: two Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter isoforms (NKCC1 and NKCC2), one Na+-Cl− cotransporter (NCC), and four K+-Cl− cotransporter isoforms (KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, and KCC4). As their names suggest, these proteins function as electroneutral salt transporters.

This hydrophobic domain is thought to consist of 10–12 membrane-spanning segments (see “Results”). NKCC1, the “secretory” isoform of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters, is the most extensively studied member of the CCCs at the molecular level. This transporter is relatively widely expressed in both epithelial and non-epithelial tissues (8Xu J.-C. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In NKCC1, phosphorylation sites associated with transport regulation have been identified in the N and C termini, indicating that these regions are intracellular (2Haas M. Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 11Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush III, B. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1373: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, sites ofN-linked glycosidation have been identified between putative membrane-spanning segments 7 and 8, demonstrating that this loop is extracellular (15Forbush III, B. Payne J.A. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Isenring P. Abstracts of the International Society of Nephrology. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1995Google Scholar).

A. 1998; 95: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have made innovative use of chimeras and point mutations to demonstrate that it is mainly the central hydrophobic domain that determines the apparent affinities of NKCC1 for Na+, K+, and Cl− as well as for the NKCC-specific inhibitor bumetanide. The cytosolic N and C termini appear to have little effect on these properties of NKCC1 (16Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and may instead be mainly involved in the regulation of transport activity. To begin to integrate this information into a working model of NKCC1, it is important to have some knowledge of the structure of the transmembrane domain. To date, only theoretical predictions for the transmembrane topology of any of the CCCs are available. A number of these theoretical methods (based, for example, on improvements of classical hydropathy analysis, neural networks, or hidden Markov models) have been designed to predict the topology of integral membrane proteins. As discussed later in this report, when we applied several of these more recent algorithms to NKCC1, we found broadly similar predictions, but there were nevertheless significant differences among the results from the various methods. To attempt to resolve these discrepancies and to establish an experimental model for the topology of NKCC1, in this study, we used in vitro translation in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes to investigate the membrane insertion properties of putative NKCC1 membrane-spanning segments (MSSs). As discussed below, these properties are thought to underlie the mechanism of assembly of polytopic integral membrane proteins (19Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Matlack K.E.S. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The data presently available indicate that the mechanism of assembly of polytopic integral membrane proteins involves the presence of a series of topogenic signal sequences, termed “signal anchor” and “stop transfer” sequences, in the nascent polypeptide chain (19Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Matlack K.E.S. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For example, after the translation of the cytosolic N terminus of a membrane protein such as NKCC1, the nascent chain is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by binding to a signal recognition particle, which in turn binds to its receptor on the ER. Here the nascent chain and its ribosome are released from the signal recognition particle and associate with a large hydrophilic proteinaceous ER channel, the translocon, which is responsible for the subsequent integration of the membrane protein into the lipid bilayer. The first MSS to appear in the nascent chain then acts as a signal anchor by inserting into the translocon complex in such a way that its N-terminal end remains on the cytoplasmic side of the ER and its C-terminal end faces the ER lumen. The sequence following the signal anchor is then extruded through the translocon into the interior of the ER as it is translated. This translocation process is subsequently stopped by the appearance of a second MSS, which acts as a stop transfer by associating with, and being retained by, the translocon complex in the opposite orientation from that of the preceding signal anchor. The sequence following this stop transfer will then remain in the cytoplasm. In this way, a series of signal anchor and stop transfer sequences are thought to determine the orientation of the MSSs of a polytopic integral membrane protein and its associated extracellular and intracellular loops. Whether some or all of the MSSs are retained in the translocon to facilitate their assembly with others is still under investigation; however, at some point, all of the MSSs are obviously transferred into the lipid bilayer to yield the final properly folded integral membrane protein. The above mechanism for the assembly of integral membrane proteins suggests a simple test for transmembrane topology predictions: by assaying the signal anchor or stop transfer activity of putative MSSs, one can determine whether these sequences have the topogenic properties required to validate proposed topology schemes. In this study, we tested the topology predictions for rat NKCC1 using this approach. Our results, taken together with earlier information concerning the topology of NKCC1, strongly support a model consisting of 12 MSSs. A number of recent theoretical algorithms were employed to characterize the topology and membrane-spanning regions of rat NKCC1. These included the dense alignment surface method of Cserzo et al. (21Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A.

Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar). The two expression vectors (HKM0 and HKM1) used in this study were the generous gift of Dr. George Sachs. These vectors were constructed from the plasmid pGEM7zf+ (Promega, Madison, WI) and have been extensively characterized (29Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol.

HKM0 and HKM1 code for related fusion proteins whose sequences have been inserted downstream of the T7 promoter in pGEM7zf+. The HKM0 fusion protein consists of a 101-amino acid sequence corresponding to the N-terminal cytosolic tail of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit, followed by a linker containing a BglII and a HindIII restriction site to allow insertion of variable sequences and then the last 177 amino acids of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase β-subunit. The HKM1 vector is identical to the HKM0 vector except that it contains the first 139 amino acids of the rabbit gastric H,K-ATPase α-subunit, which correspond to its N-terminal cytosolic tail as well as its first MSS (a signal anchor sequence) and the following extracytoplasmic loop (∼12 amino acids). The β-subunit sequence in each vector represents its extracytosolic tail and does not include its transmembrane segment. Sequences coding for putative transmembrane regions of rat NKCC1 were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and ligated between theBglII and HindIII sites of the HKM0 and HKM1 vectors using standard methods. The necessary BglII andHindIII sites were contained in the sense and antisense polymerase chain reaction primers, respectively (see “Results” and “Discussion” for specific inserted sequences). The correctness of all polymerase chain reaction fragments and their proper ligation into the HKM0 and HKM1 vectors were confirmed by sequencing of the final constructs. Plasmids were propagated in TOP10F′ cells (Invitrogen) and purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia CA). Fusion proteins were synthesized from purified plasmids using the TNT T7 coupled rabbit reticulate lysate system (Promega) in the presence of Redivue l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and in the presence and absence of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega). This method allows transcription and translation to be performed in a single step. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 90 min in 25-μl volumes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Products of reactions that were carried out in the absence of microsomes were run directly on SDS-PAGE (1.6 μl/lane). Aliquots (10 μl) of translation reactions that contained microsomes were diluted in 1 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 250 mm sucrose and centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was run on SDS-PAGE. Where indicated, this pellet was also subjected to an alkaline extraction step by being resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1m Na2CO3 and recentrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g before SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 4–20% Tris/glycine Ready gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were fixed in methanol/acetic acid/H2O (50:10:40), treated with AmplifyTM reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat AR film. The positions of the Bio-Rad Kaleidoscope SDS-PAGE standards are indicated on the autoradiographs presented. The MSSs of NKCC1 predicted by a number of recent theoretical methods are summarized in the upper portion of Fig. 1. In each case, the positions of predicted MSSs in the amino acid sequence are indicated by horizontal lines.

In the lower part of Fig. 1, we show a hydrophobicity plot obtained by the classical method of Kyte and Doolittle (28Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar) using a running 19-amino acid window. The actual amino acid sequence of the central hydrophobic domain of rat NKCC1 is shown in Fig. 2, where the regions m1, m2, etc., indicated in Fig. 1 are underlined andlabeled. A careful look at the predictions illustrated in Fig. 1 reveals that, although there is some variation in the exact positions of the predicted termini of individual MSSs, there is reasonably good agreement among the various methods concerning the locations of the eight putative MSSs labeled m1 through m8. The one exception to this is the MEMSAT2 method, which failed to predict a MSS corresponding to m1. Agreement among the methods is, however, poorer over the regions labeled m9-m10 and m11-m12. Here, the MEMSAT2 and PHDhtm methods predicted two relatively short MSSs; the dense alignment surface and older PHDhtm (M-H & T) methods predicted two long MSSs; the SOSUI and HMMTOP methods predicted three MSSs; and the TMHMM method predicted four MSSs, in agreement with the proposal of Payne et al. (10Payne J.A. Xu J.-C. Haas M. Lytle C.Y. Ward D. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17977-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although these recent methods for MSS prediction are more sophisticated and computationally complex than classical hydropathy analysis, the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity plot in Fig. 1 provides a simple explanation for these latter discrepancies, namely, that the regions m9-m10 and m11-m12 correspond to hydrophobic segments that are rather long (>30 residues) for a single helical MSS, but rather short for a MSS pair, making it difficult to decide between these two possibilities. These two broad hydrophobic regions are, in fact, a characteristic of all known CCCs (1Kaplan M.R. Mount D.B. Delpire E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 649-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Haas M. Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We have not attempted to look into the details of the theoretical methods to determine the origins of the above differences. Rather, in what follows, we have subjected these theoretical predictions to experimental testing. As already indicated, the HKM0 and HKM1 vectors code for fusion proteins consisting of either the first 101 (HKM0 vector) or the first 139 (HKM1 vector) amino acids of the H,K-ATPase α-subunit, followed by a short linker region that allows insertion of variable sequences and then the last 177 amino acids of the H,K-ATPase β-subunit. The α-subunit sequence contained in the HKM0 vector represents its N-terminal hydrophilic cytosolic tail, whereas the α-subunit sequence in the HKM1 vector codes for this same region, followed by its first MSS. The β-subunit sequence in both of these vectors contains five consensus sites for N-linked glycosidation, but does not include the MSS of the β-subunit. The principle upon which this experimental system is based is that the β-subunit acts as a flag to signal the location of the C terminus of the fusion protein when it is expressed in the presence of microsomes; because of its multiple glycosylation consensus sites, one would expect the β-subunit to be heavily glycosidated when it is translocated into the interior of the microsomes. The N-terminal tail of the H,K-ATPase found in both of these vectors contains a cytosolic anchor sequence consisting of eight positively charged amino acids, which retains the N termini of the HKM0 and HKM1 fusion proteins on the cytoplasmic side of the microsomal membrane (31Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19697-19707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The system is demonstrated in Fig. 3 (upper panels), where we show the effects of translating the empty HKM0 and HKM1 vectors in the presence (+) and absence (−) of microsomes. As expected, the presence of microsomes had no effect on the apparent molecular mass of the HKM0 translation product, which has no hydrophobic regions and does integrate into the membranes (29Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); but the presence of microsomes resulted in an upward shift of ∼14 kDa in the apparent molecular mass of the HKM1 translation product. In control experiments (29Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated that N-glyconase digestion reduces the apparent size of this HKM1 translation product found in the presence of microsomes to that found in their absence, confirming that this shift in molecular mass is due to glycosylation. In addition, it has been shown (29Bamberg K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16909-16919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that this translation product is completely digested by proteinase K in the presence of detergent, but is resistant to digestion in its absence, confirming that the HKM1 fusion protein is integrated into the membrane (a partial digestion is seen in the absence of detergent due to removal of the exposed N terminus of the α-subunit).Figure 1Predictions of membrane-spanning segments in NKCC1.

The middle andlower panels show autoradiograms resulting from the translation products of HKM0 and HKM1, respectively, containing the inserts m1 (Val-284 to Val-303), m2 (Gly-307 to Gly-326), m1 + m2 (Val-284 to Gly-326), and m1 + 75-amino acid N-terminal extension (m1+NText; Met-209 to Val-303).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above experiments establish that the first MSS of the H,K-ATPase α-subunit acts as a signal anchor sequence (see Introduction). In the same way, the signal anchor activity of any putative MSS can be tested by inserting it between the BglII and HindIII sites of the HKM0 vector and comparing the apparent molecular masses of its translation products in the presence and absence of microsomes. The appearance of a higher molecular mass band in the presence of microsomes is an indication of β-subunit glycosidation and thus signal anchor activity. Likewise, the stop transfer activity of a putative MSS can be tested by inserting it between the BglII and HindIII sites of the HKM1 vector (downstream of the first MSS of the H,K-ATPase) or, alternatively, placing it downstream of another MSS with signal anchor activity in the HKM0 vector. In these cases, the loss of the glycosidated band seen in the presence of microsomes would indicate that the MSS being tested had acted as a stop transfer sequence, being retained in the membrane in the opposite orientation from that of the signal anchor and thereby preventing the translocation of the β-subunit glycosidation flag into the interior of the microsome. As mentioned in the Introduction, there is strong experimental evidence for the cytosolic localization of the N terminus of NKCC1. Forbush and collaborators"

We reported previously that overexpression of p202, an interferon-inducible negative regulator of cell growth, negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of p53. Now we identify the gene encoding p202 as one whose mRNA and protein expression decrease in cells following the expression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53. Furthermore, the levels of p202 also decrease after exposure of cells to ultra violet light, which correlate with increase in the levels of p53. We report that the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 to the 5′-regulatory region of the 202 gene contributes to the transcriptional repression of the 202 gene. Interestingly, overexpression of p202 in cells induced to undergo p53-dependent apoptosis significantly delays this process, indicating that the negative regulation of the 202 gene by wild-type p53 is important to potentiate apoptosis.

Interestingly, the reduced basal levels of p202 (in consequence of the expression of antisense RNA to 202) in fibroblasts, under reduced serum condition, increase the susceptibility to apoptosis (5Koul D.

Eisenman R.N. Lengyel P J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27377-27385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these observations support the notion that p202 participates in the regulation of apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism(s) remains to be identified. The p53 family genes include genes encoding p73, p63, and p53 (7Lohrum M.A.E. Vousden K.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 197-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor gene from the family continues to hold distinction as the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer (7Lohrum M.A.E. Vousden K.H.

This has stimulated efforts to understand the function of this gene in normal and neoplastic state. A large number of functions have been attributed to p53, including cell-cycle checkpoints and apoptosis (11Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In human and rodent cells containing wild-type p53 genes, the p53 protein is induced by a variety of stimuli, including chemotherapeutic agents, oxidative stress, hypoxia, nucleotide depletion, and oncogenic expression. Accumulated data suggest that the high frequency of p53 mutations in human cancer reflect the ability of this protein to induce programmed cell death or apoptosis (7Lohrum M.A.E. Vousden K.H.

The underlying mechanism of tumor suppressor activity of p53 resides in part in its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner (8Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 10Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a substantial number of genes containing p53 binding site(s) are activated by p53 (8Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 11Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). These include mdm2, p21, and gadd45. p21and gadd45 have been implicated in p53-mediated cell cycle regulation. In addition to playing a role as a DNA binding-dependent activator, p53 has also been reported to negatively regulate the transcription of a number of genes (11Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), including those for presenilin (12Roperch J.P. Alvaro V. Prieur S. Tuynder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L.

Virol. 1992; 66: 4757-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the transcriptional activation by p53, no consensus sequence has been found in the promoters that are repressed by p53. It was initially reported that only the promoters containing a TATA box are repressed by p53 (18Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, in at least two cases, it has been reported that the specific DNA binding of p53 in the regulatory region of these genes results in transcriptional repression (19Ori A. Zauberman A. Doitsh G. Paran N. Oren M. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated a role for transcriptional repression in p53-dependent apoptosis (9Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 11Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). For example, proteins such as BCL2 have been shown to inhibit p53-mediated transcriptional repression, whereas transactivation and G1 arrest functions remain unaffected (21Basu A. Haldar S. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, deletion of the proline-rich region (amino acids 60–90) in human p53, which contains five repeats of the P XXP motif (22Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), renders it defective at apoptosis induction and transrepression, but not transactivation (23Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 24Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L.

The observation that p202 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of p53 (26Datta B. Li B. Choubey D. Nallur G. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27544-27555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), coupled with the fact that a number of proteins that regulate p53 functions are in turn regulated by p53, led us to test if p53 regulates the expression of p202. Here we report that the expression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53 results in a decrease in the 202 RNA and protein. We show that p53 binds to a p53 DNA-binding consensus sequence present in the 5′-regulatory region of the 202 gene in gel mobility shift assays. Moreover, p53 represses the activity of a reporter gene, whose transcription is driven by the 5′-regulatory region of the 202 gene. Additionally, we demonstrate that overexpression of p202 significantly delays p53-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the decrease in p202 levels by wild-type p53 may be important for p53-induced apoptosis.

To express the temperature-sensitive mutant of p53, murine AKR-2B fibroblasts were cotransfected with plasmid pCMV53Val135 and pCMV (in 10:1 ratio) and the transfected cells were selected in G418 (500 μg/ml). After 2 weeks, the drug-resistant colonies (>70) were pooled and maintained at 37 °C (favoring the mutant conformation of p53). If so indicated, cells were shifted to 32 °C (favoring the wild-type conformation of p53) for indicated times.

To initiate apoptosis in the pooled transfected cells, cells were cultured without Zeocin and were shifted to the permissive temperature (32.5 °C) for the indicated times. Flow cytometry was performed on single cell suspensions on adherent (after trypsin and EDTA treatment) as well as the floating cells after pooling them. Briefly, for cell cycle analysis, cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml, Sigma) and subjected to flow cytometry using a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer as described previously (35Chaturvedi V.

Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Antibodies to p21 (sc-6246) and p53 (sc-6243) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For gel-shift assays, anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies (clone 421) and anti-E2F-1 antibodies (clone KH95) were purchased from Oncogene Science (Boston, MA). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from cells and subjected to Northern blotting, followed by hybridization with the 202-specific cDNA probe (HincII fragment). Assays were performed on single cell suspensions on adherent (after trypsin/EDTA treatment) as well as the floating cells after pooling them. Cells (about 2–5 × 105) were lysed in 20 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.8% sodium dodecyl sulfate). To lysates 10 μl of RNase A/T1 mixture mix (500 and 20,000 units/ml, respectively) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Proteinase K solution (10 μl of 20 mg/ml) was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 50 °C. Samples were mixed with 6× DNA loading buffer (30% glycerol and 0.25% bromophenol blue) before their analysis on 1.5% agarose gel. The agarose gel was run at 2 V/cm until the dye reached to the end of gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. Nuclear extracts were prepared from murine AKR-2B cells treated with UV-C (5 mJ/m2) for 24 h or untreated cells as described previously (36Pitkanen K. Haapajarvi T. Laiho M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of nuclear proteins or the recombinant purified p53 protein (250–500 ng; purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for binding to labeled oligonucleotides (labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed into double-stranded oligonucleotides) containing either the p53 DNA binding consensus sequence (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the 202 gene p53 DNA binding sequence p53CS1 (5′-CTACATGACTTCTACCCATGCTT-3′ and the complementary sequence) or p53CS2 (CTAGTTTTAACACCTTGATCTGG-3′ and the complementary sequence (see Table I for sequence). For supershift assays, nuclear extract proteins or the recombinant p53 were incubated with anti-p53 (clone 421) antibodies (1 μg) for 20 min at room temperature. Binding reactions were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described previously (36Pitkanen K. Haapajarvi T. Laiho M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Table IComparison of the two potential p53 DNA binding site sequences present in the regulatory region of the 202 gene with other known p53 DNA binding sitesa A bold letter indicates deviation from the p53 DNA binding consensus sequence.

Open table in a new tab a A bold letter indicates deviation from the p53 DNA binding consensus sequence. Arrows indicate orientation of pentamers. The center bases of consensus sequence are underlined. For reporter assays, subconfluent cells in six-well plates were transfected with the reporter plasmids 202-luc (5 μg) and pRL-TK (0.5 μg) along with indicated amounts of protein expression plasmid using the calcium phosphate transfection system (Life Technologies, Inc.), as suggested by the supplier. Cells were harvested 42–48 h after transfections and the firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit (from Promega) and TD-20/20 luminometer (from Turner Designs). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla luciferase in order to control for variation in transfection efficiencies. The luciferase activity in control vector-transfected cells is shown as 1. To test if the expression of wild-type p53 regulates the expression of p202, we generated a stable cell line of murine AKR-2B fibroblasts (we chose this cell line because the basal levels of p202 RNA and protein can be detected in this cell line) (29Choubey D. Lengyel P. J. Interferon Res. 1993; 13: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) constitutively expressing the temperature-sensitive mutant of murine p53 (p53Val135) (33Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). While incubation of these cells at 37 °C (the nonpermissive temperature) favors mutant conformation of p53, upon shift of cells to 32 °C (the permissive temperature) favors a wild-type conformation of p53 (33Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Using this cell system, we found that the expression of wild-type p53 significantly decreased the steady-state levels of the 202 RNA (Fig. 1 A) and the decrease was apparent 24 h after shift of cells to the permissive temperature (compare lane 1 with lane 2). Additionally, the decrease in the 202 RNA was accompanied by a decrease in the basal levels of p202 (Fig. 1 B, compare lane 1 with lane 2) and also the interferon-induced levels of p202 (Fig. 1 B, compare lane 3 with lane 4). Furthermore, the decrease in p202 levels was accompanied by an increase in p21 WAF1/CIP1 levels, a known transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor (8Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar,10Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Because AKR-2B cells express wild-type p53, which could affect the regulation by a transgene (p53Val135) by dimerization (9Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), we utilized the Val5 cell line (in these cells both alleles of p53 are deleted) (27Harvey D.M. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2375-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), which also expresses the temperature-sensitive mutant of p53. As shown in Fig. 1 C, these cells had higher levels of p202 at the nonpermissive temperature, which were comparable with the p202 levels in IFN-treated cells (compare lane 2 with lane 1), and shift of these cells to the permissive temperature resulted in a decrease in p202 levels (compare lane 3 with lane 1). Moreover, the decrease in p202 levels was accompanied by an increase in p21 WAF1/CIP1 levels. Interestingly, as noted above (Fig. 1 B), the IFN treatment of these cells at the permissive temperature resulted in only a moderate increase in p202 levels. Together, these observations provide support to the idea that the expression of wild-type p53 negatively regulates the steady-state levels of the 202 RNA and protein in these cell lines. The 5′-regulatory region of the 202 gene, which is immediately upstream to the transcription initiation sites, has been characterized (30Samanta H. Engel D.E. Chao H.M. Thakur A.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17182-17189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to identify a potential mechanism(s) by which wild-type p53 regulates the expression of the 202 gene, we searched the 5′-regulatory region of the 202 gene for the presence of other cis-regulatory elements that are shown to be involved in p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of genes. Our search revealed that the regulatory region of the 202 gene contains several cis-acting elements (Fig.2 A), including two potential p53 DNA binding sites (indicated as p53CS1 and p53CS2), shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes by p53 (8Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar, 11Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as shown in Table I, the two potential p53 DNA binding sites p53CS1 and p53CS2 in the 5′-regulatory region of the 202 gene, like other known p53 DNA binding sites in other p53-responsive genes (37Martinez J.D. Craven M.T. Pennington M.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 38El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), contain C(A/T)(T/A)G at the core of the ten base palindrome, which is important for the DNA binding activity of p53 (37Martinez J.D. Craven M.T. Pennington M.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 38El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). However, as noted in Table I, these two potential p53 DNA binding sites in the 202 gene contain variations (in the case of p53CS1, 5 variations out of 20 nucleotides, and, in the case of p53CS2, 4 out of 20 nucleotides) from the p53 DNA binding consensus sequence (38El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Next, we tested if p53 could bind to the p53CS1 or p53CS2 sequence in gel-mobility shift assays. For this purpose, we used nuclear extracts from AKR-2B cells (these cells contain wild-type p53) untreated or after exposure to low levels (5 mJ/m2) of UV-C treatment. As shown in Fig. 2 B (left panel), p53 in these nuclear extracts specifically bound to a p53 consensus sequence in gel mobility shift assays and the complex was competed well with 20-fold excess of cold consensus sequence oligonucleotide (compare lane 3 with lane 4). Furthermore, the complex was supershifted after incubation with antibodies to p53 (antibody pAb 421) that are known to improve the binding of p53 to its cognate site (39Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). However, no such supershift was seen after incubation with an isogenic control antibody to E2F-1 (compare lane 5 with lane 6). Interestingly, incubation of nuclear extracts with a labeled oligonucleotide containing the p53CS1 sequence resulted in binding of p53 (see Fig. 2 B, right panel) and the binding was also competed out well by 20-fold excess of cold oligonucleotide containing the p53 DNA binding consensus sequence (compare lane 8 with lane 7). Additionally, the p53 complex was supershifted after incubation with antibodies to p53 (antibody pAb 421). However, no such supershift was seen after incubation with an isogenic control antibody to E2F-1 (compare lane 9 with lane 10). Thus, these experiments indicated that, in these assays, p53 specifically bound to the 202 p53CS1 sequence and the p53 consensus sequence with a comparable affinity. Because the p53CS2 sequence in the 5′-regulatory region of the 202 gene differs from the p53CS1 and the p53 consensus sequence (see Table I), we tested its ability to bind p53 in gel-shift assays. As shown in Fig. 2 C, oligonucleotide containing a p53 DNA binding consensus sequence bound to p53 (lane 2) and incubation with anti-p53 antibodies resulted in supershift of p53-oligonucleotide complex (lane 3). As expected from our above experiment (Fig.2 B), the 202 p53CS1 sequence also bound to p53 to a comparable extent (compare lane 5 with lane 2) and incubation with anti-p53 antibodies resulted in a supershift of p53-oligonucleotide complex (compare lane 6 with lane 3). However, the p53CS2 sequence bound to p53 weakly (compare lane 8 with lanes 2 and 5) and incubation with anti-p53 antibodies did not result in a significant supershift of"

Several transcriptionally active regulatory elements have been identified in the proximal promoter, including a GATA-2 and an Sp-1 binding site. Because they cannot account for the constitutive expression of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase gene in a restricted number of cells, we have searched for other cell-specific regulatory elements. By DNase I hypersensitivity mapping and deletion studies we have identified a 269-base pair activator element located 4.9 kilobases upstream from the transcription start site that acts as an enhancer. DNase I footprinting and linker-scanning experiments showed that several regions within the 269-base pair enhancer are important for transcription factor binding and for full enhancer activity.

EMSA experiments suggested the implication of MZF-like, AP-2, Sp-1-related, and Ets-related factors. Among Ets factors, Erg was the only one able to bind to cognate sites in the enhancer, as found by EMSA and supershift experiments, and to activate the transcriptional activity of the enhancer in cotransfection experiments.

In the vascular system, the NOS III isoform (eNOS), first identified in endothelial cells, regulates vascular tone (1Palmer R.M.J. Rees D.D. Ashton D.S. Moncada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Several studies were aimed at characterizing the 5′-upstream sequences that drive transcriptional activity of the promoter up to 3500 bp. A major transcriptional effect was identified for Sp-1/Sp-3 and GATA-2 transcription factors, for which binding sites are located respectively at −103 and −230 bp upstream from the major transcription start site (9Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15320-15326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 10Wariishi S. Miyahara K. Toda K. Ogoshi S. Doi Y. Ohnishi S. Mitsoui Y.

It was also shown that a 1600-bp human eNOS (heNOS) promoter fragment allows the endothelial expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice but is not sufficient to observe a full expression of the gene in all endothelial territories and to reproduce the endogenous pattern of expression (13Guillot P.V.

In this study, we characterized cis-acting sequences, located 4.9 kb upstream from the major transcription start site, that increase constitutive expression of the heNOS gene in endothelial cells. Analysis of the enhancer sequence by DNase I footprinting and linker-scanning mutants led us to identify five major binding sites, in particular for Erg and other Ets family member proteins, for Sp-1-related factors, and for MZF-like transcription factors. Sonicated salmon sperm DNA, proteinase K, RNase A, poly(dI·dC) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. MCDB-131 medium, hydrocortisone and Nonidet P40 (Igepal) from Sigma. Fetal calf serum, penicillin and streptomycin were from Seromed (Berlin, Germany). Epidermal growth factor, human recombinant and polyethyleneimine suspension (EXGEN 500), were from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France). RPMI medium, phosphate-buffered saline, and l-glutamine were from Life Technologies, Inc. DNase I was from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). HMEC-1 are human dermal microvascular endothelial cells immortalized by transfection with a pBR322-derived plasmid containing the coding region for the simian virus 40 A gene product, large T antigen, and were a gift from Thomas J. Lawley (Emory University, School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated as described by Jaffe et al.(14Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). Both cell types were cultured in MCDB-131 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone. HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented by 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an humidified incubator. In situ DNase I digestion method was performed as described previously by Stewartet al. (15Stewart A.F. Reik A. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), using 0.2% and 0.05%, respectively, of Nonidet P-40 for permeabilization of HMEC-1 or HeLa cells. After phenol extraction, DNA samples (30 μg) were subsequently submitted to Southern blot analysis. DNase I hypersensitivity assay was also performed on isolated nuclei with standard procedures (16Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). A PCR product extending from 5′-upstream from the DNase I hypersensitive site HS1 to downstream from the initiator methionine codon, was obtained by PCR using a commercially available long PCR kit (Taq+ Precision PCR system, Stratagene La Jolla, CA) and a human eNOS cosmid clone as template (17Nadaud S. Bonnardeaux A. Lathrop M. Soubrier F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The PCR product was subcloned between theNheI and HindIII sites of the firefly luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3-basic (Promega, WI). For generation of deletion mutants, the construct was partially digested by exonuclease III/S1 nuclease using a commercial kit (Erase-a-base system, Promega). All constructs were sequenced using Thermosequenase dye terminator cycle sequencing (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. Sense (pGL3-p2) and antisense (pGL3-p42) constructs containing the 269 bp activator element (−4907/−4638) in both orientations were generated by subcloning a 269-bp Pfupolymerase amplification product 5′ to the 1703-bp promoter fragment of the heNOS gene. For point mutation generation, a commercial kit (Quick Change mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) was used with pGL3-p2 as template. Constructs and mutants were checked by sequencing. Transfection assays were carried out using polyethyleneimine suspension in a commercially available solution (EXGEN 500). Briefly, HMEC-1 and HeLa cells were seeded on 2-cm2 multidish plates at 100 × 103/well and 50 × 103/well respectively, incubated 24 h, and then treated with a buffer (150 mmNaCl) containing 0.134 pmol of the relevant reporter gene vector, 0.134 pmol of pRenilla luciferase gene vector (Promega) as transfection standardizing control and polyethyleneimine suspension (4 μl for 2 μg of total DNA). Coexpression experiments were performed using expression vectors containing cDNA for various transcription factors, pCDNA1-Ets-2 (gift of Dr. J. Leiden), pCDNA1-Elf-1 (18John S. Reeves R.B. Lin J.X. Child R. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pSG5-Ets1 (19Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), pCMV5-Elk-1-FLAG (gift of Dr. R. Davis), pSG5-p55-Erg (20Schwachtgen J.L. Janel N. Barek L. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Ghysdael J.

Identical experimental procedures were used, except that relevant expression vectors were included in polyethyleneimine suspension at convenient ratio compared with reporter vector. Luciferase activity was measured by luminometry using Dual luciferase revelation system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. HMEC-1 nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). For whole cell extract preparation, HeLa cells were seeded on a 2-cm2 multidish plate and transfected with 2 μg of relevant expression vectors or empty control vectors. After 40 h, the cells were harvested in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, collected by low speed centrifugation (800 ×g, 4 °C), and then resuspended in 40 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 m KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol. Cells were broken by freezing and thawing (three times), cell debris were removed by centrifugation (800 × g, 10 min., 4 °C), and the supernatant (whole cell extract) was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. A fragment of the heNOS gene promoter region (−4907 to −4638) was obtained by PCR amplification using primers flanking the enhancer. For radioactive labeling, one primer (1.5 pmol) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) before a 20-cycle PCR amplification using 10 pmol of the second primer. DNase I footprinting analyses were performed by incubating 5,000 cpm of probe with 20–30 μg of nuclear extracts for 15 min, at room temperature, in 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol before submission to increasing amounts of DNase I for 2 min. Control reactions were performed in the absence of proteins. Reactions were stopped by addition of stop buffer (200 μg of proteinase K, 50 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml tRNA, and 1% SDS) and incubated 1 h at 50 °C. Samples were phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, and recovered in (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol), denatured, and loaded, together with a G+A Maxam-Gilbert sequence of the probe, on a 6% acrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel. Seven linker-scanning mutations were introduced in the pGL3-p2 construct. For each mutant, two amplicons, the 5′ and the 3′, were synthesized using a PCR-based method with Pfu polymerase. Primers used to create the linker-scanning mutants are listed in Table I. The 5′ amplicon was generated using two primers designated MluB10 and Brx. MluB10 is a gene-specific, sense primer that corresponds to the −4907/−4883 region of the heNOS promoter and has a Mlu I restriction site at its 5′ end. Brx primers, where x corresponds to the location of the specific bases to be mutated, are 24–29 base antisense primers containing a sequence identical to the promoter sequence linked to a mutated region at the 5′-end, heterologous to the heNOS sequence and containing a restriction site. The 3′ amplicon was generated similarly using a common antisense primer HSFP3′ (positions −4684/−4638) and different Scx primers containing a sequence identical to heNOS promoter and a 5′-end heterologous to the heNOS sequence and containing a restriction site identical to the corresponding Brx oligonucleotide. After restriction digestion and purification, each 5′ amplicon was ligated to its corresponding 3′ amplicon, and the ligation product was submitted to a further Pfu amplification reaction. The 269-bp mutated product was then subcloned in front of the 1703-bp promoter in pGL3–1703 construct. Clones obtained were checked by sequencing.Table IPrimer pairs used to construct all pGL3-p2 linker-scanning mutants and mutations introducedPrimer nameMutant namePrimer sequenceMutation introducedMlu-B105′-CGTGACGCGTCAGCACTCAGCATGAGTTACA-3′Br-Nhe-4802/4793pGL3-LS-A5′-CTAGGCTAGCGCGGGGAAAGGGAAGGGAG-3′ WT 5′-GCTCCCCACCCGTCT-3′Sc-Nhe-4802/4793pGL3-LS-A5′-GCGAGCTAGCACTCCTTGCCAGCAGGC-3′ LSA 5′-GCGCTAGCACTCCCT-3′Br-Bgl-4792/4785pGL3-LS-B1 5′-CGAGATCTACCGGGTGGGGAGCGG-3′ WT 5′-CGTCCTTGCCAGCA-3′Sc-Bgl-4792–4785pGL3-LS-B1 5′-GTAGATCTCGCAGGCAGGAAGGAA-3′LSB1 5′-CGGTAGATCTCGCA-3′Br-Bgl-4784/4776pGL3-LS-B2 5′-CGAGATCTATGGCAAGGACGGGTG-3′ WT 5′-CCAGCAGGCAGGAA-3′Sc-Bgl-4784/4776pGL3-LS-B2 5′-ATAGATCTCGAAGGAAGCTGCTCA-3′LSB2 5′-CCATAGATCTCGAA-3′Br-Eco-4765/4756pGL3-LS-C15′-GTGAATTCGTCAGCTTCCTTCCTGC-3′ WT 5′-CTGACGAATTCACAA-3′Sc-Eco-4765/4756pGL3-LS-C15′-ACGAATTCACAAGGGTGGGGTACT-3′LSC1 5′-CTGACGAATTCACAA-3′Br-Eco-4765/4756pGL3-LS-C25′-CTGAATTCGTCACTATGAGCAGCTT-3′ WT 5′-GTGCAAGGGTGGGGT-3′Sc-Eco-4755/4746pGL3-LS-C2 5′-ACGAATTCAGGTACTTCCAGCTCA-3′LSC2 5′-GTGACGAATTCAGGT-3′Br-Eco-4755/4746pGL3-LS-C35′-GTGAATTCGTCCACCCTTGCACTAT-3′ WT 5′-GGGGTACTTCCAGCT-3′Sc-Eco-4745/4745pGL3-LS-C35′-ACGAATTCACGCTCACACTGAACAG-3′LSC3 5′-GGACGAATTCACGCT-3′Br-Bam-4697/4687pGL3-LS-D5′-ACGGATCCACGACTCTTTATAGCCC-3′WT 5′-GTCAGGGACTTCCGCT-3′Sc-Bam-4697/4687pGL3-LS-D5′-GTGGATCCGTGCTCAGTCACCCCTG-3′LSD 5′-GTCGTGAATCCGTGCT-3′HSFP3′5′-GGCCTGGGGTGTGTGCATTGG-3′Wild type (WT) sequences are underlined, and mutations are italicized.

Oligonucleotides corresponding to DNase I protected regions were designed according to the sequence established previously (see Table II). Crude nuclear extracts (5–7 μg) or whole cell extracts of cells transfected with expression vector (4 μg) were incubated with approximately 0.15 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on prerun acrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1) native gels. Supershift experiments were performed by preincubating nuclear or cell extracts with relevant polyclonal antiserum or purified polyclonal antibody prior to addition of labeled probes.

Enhancer sequences were checked for transcription binding sites using Transfac data base and MatInspector 2.0 software (22Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). All transfection data are expressed as the means ± S.E., quantitative results were analyzed by the Student's t test. Analysis of cotransfections experiments in HMEC-1 and HeLa cells were performed using a two-way analysis of variance, with a test of interaction. DNase I hypersensitivity experiments were performed on permeabilized cells as well as on isolated nuclei. Results obtained with permeabilized cells are shown, but similar results were obtained with the two methods. Using a probe located at the 3′ edge of a large HindIII restriction fragment located in the 5′ region of the heNOS gene (Fig. 1 A), three hypersensitive sites were detected by Southern blot experiments in the heNOS gene in HMEC-1 (Fig. 1 B). From the size of these fragments, it can be deduced that these sites are located approximately at 5 kb (HS1), 1.9 kb (HS2), and 0.9 kb (HS3) upstream from the major transcription start site (Fig. 1 A). The distal hypersensitive site (HS1) does not correspond to any previously identified regulatory regions of the heNOS promoter. Using HeLa cells that do not express eNOS, as observed by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown), none of these hypersensitive sites could be detected in similar experiments (Fig. 1 C). A 6-kb promoter fragment was obtained, using a PCR-based method, and cloned 5′ to a luciferase reporter gene (pGL3-basic). After exonuclease III digestion of this plasmid (pGL3–6090), different deletion mutant constructs of the heNOS promoter were obtained and transfected into HMEC-1. As shown in Fig. 2 A, transfections of HMEC-1 performed with pGL3–6090 construct showed a 5-fold increase of the promoter activity, compared with that obtained with the 1703-bp promoter fragment (pGL3–1703). Progressive deletions from −6090 to −4907 did not show significant reduction of transcriptional activity. Deletions from −4907 to −4638 returned transcription to the level obtained with pGL3–1703, indicating the existence of an activator element located between positions −4907 and −4638 of the promoter. Deletion of the promoter from −4638 to −1703 did not significantly influence the promoter activity (data not shown). Deletions from −1703 to −782 showed a slight decrease in the promoter activity (30%; data not shown). To investigate the enhancer characteristics of the distal activator element (−4907/−4638), it was cloned in both orientations immediately 5′ to the 1703-bp promoter (pGL3-p2 and pGL3-p42) or 5′ to an heterologous SV40 promoter (pGL3-SV40-Enh). Transfection experiments performed in HMEC-1 with pGL3-p2 (sense construct) and pGL3-p42 (antisense construct) showed a transcriptional activity similar to pGL3–4907 (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, transfection experiments using pGL3-SV40-Enh showed an enhanced transcriptional activity as compared with the SV40 promoter (Fig. 2 B). A similar pattern of transcriptional activation was observed with the different constructs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating similar mechanisms of activation in the two endothelial cell models. In contrast, transfection experiments using HeLa cells showed no transcriptional activation of the native promoter by the heNOS distal enhancer, because no difference in transcriptional activity was observed between pGL3–4638 and pGL3–4907 (Fig. 2 D). However, the pGL3-p2 construct showed a 3-fold increase in transcriptional activity in HeLa cells compared with the 1703-bp promoter (Fig. 2 D). A large increase of transcriptional activity was also observed when using the pGL3-SV40-Enh construct compared with pGL3-SV40 in HeLa (Fig. 2 D). DNase I footprint experiments were performed to identify regulatory elements involved in the heNOS distal enhancer activity. An end-labeled PCR-product corresponding to the 269-bp activator element of the promoter was used as a probe in footprint experiments with HMEC-1 nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 3, nuclear proteins protected the sense probe in four regions, named A, B, C, and D (Fig. 3 A). The protected element A spans 8 bp and is limited in its 3′ part by a DNase I-hypersensitive site. Element B spans approximately 15 bp, and element C spans 30 bp. Element D spans 6 bp and exhibits an hypersensitive site immediately downstream. Using an antisense probe, we observed protection over elements A, B, and C, but element D was not protected (Fig. 3 A). To understand the role of each DNase I protected element, a systematic mutational analysis was conducted by mutating 8–10 bp of each element (Table I). These linker-scanning studies allowed functional binding sites to be identified among the four DNase I protected elements. Five linker-scanning mutants (pGL3-p2-LSA, pGL3-p2-LSB2, pGL3-p2-LSC2, pGL3-p2-LSC3, and pGL3-p2-LSD) showed a clear, significant decrease in transcriptional activity compared with the pGL3-p2 wild type construct in HMEC-1 (Fig. 4). The mutants pGL3-p2-LSA, pGL3-p2-LSC2, and pGL3-p2-LSD conserved 30–35% of the enhancer activity, whereas pGL3-p2-LSB2 and pGL3-p2-LSC3 no longer exhibited an enhancer effect. In contrast, the linker-scanning mutant pGL3-p2-LSB1 kept 60% of the enhancer activity, and the linker-scanning mutant pGL3-p2-LSC1 had no effect on enhancer activity. These data demonstrate the functional role of five regions of the enhancer in the regulation of basal heNOS expression.Figure 4Transcriptional activities of the linker-scanning mutants in HMEC-1. Linker-scanning mutations were introduced in pGL3-p2 construct by substituting 8–10 bp in the different regions protected by DNase I footprinting (Table I).Boxes represent DNase I protected elements A–D. Black crosses represent linker-scanning mutations. Sequence of mutations are described in Table I. Transcriptional activities of enhancer construct pGL3-p2 and of the different linker-scanning mutants were compared with that of pGL3–1703 promoter. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of five independent experiments (duplicate determination). *, p < 0.05, relative to pGL3-p2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A 34-bp oligonucleotide (FPA-WT) was designed to be centered on footprint element A, overlapping 15 bp of footprint B (Fig. 5 A). Several DNA-protein complexes were observed when using a labeled FPA-WT probe in EMSA experiments (Fig. 5 C, lanes 2 and 12). Addition of 10–100-fold molar excess of cold competitor FPA-WT oligonucleotide, suppressed all the complexes (lanes 3,4, 13, and 14). Computer analysis of the FPA-WT sequence revealed putative binding sites for several transcription factors located in element A, in particular for MZF-1 zinc finger transcription factors and for Krüppel-like transcription factors family members (Fig. 5 A). FPA-derived oligonucleotides were designed (Fig. 5 B and TableII). Oligonucleotides mutated for the entire A site (FPA-M) or for the MZF-1 consensus sequence 5′-TCCCCA-3′ (FPA-m2) failed to compete for complexes formation (Fig. 5 C, lanes 5, 6,9, and 10, respectively), suggesting a major effect of this core element in the protein binding. An FPA-m1 oligonucleotide, mutated in the EKLF consensus sequence 5′-CACCC-3′, competed formation of all complexes (Fig. 5 C, lanes 7 and 8). An oligonucleotide, bearing a consensus MZF-1 binding site (MZF consensus), with unrelated flanking sequences, prevented the formation of complex I (Fig. 5 C, lanes 15 and16). The same oligonucleotide with a 3-bp mutation in the MZF binding site (MZF consensus mutant) failed to compete (lanes 17 and 18). These results suggest that MZF-like factors bind element A, whereas EKLF factors do not. Despite the fact that HMEC-1 cells seem to express MZF-1 (as seen with reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis; data not shown) and MZF-1b (Western blot analysis; data not shown), we were unable to observe any supershift using either the MZF-1/1b antibody or an antibody specifically targeted against the N-terminal domain of MZF-1b (data not shown). Similarly, coexpression of MZF-1 expression vector with pGL3-p2 plasmid had no effect on the enhancer transcriptional activation (data not shown). Footprint element C was functionally restricted to base position −4755/−4735 by linker-scanning analysis (linker-scanning mutants LSC2 and LSC3). A labeled FPC1–3-WT probe, containing the total footprint element C sequence (−4765/−4735), formed multiple complexes in the presence of crude nuclear extracts (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 8), among which several were specifically competed by 100-fold molar excess of cold FPC1–3-WT oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 B,lanes 3 and 9). Computer analysis of −4755/−4738 region revealed putative binding sites for AP-2, Sp-1, MZF-1, and Ets. Competition experiments performed using an AP-2 consensus oligonucleotide showed competition for complex IV formation (Fig. 6 B, lane 6). In addition an Sp-1 consensus oligonucleotide competed for complexes IV-V formation (lane 5). Finer analysis of the sequences of AP-2 and Sp-1 consensus oligonucleotides revealed putative Sp-1 binding sites within the AP-2 oligonucleotide. Inversely the Sp-1 oligonucleotide had no binding site for AP-2. This suggests that the competition of AP-2 oligonucleotide for complex IV formation may be in fact Sp-1-dependent. Therefore, the relative contribution of AP-2 and Sp-1 for complex IV formation should be further investigated. MZF-1 consensus oligonucleotide exhibited a clear competition for complex I (lane 4), suggesting the binding of an MZF-like protein. Lastly, an FPC1–3-WT oligonucleotide bearing a mutation in the Ets-binding site still competed away all complexes with efficiency equivalent to that of the wild type FPC1–3-WT oligonucleotide (lane 10). Altogether, these results suggest an implication of Sp-1-related and MZF-like transcription factors in the formation of DNA-protein complexes in element C but not of Ets family members. Incubation of the labeled FPB2-WT probe centered on the region B2 (Fig. 7iA) with HMEC-1 nuclear extracts resulted in a DNA-protein complex formation (Fig. 7 B,lane 2), which was completely prevented with cold FPB2-WT competitor (Fig. 7 B, lane 3). Computer analysis of FPB2-WT revealed a putative Ets-binding site possibly involved in the complex formation. Indeed, we observed a clear competition using a 100-fold molar excess of a consensus Ets-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 7 B, lane 5), whereas an FPB2 oligonucleotide, mutated for the Ets-binding site (FPB2m) failed to prevent the complex formation (Fig. 7 B, lane 4). Using antibodies directed against Erg 1/2 transcription factors or NERF 1/1b/2 factors, we did not observe any supershift on DNA-protein complexes formed by HMEC-1 nuclear extracts and FPB2-WT probe (data not shown), suggesting that neither Erg nor NERF transcription factors were present in DNA-pr"

The phosphotyrosine-binding/protein interaction (PTB/PI) domain of X11α, a neuronal cytosolic adaptor protein, binds to the YENPTY sequence in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of APP. This interaction prolongs the half-life of APP and inhibits Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion. X11α/Mint-1 has multiple protein-protein interaction domains, a Munc-18 interaction domain (MID), a Cask/Lin-2 interaction domain (CID), a PTB/PI domain, and two PDZ domains. These X11α protein interaction domains may modulate its effect on APP processing. To test this hypothesis, we performed a deletion analysis of X11α effects on metabolism of APP695 Swedish (K595N/M596L) (APPsw) by transient cotransfection of HEK 293 cells with: 1) X11α (X11α-wt, N-MID-CID-PTB-PDZ-PDZ-C), 2) amino-terminal deletion (X11α-ΔN, PTB-PDZ-PDZ), 3) carboxyl-terminal deletion (X11α-ΔPDZ, MID-CID-PTB), or 4) deletion of both termini (PTB domain only, PTB). The carboxyl terminus of X11α was required for stabilization of APPsw in cells. In contrast, the amino terminus of X11α was required to stimulate APPs secretion. X11α, X11α-ΔN, and X11α-PTB, but not X11α-ΔPDZ, were effective inhibitors of Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion. These results suggest that additional protein interaction domains of X11α modulate various aspects of APP metabolism.

Accumulating biochemical, genetic, and pathologic evidence suggests that amyloidogenesis plays a pivotal and possibly causal role in AD. The major components of amyloid plaque in AD brain are Aβ peptides including Aβ40 and Aβ42 that are derived by proteolysis of the type I transmembrane glycoprotein amyloid precursor protein (APP). Alternate pathways of APP proteolysis by either β-, γ-secretases or α-, γ-secretases result in the secretion of either APPsβ and Aβ, or APPsα and p3, respectively, and the generation of a series of cell-associated carboxyl-terminal stubs (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399 (suppl.): A23-A31Crossref Scopus (1519) Google Scholar).Mutations identified in rare autosomal dominant pedigrees of AD alter APP processing. For example, the APPsw mutation (K595N/M596L of APP695) was identified in affected subjects of a Swedish kindred of dominantly inherited AD; this mutation is located at the β-secretase cleavage site of APP and promotes β-secretase cleavage, thus increasing both Aβ40 and Aβ42 generation and amyloidogenesis in brain. This data strongly suggest that modulation of APP processing and the generation of Aβ peptides in particular play an important role in AD pathogenesis. In support of the amyloid hypothesis, all known familial AD mutations in APP, presenilin-1, and presenilin-2 result in greater generation of the more amyloidogenic Aβ42 from APP (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399 (suppl.): A23-A31Crossref Scopus (1519) Google Scholar).Proteins that interact with the highly conserved cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of APP also modulate its cellular processing.

The PTB domain of Shc specifically interacts with ΨXNPXpY motifs (where Ψ is a hydrophobic residue, X is any amino acid, N is asparagine, P is proline, and pY is phosphotyrosine) found in tyrosine kinase receptors, thus mediating signal transduction. Similarly, the PTB domains of X11, Fe65, and their homologs bind to the YENPTY motif in the carboxyl terminus of APP, although tyrosine phosphorylation has no discernable effect. The crystal structure of the PTB domain of X11α bound to peptides of APP spanning the YENPTY sequence reveals that eight peptide residues make specific contacts with the PTB domain, and they collectively achieve high affinity (Kd = 0.32 μm) and specificity (18Zhang Z.

X11α/Mint-1 also has other protein interaction domains, a Munc-18 interaction domain (MID), a Cask/Lin-2 interaction domain (CID) amino-terminal to the PTB/PI domain, and two carboxyl-terminal PDZ (Postsynaptic density-95,Disks-large, epithelial tight junction proteinZO-1) domains. Thus, APP and X11α may be components of a multimeric assembly that mediates their normal functions and regulates their trafficking and processing. We hypothesized that the MID, CID, and PDZ domains of X11α would modulate its effects on APP processing. To test this hypothesis X11α, amino-terminal deleted (X11α-ΔN), carboxyl-terminal deleted (X11α-ΔPDZ), and both termini deleted (X11α-PTB) constructs were generated and transiently co-expressed with APPsw in HEK 293 cells. The X11α deletion constructs revealed differential and complex effects on APP metabolism, suggesting a role for the non-PTB interaction domains of X11α in its modulation of APP trafficking and processing.RESULTSTo examine the potential effects of additional protein-protein interaction domains of X11α on APP processing, we deleted the amino terminus (X11α-ΔN), carboxyl terminus (X11α-ΔPDZ), or both (PTB domain only). A schematic representation of the X11α protein-protein interaction domains, and the deletion constructs used in these experiments are shown in Fig. 1 A. Immunoblot of all expressed Myc-tagged X11α constructs revealed similar protein levels of the expected Mr (Fig. 1 B). PhosphorImager quantitation of expression levels of the four X11α constructs revealed no significant differences (n = 12 separate experiments).Coexpression of APPsw with X11α or X11α-ΔN, but not vector, X11α-ΔPDZ, or X11α-PTB significantly increased APPsw in cell lysates (Fig. 2). Immunoblot results were identical with an antibody that recognized either the amino terminus (Fig. 2 A) or the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2 B) of APP, thus demonstrating these effects on full-length APP. Quantitation of immunoblots as shown in Fig. 2 A revealed that X11α and X11α-ΔN, but not X11α-ΔPDZ and X11α-PTB, increased cellular APP 2-fold (p < 0.01, n = 12 separate experiments) (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal PDZ domains of X11α mediate relative increases in cellular APP. Reprobing the blot with an anti-tubulin antibody revealed equivalent levels, suggesting that the effects were specific to APP and not tubulin and that equal levels of protein were loaded per lane (data not shown).Figure 2Carboxyl-terminal domains of X11α increase cellular APPsw. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector or APPsw alone or with vector, X11α-wt, X11α-ΔN, X11α-ΔPDZ, or X11α-PTB. Forty-eight hours after transfection, 20 μg of cell lysate protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by immunoblot with enhanced chemiluminescence and a PhosphorImager.

After transient transfection of HEK 293 cells with APPsw and either vector, X11α, X11α-ΔN, X11α-ΔPDZ, or X11α-PTB, proteins in conditioned medium were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot detection of total APPs with 22C11. X11α and X11α-ΔPDZ, but not X11α-ΔN or X11α-PTB, increased total APPs in medium compared with cells transfected with APPsw alone (Fig. 3 A). PhosphorImager quantitation of APPs from immunoblots as shown in Fig. 3 Arevealed that X11α and X11α-ΔPDZ, but not X11α-ΔN and X11α-PTB, increased APPs approximately 4- and 8-fold, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 12 separate experiments) (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the amino-terminal domains of X11α promote APPs secretion. The downward shift in Mr suggests that APPsβ is responsible for the bulk of the relative increase in total APPs.Figure 3Amino-terminal domains of X11α promote APPs secretion. A,HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with APPsw alone or in combination with X11α-wt, X11α-ΔN, X11α-ΔPDZ, or X11α-PTB. After correcting for protein in cell lysates, the proteins in approximately 50 μl of medium conditioned for 48 h were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and total APPs was detected by immunoblot with 22C11.

Cotransfection of APPsw with X11α, X11α-ΔN, or X11α-PTB, but not X11α-ΔPDZ, decreased levels of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in parallel (Fig. 4; p < 0.01,n = 8 separate experiments). In contrast, X11α-ΔPDZ increased secreted Aβ40, although this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the interaction of the PTB domain of X11α with the YENPTY motif of APP inhibits Aβ secretion; however, this inhibitory effect is reversed by the deletion of PDZ domains.Figure 4The isolated PTB domain of X11α is as effective as X11α in inhibition of Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector or APPsw alone or in combination with X11α-wt, X11α-ΔN, X11α-ΔPDZ, or X11α-PTB. Conditioned medium were collected 48 h after transfection and Aβ40 and Aβ42 were detected by ELISA. The data represent absorbance minus background converted to picograms using standard curves.

The results may be interpreted by a model of alternate and competing pathways of APP metabolism, with the shunting of APP among these pathways influenced by these additional X11α domains. The results best fit a model including: 1) inhibition of endocytic APP metabolism by the PTB domain interaction, 2) inhibition of all APP metabolism by carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain interactions, and 3) promotion of APPs and Aβ secretion by amino-terminal domain interactions. Although this model may be useful in the interpretation of results (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) in relation to the literature on APP trafficking and processing, further experiments are required to probe its accuracy. Inhibition of endocytic processing is plausible because clathrin-mediated endocytosis also requires the binding of adaptor proteins to the cytoplasmic YENPTY sequence of APP. Also supportive of this model, a yeast two-hybrid screen identified self-interaction of Lin-10, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of X11α (24Walhout A.J.M. Sordella R. Lu X. Hartley J.L. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Thierry-Mieg N. Vidal M. Science. 2000; 287: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), suggesting that X11α may dimerize at PDZ domains to retard APP catabolism.Whereas stabilization of APP in cell lysates and inhibition of Aβ secretion by X11α are invariate, results with APPs are more complex. Cotransfection of wt APP with X11α decreases APPsα and total APPs secretion in conditioned medium. Similarly, cotransfection of APPsw with X11α decreases APPsα (4Borg J.-P. Yang Y. De Taddeo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 5Sastre M. Turner R.S. Levy E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22351-22357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, cotransfection of APPsw with X11α increases total APPs (Fig. 3) and may represent an increase in APPsβ. This may be explained by the fact that the APPsw mutation promotes β-secretase cleavage at the expense of α-secretase cleavage, and that amino-terminal domains of X11α may further promote β-secretase cleavage of APPsw in the secretory pathway (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the effects of X11α on APPs may have biphasic kinetics consisting of an initial inhibition followed by a relative increase in APPs secretion as bulk flow of nascent APP through the secretory pathway resumes whereas endocytic processing is inhibited. Analysis with APPsβ-specific probes and kinetic experiments will shed light on these possibilities. These results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that generation of Aβ peptides from wt APP requires endocytosis from the cell surface, whereas generation of APPs and Aβ from APPsw occurs in parallel and independent of endocytosis in the exocytic pathway (25Koo E.H.

However, X11α, X11α-ΔN, X11α-ΔPDZ, and the isolated PTB domain of X11α are all capable of binding APP (2Borg J.-P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell.

Similarly, APP binds to the isolated PTB domain of X11β as well as full-length X11β; however, deletion of the carboxyl terminus of X11β enhances its binding to APP whereas deletion of its amino terminus suppresses binding. Apparently independent of binding affinities, only full-length X11β inhibits Aβ40 but not Aβ42 secretion (30Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S Takeda S Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This effect is blocked by XB51, a protein that binds to an amino-terminal region of X11β (31Lee D.-S. Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23134-23138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whereas the carboxyl-terminal protein interaction domains in the X11 gene family are highly conserved, the amino-terminal sequences are divergent and thus may modulate APP metabolism differently.Munc-18 interacts with a domain in the amino-terminal region (MID) of X11α and X11β (32Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), but not X11γ. Munc-18 plays an essential role in the docking of vesicles during exocytosis (33Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Cask also interacts with an amino-terminal domain (CID) of X11α, but not X11β or X11γ. Cask is a member of the evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric complex Mint/Cask/Veli and its C. elegans homologs Lin-10/Lin-2/Lin-7. In C. elegans this modular adaptor protein complex is essential in targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor Let-23 to the basolateral side of vulval epithelial cells and the GLR-1 glutamate receptor to the postsynaptic region of neurons (34Keach S.M.

Consistent with this notion, data from knock-out and overexpression models of the Drosophila melanogaster APP homolog suggest that it regulates synaptic structure and number, and this effect is mediated by cytoplasmic domains of APP (43Torroja L. Packard M. Gorczyca M. White K. Budnik V. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7793-7803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, neurons from APP-deficient mice display deficient survival and neurite outgrowth (44Perez R.G. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H. Koo E.H. J.

Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Spinophilin/neurabin II, a protein with putative roles in presynaptic formation and function, binds to the second PDZ domain of X11α (47Ide N. Hata Y. Hirao K. Irie M. Deguchi M. Yao I. Satoh A.

Although the role of these potential X11α binding partners in APP metabolism in transfected 293 cells is unclear, these protein interactions may modulate APP trafficking and processing in vivo. The APP/Mint/Cask complex is not only localized in neuronal processes suggestive of synaptic localization and function, but also in the Golgi of NT2 neurons, thus suggesting APP tethering and targeting roles for the Mint-1/Cask/Veli complex (21Borg J.-P.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The β- and γ-secretase activities responsible for APP metabolism have recently been identified. X11, Fe65, and other APP-binding proteins may influence its processing by multiple mechanisms including steric hindrance of proteases or by trafficking APP to alternate cellular compartments containing different complements of protease activities. Recent therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AD have included identifying specific inhibitors of β- or γ-secretases. However, it is unlikely that these proteases are specific to APP, and thus, inhibitors may have untoward effects. For example, presenilin-1 promotes intramembranous Notch cleavage as well as APP cleavage (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399 (suppl.): A23-A31Crossref Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Notch signaling is vital for normal mammalian development and has important roles in the adult. The interaction of X11α and other binding partners with APP suggests novel therapeutic strategies based on substrate protection rather than protease inhibition. Alternatively, X11α has unknown effects on potentially deleterious carboxyl-terminal stubs of APP and intracellular Aβ. Therefore, whether this mechanism proves to be a viable therapeutic strategy for AD depends on furtherin vitro and in vivo studies of the consequences of their interaction. Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically defined by the density of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in brain. Accumulating biochemical, genetic, and pathologic evidence suggests that amyloidogenesis plays a pivotal and possibly causal role in AD. The major components of amyloid plaque in AD brain are Aβ peptides including Aβ40 and Aβ42 that are derived by proteolysis of the type I transmembrane glycoprotein amyloid precursor protein (APP). Alternate pathways of APP proteolysis by either β-, γ-secretases or α-, γ-secretases result in the secretion of either APPsβ and Aβ, or APPsα and p3, respectively, and the generation of a series of cell-associated carboxyl-terminal stubs (1Selkoe D.J.

The PAC1 and VPAC1 receptors may stimulate, in addition, inositol trisphosphate synthesis and calcium mobilization (7Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L.

Delporte C. Winand J. Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). VIP and PACAP receptors are members of a large family of G protein-coupled receptors, often referred as the GPCR-B family (4Harmar A.J. Arimura A. Gozes I. Journot L. Laburthe M. Pisegna J.R.

Endocrinol. 1994; 101: C5-C9Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), that includes the secretin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) receptors. The VIP, PACAP, secretin, and GRF receptors constitute a subfamily based on the homology of the ligands and of the receptors. Each receptor recognizes its own cognate ligand with a high affinity but recognizes at least one other parent peptide with a comparable or a lower affinity (4Harmar A.J. Arimura A. Gozes I. Journot L. Laburthe M. Pisegna J.R. Rawlings S.R. Robberecht P. Said S.I. Sreedharan S.P. Wank S.A. Waschek J.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 265-270PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the sequence homology of the ligands and the receptors, the information obtained on one receptor-ligand pair can be anticipated to be relevant also in the other systems. The positioning of the ligand on the receptors is still poorly understood. Investigations of chimeric receptors and mutants have indicated that the large amino-terminal domain (10Vilardaga J.P.

Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal part of the ligand is necessary for high affinity binding and for second messenger activation; its deletion in VIP, PACAP, and secretin reduced both the affinity and the intrinsic activity of the peptide (20Ciccarelli E. Vilardaga J.P. De Neef P. Di Paolo E. Waelbroeck M. Bollen A. Robberecht P. Regul. Pept. 1994; 54: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The identification of the receptor residues interacting with the amino terminus of the ligand is a prerequisite to model the active form of the receptor and conceive new ligands, preferably non-peptidic, that could be of therapeutic interest. We focused in this work on the human VPAC1receptors and investigated the contribution of two basic residues located in the second transmembrane helix to ligand recognition and adenylate cyclase activation. We obtained evidence that both basic residues are important for recognition of the Asp3 of VIP and stabilization of the active VIP-receptor complex conformation. Our results also suggested that a second binding mode, that does not involve recognition of the VIP Asp3 residue and does not induce receptor activation, is also possible. The human VPAC1 receptor cDNA was cloned by PCR according to the previously reported sequence (21Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), using specific primers. Generation of the four mutated receptors was achieved using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the human VPAC1 receptor-coding region, inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Corp.), was submitted to 22 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 14 min) in a 50-μl reaction volume. The forward and reverse primers were complementary and contained the desired nucleotide changes, flanked on either side by 15 perfectly matched nucleotides (only the forward primers are shown): Arg188 to Leu, CATATCCTTCATCCTGCTGGCTGCCGCTGTCTTC; Arg188 to Gln, CATATCCTTCATCCTGCAGGCTGCCGCTGTCTTC; Lys195to Ile, GCCGCTGTCTTCATCATAGACTTGGCCCTCTTC; Lys195 to Gln, GCCGCTGTCTTCATCCAAGACTTGGCCCTCTTC. Following PCR, 10 μl were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the remaining 40 μl were digested for at least 2 h by 1 μl of DpnI restriction enzyme (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to remove the parental methylated DNA. The digested PCR products were transformed into TOP10 One Shot competent Escherichia coli bacterial cells (Invitrogen Corp.). Of several colonies verified by agarose gel electrophoresis of miniprep plasmid DNA (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), three were retained and further purified on Qiaquick PCR purification spin columns, and the mutations were checked for by DNA sequencing on an ABI automated sequencing apparatus, using the BigDye Terminator sequencing prism kit from ABI (Perkin-Elmer). Plasmid DNA from one clone for each mutation, containing the correct nucleotide substitutions, was prepared using a midiprep endotoxin-free kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the complete nucleotide sequence of the receptor coding region was verified by DNA sequencing, and 20 μg were electroporated (Electroporator II; Invitrogen Corp.) into wild type CHO-K1 cells. Selection was carried out in culture medium (50% HamF12, 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin (10 milliunits/ml), 1% streptomycin (10 μg/ml), 1% l-glutamine (200 mm; Life Technologies LTD, Paisley, United Kingdom), supplemented with 600 μg of geneticin (Gly418)/ml culture medium. After 10 to 15 days of selection, isolated colonies were transferred to 24-well microtiter plates and grown until confluence, trypsinized, and further expanded in 6-well microtiter plates, from which cells were scraped and membranes prepared for screening by an adenylate cyclase activity assay in the presence of 10 μm VIP. Membranes were prepared from scraped cells lysed in 1 mm NaHCO3 by immediate freezing in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the lysate was first centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 400 × g, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet, resuspended in 1 mmNaHCO3, was used immediately as a crude membrane fraction. Binding studies were performed as described (23Gourlet P. De Neef P. Cnudde J. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) using125I-VIP, 125I-[Gln3] VIP, or125I-VIP1 antagonist. The three tracers were radiolabeled similarly and had comparable specific radioactivity (6Vertongen P. Schiffmann S.N. Gourlet P. Robberecht P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 412-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,23Gourlet P. De Neef P. Cnudde J. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Peptides. 1997; 18: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In all cases, the nonspecific binding was defined as residual binding in the presence of the corresponding unlabeled peptide (1 μm). Binding was performed at 20 °C in a total volume of 120 μl containing 20 mm Tris-maleate, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) buffer. 3 to 30 μg of protein were used per assay. Bound and free radioactivity were separated by filtration through glass-fiber GF/C filters presoaked for 24 h in 0.01% polyethyleneimine and rinsed three times with a 20 mm (pH 7.4) sodium phosphate buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Adenylate cyclase activity was determined by the procedure of Salomon et al. (24Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar), as described previously. Membrane proteins (3–15 μg) were incubated in a total volume of 60 μl containing 0.5 mm[α32P]ATP, 10 μm GTP, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm cAMP, 1 mm theophylline, 10 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate, 30 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 30 mm Tris-HCl at a final pH value of 7.8. The reaction was initiated by membranes addition and was terminated after a 15-min incubation at 37 °C by adding 0.5 ml of a 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution containing 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm cAMP, and 20,000 cpm [3H]cAMP. cAMP was separated from ATP by two successive chromatographies on Dowex 50W × 8 and neutral alumina.

The clones transfected with the DNA coding for the mutated receptors were selected on the basis of the ability of 10 μm VIP membranes to activate adenylate cyclase. The selected clones were then tested for 125I-VIP binding. Binding was non-significant in all the clones tested. As expected from the binding data, the EC50 values for VIP were 30 to 100-fold higher than at VPAC1 receptors (Fig.1). There was no noticeable difference between the R188L and R188Q receptors on one hand and the K195I and K195Q on the other hand. We then tested the ability of VIP analogues to stimulate adenylate cyclase. [Arg16] VIP, [Asn3] VIP, and [Gln3] VIP were more potent and more efficient than VIP at the R188L- and R188Q-VPAC1 receptors, and [Glu3] VIP and the VIP1 agonist behaved as partial agonists on both mutant receptors (Fig. 1 and results not shown). The results are compared in Table II with the data obtained at wild type receptors with the same peptides. [Arg16] VIP was also more potent and more efficient than VIP on the K195Q- (Fig. 1) and K195I-VPAC1 receptors (data not shown). [Glu3] VIP, [Gln3] VIP, and [Asn3] VIP behaved as partial agonists on this construct, and the VIP1 agonists' ability to activate adenylate cyclase through K195Q- and K195I-VPAC1 receptor mutants was barely detectable (Table II). The VIP1 antagonists' affinity for the mutated receptors was evaluated by comparing VIP, [Arg16] VIP, or VIP1 agonist dose-effect curves in the absence and presence of 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μm antagonist (Fig.2 and results not shown). The VIP dose-effect curves were shifted dose-dependently to higher concentrations in the presence of antagonist, as expected for Ki values ≈ 2–3 nm at the five receptors (Fig. 2 and results not shown). Taken together, these results suggested that the affinity of [Gln3] VIP and of the VIP1 antagonist for the mutant receptors might be sufficient to allow binding studies using these radiolabeled peptides. This was indeed the case. The binding experiments were performed at 20 °C as tracer binding was unstable at 37 °C (probably because of a receptor instability, as already noted for chimeric receptors (10Vilardaga J.P. De Neef P. Di Paolo E. Bollen A. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Gourlet P. Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The binding of both tracers was rapid (equilibrium was achieved within 20 min) and reversible (data not shown). The peptides' IC50 values (reported in Table I) did not depend on the tracer used. Representative competition curves are shown in Fig.3. The R188Q and K195Q receptor concentrations were comparable (within 2-fold) to the VPAC1 receptor concentration. We were surprised that, even though the presence of a negative charge in position 3 was clearly deleterious for recognition of the R188Q, R188L, K195Q, and K195I mutant VPAC1 receptors by agonists, the VIP1 antagonist (that also possesses an Asp3 residue) retained a high affinity for the mutated receptors. We therefore synthesized and tested two additional peptides with an Asn3 residue, the Asn3 VIP1agonist and Asn3 VIP1 antagonist. As shown in Tables I and II, replacing the Asp3 by an Asn3residue reduced the affinity and efficacy of the VIP1agonist at wild type receptors but increased its affinity and efficacy on the mutated R188Q receptor. In contrast, replacing Asp3by an Asn3 residue in the VIP1 antagonist did not affect its affinity for the receptors studied in this work; the modified peptide always behaved as a high affinity antagonist (Fig.4). VIP receptors belong to a G protein-coupled receptor family that does not share any sequence homology with rhodopsin or with the β-adrenergic receptor family.

In view of the significant sequence homologies between secretin, VIP, PACAP, GRF, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide (7–36), and gastric inhibitory peptide on the one hand and between their receptors on the other hand, we hypothesized that these different peptides recognize “equivalent” binding sites in their respective receptors. The observation that all the aforementioned peptides except glucagon possess an acidic residue (Asp or Glu) in position 3, and that all the receptors (except glucagon's) possess aligned basic Arg and Lys residues at the extracellular end of TM2, led us to suspect that these residues might interact in the peptide-receptor complex. Our preliminary results confirmed that, as in secretin receptors (17Di Paolo E. Vilardaga J.P. Petry H. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Robberecht P. Waelbroeck M. Peptides. 1999; 20: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,38Vilardaga J.P. Di Paolo E. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Bollen A. Robberecht P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 842-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the VPAC1 receptor Arg188 and Lys195 were important for VIP recognition; we were unable to obtain significant 125I-VIP binding at the mutated receptors, and very high VIP concentrations were necessary to activate the adenylate cyclase. The following results suggested in addition that VIP was unable to stabilize the mutated receptors' active conformations sufficiently to ensure full receptor activation: [Asn3] VIP, [Gln3] VIP, and [Arg16] VIP were more efficient than VIP at the R188Q and R188L VPAC1 receptors, and [Arg16] VIP was more efficient than VIP at the K195Q and K195I VPAC1receptors. When VIP and its receptor are free, the VIP Asp3 and the receptor Arg188 and Lys195 side chains probably form dipole-ion interactions with surrounding water molecules. These favorable interactions are disrupted upon ligand binding; they must be compensated by ligand-receptor interactions to allow high affinity binding. The “uncharged VIP analogues” [Asn3] VIP and [Gln3] VIP had a higher affinity than VIP for the “uncharged receptor mutants” (R188Q, R188L, K195Q, and K195I VPAC1 receptors), suggesting that the VIP Asp3and the receptor Arg188 and Lys195 side chains were in close proximity in the agonist-receptor complex. The affinity loss that we observed upon replacement of the VIP Asp3, VPAC1 receptor Arg188, and VPAC1receptor Lys195 (30- to 100-fold) was however comparatively small and did not support the hypothesis that the Asp negative charge is close enough to the receptor Arg and Lys positive charges to form ionic bonds (40Andrews P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1986; 7: 148-151Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is more likely that Asp3, Arg188, and Lys195 formed strong hydrogen bonds (i.e. dipole-dipole or ion-dipole interactions); the two receptor basic residues probably participated in the formation of an electrophilic pocket that recognized the negatively charged VIP Asp3 side chain. [Asn3] VIP and [Gln3] VIP behaved as partial agonists at wild type receptors but were more efficient than VIP at the R188Q and R188L mutant receptors. The incomplete activation of the mutant receptors by VIP might be caused by difficulties in burying the anionic Asp3 side chain deep enough in the (uncharged) mutant receptors' binding site. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the observation that replacing the VIP Asp3 or the VPAC1 receptor Arg188or Lys195 with uncharged amino acids affected the recognition of the VIP1 agonist (an efficient partial agonist) somewhat less than the recognition of VIP and did not affect binding of the VIP1 antagonist, a compound that does not induce receptor activation. Due perhaps to steric hindrance between the receptor and the large d-Phe2 side chain, the VIP1 antagonist Asp3 was apparently unable to enter the agonist binding pocket and to trigger receptor activation. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor belongs to the same receptor family as the VPAC1 receptor. A molecular model of the PTH-receptor interaction has been developed, based on experimental data from cross-linking studies, spectroscopic investigations of the hormone and receptor fragments, and theoretical structure predictions (39Pandol S.J. Dharmsathaphorn K. Schoeffield M.S. Vale W. Rivier J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G553-G557PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, PTH recognizes extracellular receptor domains (the amino-terminal domain and extracellular loops) but penetrates very little if at all inside the compact transmembrane helices bundle. It is tempting to suggest that, like PTH, VIP initially recognizes an extracellular binding site. In a second step, driven and stabilized i.e. by the Asp3-Lys195/Arg188 interactions, a transmembrane binding pocket opens and recognizes the agonists' amino-terminal amino acids, and the receptor activates intracellular G proteins. “Too large” amino-terminal VIP amino acids (d-Phe2 instead of Ser2 and pCl-Phe6 instead of Phe6) might prevent the recognition of this activated receptor conformation by steric hindrance; [d-Phe2] and [pCl-Phe6] VIP or VIP/GRF analogues usually behave as VIP antagonists (27Rolz C. Pellegrini M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6397-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Rekasi Z. Varga J.L. Schally A.V. Halmos G. Groot K. Czompoly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The location of the VIP and secretin “Asp3 binding site” to transmembrane helix 2 was somewhat unexpected; indeed, in the rhodopsin-like β-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptor family, the ligand binding pocket is lined by TMs 3 to 7 and does not involve TMs 1 and 2. It is important to note in this respect that most of the “signature” amino acids that define the β-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptor family, including the proline residues that participate in the formation of the agonist binding pocket, are absent from the secretin receptor family (including VPAC1receptors). Our results suggest that (in contrast with the G protein binding site that appears to involve the same intracellular loops in both receptor families) the agonist binding site was located in very different transmembrane regions in the secretin- and β-adrenergic-receptor families. Further studies will be needed to extend this observation and allow the construction of an activated agonist-receptor complex model. To conclude, our present results suggested that the VIP Asp3 side chain fitted inside the transmembrane helix bundle, in close proximity to TM2 Lys195 and Arg188. This interaction was essential for receptor activation. The VIP1 antagonist Asp3 residue did not recognize the same binding pocket perhaps because of unfavorable coulombic interactions between thed-Phe2 side chain and the receptor."

To identify methylation sites that may be critical for maintaining repression of the human HPRT gene, we treated human/hamster hybrid cells containing an inactive human X chromosome with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azadeoxycytidine (5aCdr), and we then examined the high resolution methylation pattern of the HPRT promoter in single cell-derived lines. Reactivation of HPRT correlated with complete promoter demethylation. In contrast, the 61 5aCdr-treated clones that failed to reactivate HPRT exhibited sporadic promoter demethylation. However, three specific CpG sites remained methylated in all unreactivated clones, suggesting these sites may be critical for maintaining transcriptional silencing of the HPRT gene. Re-treatment of partially demethylated (and unreactivated) clones with a second round of 5aCdr did not increase the frequency of HPRTreactivation. This is consistent with mechanisms of methylation-mediated repression requiring methylation at specific critical sites and argues against models invoking overall levels or a threshold of promoter methylation. Treatment of cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, failed to reactivate HPRT on the inactive X chromosome, even when the promoter was partially demethylated by 5aCdr treatment, suggesting that transcriptional repression by DNA methylation is unlikely to depend upon a trichostatin A-sensitive histone deacetylase.

Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), particularly in housekeeping genes on the inactive X chromosome. Numerous studies suggest that this association between promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional repression has a functional basis. For instance, individual loci on the inactive human X chromosome in human/hamster hybrid cell lines may be reactivated using DNA-demethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine (2Ellis N. Keitges E. Gartler S.M. Rocchi M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3Mohandas T. Sparkes R.S. Shapiro L.J.

Li E. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), resulting in a failure to maintain methylation patterns during growth. Likewise, in vitro methylation of various promoter constructs results in inhibition of transcription in transient expression assays (5Buschhausen G. Wittig B. Graessmann M. Graessmann A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 6Busslinger M. Hurst J. Flavell R.A.

However, despite significant evidence that DNA methylation represses transcription, specific mechanisms of this repression are only now becoming apparent. Recent reports suggest that DNA methylation mediates transcriptional repression indirectly, via binding of the methylated DNA-binding protein MeCP2, which in turn recruits histone deacetylases that modify the local chromatin structure (10Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar, 11Jones P.L. Veenstra G.J. Wade P.A. Vermaak D. Kass S.U. Landsberger N. Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). However, additional mechanisms may also act to repress transcription by methylation, such as direct inhibition of transcription factor binding to its cognate site in DNA. Indeed, methylation of the binding sites of several transcription factors has been shown to alter the affinity of the factor for its binding site (reviewed by Tate et al.(12Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar)). Whether transcriptional repression relies on methylation at specific critical CpGs or on the overall level of promoter methylation remains unclear. Several studies indicate that methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the vicinity of the transcriptional initiation site(s) of genes is important for gene silencing (13Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8252-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14Levine A. Cantoni G.L. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, perturbation of the methylation pattern in this region may identify specific CpG sites whose methylation is required to maintain silencing and provide insight into mechanism(s) by which methylation mediates transcriptional repression. The X-linked human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)1 gene exhibits strong differential methylation in the promoter region on the active and inactive X chromosomes. High resolution methylation analysis by ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR)-assisted genomic sequencing indicates that the promoter on the active X chromosome is unmethylated, whereas the promoter on the inactive X chromosome is methylated at most, but not all, CpG dinucleotides (18Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1419-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The promoter methylation of the inactive HPRT allele, like that of other X-linked housekeeping genes, is unusual in that it occurs in a CpG island, which is typically unmethylated in autosomes. DNA-demethylating agents such as 5-azadeoxycytidine (5aCdr) can alter the methylation pattern of the inactive HPRT allele and can reactivate the gene on the inactive X chromosome in rodent/human hybrid cell lines (2Ellis N. Keitges E. Gartler S.M. Rocchi M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3Mohandas T. Sparkes R.S. Shapiro L.J.

Cis-acting regulatory elements in the HPRT promoter region have been identified by dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in vivofootprinting (20Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By examining the altered methylation patterns of the HPRTpromoter in single cell-derived clones from 5aCdr-treated cells, we have identified three specific CpG dinucleotides in the promoter region whose methylation is highly correlated with maintaining transcriptional repression of the HPRT gene on the inactive X chromosome. Consistent with the requirement for methylation of specific critical CpG sites, we find no correlation between the level of pre-existing demethylation and the reactivation frequency of the gene when clonal lines that have undergone partial demethylation of the promoter are re-treated with 5aCdr. We also find that the inactive HPRTallele appears to be insensitive to reactivation by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), and we also show that this resistance to TSA reactivation cannot be overcome by partial demethylation of the promoter region. Furthermore, we present evidence for de novo methylation of the HPRT promoter upon 5aCdr treatment, and we discuss its potential relevance to transcriptional silencing by DNA methylation. 8121 (20Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and X8-6T2 (21Dracopoli N.C. Rettig W.J. Albino A.P. Esposito D. Archidiacono N. Rocchi M. Siniscalco M.

They were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1× 6-thioguanine (2-amino-6-mercaptopurine; Sigma). 4.12 (20Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) is a human/hamster hybrid containing an active human X chromosome. 4.12 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1× HAT (hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplement. All cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 8121 cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence, switched to medium lacking 6-thioguanine, and treated for 24–48 h with 0.5–2.0 μg/ml 5aCdr. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, counted by hemocytometer, and serially diluted. Cells were plated at a density of 10–103cells per 100-mm plate in non-selective medium (without HAT or 6-thioguanine) or 103–105 cells per 100-mm plate in HAT-supplemented medium. After 2–4 weeks, well isolated single cell-derived colonies were isolated with cloning rings and individually expanded in 24-well plates and then in individual culture flasks. Sixty two clones isolated from 5aCdr-treated cells grown without selection and four clones isolated from 5aCdr-treated cells grown under HAT selection were expanded for further analysis. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 μg/ml gentamicin and then treated with 1.0 μg/ml 5aCdr for 24 h. The cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in medium without 5aCdr, plated in duplicate at a density of 20,000 cells per 150-mm plate in HAT medium, as well as 1,000 cells per 150-mm plate in non-selective medium (to normalize for plating efficiency), and incubated at 37 °C for 10 days. Single cell-derived colonies in each dish were stained with Coomassie Blue for 5 min and counted. The 5aCdr-induced reactivation frequency for each cell line was normalized for plating efficiency by calculating ((average number of HAT-resistant colonies in each plate)/(average number of colonies on each non-selected plate × 20)). The overall reactivation frequency of all of the clones together was calculated as ((total number of HAT-resistant colonies)/(total number of colonies on all non-selected plates × 20)). Cells were grown to 50% confluence and then switched to medium supplemented with 300 ng/ml TSA. Cells were lysed, and RNA was isolated (as described below) after 0, 12, 24, and 48 h of TSA treatment. Cells in monolayers were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed and incubated overnight at room temperature in 10 ml of DNA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 25 mmEDTA, 0.5% SDS, 300 μg/ml proteinase K). The lysate was extracted once with Tris-equilibrated phenol (pH 7.0), twice with phenol/chloroform (50:50), and once with chloroform. The 10-ml aqueous phase was treated with 10 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase mixture (RNase A (500 units/ml), RNase T1 (2000 units/ml); Ambion) for 1 h at 37 °C and then extracted once with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform. The genomic DNA was precipitated with 0.5 volume of 7.5 m ammonium acetate, spooled out, washed briefly with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and then resuspended in TE (10 mmTris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) at approximately 1 μg/μl and stored at 4 °C. RNA was prepared using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and suspended in 100 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O. RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometry and adjusted to 1 μg/μl in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O, and the RNA was stored at −20 °C. HPRT mRNA was assayed using a protocol modified from Sasaki et al. (19Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of RNA in 6 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O was denatured for 5 min at 95 °C and then placed on ice for 2 min. The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was then performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 units of RNasin (Promega), 7.5 μmrandom hexamers, 1 mm dNTPs, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 200 units of murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega) and was incubated for 10 min at 20 °C and then 1 h at 37 °C. PCR amplification was performed on 10 μl of the RT products in a final volume of 100 μl containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.75 mm MgCl, 60 pmol each of the HPRT-specific primers HPRT1 (5′-TCCTCCTGAGCAGTCAGC-3′) and HPRT3 (5′-GGCGATGTCAATAGGACTC-3′), 7.5 pmol each of the human MIC2 gene (MIC2)-specific primers XMIC2 (5′-ACCCAGTGCTGGGGATGACTTT-3′) and XMIC2R (CTCTCCATGTCCACCTCCCCT-3′), and 10 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The PCR cycling conditions were 2 min at 94 °C; 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, and 90 s at 70 °C; 4 min at 72 °C; hold at 4 °C. 10 μl of the PCR reaction was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel, run at 100 V for 2 h, stained in ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV fluorescence. Analysis of the methylation status of each CpG dinucleotide within the 5′ region of the HPRT gene was accomplished using the cytosine-specific Maxam-Gilbert genomic sequencing reaction (22Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) followed by gene-specific amplification using ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR (23Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). 75 μg of genomic DNA were treated with 60% hydrazine in 1.5 m NaCl for 10 min at 20 °C. The reaction was stopped with 200 μl of hydrazine stop solution (0.3m sodium acetate (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and then precipitated in ethanol in a dry ice bath. The pellet was re-precipitated with sodium acetate and washed briefly with 75% ethanol and dried under vacuum. The sample was resuspended in 90 μl of H2O, and 10 μl of piperidine was added. Piperidine cleavage at modified cytosines was performed at 95 °C for 30 min. 1 ml of H2O was added, and the sample was allowed to dry overnight under vacuum to remove the piperidine. The resulting chemically cleaved DNA was resuspended at a final concentration of 1 μg/μl in H2O. Fragments representing cleavages at unmethylated cytosines within the HPRT promoter were amplified by LMPCR. The LMPCR amplification of fragments representing cleavages within the HPRT promoter was performed essentially as described by Hornstra and Yang (18Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1419-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) except that the PCR step was carried out using Taq polymerase (20Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) instead of Vent polymerase. For the methylation analysis, 2 μg of hydrazine-treated DNA was amplified using the E and M primer sets as described previously (20Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The E1 and E2 primers, 5′-AGCTGCTCACCACGACG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGGCTGCGGGTCGCCATAA-3′, respectively, were used to examine upper strand methylation, whereas the M1 and M2 primers, 5′-GAATAGGAGACTGAGTTGGG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCCTCGGCTTCTTCTGGGAGAA-3′, respectively, were used to examine the lower strand. These two LMPCR primer sets cover the region from approximately positions −235 to −10 relative to the translation start site on both strands and include the entire minimal promoter (24Rincon Limas D.E. Krueger D.A. Patel P.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4157-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LMPCR products were size-fractionated on a 5% acrylamide gel DNA sequencing gel, electrotransferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with an appropriate 32P-labeled probe as described previously (23Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To identify specific CpG sites within the promoter region whose methylation may be critical for maintaining transcriptional repression of the HPRT gene on the inactive X chromosome, we treated 8121 cells (containing an inactive human X chromosome) with the demethylating agent 5aCdr and isolated both HAT-selected (HAT selects for the HPRT+ phenotype) and non-selected single cell-derived clones. If critical CpG sites exist within the HPRT promoter region, these sites should remain methylated after exposure to 5aCdr in all clones that fail to reactivate the HPRT gene (and, conversely, undergo demethylation in all clones that do reactivate). Each of 4 HAT-selected and 62 non-selected clones were screened for expression of HPRT mRNA by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR assay was performed on total RNA as a multiplex reaction using both HPRT-specific primers and human MIC2 (MIC2)-specific primers. Because MIC2 is an X-linked gene that escapes X inactivation,MIC2 expression serves as an internal positive control for the RT-PCR. As expected, RT-PCR analysis revealed that all 4 HAT-resistant clones had reactivated the HPRT gene (Fig.1 A). In addition, one of the 62 non-selected clones examined also had reactivated the HPRTgene following 5aCdr treatment. To determine the sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay, total RNA from 4.12 cells (which contain an active human X chromosome and express the HPRT gene) was serially diluted with total RNA from 8121 cells, and the resulting mixtures were subjected to RT-PCR. The results (Fig. 1 B) indicate that the RT-PCR assay can readily detect as little as 0.2% of “wild type” (i.e. 4.12 cells) HPRT mRNA levels. All 5 clones that reactivated the HPRT gene after 5aCdr treatment exhibited full wild type HPRT mRNA levels, and all 61 clones that failed to reactivate the HPRT gene after 5aCdr treatment showed no detectable HPRT mRNA; no low or intermediate HPRT mRNA levels were observed for any of the clones examined in our RT-PCR assays. All clones assayed for HPRT reactivation by RT-PCR were also subjected to high resolution DNA methylation analysis by LMPCR genomic sequencing (Figs. 2 and3). The specific region of the HPRT promoter examined extends from approximately 140 bp upstream to 90 bp downstream of the two major transcription initiation sites identified by Kim et al. (25Kim S.H. Moores J.C. David D. Respess J.G. Jolly D.J. Friedmann T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3103-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and encompasses the entire minimal promoter (26Patel P.I. Framson P.E. Caskey C.T. Chinault A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and all but one of the transcription factor binding sites previously identified by DMS in vivofootprinting (20Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This region was chosen for analysis because previous studies suggest the region surrounding transcription initiation sites is crucial for transcriptional repression by DNA methylation (13Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8252-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 14Levine A. Cantoni G.L. Razin A. Proc. Natl.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 189: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the parental 8121 cell line, this region contains 20 symmetrically methylated CpG sites (where paired CpGs on the upper and lower strand count as a single site) and 12 unmethylated sites (18Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1419-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Purified genomic DNA from each clone was subjected to the Maxam-Gilbert cytosine-specific sequencing reaction followed by ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR). The cytosine-specific reaction uses hydrazine to modify cytosine nucleotides in DNA, but this modification is significantly inhibited by methylation at the 5-position of cytosine. The differential reactivity of hydrazine with cytosine versus5-methylcytosine allows for examination of the methylation status of every cytosine (including CpG dinucleotides) within a region of interest (18Hornstra I.K.

In this high resolution assay, demethylation at a specific cytosine results in the appearance of a new band (relative to a methylated sample) in the autoradiogram of the cytosine-specific sequencing ladder (Fig. 2). A site was scored as “demethylated” in 5aCdr-treated clones if a new cytosine-specific band was detected that was previously undetectable (i.e. methylated) at the same position in the cytosine-specific ladder from the 8121 parental cells. All sites designated as “methylated” showed no detectable band on the cytosine-specific sequencing ladder above background levels; therefore, a site in the 5aCdr-treated clones was considered demethylated if the associated band was detectable above background (Fig. 3).Figure 3Summary of methylation analysis of the HPRT gene 5′ region in unreactivated clones. The rows of squares immediately above and below the nucleotide sequence indicate the methylation pattern of the parental 8121 cell line. Open squaresindicate unmethylated CpG dinucleotides; solid squaresindicate methylated CpG dinucleotides, and half-filled squares indicate sites methylated in some cells but not others.? indicates sites for which the methylation status could not be determined due to technical limitations of the genomic sequencing methodology. Only those unreactivated clones whose methylation state differed from the parental pattern at a given CpG site are scored as open or solid circles. Each open circle represents one unreactivated clone that exhibited demethylation at the indicated CpG site. Each solid circlerepresents one unreactivated clone that exhibited de novomethylation at the indicated CpG site. Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of clones that demonstrated de novo methylation at a given CpG site. In these cases of de novo methylation, the number of circles is scaled to half the number of methylation events at each site. ND indicates that the methylation status of the CpG site was not determined because it could not be resolved with the primer set used for that strand. The large vertical ovals indicate the location of the three critical methylation sites that remain methylated in all 61 unreactivated clones. Bolded italicized G s within the sequence indicate the location of DMS in vivo footprints in the region (20Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell.

The arrows indicate the location of the two major transcription initiation sites determined by Kim et al. (25Kim S.H. Moores J.C. David D. Respess J.G. Jolly D.J. Friedmann T.

Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1419-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, two HAT-selected 8121-derived clones that had spontaneously reactivated the human HPRT gene in the absence of 5aCdr treatment also exhibited complete demethylation of all CpGs in the same region of the promoter (data not shown). These data suggest that the complete demethylation of this region of the HPRT promoter in transcriptionally reactivated clones is not simply an artifact of 5aCdr or HAT treatment and is a requirement for transcriptional activation of the gene. Consistent with these results, clones that failed to reactivate the HPRT gene following 5aCdr treatment had promoters that remained relatively hypermethylated compared with the unmethylated active HPRT allele (Fig. 2). Among unreactivated clones, the extent and pattern of 5aCdr-induced demethylation at the HPRT promoter were quite variable, with as few as 0 and as many as 11 demethylated CpG sites out of a possible 20 methylated sites in the parental 8121 cells, with an overall frequency of 7.8% demethylation/site. Nevertheless, even the clone with 11 demethylated sites failed to express any detectable HPRT mRNA as determined by RT-PCR, suggesting that the repressive effect of methylation on transcription is not simply cumulative nor directly proportional to the number of methylated CpG sites. Since any methylation site(s) essential for transcriptional repression should remain methylated in all unreactivated clones, the methylation patterns of each of the 61 unreactivated clones were compared (and summarized in Fig. 3). This analysis identified three CpGs at positions −48, −54, and −97 (relative to the translation initiation site) that remain methylated on both strands in all 61 unreactivated 5aCdr-treated clones. The site at position −97 is located immediately upstream of a major transcription initiation site, and the sites at positions −48 and −54 are located approximately 35–45 bp downstream of the two major transcription start sites (in the portion of the gene encoding the 5′-untranslated region). The perfect correlation between methylation at these three “critical” CpG sites and transcriptional repression of the HPRT gene in 61 independent clones suggests that methylation at these sites is necessary for maintaining repression of HPRT on the inactive X chromosome. In contrast, all other CpG sites examined in this region exhibited demethylation in at least one unreactivated clone, indicating that methylation at each of these sites is not essential for maintaining transcriptional repression. The 5aCdr-induced demethylation pattern observed in the 61 unreactivat"

RD3 comprises a unique translational topology of two homologous type III AFP globular domains, each containing one flat, ice binding plane. The ice binding plane of the N domain is located ∼3.5 Å “behind” that of the C domain. The two ice binding planes are located laterally with an angle of 32 ± 12° between the planes. These results suggest that the C domain plane of RD3 binds first to the ice {101̄0} prism plane in the 〈0001〉 direction, which induces successive ice binding of the N domain in the 〈0101〉 direction. This manner of ice binding caused by the unique structural topology of RD3 is thought to be crucial for the significant enhancement of antifreeze activity, especially at low AFP concentrations.

Antifreeze function is macroscopically visible in aqueous solutions of AFP as the creation of an unusual bipyramidal shape for ice crystals (7Hew C.L. Yang D.S.C. Eur. J.

S. A. 1977; 74: 2589-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how AFPs cause these phenomena. Indeed, quantitative analysis of the nonlinear profile of Tf depression is not feasible, because it is difficult to define the concentration of growing ice crystals and total numbers of ice binding sites for AFP. Nevertheless, structural biology has provided insight into the antifreeze mechanism. For example, types I–IV AFP variants have the ability to bind specifically to the ice crystal surface and inhibit its growth, albeit each variant is composed of a different structural motif: type I AFP is composed of alanine-rich, amphipathic α helices (Mr∼3,300–5,000); type II AFP (Mr ∼14,000) comprises cysteine-rich globular proteins related to C-type lectines; type III AFP (Mr ∼6,500) comprises compact β-sheet structures, and type IV AFP (Mr∼12,000) is assumed to form a four-helix bundle (9Davies P.L.

A remarkably flat and amphipathic surface plane that encompasses residues 9–21 and 41–44 is thought to be an essential ice binding site. The polar atoms of the putative ice binding residues Gln9, Asn14, Thr15, Ala16, Thr18, and Gln44 are located to form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms of the ice lattice {101̄0} prism plane (11Sönnichsen F.D.

RD3 is an activity-enhanced variant of type III AFP that is an intramolecular dimer (134 residues, Mr15,800; Ref. 15Wang X. DeVries A.L. Cheng C.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In RD3 a 9-residue linker sequence (D65GTTSPGLK73) connects the two type III AFP domains in tandem and locates them in specific orientations, which determines in part the antifreeze activity of the intact molecule. Together with activity measurements, the present structural determination of RD3 will improve understanding of the ice binding mechanism and will provide insight into the potential for production of AFP with enhanced activity. Preparations of unlabeled, 15N-labeled-, and13C/15N-labeled-RD3 were briefly described previously (16Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Nitta K. Tsuda S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 273-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli JM105 cells were transformed with a pKK223–3UC-based expression plasmid containing synthesized DNA encoding RD3 and were cultured in M10 minimal media. The media contained 15N-labeled NH4Cl for the expression of 15N-labeled RD3 and both15N-labeled NH4Cl and 13C-labeled glucose for expression of 13C/15N-labeled-RD3. The transformed cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was suspended in TEN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Inclusion bodies in the precipitate were purified by centrifugation in 40% (w/v) sucrose and washed with TEN buffer containing 1.0% Triton X-100. RD3 was extracted from the inclusion bodies with extraction buffer (acetonitrile:isopropanol:water, 46.7:23.3:30) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 22 °C. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was diluted with acetic acid buffer (pH 3.8) and loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography High-S column (Bio-Rad). Bound RD3 was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of aqueous ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing RD3 were further purified by reverse-phase liquid chromatography using a TSKgel ODS-80Ts column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The RD3 sample was lyophilized after check of the purity by Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie brilliant blue staining. Approximately 50 mg of unlabeled RD3 and 15 mg of15N- and 13C/15N-labeled RD3 were prepared from 2.4- and 6.0-liter cultures, respectively. The thermal hysteresis measurements were performed using an osmometer (model OM 802, VOGEL GmbH) for lyophilized RD3 and type III AFP monomer (RD3-Nl) samples. RD3 and RD3-N1 samples were dissolved in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9) to give final concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.5, and 2.0 mm. Thermal hysteresis measurements were repeated three times using fresh solution for each point. The antifreeze activity of RD3 was further examined by observation of the ice crystal morphology using a Leica DMLB 100 photomicroscope equipped with a Linkam LK600 temperature controller. RD3 (2 μl) was dissolved in 0.1 mammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9, 0.1–1.0 mg/ml), momentarily frozen (approximately −22 °C), and warmed to 0 °C on the sample stage of the photomicroscope in order to create several ice crystal seeds in the solution. This solution was then cooled to approximately −1 to −5 °C, and growth of ice crystal seeds was monitored. A total of 1575 NMR-derived experimental restraints were obtained using a 500-MHz NMR spectrometer (Unity Inova-500, Varian) for the structural determination. Interproton distance restraints were obtained from the two-dimensional NOESY, 15N-edited NOESY (17Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), and simultaneous15N/13C-edited 3D NOESY experiments (18Pascal S.M. Muhandiram D.R. Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; B103: 197-201Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar) performed at 4 °C. The mixing time dependence of the transient NOE was determined from two-dimensional NOESY spectra to assess the effects of spin diffusion; subsequently, the mixing time was set to 50 ms for the NOESY experiments used to obtain experimental nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) restraints. The intensities of two-dimensional and 3D NOESY data were calibrated on the basis of NOEs corresponding to a known distance such as Tyr Hδ–Hε (2.48 Å), and an error of 50% was assumed for the NOE peak intensities. The following distance constraints were used to calibrate the 3D spectra: HNi–Hαi = 2.70–3.05 Å (for residues with negative φ value); HNi–Hαi-1 = 1.7–3.6 Å; H–C–C–H = 2.2–3.1 Å; H–C–CH3 = 2.5–2.7 Å; and H–C–H = 1.7–1.8 Å. In cases in which direct calibration was not possible, the distance constraints were overestimated. For NOEs found only in the NOESYs with a mixing time of 120 ms, the upper bound was set to 6 Å. For all proton-proton restraints, the lower bound was set to 1.7 Å. Dihedral angle restraints for the φ angle were estimated from the 3D HNHA experiment, using a correction factor of 1.1. A 25% error on the peak intensities was assumed, and the minimum φ angle restraint range was set to ±10°. The initial set of restraints containing no dihedral angle restraints and a fraction of NOEs are listed in Table I. From this initial set of NOE restraints and starting from an extended structure, 100 structures were generated with the simulated annealing protocol in X-PLOR 3.851 (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1987Google Scholar) using 12,000 high-temperature steps (60 ps at 1,000 K) and 6,000 cooling steps (30 ps, final temperature of 100 K). Of the 100 calculated structures, 75 were converged and folded properly but had significantly high total energy, which is generally due to assignment errors and a lack of input structural constraints. Hence, the input constraints were refined by analysis of the inconsistency between the constraints and the coordinates of the calculated structures. The calculated structures were then used for a new round of peak picking of NOESY spectra that enabled the assignment of larger numbers of NOEs. With refined distance constraints and the addition of dihedral φ angle constraints, the next round of structure calculation was performed starting with the 75 converged structures using the simulated annealing protocol with 6,000 high-temperature steps (30 ps) and 4,000 cooling steps (20 ps). Refinement of the input constraints with structure calculations was repeated over 30 times. The set of structures presented in this paper includes the 15 (see Fig. 2) and 40 (see Fig. 4 b) lowest energy structures selected from the 50 structures obtained in the last round of refinement.Table ISummary of restraints and structural statisticsRestraints Total1655 Short672 Medium (2 ≤ ‖i − j‖≤ 4)532 Long (‖i − j‖ ≥ 5)291 H bond80 Dihedral (φ)80Restraint violations Distance (> 0.2 Å)0 Dihedral (> 2 °)0Precision (Å)1-aThe average rms deviation for the coordinate set was calculated by superimposing each of the 40 structures onto the minimized average coordinate set.

The average S 2 value for the linker (0.60 ± 0.15) indicates that the backbone atoms of the linker are more flexible compared with the globular domains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recombinant RD3 protein generated by bacterial expression gives rise to thermal hysteresis and a bipyramidal shape for ice crystals as typically observed for all AFP variants. The noncolligative increase in antifreeze activity of RD3 is compared with that of type III AFP monomer (RD3-Nl; Ref. 20Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Odaira M. Nitta K. Tsuda S. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in the range of 0–2.0 mm protein (Fig. 1 a). RD3 was initially reported to show 1.9-fold higher activity than type III AFP monomer (11Sönnichsen F.D. Sykes B.D. Chao H. Davies P.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1154-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), which is verified in the present study when the concentrations of RD3 and monomer are 0.5 mm (Fig. 1, a and b). For AFP concentrations of 0–0.5 mm, a significant 5.9-fold enhancement of antifreeze activity is observed for RD3 compared with monomer (RD3-N1; Fig. 1 b). Although RD3 consists of two type III AFP monomers, the increased antifreeze activity of RD3 does not correspond to simple additive activity of two monomers under nonsaturating conditions. It has been suggested that AFPs bind irreversibly to ice crystal nuclei according to the adsorption-inhibition mechanism at the ice-water interface (8Raymond J.A. DeVries A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2589-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), on which convex ice surfaces are created between the bound proteins. The height and curvature of the convex ice surface increases because of the Kelvin effect at subzero temperatures (21Wilson P.W. Cryo-Letters. 1993; 14: 31-36Google Scholar). The convex ice surface is energetically unfavorable for water to join the ice lattice and results in depression of the freezing point (ΔTf ; Ref.22Wilson P.W. Cryobiology. 1994; 31: 406-412Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The freezing point depression was assumed to follow the relationship ΔTf = constant ×h/D 2, where h is the height of the convex ice surface, and D is the average distance between the ice-bound AFPs on the ice surface (21Wilson P.W. Cryo-Letters. 1993; 14: 31-36Google Scholar). Assuming that the average separation distance (D) for RD3 is less than the distance between RD3-Nl monomers because of the unique interdomain topology of RD3, this equation predicts an increased ΔTf for RD3 compared with type III AFP monomer. It should be noted that this equation was proposed under the assumption that type I AFP is cylindrically shaped. Thus, modifications or additional hypotheses, or both, may be necessary to describe the ice binding properties of RD3. In any case, more coverage of the ice surface area or more effective ice binding of RD3 compared with monomer (RD3-Nl), or both, is thought to alter efficiently the convex ice surface between ice-bound protein molecules especially at low protein concentrations (0.1–0.5 mm AFP). At higher AFP concentrations (0.5–2 mm), saturating amounts of AFP are bound to the ice crystal surface; thus no new convex ice surfaces can be formed, leading to an upper limit for ΔTf (Fig. 1 a). Assuming that the average distance between RD3 is shorter than that between RD3-Nl molecules, a smaller amount of RD3 compared with RD3-Nl is enough to saturate the ice surface. Hence, the ΔTf curve becomes a plateau even at the low concentration of RD3. The validity of this idea requires more experimental evidence and consideration, and detailed information about the structural difference between RD3 and the type III AFP monomer would have a significant contribution in this regard. The NMR solution structure of intact RD3 (Fig.2) has been determined on the basis of complete assignments of the 1H, 13C, and15N resonances of RD3 at pH 6.8 and 4 °C, which is approximately the freezing point of the solvent (BioMagResBank accession number 4449; Ref. 16Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Nitta K. Tsuda S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 273-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The determined structures have high stereochemical quality as well as sufficiently small values for NOE violations and root mean squared atomic coordinate differences (TableI; restraints and coordinates are available from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). The N and C domains of RD3 (residues 1–64 and 74–134) have highly similar compact folds (Fig. 3). These folds are characterized by an internal two-fold symmetry motif or so-called “pretzel fold” (14Yang D.S.C. Hon W.-C. Bubanko S. Xue Y. Seetharaman J. Hew C.L. Sicheri F. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2142-2151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) consisting of two antiparallel loop-shaped elements (residues 8–23 and 40–55 for the N domain and residues 78–93 and 110–125 for the C domain). A large part of the secondary structure of each domain is due to the β-strand (48%). The elements of secondary structure for the N domain consist of eight short β-strands (β1–β8; residues 3–7, 9–13, 15–18, 22–26, 31–33, 43–45, 47–49, and 53–55; Fig. 3 a) followed by a type III turn. The eight β-strands are connected through a type II turn (residues 40–43), a type III turn (residues 18–21), and an α-helix (α1; residues 36–39). The eight β-strands are also identified in the corresponding regions of the C domain (β9–β16; residues 73–77, 79–83, 85–88, 92–96, 101–103, 113–115, 117–119, and 122–125). Similar to the N domain, the other C domain secondary structural elements are an α-helix (α2; residues 106–109), a type II turn (residues 110–113), and two type III turns (residues 88–91 and 126–129). For the type III AFP monomer (QAE isoform), there are coordinates available for the NMR solution structure (Protein Data Bank code 1KDF; Refs. 11Sönnichsen F.D. Sykes B.D. Chao H. Davies P.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1154-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,12Sönnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Structure. 1996; 15: 1325-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the x-ray structure (Protein Data Bank code 1MSI; Ref. 13Jia Z. DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). There are slight inconsistencies in the secondary structure assignment between the NMR and x-ray structural coordinates. For example, one β-strand (residues 2–13) identified in the x-ray structure (1MSI) was assigned as two strands (residues 3–7 and 9–13) in the NMR structure (1KDF). Our determination of the lengths and locations of the α-helices and β-strands for each globular domain of RD3 are similar to those identified in the NMR structure (1KDF; Ref. 12Sönnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Structure. 1996; 15: 1325-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The structures of the type II turns at residues 40–43 and 110–113 were not identified in the QAE isoform and are due, in part, to the presence of residues Gly42 and Gly112 of RD3, which favor turns. The root mean square deviation value between the globular domains of RD3, 1KDF, and 1MSI is 1.17 ± 0.23 Å for the backbone atoms, indicating that the overall structural motif of the N- and C-terminal globular domains of RD3 is typical of type III AFP monomer. The side chain oxygen atoms of Gln9, Asn14, Thr15, Thr18, and Gln44 and main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Asn14 and Ala16are clustered together and form a flat surface plane on the outer face of the two-fold symmetry motif of the N domain (Fig.4 a). These atoms were identified as putative ice binding residues for type III AFP monomer. Mutation of these residues reduces protein thermal hysteresis activity and causes changes in morphology of the ice crystal (13Jia Z. DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The corresponding ice binding residues of the C domain of RD3 are Gln79, Asn84 (O′), Thr85, Ala86, Thr88, and Gln114 (Fig.4 a). It appears that the nonpolar side chain groups of Pro12, Thr15, Ala16, Thr18, Ile20, Met21, and Gly42 fill the gaps between the ice binding residues of the N domain. The corresponding residues of the C domain are Pro82, Thr85, Ala86, Thr88, Ile90, Met91, and Gly112. The location of these nonpolar residues in each domain is thought to stabilize the spaced polar groups and the planarity of the ice binding planes to achieve appropriate ice binding function (12Sönnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Structure. 1996; 15: 1325-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Jia Z. DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The side chain groups of the key ice binding residues Asn14 in the N domain, and the corresponding residue Asn84 in the C domain are located slightly behind the ice binding plane (Fig. 4 a). For the type III AFP monomer, Asn15 plays a pivotal role in initiation of binding to transition points between prism and basal ice planes (13Jia Z. DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The 9-residue linker of RD3 (residues 65–73) forms a bent structure, as found in RD3-Nl (20Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Odaira M. Nitta K. Tsuda S. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), that places the N and C domains in close proximity but does not allow for direct association. This short linker locates the two ice binding planes of each domain laterally with an angle of 32 ± 12° between the planes (Fig. 4, a and b). To our knowledge, this interdomain topology is structurally unique among smaller proteins (<30 kDa) that comprise two similarly sized domains. One well-known, small intramolecular dimer is calmodulin (148 residues), a dumbbell-shaped calcium regulatory protein. Calmodulin is composed of two homologous N- and C-terminal globular domains connected through a 28-residue linker that forms a long α-helix (23Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Disparate from RD3, the two homologous domains of calmodulin have no preferred orientation with respect to each other (24Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The domains have the propensity to come together and “grip” the target protein, much like two hands capturing a rope (25Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The N and C termini of RD3 (both type III AFP monomers) point to almost opposite directions in the ice-free state and presumably in the ice-bound state as well. On the other hand, the N and C termini of calmodulin point to nearly the same direction when bound to the target protein; i.e. the functional difference between RD3 and calmodulin may be ascribed to the difference in the interdomain topologies. The lateral orientation of the N- and C-terminal domains of RD3 directs the faces of two ice binding planes in nearly the same direction with a slight difference in their alignments. The ice binding plane of the N domain is located ∼3.5 Å behind that of the C domain in the minimized average structure (Fig. 4 a). This orientation of the two domains suggests that the C domain ice binding face of RD3 attaches to the ice crystal first, which follows the second attachment of the ice binding face of the N-domain in a cooperative manner. Presumably, the ice-bound form of RD3 would have the ice binding faces of each domain oriented nearly identically with respect to the ice surface. Indeed, an “aligned” form of RD3 was identified in one of the present solution structures (Fig. 4 b, thick blue rod). If a structural change occurs between ice-free and ice-bound states of RD3, it is likely that the conformation of the 9-residue linker changes between the two states. Consistent with a view of conformational flexibility between ice-free and ice-bound forms of RD3, greater flexibility for the backbone in the linker region was identified by15N NMR relaxation measurements, and fewer experimental NMR constraints were found compared with the structured regions (Fig.4 b). Manual docking of RD3 to ice indicated that interatomic distances between key atoms of ice binding residues of the two domains of RD3 form a close match to the spacing of water oxygen atoms in the ice {101̄0} prism plane of hexagonal ice crystal (Ih: c-axis = 7.361Å;a-axis = 4.507Å; Ref. 26Hobbs P.V. Ice Physics. Oxford University Press, London1974: 18-39Google Scholar). For example, the distance between the oxygen atoms of Thr88 and Ala86(CO) is 4.5 Å, and that of Ala86 and Gln114 is 7.4 Å. The corresponding residues in the N domain are Thr18, Ala16, and Gln44. These atoms are located in line in each domain and match the positions of three water oxygen atoms lined up in the 〈0001〉 direction. The placement of the C domain in this direction leads to the positioning of Asn84 (Fig. 4 a) at the intersection between the prism and basal planes of the ice crystal. These results are in good agreement with the ice-docking model proposed for type III AFP monomer (12Sönnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Structure. 1996; 15: 1325-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Jia Z. DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Assuming that the C domain binds ice first in the 〈0001〉 direction, one possible target ice surface for the N domain might be the same prism plane in the 〈0101〉 direction. Respective ice binding in the 〈0001〉 and 〈0101〉 directions would be in good agreement with the 32° difference in alignment of the two ice binding planes. In such an ice-bound model for RD3, close proximity is still identified between the oxygen atoms of the N domain plane and the water oxygen atoms in the prism plane. The positioning of the nonplanar residue Asn14 to the intersection between prism and basal planes is unexpected in this model because of steric hindrance by two globular domains. Note that the two ice binding planes can be manually aligned in the 〈0001〉 direction to achieve better interoxygen space matching of the two domains by adjustment of backbone φ/ψ angles of the linker sequence (residues 67–69). It is likely that the ice binding of the C domain induces the specific ice binding of the N domain to the prism surface. In addition, recent proposals implicate flatness of the ice binding plane and hydrophobicity as important determinants of ice binding (12Sönnichsen F.D. DeLuca C.I. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Structure. 1996; 15: 1325-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Jia Z. DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L.

J. 1998; 74: 2142-2151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These determinants are also expected to contribute to the specificity of ice binding of the N domain. DeLuca et al. (27DeLuca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) reported that genetically expressed type III AFP connected through the N terminus to thioredoxin (12 kDa) or maltose-binding protein (42 kDa) possess ∼2–3-fold higher antifreeze activity than type III AFP monomer on a molar basis. Thioredoxin and maltose-binding protein do not possess antifreeze activity, and the higher activities of the fusion proteins were ascribed to ∼3–8-fold wider coverage (without ice binding) of the ice surface. For RD3 we can assume just a 2-fold increase in coverage of the surface area compared with the monomer. Hence, the observed 5.9-fold increased activity of RD3 compared with the monomer cannot be explained on the basis of increased ice surface coverage of RD3 but can be explained on the basis of increased ice binding strength of the molecule. It is likely that the on rate for ice binding of the type III AFP monomer is a diffusion-controlled process. The same process is likely to dominate ice binding of the C domain of RD3, whereas the on rate of ice binding of the N domain is influenced by its close proximity to the ice surface because of initial ice binding of the C domain. Hence, the affinity of intact RD3 for ice would not be a simple sum of the affinity of two type III AFP monomers but, rather, would be greater than the sum of the monomer affinities, leading to the 6-fold activity enhancement of RD3. We conclude that specific ice binding of the two domains, guided by the unique structural topology of RD3, is an important factor in determination of the high antifreeze activity of RD3. The 9-residue linker presumably plays a key role in connecting the N- and C-terminal AFP domains laterally and potentially affords simultaneous ice binding of the two domains. An artificial AFP consisting of multiple type III AFP monomers connected through 9-residue linker sequences may possess highly enhanced antifreeze function compared with unconnected monomers of type III AFP.

New pathways for AdoMet or S-methylmethionine-dependent methionine synthesis are presented. S-adenosylmethionine 5′-methylthioadenosine S-methylmethionine 5′-methylthioribose-1-phosphate The sulfur amino acid methionine is a key player of intermediary metabolism; it is not only involved in protein synthesis but is also an essential determinant of the one-carbon metabolism. Indeed, under its activated form, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet),1 it is the methyl donor in hundreds of transmethylation reactions of nucleic acids, proteins, or lipids. Furthermore, AdoMet serves as a precursor for biosynthesis of polyamines and is the substrate used for numerous reactions, including vitamin biosyntheses and nucleotide modifications. Therefore AdoMet is believed to be next to ATP for the number of reactions in which a biological compound is used (1Cantoni G.L. Salvatore F. Borek E. Zappia V. Williams-Ashman H.G. Schlenk F. The Biochemistry of S-Adenosylmethionine. Columbia University Press, New York1977: 557-577Google Scholar). Giving such ubiquitous functions, the equilibrium between methionine and AdoMet is thus expected to be of a crucial importance for the overall cellular homeostasis. Accordingly it has been known for a long time, owing to both in vitro and in vivo studies, that numerous transformed cells and tumors exhibit a methionine-dependence phenotype (2Hoshiya Y. Kubota T. Inada T. Kitajima M. Hoffman R.M. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 4371-4375PubMed Google Scholar). In eucaryotic cells, the methionine/AdoMet ratio was thought to be largely controlled through two recycling pathways that act on the products of AdoMet catabolism. The first pathway, called the methyl cycle, allows the conversion ofS-adenosylhomocysteine, the by-product of all transmethylations, into homocysteine, which is next remethylated into methionine by the methionine synthase, a cobalamin-dependent enzyme in mammalian cells. The second pathway comprises a set of complex reactions that allow the direct synthesis of methionine from 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a compound formed during polyamine biosynthesis, for instance. In this spectacular pathway (called the MTA cycle), the ribose moiety of the adenosyl group gives rise to the four-carbon skeleton of methionine while conserving the methylthiol group (3Cornell K.A. Winter R.W. Tower P.A. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine to which extent each recycling pathway contributes to methionine salvage in the model eucaryoteSaccharomyces cerevisiae. The budding yeast is an especially suitable organism for such a study since it is capable of taking up and metabolizing a large number of either inorganic or organic sulfur compounds (reviewed in Ref. 4Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Especially, S. cerevisiaecells possess a membrane permease specific for AdoMet (5Spence K.D.

Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Since the methyl cycle is interrupted in such mutant cells, this result indicates either that the MTA cycle is sufficient to provide enough methionine to the cells or that there exists another unknown pathway allowing the synthesis of methionine from AdoMet. Here we present evidences that the latter hypothesis is correct, and we identify the involved enzymes and their corresponding genes, which appear to exist in other eucaryotic organisms.

To isolate strains permeable to purine nucleosides, 6 × 108cells from strain EMY60 (ade2, ade3) were plated on minimal medium containing 1 mm adenosine. 13 spontaneous mutants capable of growing on this medium were isolated. After purification, two mutants able to use adenosine as an adenine source were studied. Genetic analysis showed that they carried different mutations that we called ado8-1 andado12-1. Strains bearingado8-1 and ado12-1mutations were crossed to a strain bearing a meu1disruption, and the phenotype of ado8-1,meu1Δ and of ado12-1,meu1Δ strains was studied.

In S. cerevisiae, the methionine synthase is encoded by theMET6 gene (18Csaikl U. Csaikl F. Gene. 1986; 46: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19Mountain H.A. Bystrom A.S. Larsen J.T. Korch C. Yeast. 1991; 7: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Contrary to its mammalian counterpart, the yeast Met6 protein is thought to be a cobalamin-independent enzyme. Accordingly, S. cerevisiae cells do not need vitamin B12 for growth, although they are unable to synthesize this compound (19Mountain H.A. Bystrom A.S. Larsen J.T. Korch C. Yeast. 1991; 7: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Burton E. Selhub J. Sakami W. Biochem. J. 1969; 111: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Hansen J. Cherest H. Kielland-Brandt M.C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since there exists some evidence that cobalamin-independent methionine synthases are rather inefficient enzymes (for a review, see Ref. 22Old I.G. Phillips S.E. Stockley P.G. Saint Girons I. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 56: 145-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we searched data bases to determine whether the yeast genome might encode more than one methionine synthase, as in E. coli. Indeed, E. coli possesses two methionine synthases, encoded by theMetE and MetH genes. We thus made a search against the yeast genomic data base for proteins exhibiting similarities to the E. coli cobalamin-dependent MetH enzyme. Results showed that two open reading frames,YLL062c and YPL273w, encode proteins sharing extensive similarities to the amino-terminal part of MetHp (24% and 23% identical residues, respectively, Fig. 1). The Yll062 and Ypl273 proteins (323- and 325-amino acid residues, respectively) are two highly homologous proteins (201 identical residues) of unknown function. The possibility that Yll062 and Ypl273 proteins could be methyltransferases was further supported by the fact that they both exhibit sequence similarities to the E. coli YagD gene product, a thiol/selenol methyltransferase (23Neuhierl B. Thanbichler M. Lottspiech F. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5407-5414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, a striking observation made the two proteins, Yll062p and Ypl273p, attractive candidates for new methionine metabolism-related enzymes: their encoding genes are, respectively, adjacent to theMMP1 and SAM3 genes, which have been demonstrated to encode the SMM and AdoMet high affinity permeases, respectively (6Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28096-28105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that S. cerevisiaeis capable of using SMM as a sulfur source, but no clue as to the utilization pathway was provided (6Rouillon A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Thomas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28096-28105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The above described results led us to test whether Yll062p or Ypl273p might be implicated in the utilization of AdoMet and SMM as sulfur sources. We therefore constructed heterozygous diploid cells bearing a deleted allele of either the YLL062c or the YPL273w gene (see “Material and Methods”). Both diploids were sporulated, and the resulting progenies were analyzed for their abilities of using various sulfur sources. In both cases, all the spores were capable of utilizing sulfate as a sulfur source, demonstrating that neither deletion impaired the assimilative synthesis of methionine from sulfate. In contrast, a perfect 2+/2− segregation was observed in the presence of SMM, used as a sulfur source for the progeny of the yll062Δ/YLL062 diploid. All the spores that could not grow on SMM were the yll062Δ spores. By contrast, sporulation of the ypl273Δ/YPL273diploid showed that all ypl273Δ cells were capable of growing in the presence of SMM. Therefore, a functional Yll062p appears to be specifically required for SMM metabolism. Analysis of both progenies for growth in the presence of AdoMet showed that, although the yll062Δ spores are capable of using this compound, ypl273Δ cells exhibit a strong growth defect in the presence of AdoMet. Thus, Ypl273p appears to be specifically involved in AdoMet metabolism. These results were corroborated by analyzing the phenotype of yll062Δ,ypl273Δ double mutant cells: these are unable to use SMM as a sulfur source. Moreover, the double-disrupted strain is strictly unable to grow in the presence of AdoMet while retaining the capacity of growing in the presence of methionine as a sulfur source (Fig. 2). Taken together, sequence homologies and phenotype of the mutant cells suggested that the Yll062 and Ypl273 proteins would be SMM and AdoMet methyltransferases, respectively. A literature survey revealed that, 36 years ago, a partial purification of a methyltransferase from S. cerevisiae capable of using either AdoMet or SMM as methyl donor was reported (24Shapiro S.K. Yphantis D.A. Almenas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1551-1556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was shown to catalyze the transfer of the methyl group from either AdoMet or SMM to homocysteine. We therefore assayed AdoMet- and SMM-homocysteine methyltransferases activities in wild-type, yll062Δ, andypl273Δ cells. Results (see Table III) show that neither AdoMet- nor SMM-homocysteine methyltransferase activities can be detected in extracts of yll062Δ, ypl273Δ double mutant cells, whereas extracts of wild-type cells do contain high levels of both enzymatic activities. In accord with the phenotype of the single mutant cells, the ypl273Δ single mutation (strain CY49-1B) leads to a very low level of AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase activity, whereas SMM-homocysteine methyltransferase activity is comparable with the activity measured in wild type cells. Conversely, the yll062Δ single mutation (strain CY51-1A) results in a strong decrease of the SMM-homocysteine methyltransferase activity as compared with a wild-type strain. However, the yll062Δ mutation also decreases the AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase activity. This latter result suggests that Yll062 protein could function to some extent with AdoMet as a substrate; we measured its apparent Km for AdoMet by using an extract of strain CY49-1B (ypl273Δ). This allowed us to demonstrate that in vitro, Yll062p exhibits an AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase activity, but with an apparent Km for AdoMet 20-fold higher than that of Ypl273p.Table IIIGrowth requirements of different mutant strainsStrainRelevant genotypeAddition to YNB complete medium 3-aComplete YNB medium contains histidine, leucine, uracile, adenine, and tryptophan.Met 3-bMet, 0.1 mml-methionine; AdoMet, 0.1 mm AdoMet.AdoMet 3-bMet, 0.1 mml-methionine; AdoMet, 0.1 mm AdoMet.Met + AdoMet 3-bMet, 0.1 mml-methionine; AdoMet, 0.1 mm AdoMet.CY61–1Amet6Δ+++CY61–1Dmet6Δ, sam4Δ,mht1Δ+−+W744–1Asam1Δ,sam2Δ−++CC974–5Cmet6Δ,sam1Δ, sam2Δ−++CY69–14Cmet6Δ, sam1Δ,sam2Δ, sam4Δ,mht1Δ−−+3-a Complete YNB medium contains histidine, leucine, uracile, adenine, and tryptophan.3-b Met, 0.1 mml-methionine; AdoMet, 0.1 mm AdoMet.

As expected, in both cases, the obtained transformants were capable of growing in the presence of either SMM or AdoMet, used as sulfur source (not shown). The SMM- and AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase activities were assayed in extracts of the transformants. As shown in Table II, whenypl273Δ mutant cells are transformed with plasmid pP273, AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase activity is restored to the wild-type level, whereas when yll062Δ cells are transformed with plasmid pL062, the SMM-homocysteine methyltransferase activity is equivalent to that measured in wild-type cells. Interestingly, in the latter case, the AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase activity is increased 2-fold as compared with untransformed yll062Δ cells, a result in accord with the low AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase activity displayed by the Yll062 protein.Table IISpecific activity of AdoMet- and SMM-homocysteine methyltransferase in different mutant strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSpecific activity of methyltransferasesAdoMet-HCSMM-HCW303–1A0.61.6CY49–1Bypl273∷URA3<0.052.7CY49–1Bypl273∷URA3, pL2730.672.4CY51–1Ayll062∷HIS30.150.20CY51–1Ayll062∷HIS3, pL0620.352.2CY55–5Aypl273∷URA3, yll062∷HIS3<0.05<0.05The activities are expressed as nmol of substrate transformed min/nmol of substrate transformed min/mg of protein.

Taken together, all these results demonstrate that theYPL273w gene encodes an AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase and the YLL062c gene encodes a SMM-homocysteine methyltransferase. Although Ypl273p appears to be highly specific for AdoMet, Ypl062p is less specific, capable of transferring the methyl group of SMM to homocysteine but also the methyl group of AdoMet, provided that the concentration of this latter is high. Thus, the YPL273w gene was namedSAM4, and the YLL062c gene was namedMHT1 (S-methylmethioninehomocysteine methyltransferase), according to the standard yeast genetic nomenclature. Recently, two enzymes exhibiting SMM-homocysteine methyltransferase activity have been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. Both plant enzymes are capable of utilizing SMM and AdoMet as methyl donors in vitro. In addition, the expression of either enzyme has been shown to restore growth on SMM and on AdoMet of yeast sam4Δ,mht1Δ mutant cells, showing that, contrary to the yeast enzymes, the plant methyltransferases exhibit no substrate specificity (17Ranocha P. Bourgis F. Ziemak M.J. Rhodes D. Gage D.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15962-15968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When yeast cells are grown in the presence of a high concentration of extracellular methionine (1 mm), transcription of most of the genes involved in methionine biosynthesis is repressed (4Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). This transcriptional regulation is mediated by the SCFMet30 complex, a ubiquitin ligase that triggers the degradation of the transcriptional activator Met4p in response to high extracellular methionine (25Rouillon A. Barbey R. Patton E.E. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 292-294Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The 5′-upstream region of theSAM4 gene lacks the DNA consensus regulatory sequences on which the Met4p activator is recruited to activate the transcription of the MET genes (4Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). To determine by Northern blot whetherSAM4 gene expression is modified by the presence of high concentrations of extracellular methionine, a wild-type strain was first grown in the presence of glutathione, a non-repressive sulfur source and transferred to a medium containing 1 mm ofl-methionine, and RNAs were extracted at regular time intervals after the shift. The result shows that, contrary to the methionine biosynthetic genes, transcription of the SAM4gene increases in response to high extracellular methionine (Fig. 3). In contrast to the SAM4 gene, the 5′-upstream region of theMHT1 gene does contain the AAACTGTGG motif (at position −179), the DNA binding site of the Met4-Met28-Met31(Met32) complexes. These complexes are part of the high molecular weight complexes that are assembled in the 5′-upstream regions of the methionine biosynthetic genes and are responsible for their transcriptional activation in the absence of high extracellular methionine. To determine whetherMHT1 gene expression is indeed regulated as the “classical” MET genes, Northern blots used in the above-described experiment were analyzed with a MHT1 probe. The results (Fig. 3) show that the expression of the MHT1gene is indeed repressed when cells are grown in the presence of a high concentration of extracellular methionine. To further confirm the involvement of the transcriptional regulator Met4p in MHT1gene expression, we assayed met4Δ cells for their capacities of using SMM as a sulfur source. As shown in Fig. 4, met4Δ cells do not grow in the presence of SMM, whereas they do grow in the presence of AdoMet. As noted in the introduction, this study was aimed to decipher which pathways allow yeast cells to synthesize methionine from AdoMet in the absence of the methionine synthase encoded by the MET6 gene. Given the above-reported identification and characterization of theSAM4 and MHT1 genes, we wondered whether their encoded products might be responsible for methionine synthesis inmet6Δ cells. We therefore recombined themet6Δ mutation with the sam4Δ andmht1Δ mutations. Phenotypic analyses showed that, in contrast to the parental met6Δ mutant cells, themet6Δ, sam4Δ, mht1Δ triple mutant cells are unable to use AdoMet as a methionine source. To further confirm this result, we next used cells in which both methionine synthase, Met6p, and AdoMet synthases, Sam1p and Sam2p, were lacking (26Thomas D. Rothstein R. Rosenberg N. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5132-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As met6Δ cells, the met6Δ,sam1Δ, sam2Δ cells are capable of using AdoMet to synthesize methionine. In contrast, themet6Δ, sam1Δ , sam2Δ ,sam4Δ, mht1Δ quintuple mutant requires both methionine and AdoMet to grow. Therefore, in the absence of theMET6-encoded methionine synthase or in the presence of extracellular AdoMet, S. cerevisiae cells synthesize methionine from AdoMet due to the Sam4p and Mht1p activities (TableIII). One additional outcome of the above experiments was that, if the MTA salvage pathway exists in yeast, it is not capable by itself of providing sufficient methionine for the cell growth whatever the concentration of AdoMet. To address this issue, we next performed two successive sets of experiments. First, we tried to determine whether S. cerevisiae cells can use MTA as the methionine source. Since wild-type S. cerevisiae cells do not normally transport nucleosides, we searched for mutations that render the cells capable of transporting these compounds. This was done by searching for cells capable of using adenosine as the adenine source. Two mutations, calledado8-1 and ado12-1, were selected (see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting strains were shown to be able both to use adenosine as a source of adenine and to use MTA as a source of both methionine and cysteine (TableIV). This result thus suggested that a MTA salvage pathway may exist in yeast. However, it must be noted that the concentration of MTA required to sustain the cell growth was very high (5 mm), leaving the possibility that the observed growth may be due to MTA contamination. A second genetic approach was therefore used to strengthen these results.Table IVUtilization of various sulfur and adenine source by different mutant cellsStrainRelevant genotypeaddition to B medium 4-aB medium (7) contains histidine, leucine, uracile, and tryptophan. ade, adenine (0.3 mm); ado, adenosine (1 mm); HC,dl-homocysteine (0.2 mm); MTA, methylthioadenosine (5 mm).ade + HCado + HCade + MTAHC + MTAW303–1AMEU1, ADO8, ADO12+−−−MDY14meu1Δ, ADO8, ADO12+−−−CY85–3CMEU1, ADO8, ado12–1++++CY85–8Bmeu1Δ, ADO8, ado12–1++−−CY92–5AMEU1, ado8–1, ADO12++++CY92–2Ameu1Δ ado8–1, ADO12++−−4-a B medium (7Cherest H.

Open table in a new tab In mammalian cells, the first committed step of the MTA salvage pathway is the cleavage of MTA by the MTA phosphorylase, yielding 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate and adenine (27Backlund Jr., P.S. Smith R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1533-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Backlund Jr., P.S. Smith R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We thus searched the yeast genomic data base for proteins exhibiting similarities to the human MTA phosphorylase. Results showed that the yeast genome comprises one gene, called MEU1, whose product is highly related to the human MTA phosphorylase. The MEU1 gene had been first isolated by Donoviel and Young (29Donoviel M.S. Young E.T. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a gene whose mutation impairs the regulation of the ADH2 gene expression, but no information was further gained about the exact function of its encoded product. A meu1Δ strain was then crossed with anado8-1 or an ado12-1mutant. Phenotype analysis of the resulting recombinant mutant cells showed that, in contrast to their parental strains, bothmeu1Δ, ado8-1 andmeu1Δ, ado12-1 were unable to use MTA as sulfur source. As expected, the two strains retained the ability to use adenosine as a source of adenine (Table IV). Taken together, all our results strongly suggest that, although the MTA cycle is functional in S. cerevisiae, its activity cannot recycle sufficient AdoMet into methionine to sustain growth of the cells when the methionine synthase Met6p is lacking. The here reported identification and functional characterization of the two new genes SAM4 and MHT1 shed new light on the methionine biosynthetic pathways in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The SAM4 and MHT1 genes were identified through the sequence homology of their encoded products to the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase from E. coli. Both genes were highly similar, sharing around 60% of identical residues. Biochemical assays performed with cells that do not express the Sam4 and/or Mht1 proteins conclusively demonstrate that both proteins are capable of catalyzing the direct methylation of homocysteine. Although Sam4p appears to function exclusively with AdoMet as a substrate, Mht1p is less specific, capable of transferring to homocysteine the methyl group of either SMM or AdoMet, but with a high apparent Km for the latter. In accord with these functional assignations, the sam4Δ cells are specifically impaired in AdoMet utilization, whereas themht1Δ cells are unable to grow on SMM used as sulfur source. The identification of Mht1p as the yeast SMM-homocysteine methyltransferase as well as the phenotype of the mht1Δ cells demonstrate that in yeast, SMM catabolism occurs through only one pathway that is identical to the one found in bacteria, plants, and mammals (16Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Neuhierl B. Thanbichler M. Lottspiech F. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5407-5414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To date, SMM synthesis is known to exist in plants only, where it is synthesized from methionine and AdoMet and where it serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (30Dickson D.M.J. Wyn Jones R.G. Davenport J. Planta. 1980; 150: 158-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Dickson D.M.J. Kirst G.O. Planta. 1986; 167: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Trossat C. Rathinasabapathi B. Weretilnyk E.A. Shen T.-L. Huang Z.-H. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since the natural biotope of yeasts is leaves and fruits, it is therefore not unexpected that yeast cells have evolved a system that allows them to utilize SMM of plant origin as an alternative methionine source. Strikingly, on the yeast genome, the MHT1 gene is clustered with the MMP1gene, which encodes the high affinity SMM permease. The two genes are divergent, separated by a short intergenic region of 343 base pairs, which contains one of the two cis-acting sequences regulating the MET gene network. Accordingly, Northern blot assays demonstrated that MHT1 gene is regulated as the otherMET genes, repressed when the cells are grown in the presence of high extracellular methionine. Furthermore, transcription activation of both the MHT1 and MMP1 genes appears to require the Met4p activator 2E. E. Patton and M. Tyers, personal communication. as do most of theMET genes, a result corroborated by the inability ofmet4Δ cells to grow on SMM as a sulfur source. The identification of the SAM4 gene, encoding the AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase, uncovered that the genes specific for AdoMet utilization are also clustered in the S. cerevisiae genome. The SAM4 gene is adjacent to theSAM3 gene, which has been shown to encode the high affinity AdoMet permease. Since the permease-encoding genes (MMP1 andSAM3), on one hand, and the homocysteine methyltransferase-encoding genes (MHT1 and SAM4), on the other, form two pairs of highly similar genes, it is tempting to postulate that the two clusters have arisen through the duplication of an ancestral cluster. However, this hypothetical duplication event would have been followed by one or several recombination events, since, contrary to the MHT1 and MMP1 genes, which are divergent, the SAM3 and the SAM4 genes are transcribed in the same direction. In contrast to the MHT1 gene, transcription of theSAM4 gene is induced by growth in the presence of high extracellular methionine. Accordingly, neither the 5′-upstream region of SAM4 contains the cis-acting regulatoryMET sequences nor the growth of the met4Δ cells is impaired on AdoMet. At first view, it might appear surprising that, in the presence of high extracellular methionine, yeast cells repress SMM but not AdoMet utilization, as the remethylation of homocysteine by SMM releases two methionine molecules, whereas only one is formed when AdoMet is used. However, it must be stressed that homocysteine is only needed at a catalytic level for AdoMet-dependent methylation. Indeed the reaction also producesS-adenosylhomocysteine, which in turn is converted into homocysteine by the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (Fig. 5 B). Since homocysteine synthesis from sulfate is completely abrogated in the presence of high extracellular methionine as a consequence of the sulfate assimilation pathway repression, the use of SMM would be only achieved through the expensive and complete ATP dephosphorylation required for the de novo AdoMet-dependent synthesis of homocysteine (Fig. 5 A). Identification of the AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase-encoding gene led to the unexpected finding that, contrary to what was previously thought, neither the methyl cycle nor the MTA salvage pathways account for the majority of AdoMet recycling into methionine in yeast cells. Compelling evidences supporting this view are provided by the phenotypes of the sam4Δ, mht1Δ cells that are unable to grow on AdoMet as well as by the fact that, contrary to met6Δ cells that lack methionine synthase, recombinantmet6Δ, sam4Δ, mht1Δ mutants lose the faculty of using AdoMet as methionine source. Moreover, the observed induction of the SAM4 gene expression in response to high extracellular methionine lends further support to the notion that the Sam4p AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferase plays a major role in the control of the equilibrium between methionine and AdoMet in yeast cells. AdoMet-dependent homocysteine methylation appears to be a propitious mean to get such control, since this reaction is of low energy cost, uses catalytic amounts of homocysteine, and is, independent of the folate biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 5 C) As noted in the Introduction, it is well established that about 50% of the human tumor cells exhibit a methionine-dependent phenotype growth. Contrary to normal cells, which are capable of using homocysteine or methionine to meet their requirement in sulfur amino acids, these tumor cells only grow in the presence of methionine. Accordingly, it was shown that athymic mice that are grafted with human cancers and fed a methionine-free diet are greatly reduced in their tumor burden (33Kokkinakis D.M. Schold Jr., S.C. Hori H. Nobori T. Nutr. Cancer. 1997; 29: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The metabolic basis for this phenotype is not understood and appears not to result from alterations in the cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase that catalyze the folate-dependent methylation of homocysteine ( (34Malinow M.R. Nieto F.J. Kruger W.D. Duell P.B. Hess D.L. Gluckman R.A. Block P.C. Holzgang C.R. Anderson P.H. Seltzer D. Upson B. Lin Q.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Regarding the here-reported role of the AdoMet-homocysteine methyltransferases in yeast cells, it would be of great interest to determine the status of these enzymes in human tumor cells. A Blast search against the Drosophila genome revealed that it contains two genes whose products are highly similar to the Sam4 and Mht1 proteins (Fig. 6), a result supporting the notion that such enzymes would be universal and not restricted to the bacterial or fungal kingdoms. Surprisingly, theDrosophila genome, under its published form, does not comprise a gene whose product is homologous to either the cobalamin-dependent synthase from human and E. coli cells or to the cobalamin-independent methionine synthase from yeast. The diversity of the enzymes providing cells with methionine could be therefore much more larger than previously anticipated. We are indebted to Dr. E. T. Young for the generous gift of strain MDY14."
https://openalex.org/W2040316218,"Positively charged plastocyanin from Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The reactivity of its mutants toward photosystem I was analyzed by laser flash spectroscopy. Replacement of arginine at position 88, which is adjacent to the copper ligand His-87, by glutamine and, in particular, by glutamate makes plastocyanin reduce its availability for transferring electrons to photosystem I. Such a residue in the copper protein thus appears to be isofunctional with Arg-64 (which is close to the heme group) in cytochrome c6 from Anabaena(Molina-Heredia, F. P., Dı́az-Quintana, A., Hervás, M., Navarro, J. A., and De la Rosa, M. A. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 33565–33570) and Synechocystis (De la Cerda, B., Dı́az-Quintana, A., Navarro, J. A., Hervás, M., and De la Rosa, M. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 13292–13297). Other mutations concern specific residues of plastocyanin either at its positively charged east face (D49K, H57A, H57E, K58A, K58E, Y83A, and Y83F) or at its north hydrophobic pole (L12A, K33A, and K33E). Mutations altering the surface electrostatic potential distribution allow the copper protein to modulate its kinetic efficiency: the more positively charged the interaction site, the higher the rate constant. Whereas replacement of Tyr-83 by either alanine or phenylalanine has no effect on the kinetics of photosystem I reduction, Leu-12 and Lys-33 are essential for the reactivity of plastocyanin. Positively charged plastocyanin from Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The reactivity of its mutants toward photosystem I was analyzed by laser flash spectroscopy. Replacement of arginine at position 88, which is adjacent to the copper ligand His-87, by glutamine and, in particular, by glutamate makes plastocyanin reduce its availability for transferring electrons to photosystem I. Such a residue in the copper protein thus appears to be isofunctional with Arg-64 (which is close to the heme group) in cytochrome c6 from Anabaena(Molina-Heredia, F. P., Dı́az-Quintana, A., Hervás, M., Navarro, J. A., and De la Rosa, M. A. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 33565–33570) and Synechocystis (De la Cerda, B., Dı́az-Quintana, A., Navarro, J. A., Hervás, M., and De la Rosa, M. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 13292–13297). Other mutations concern specific residues of plastocyanin either at its positively charged east face (D49K, H57A, H57E, K58A, K58E, Y83A, and Y83F) or at its north hydrophobic pole (L12A, K33A, and K33E). Mutations altering the surface electrostatic potential distribution allow the copper protein to modulate its kinetic efficiency: the more positively charged the interaction site, the higher the rate constant. Whereas replacement of Tyr-83 by either alanine or phenylalanine has no effect on the kinetics of photosystem I reduction, Leu-12 and Lys-33 are essential for the reactivity of plastocyanin. plastocyanin cytochrome c6 photosystem I wild-type Plastocyanin (Pc),1 a small single copper protein, and cytochrome c6(Cyt), a monoheme protein, function as alternative mobile electron carriers between the two membrane complexes b6 f and photosystem I (PSI) (cf.

The isoelectric point of Pc and Cyt varies widely depending on the organism; the two molecules exhibit the same value of ∼9 in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 (4Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Their respective three-dimensional structures have repeatedly been solved using proteins from different organisms, and their structure-function relationships have been comparatively analyzed. In Pc, which was investigated first, two active sites were identified: site 1 (or the so-called north hydrophobic pole), located in a flat region around the copper ligand His-87, and site 2 (or the so-called east face), which is referred to as the acidic patch in eukaryotic organisms because it includes aspartic and glutamic residues at positions 42–45 and 59–61 surrounding the solvent-exposed Tyr-83 (1Gross E.L. Ort D.R. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 413-429Google Scholar, 2Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 11-22Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that site 2 is responsible for the electrostatic interactions with cytochrome f and PSI, whereas site 1, in particular His-87, is involved in electron transfer itself (3Hope A.B.

We have recently reported that Cyt from Synechocystis (6De la Cerda B. Dı́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Anabaena (7Molina-Heredia F.P. Dı́az-Quintana A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33565-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) possesses two areas equivalent to those of Pc: site 1, which is a hydrophobic region at the edge of the heme pocket providing the contact surface for electron transfer, and site 2, which is a charged patch driving the electrostatic movement toward its two membrane-anchored partners. Our mutagenesis studies of these two cyanobacterial Cyts revealed the existence of a highly conserved arginine residue at position 64, which is located on the protein surface at the frontier between sites 1 and 2, very close to the heme group, that is essential for electron transfer to PSI (6De la Cerda B.

Arg-64 is the only arginine residue in Anabaena Cyt, as is Arg-88 in Anabaena Pc. Arg-64 in Cyt could thus be the counterpart of Arg-88 in Pc. Another peculiarity of Pc and Cyt from Anabaena, as compared with the proteins from other sources, is their high isoelectric point (see above) because of their high lysine content. In fact, site 2 is positively charged in both Pc and Cyt, whereas it is typically negative in other cyanobacteria and, in particular, in higher plants (2Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 11-22Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Considering that it is site 2 that mainly drives the attractive movement of these two mobile metalloproteins toward the membrane complexes, it was of interest to investigate in Anabaena Pc (as previously done in Cyt) how the surface electrostatic potential distribution and redox kinetics are altered by mutations. This work was thus aimed at comparing the role of specific amino acids in Anabaena Pc with those of its counterpart Cyt from the same organism. Pc was modified by mutagenesis of specific residues either at site 1 or site 2, with special attention being paid to Arg-88. The kinetic mechanism of PSI reduction by mutant Pcs was analyzed by laser flash absorption spectroscopy. Pc from Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 was purified as described previously (8Medina M. Dı́az A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Gómez-Moreno C. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with the following two exceptions. i) Pc samples were applied onto the CM-cellulose column after oxidation with potassium ferricyanide, and ii) elution of the adsorbed proteins was performed with a linear gradient of 2–30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 μm potassium ferricyanide. Pc concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an absorption coefficient of 4.5 mm−1cm−1 at 597 nm for the oxidized protein (9Hervás M. Navarro F. Navarro J.A. Chávez S. Dı́az A. Florencio F.J. De la Rosa M.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mutant petE genes were constructed by the polymerase chain reaction with the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) using oligonucleotides of 26–38 bases, 15 ng of DNA templates, and 16 cycles of 12 min in extension time. The construction for the Anabaena petE gene previously described was used as a template (4Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments were sequenced to check the mutations. Other molecular biology protocols were standard (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformed cells of Escherichia coliMC1061 were grown in a 40-liter fermentor (Biostat C, B. Braun Biotech) at 37 °C for 18 h under aerobic conditions. The fermentor was filled with 20 liters of standard Luria-Bertani medium (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 200 μmCuSO4. The air flow was adjusted automatically to keep the concentration of dissolved oxygen at ∼95% of its saturation value. The culture was stirred at 250 rpm. The pH value was kept constant at ∼6.0 by addition of small amounts of 1 n HCl. To prevent loss of the expression vector, E. coli cells were transformed and immediately used to inoculate the reactor. Cells were collected by tangential filtration in a Sartocon cross-flow filtration system (Sartorius), and the periplasmic fraction was extracted by freezing the cell paste at −20 °C. The frozen cell paste was resuspended in 100 ml of deionized water and centrifuged. The resulting suspension was extensively dialyzed against 2 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with the exception of mutants K33E, H57E, K58E, and R88E, which were dialyzed against 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. From this point on, the purification procedure for most of the mutants was identical to that for native Pc, with minor changes in elution gradients. The mutants K33E, H57E, and K58E were applied onto a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 2 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. Elution of the adsorbed proteins was performed with a linear gradient of 0–100 mm NaCl in the same buffer. R88E was purified by gel filtration in a Sephadex G-50 column. In all cases, 50 μm potassium ferricyanide was added to the gradient buffers to keep Pc oxidized. Protein concentration was determined as described above. The redox potential value for each Pc mutant was determined as reported previously (4Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 11Ortega J.M. Hervás M. Losada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 199: 239-243Google Scholar) by following the differential absorbance changes at 597 minus 500 nm. Errors in the experimental determinations were less than 10 mV. PSI particles were isolated from Anabaena cells by β-dodecyl maltoside solubilization (12Hervás M. Ortega J.M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Bottin H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 235-241Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Rögner M. Nixon P.J. Dinner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chlorophyll:P700 ratio of the resulting PSI preparations was ∼140:1. The P700 content in PSI samples was calculated from the photoinduced absorbance changes at 820 nm using the absorption coefficient of 6.5 mm−1cm−1 determined by Mathis and Sétif (14Mathis P. Sétif P. Isr. J. Chem. 1981; 21: 316-320Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration was determined according to the method of Arnon (15Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetics of flash-induced absorbance changes in PSI were followed at 820 nm as described previously (16Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture and other experimental conditions have been reported (17De la Cerda B. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10125-10130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The buffer used throughout this work was 20 mm Tricine/KOH, pH 7.5. Data collection, as well as kinetic and thermodynamic analyses, were carried out as reported previously (16Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 18Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2693-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Apparent thermodynamic parameters were estimated as in Dı́az et al. (19Dı́az A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) by fitting the experimental data to the equation of Watkins et al.(20Watkins J.A. Cusanovich M.A. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Experimental errors were less than 10% for both the kinetic constants and thermodynamic parameters. Structure and surface electrostatic potential distribution of Pc mutants were modeled using the Swiss-Pdb Viewer program (21Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9493) Google Scholar). The solution structure of reduced Pc from Anabaena variabilis (22Badsberg U. Jørgensen A.M.M. Gesmar H. Led J.J. Hammerstad J.M. Jespersen L.-L. Ulstrup J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7021-7031Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whose amino acid sequence exhibits 100% identity with that of Pc from Anabaena sp. PCC 7119, was used as a template. The quality of the modeled structures for each Pc mutant was tested using the PROCHECK program (23Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Seven residues of Anabaena Pc were chosen to be mutated, two at the north hydrophobic patch and five at the east charged area (Fig. 1). The steric hindrance and nature of interactions at site 1 were investigated by replacing Leu-12 by Ala, and Lys-33 by Ala or Glu. The functional equivalence of site 2 in Anabaena Pc and in the negatively charged copper proteins was analyzed by substituting residues at positions 49, 57, and 58; Asp-49 was replaced by Lys, and both His-57 and Lys-58 were replaced by either Ala or Glu. Tyr-83 was changed to Ala and Phe to check whether Tyr-83 is involved in redox reactions, a role that was first proposed by He et al.(24He S. Modi S. Bendall D.S. Gray J.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) but later discarded by Bendall et al. (25Bendall D.S. Wagner M.J. Scharlab B. Söllick T.-R. Ubbink M. Howe C.J. Peschek G.A. Löffelhardt W. Schmetterer G. The Phototrophic Prokaryotes. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 315-328Crossref Google Scholar) in other Pcs. Our analysis of all primary sequences of Pcs deposited at the Protein Data Bank with the BLAST search program (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Scgäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59329) Google Scholar) revealed that Arg-88 is conserved in cyanobacteria but not in higher plants or in green algae. The reason for such conservation of Arg-88 in cyanobacterial but not in eukaryotic Pcs was thus investigated by replacing Arg-88 with either glutamine, as it is in spinach, or with glutamate. Neither the electronic absorption spectrum nor the midpoint redox potential of Anabaena Pc was altered by the mutations mentioned above, thereby revealing that the copper center was not distorted. As shown in Table I, the only exceptions were the R88E and K33E mutants, whose midpoint redox potential values are 25–30 mV lower than that of WT Pc.Table IMidpoint redox potential (E m) of wild-type and mutant plastocyanins, as well as bimolecular rate constants and activation parameters for the overall reaction of PSI reduction by the different copper proteinsPlastocyaninEm , pH 7.0kbim × 10−7kinf × 10−6ΔG ‡ΔH ‡ΔS ‡mVm −1 s −1m −1 s −1kJ mol −1kJ mol −1J mol −1 K −1Wild-type3557.685.9627.936.227.7Mutants at the east face R88E3250.32ND1-aND, not determined, because this mutant shows a kbim independent of ionic strength.35.936.52.1 R88Q3360.995.7833.041.433.0 D49K3539.736.2927.535.326.2 H57A3451.706.0931.739.124.7 H57E3413.765.9429.639.332.5 K58A3463.033.4830.341.136.3 K58E3391.594.1931.742.937.4 Y83A3404.446.1829.344.049.2 Y83F3434.735.2229.134.016.5Mutants at the north pole L12A3711.370.8432.231.0−4.2 K33A3552.553.7530.740.231.9 K33E3301.353.1032.241.932.31-a ND, not determined, because this mutant shows a kbim independent of ionic strength. Open table in a new tab The kinetic profile of PSI reduction under standard conditions was monoexponential with all mutants, as it is with WT Pc (16Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but the rate constants varied greatly. The observed pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) of PSI reduction by any mutant is linearly dependent on Pc concentration, as is the case with the WT molecule (Fig. 2). This finding can be interpreted by assuming that there is no formation of a detectable transient complex between PSI and Pc, in agreement with a collisional kinetic model (3Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 16Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The bimolecular rate constant for the overall reaction (kbim) can be calculated under standard conditions from the linear plots of kobs versus Pc concentration. Table I shows that most mutants yield kbim values smaller than WT Pc, with the exception of D49K, which exhibits a higher reactivity, and the two mutants at Tyr-83, which are slightly affected. As expected, all mutants of the hydrophobic patch suffer a significant decrease in their kbim value. Electrostatic mutations at positions 33, 57, and 58 cause Anabaena Pc to decrease its availability to reduce PSI as much as its global charge is made more negative. Major changes are obtained with the Arg-88 mutants, because replacement of Arg-88 with glutamine or glutamate induces a decrease in kbim of ∼8 and 24 times, respectively (TableI). Fig. 2 shows how inefficient the R88Q and R88E mutants are, even at high concentrations, compared with the WT molecule. Taking into account the electrostatic nature of the interactions between Pc and PSI, a detailed analysis of the effect of ionic strength on kbim was performed. The kbim values of WT Pc and all its mutants decrease steadily with increasing NaCl concentration, indicating the existence of attractive electrostatic interactions between the reaction partners that are overwhelmed at high ionic strength. The only exception is the R88E mutant, for which the kbimvalues are independent of ionic strength (see Fig. 4). The formalism developed by Watkins et al. (20Watkins J.A. Cusanovich M.A. Meyer T.E. Tollin G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) facilitates the analysis of the intrinsic reactivity of redox partners in the absence of electrostatic interactions. By applying the Watkins equation to our data on the ionic strength dependence of kbim, values for the bimolecular rate constant extrapolated to infinite ionic strength (kinf) can be calculated. As shown in Table I, all mutants, except L12A and R88E, exhibit kinf values similar to that of WT Pc, indicating that the minor reactivity of Pc mutants under standard conditions is mainly due to electrostatic rather than hydrophobic or structural changes. In the case of L12A, however, the kinf value is 7-fold lower than that for WT Pc. This suggests that such an isoelectric mutation may indeed induce structural changes hindering the interaction between Pc and PSI, as previously observed in Synechocystis (17De la Cerda B. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10125-10130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and spinach (27Sigfridsson K. Young S. Hansson Ö Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The Watkins equation, however, cannot be applied as such to R88E because its interactions with PSI are independent of ionic strength. The kbim value for R88E at any NaCl concentration (1.46 × 106m−1 s−1) is 4-fold lower than the kinf value for WT Pc (see Table I). This suggests that the electrostatic change induced by mutation is not the only factor affecting the reactivity of R88E toward PSI. Worth mentioning is the finding that the R64E mutant of Anabaena Cyt exhibits a kinf value that is also 4- or 5-fold lower than that for WT Cyt (7Molina-Heredia F.P. Dı́az-Quintana A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33565-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The nature of interactions between PSI and Pc was further investigated by performing a thermodynamic analysis of PSI reduction by the copper protein mutants. In all cases, the temperature dependence of the observed rate constant yielded linear Eyring plots with no breakpoints, from which the values for the apparent activation enthalpy (ΔH ‡), entropy (ΔS ‡), and free energy (ΔG ‡) of the overall reaction can be calculated. As shown in Table I, the most significant difference is observed with the R88E mutant, whose free energy change is 8.0 kJ mol−1 higher than that of WT Pc, as expected from its impaired reactivity toward PSI. Such a difference in ΔG ‡ is mainly due to a decrease of 25.6 J mol−1 K−1 in the entropic term. Also interesting is the L12A mutant, which exhibits a free energy change of 4.3 kJ mol−1 higher than that of WT Pc that is mainly due to the decrease in the entropic term. The observed changes in ΔG ‡ with the other mutants can be attributed to shifts in the enthalpic and/or entropic terms. To elucidate whether the lower reactivity of R88E can be ascribed to reasons other than the electrostatic change itself, its availability to transfer electrons to PSI from spinach and Synechocystis was analyzed in comparison with Anabaena WT Pc. The kbim value for spinach PSI reduction was 3.5 × 105m−1s−1 with R88E, or 4.3-fold lower than that with Anabaena WT Pc (1.5 × 106m−1 s−1). The kbim value for Synechocystis PSI reduction was 1.9 × 106m−1 s−1with R88E, or 15-fold lower than that with Anabaena WT Pc (2.8 × 107m−1s−1). These findings allow us to conclude that Arg-88 is a crucial residue not only for long range electrostatic attractions between Pc and PSI but also for electron transfer. It should be noted that glutamine at position 88 of spinach Pc has been replaced with asparagine, glutamate, lysine, and tyrosine with no significant changes in the kinetics of PSI reduction (27Sigfridsson K. Young S. Hansson Ö Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Ivkovic-Jensen M.M. Ullmann G.M. Young S. Hansson Ö. Crnogorac M.M. Ejdebäck M. Kostic N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9557-9569Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Divalent cations like Mg2+ have previously been reported to be specifically involved in Pc/PSI interactions in other organisms, but not Anabaena (8Medina M. Dı́az A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Gómez-Moreno C. De la Rosa M.A. Tollin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As such, an analysis of the effect of Mg2+ cations on the bimolecular rate constant of PSI reduction by WT and mutant Pcs was performed. The experimental results showed that the three mutants with one positive charge replaced by a negative residue (K33E, K58E, and R88E) are the only ones altered by magnesium cations. With these mutants the bimolecular rate constant exhibits higher values with MgCl2 than with NaCl at the same ionic strength (data not shown). All these findings can be interpreted by assuming not only that the added negative charges in Pc mutants facilitate the formation of new salt bridges with positive counterparts in PSI (16Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but also that the original positive residues in WT Pc interact with an acidic area in PSI. The positively charged site 2 in Anabaena Pc does appear to play the same role as the negatively charged site in other Pcs. The surface electrostatic potential distribution of Anabaena Pc was then calculated for its WT species as well as for the D49K and R88E molecules. As can be seen in Fig. 3, their respective electrostatic charges at site 2 correlate well with their relative efficiency as electron donors to PSI; the more positive the local surface charge, the higher the kinetic rate constant of photosystem reduction. A similar correlation had previously been observed with a number of mutants at site 2 of Cyt from Anabaena (7Molina-Heredia F.P. Dı́az-Quintana A. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33565-33570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Synechocystis (6De la Cerda B. Dı́az-Quintana A. Navarro J.A. Hervás M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13292-13297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The close similarity between Pc and Cyt from Anabaena was investigated by comparing the structures of the two molecules and the relative position of critical surface residues. The three-dimensional structures of the metalloproteins were thus modelled (Fig.4, upper panel). Assuming that His-87 in Pc plays the same redox role as the heme group in Cyt (29Frazão C. Soares C.M. Carrondo M.A. Pohl E. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. Sheldrick G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the comparison of the two protein structures makes Arg-88 and Asp-49 of Pc occupy positions equivalent to Arg-64 and Asp-72 in Cyt. In addition, the high number of lysine residues in both molecules could contribute to site 2 being so positively charged. Such a structural coincidence between Pc and Cyt from Anabaena is indeed supported by the experimental findings concerning the kinetic behavior of mutants affected at the arginine and aspartate residues. Fig. 4 (lower panels) shows how the kbim values at low ionic strength for the D49K mutant of Pc are significantly higher than those for WT Pc, as are the values for the D72K mutant of Cyt compared with WT Cyt. The kbim values for R88E of Pc and R64E of Cyt are, however, lower than those for their respective WT species. Also worth noting is the parallel ionic strength dependence of kbim with the WT and mutant proteins,i.e. the decrease in kbim with increasing NaCl concentration. Several possibilities concerning the role of the single arginyl residue in both Cyt and Pc can be devised. The interaction of these two metalloproteins with PSI should involve the formation of a transient electrostatic complex, which has in fact kinetically been detected with Cyt but not with Pc, probably due to its low association constant. The arginyl residue could thus be required for appropriate orientation of the redox centers within the transient complex. Specific electrostatic interactions of Arg-88 in Pc and Arg-64 in Cyt with negatively charged groups in PSI could be made evident as soon as a high resolution structure for PSI is made available. In addition, the proximity of the arginyl residue to the prosthetic group in each protein can explain why the arginine mutants of both Pc and Cyt exhibit values for the rate constant extrapolated to infinite ionic strength lower than those of the respective WT species. In this context, conformational changes of Arg-88 related to changes in the redox state of Pc have been described recently (30Inoue T. Sugawara H. Hamanaka S. Tsukui H. Suzuki E. Kohzuma T. Kai Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6063-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To conclude, we can say that site 1 of Anabaena Pc is similar to site 1 of other Pcs, but site 2 is positively charged in Anabaena, whereas it is negatively charged in other organisms. In addition, not only Pc but also Cyt from Anabaena contains a single arginine residue between sites 1 and 2 that appears to play the same function in the two molecules. We thank S. Alagaratnam, A.

The signaling mechanisms regulating Etk kinase activity remain largely unknown. To identify factor(s) regulating Etk activity, we used the PH domain and a linker region of Etk as a bait for a yeast two-hybrid screen. Three independent clones encoding protein-tyrosine phosphatase D1 (PTPD1) fragments were isolated. The binding of PTPD1 to Etk is specific since PTPD1 cannot associate with either the Akt PH domain or lamin. In vitro and in vivo binding studies demonstrated that PTPD1 can interact with Etk and that residues 726–848 of PTPD1 are essential for this interaction. Deletion analysis of Etk indicated that the PH domain is essential for PTPD1 interaction. Furthermore, the Etk-PTPD1 interaction stimulated the kinase activity of Etk, resulting in an increased phosphotyrosine content in both factors. The Etk-PTPD1 interaction also increased Stat3 activation. The effect of PTPD1 on Etk activation is specific since PTPD1 cannot potentiate Jak2 activity upon Stat3 activation. In addition, Tec (but not Btk) kinase can also be activated by PTPD1. Taken together, these findings indicate that PTPD1 can selectively associate with and stimulate Tec family kinases and modulate Stat3 activation.

These Tec kinases have been implicated in the signaling pathways of a variety of hematopoietic and antigen receptors. For instance, Btk has been found to be activated through B-cell receptor stimulation, the interleukin-5 receptor, gp130, and the mast cell Fcε receptor (8Kawakami Y. Yao L. Miura T. Tsukada S.

Mutations in Btk are associated with the human disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia as well as murine X-linked immunodeficiency (1Tsukada S. Saffaran D. Rawlings D. Witte O.

Tec itself mainly participates in signaling pathways regulating myeloid growth and differentiation. In these cells, Tec is tyrosine-phosphorylated following cell stimulation by a variety of hematopoietic growth factors, such as interleukin-3, stem-cell factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (17Matsuda T.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Etk, unlike other members of the Tec kinase family, which are mostly hematopoietic cell-specific, is preferentially expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells (7Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Thus, far upstream regulators and downstream signaling pathways of Etk and their roles in biological functions remain largely unknown. Recently, Etk has been shown to mediate interleukin-6 signaling in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP for differentiation (7Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3644-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and Gα12/13 signaling in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts for activation of serum response factor (24Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In Btk-deficient DT40 cells, Etk can replace the function of Btk in activating phospholipase Cγ2 in response to B-cell receptor engagement (25Tomlinson M.G. Kurosaki T. Berson A.E. Fujii G.H.

In rat liver epithelial cells, Etk can mediate cellular transformation of v-Src by activating Stat3 activity (26Tsai Y.T. Su Y.H. Fang S.S. Huang T.N. Qiu Y. Jou Y.S. Shih H.-M. Kung H.-J. Chen R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Besides Stat3 activation, Etk has also been shown to activate Stat1 and Stat5 (27Saharinen P. Ekman N. Sarvas K. Parker P. Alitalo K. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wen X. Lin H.H. Shih H.-M. Kung H.-J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38204-38210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, we have established an Etk-inducible system to demonstrate that Etk induces cyclin D1 reporter activation through Stat5 (28Wen X. Lin H.H. Shih H.-M. Kung H.-J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38204-38210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although progress has been made in identifying signaling pathways lying upstream or downstream from members of the Tec kinase family, little is known about the signaling mechanism regulating their kinase activity. Recent studies of Itk revealed that regulation of kinase activity is through an internal folding of the molecule (29Andreotti A.H. Bunnell S.C. Feng S. Berg L.J. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The intramolecular interactions of the SH3 and adjacent proline-rich domains lock the kinase in a closed, inactive state. Signaling molecules that contain proline-rich domains and phosphotyrosine can disrupt the intramolecular interactions, leading to the unfolding of the kinase domain and allowing the phosphorylation sites to be exposed to Src family kinases. An analogy for this intramolecular regulation is found in the Src family kinases, in which phosphorylation of a carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue is thought to regulate kinase activity through an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain (30Courtneidge S.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 31Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the kinase presumably involves dissociation of intramolecular interactions by signaling molecules, removing the constraint on the catalytic domain and producing an open, active kinase. Many investigators have attempted to understand the signaling mechanism of Tec family kinases by identifying ligands for the subdomains of these kinases. For example, the α subunit of Gq and Gα12 proteins can directly stimulate the kinase activity of Btk via binding to the TH-SH3 and PH-TH regions of Btk (32Ma Y.C. Huang X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12197-12201Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Jiang Y. Ma W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.Y.

Thus, interaction with signaling molecules is likely a common mechanism for activation of Tec family kinases. PH domains are primarily involved in protein-lipid or protein-protein interactions and regulate enzyme function by controlling interacting partners or cellular localization (35Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 36Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Studies of Tec family kinases have implied that the binding of lipid or protein signaling molecules to the PH domain is essential for activation and biological activity. Mutations in the Btk PH domain cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia and X-linked immunodeficiency (13Vihinen M. Zvelebil M.J. Zhu Q. Brooimans R.A. Ochs H.D. Zegers B.J. Nilsson L.

In contrast, the E41K mutation in the Btk PH domain results in an increase in membrane association and activation of Btk (16Li T. Tsukada S. Satterthwaite A. Havlik M.H. Park H. Takatsu K. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study has indicated that phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate interacting with the PH domain acts as an upstream activation signal for Btk and Tec kinases (43Scharenberg A.M.

Some protein interactions, such as Gα12/13/q, result in activation of Btk kinase activity. Others, such as protein kinase C, lead to down-regulation of Btk and Etk activities. These findings suggest that the PH domain of Tec family kinases is a target site for interaction and regulation by signaling molecules. We are interested in identifying the cellular signaling molecules for Etk. Etk contains PH, SH3, SH2, and kinase domains similar to those of other Tec family members. However, human Etk has an atypical TH motif that consists of a Btk motif and a unique sequence with two 22-amino acid repeats next to the SH3 domain. Since the Btk motif is highly homologous among the Tec family members, we included the Btk motif as part of the PH domain and designated a linker region L representing the region between the Btk motif and SH3 domains for Etk. To identify signaling factor(s) regulating Etk activity, we have chosen the PH domain and linker region as a bait for a yeast two-hybrid screen. PTPD1 was isolated, and its effect on Etk signaling is revealed in this study. The DNA fragments encoding the PH domain and linker region of Etk (Etk-PH+L), ETKΔ(PH+L), full-length Etk, and the PH domain of Akt were generated by polymerase chain reaction and fused to LexA in the vector BTM116 to produce baits for yeast two-hybrid studies. For GST-PH+L and GST-SH3 constructs, both corresponding DNA fragments were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and subcloned into pGEX-KG. For pCITE4C (Novagen)-PTPD1-(666–848), pCITE4C-PTPD1-(666–725), and pCITE4C-PTPD1-(726–848) constructs, the corresponding DNA segments were generated by digestion from pGalAD-PTPD1-(666–848), which was isolated by a two-hybrid screen and subcloned into pCITE4C. Full-length PTPD1 and Btk were cloned by polymerase chain reaction from human heart and bone marrow cDNA libraries (CLONTECH), respectively. Subsequently, PTPD1 and Btk were inserted into the pcDNA3-HA and pCMV-tag2 vectors, respectively, for expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged and FLAG-tagged proteins in mammalian cells. All of the HA-PTPD1 and T7-Etk deletion and point mutation constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mammalian vectors expressing Stat3, mouse Jak2, Tec, and c-Src Y527F were gifts from Drs. X.-Y. Fu, O. Silvennoinen, L. J. Berg, and Dr. H.-C. Wang, respectively. A human heart two-hybrid cDNA library was purchased from CLONTECH, and the yeast strain L40 was kindly provided by Dr. S. Hollenberg (Vollum Institute). Yeast two-hybrid screenings were performed as described (50Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Interaction between Etk-PH+L and proteins encoded by the cDNA library will activate HIS3 and lacZreporter genes. HIS3 confers upon yeast the ability to grow on histidine-free medium, whereas lacZ produces β-galactosidase that can be detected colorimetrically by filter assays. GST fusion proteins were purified as described (51Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled proteins were made with the TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 35S-Labeled proteins were incubated with 2 μg of each GST fusion protein in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmEDTA) for 1–2 h, washed four times, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. A fraction of the reaction mixture was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining to visualize GST fusion proteins. For testing association in mammalian cells, various HA-PTPD1 and T7-Etk constructs were transfected into 293T cells (10 cm) by the lipofection method. Thirty-six hours after cotransfection, cell were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm octyl glucoside, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.02% NaN3, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 200 mmsodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cell lysates were mixed with antiserum against HA (BAbCO, Richmond, CA) or against T7 (Novagen), and the immunocomplexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblot analyses of precipitated proteins were performed as described previously (7Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antibodies to phosphotyrosine (4G10), Jak2, and c-Src were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Human 293T or COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded into 10-cm plates the day before transfection. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cell extracts were harvested 36 h later for co-immunoprecipitation assays, kinase assays, and Western analysis. For the reporter gene assay, salivary Pa-4 cells were transfected with the pLucTKS3 reporter (a gift from Dr. Richard Jove) as well as the pRL-Tk plasmid as an indicator for normalization of transfection efficiency. The luciferase activities (firefly luciferase for the reporter and Renilla luciferase for the indicator) were measured using the Dual-LuciferaseTM assay system (Promega). The in vitro kinase assays of Etk were performed as described (34Bence K. Ma W. Kozasa T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1997; 389: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.0) and 2 mm MnCl2) and incubated with substrate buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm MnCl2, 20 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of peptide substrate derived from the Btk SH3 sequence containing the major autophosphorylation site (34Bence K.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed according to the procedures described by Vignais et al. (53Vignais M.L. Sadowski H.B. Watling D. Rogers N.C. Gilman M. Mol. Cell.

The Stat3·SIE complex was resolved by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. The specificity of the Stat3·SIE complex was further verified by adding anti-Stat3 antibody for supershift and unlabeled SIE for competition (data not shown). To identify factors that can modulate Etk activity, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human heart cDNA library with a bait containing the PH domain and linker region fused to the LexA protein. From an initial screen of ∼2 × 107primary yeast transformants, 264 positives were identified by simultaneous HIS3 and LacZ transcription. After subsequent purification and curing processes, plasmids of 45 strong interacting clones were isolated for sequence analysis. Three of these clones encode fragments of PTPD1 (as shown in Fig. 1 A) fused in frame with the Gal4 transactivation domain. PTPD1 was initially identified as a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (54Moller N.P. Moller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Sures I. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7477-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It encodes a protein of 1174 amino acids with an ezrin-like domain at the N terminus and a PTP domain at the C terminus separated by a long intervening sequence. All three isolated PTPD1 fragments are located in the intervening sequence (Fig. 1 A). Two of these clones were further tested for binding specificity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, both PTPD1 clones interacted specifically with the PH domain and linker region of Etk, as demonstrated by the formation of blue colonies. Notably, full-length Etk could also bind to both PTPD1 fragments, whereas one fragment containing resides 374–848 conferred a weak interaction as illustrated by a light-blue colony. In contrast, EtkΔ(PH+L) (lacking the PH domain and linker region) failed to produce the interaction. In addition, the interaction was specific since no appreciable interaction was detected with the PH domain of Akt or lamin as negative controls. These findings indicate that PTPD1 can specifically interact with Etk through the PH domain and linker. To further confirm the interaction between Etk and PTPD1 in vitro, a GST pull-down assay was performed. An in vitrotranslated, 35S-labeled PTPD1 fragment containing residues 666–848 bound to the immobilized GST fusion protein with the PH domain and linker domain, but not to the immobilized GST protein (Fig. 1 C, upper panel, lanes 4 and7). Furthermore, full-length PTPD1 was also subjected to this assay, and it bound to the PH domain and linker region of Etk as well (data not shown). These findings are consistent with those of the yeast two-hybrid assay. PTPD1-(666–848) contains an acidic segment (residues 712–722) that might be involved in Etk interactions. To test this possibility, the PTPD1 fragment was divided into two smaller fragments and subjected to GST pull-down experiments. PTPD1-(666–725) containing the acidic segment did not bind to GST-PH+L, whereas PTPD1-(726–848) was sufficient for interaction (Fig. 1 C,lanes 8 and 9). Taken together, these results suggest that the PTPD1 segment from residues 726 to 848 is responsible for Etk interaction. To further determine whether PTPD1 interacts with Etk in mammalian cells, human 293T cells were cotransfected with constructs expressing HA-PTPD1 and T7-Etk. Cell lysates were separately subjected to immunoprecipitation assays with anti-HA tag or anti-T7 tag antibody. HA-PTPD1 was detected in the immunocomplexes of Etk (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). This interaction was also confirmed in a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay as illustrated in Fig. 2 B. Again, the Etk-PTPD1 interaction is dependent on residues 726–848 of PTPD1 since the deletion mutant HA-PTPD1Δ(726–848) cannot be detected in the immunocomplex of T7-Etk (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). These observations indicate that Etk and PTPD1 can specifically form a complex in cells. To further delineate the subdomain of Etk involved in PTPD1 binding, we used various deletion mutants of Etk, including the PH domain, linker region, SH3 domain, and SH2 domain, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with PTPD1. The protein expression levels of each mutant and PTPD1 were very similar (Fig. 2 C, middle panel). Notably, deletion of the PH domain resulted in loss of association with PTPD1, as demonstrated by lack of detection of the HA-PTPD1 protein in the anti-T7 tag immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). Conversely, the linker region deletion mutant EtkΔL, like wild-type Etk, retained the interaction with PTPD1 (Fig. 2 C, upper panel, lanes 2 and 6). Mutants EtkΔSH2 and EtkΔSH3 still associated with PTPD1, but to a lower extent. These observations were further verified by the reciprocal experiments with anti-HA immunoprecipitated complex and Western analysis with anti-T7 antibody (data not shown). These findings indicate that the PH domain of Etk is the major site for PTPD1 binding. Since PTPD1 is a tyrosine phosphatase, it likely modulates the phosphotyrosine content of Etk. We next tested whether the Etk-PTPD1 interaction results in a change in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Etk. Interestingly, coexpression of wild-type PTPD1 increased the phosphotyrosine content of Etk (Fig. 2 A,lower panel, lane 2). This consequence was due to the association with PTPD1 because the PTPD1 deletion mutant PTPD1Δ(726–848) failed to confer the effect (lane 3). Conversely, tyrosine phosphorylation of PTPD1 was also enhanced by interaction with Etk. This notion was also confirmed by the reciprocal experiment in which PTPD1 was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody and Western blot analysis with 4G10 antibody (Fig. 2 B,lower panel). To further establish the correlation between interaction and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both Etk and PTPD1, Etk immunocomplexes from cell lysates expressing PTPD1 and various deletion mutants of Etk were subjected to Western analysis with 4G10 antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 2 C (lower panel), only the EtkΔPH mutant failed to confer tyrosine phosphorylation of both factors. Taken together, these findings provide a direct correlation between Etk-PTPD1 association and increased tyrosine phosphorylation. The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both Etk and PTPD1 may result from the Etk kinase its"

Saeki K. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 223-280Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The redox active prosthetic group in this class of ferredoxins is characterized by an iron-sulfur cluster, consisting of two non-heme iron ions ligated to thiolate side chains of four cysteines of the polypeptide, bridged by two inorganic sulfide ions. [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins are classified by structure and function into plant-type ferredoxins and vertebrate-type ferredoxins. Vertebrate-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins, present in oxygenase systems of bacteria and vertebrates, transfer electrons from a NAD(P)H-dependent ferredoxin reductase to different cytochrome P450 enzymes (2Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 127: 137-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, ferredoxins of the [2Fe-2S] protein family are present in adrenal cortex, placenta, liver, kidney, and brain (3Ichikawa Y. Hamamoto I. Waki N. Iwahashi K. Hiwatashi A. Tsubaki M. Matsubara H. Katsube Y. Wada H. Iron-Sulfur Protein Research. Japan Societies Press/Tokyo, Springer Verlag/Berlin, 1987: 97-105Google Scholar), where they participate in cytochrome P450-catalyzed hydroxylation reactions to produce steroid hormones, vitamin D metabolites, and bile acids. Bovine Adx1 as a member of vertebrate [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins, functions as electron mediator from the isoalloxazin system of adrenodoxin reductase (AdR) to the heme iron of two cytochromes P450, CYP11A1 and CYP11B1, localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane of the adrenal cortex (4Grinberg A.V. Hannemann F. Schiffler B. Müller J. Heinemann U. Bernhardt R. Proteins. 2000; 40: 590-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). CYP11A1 converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, and CYP11B1 catalyzes the 11β-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol and the production of aldosterone. The crystal structures of a truncated bovine Adx (5Muller A. Muller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and of a full-length Adx (6Pikuleva I.A. Tesh K. Waterman M.R. Kim Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) determined at 1.85- and 2.5-Å resolution, respectively, display a compact (α+β) fold typical for [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins. The polypeptide chain is organized into a large core domain, containing the iron-sulfur cluster, and a smaller interaction domain. This small 35-amino acid-comprising domain includes the acidic region between residues 72 and 79, which was shown to be responsible for the recognition of the redox partners AdR and cytochrome CYP11A1 (7Vickery L.E. Steroids. 1997; 62: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The identification of corresponding positively charged residues on the interaction partners AdR and CYP11A1 (8Wada A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17126-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed a recognition model mainly based on electrostatic interactions. The ability to accept and donate electrons during interaction with redox partners is tightly connected to the redox potentials of iron-sulfur proteins. The redox potential differs widely in [2Fe-2S] proteins and is correlated to the ferredoxin type. In general, plant-type ferredoxins display lower redox potentials (between −305 and −455 mV) (10Cammack R. Rao K.K. Bargeron C.P. Hutson K.G. Andrew P.W. Rogers L.J. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 205-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) than vertebrate-type ferredoxins (−235 to −273 mV). The protein sequence alignment of the region around the [2Fe-2S] cluster ligands (Fig. 1) between plant-type ferredoxins and vertebrate-type ferredoxins displays a difference between the two ferredoxin types in the length of the metal-binding loop proximate to the reducible iron atom. The loop in vertebrate-type ferredoxins contains five residues, and the conserved alcoholic amino acid in the middle of the loop consists of a threonine or serine (Fig.1). In plant-type ferredoxins, the loop is one amino acid shorter and a corresponding conserved residue is missing. In Adx, a threonine is positioned in the middle of the loop between the cysteine cluster ligands Cys-46 and Cys-52. In order to understand the particular role of the amino acid Thr-49 for the functional properties of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, a series of mutants of Adx was generated in which Thr-49 was replaced by alanine (T49A), serine (T49S), leucine (T49L), and tyrosine (T49Y) or Thr-49 was deleted (T49Δ). Recombinant proteins were purified from E. coli and characterized in detail by biochemical and biophysical methods. Adx proteins were produced using the T7-expression system consisting of E. coli strain BL21[DE3]pLysE and vector pET3d (19Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Adx cDNA were introduced by polymerase chain reaction according to Landt et al. (20Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing the appropriate restriction sites and mutations were synthesized by BioTez GmbH. Recombinant Adx and AdR were purified as described (21Uhlmann H. Beckert V. Schwarz D. Bernhardt R. Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1131-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Sagara Y. Wada A. Takata Y. Waterman M.R. Sekimizu K. Horiuchi T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was calculated using ε414 = 9.8 (mm cm)−1for Adx (23Kimura T. Jorgensen C.K. Neilands J.B. Nyholm R.S. Reinen D. Williams R.J.P. Structure and Bonding. 5. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1968: 1-40Google Scholar) and ε450 = 11.3 (mmcm)−1 for AdR (24Hiwatashi A. Ichikawa Y. Yamano T. Maruya N. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3091-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Isolation of CYP11A1 and CYP11B1 from bovine adrenal glands was performed according to Akhrem et al. (25Akhrem A.A. Lapko V.N. Lapko A.G. Shkumatov V.M. Chashchin V.L. Acta Biol. Med. Ger. 1979; 38: 257-273PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Absorption spectra in the UV-visible region were recorded at room temperature on a Shimadzu double-beam spectrophotometer UV2101PC. Samples for NMR spectroscopy (5 mg each) of Adx and T49Δ in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer were dried at room temperature under vacuum and dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O. The pH was adjusted to 8.2 with a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer. Both samples were left at 4 °C for approximately 72 h to exchange the amide protons for deuterium. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 NMR spectrometer at 299 K. The residual water signal was suppressed with low power irradiation. CD spectra were recorded as described previously (26Uhlmann H. Kraft R. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22557-22564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter. Temperature-dependent measurements were carried out at a heating rate of 50 °C/h from 20 to 65 °C with a temperature increment of 0.2 °C, monitoring the decrease of the circular dichroism signal at 440 nm. Tm and Hm were calculated from CD scans with a nonlinear regression program using the two-state model (27Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1979; 33: 167-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Redox potentials of Adx and mutants were determined using the dye photoreduction method (28Sligar S.G. Gunsalus I.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) with safranin T as indicator and mediator as described. Binding of Adx and mutants to CYP11A1 was followed spectrophotometrically as a high spin shift of the P450 heme iron from 417 nm to 393 nm, caused by Adx-induced cholesterol binding (29Kido T. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11806-11815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titrations were performed in tandem cuvettes with 2 μm CYP11A1, 25 μm cholesterol, 0.03% Tween 20 in a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m potassium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.05% sodium cholate at room temperature. Calculation of free Adx was done as described by Coghlan and Vickery (30Coghlan V.M. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18606-18612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of the first electron transfer reaction from Adx to cytochrome CYP11A1 were carried out using a single channel stopped-flow ASVD spectrophotometer SX-17MV (Applied Photophysics). The reduction of cytochrome CYP11A1 in a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 0.1m potassium chloride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.05% sodium cholate was followed at 15 °C by monitoring the absorption at 450 nm, representing the formation of the ferrous-carbon monoxide complex (31Tuckey R.C. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4232-4237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of Adx and AdR was assayed following the reduction of cytochrome c in a buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 10 mm potassium chloride. The reaction was initiated by addition of NADPH. The absorption change at 550 nm was monitored, and the activity determined using an extinction coefficient of 20 (mm cm)−1 for cytochrome c. The cholesterol side chain cleavage activity was assayed in a reconstituted system catalyzing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone according to the procedure of Sugano et al.(32Sugano S. Miura R. Morishima N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 30 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20 and contained a NADPH regenerating system. The samples were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC with an isocratic solvent system of acetonitrile/isopropanol (15:1). The tunneling pathway model of Beratan (33Beratan D.N. Betts J.N. Onuchic J.N. Science. 1991; 252: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the electron transfer from the [2Fe-2S] cluster to the ferredoxin surface. The program Pathway (version 0.97) classifies the pathways into covalent, hydrogen-bonded, and through-space (van der Waals contact) segments depending on the kind of interaction between the neighbored atoms, and finds optimal pathways with maximal coupling between electron donor and acceptor. To confirm that oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was limited to the predicted sites, Adx cDNA inserts in the expression vector pET3d were sequenced using the cycle sequencing method. All Adx proteins were expressed as holoproteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli strain BL21[DE3]pLysE. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed specific bands at 14 kDa for all proteins. The expression yields of mutants T49A, T49S, T49L, and T49Y were each in the range of wild type adrenodoxin (50–100 mg/liter of E. coli culture). Yields of mutant T49Δ were reduced to one third of the wild type level. The final purity index (A414/A276) of the proteins was always higher than 0.9. To measure the effect of mutations on the structure of the iron-sulfur cluster region CD spectroscopy was applied, a method that sensitively detects conformational changes in optically active substances like iron-sulfur cluster containing proteins. No significant changes were observed either in the near UV or visible region for the substitution mutants (Fig.2). In contrast, deletion mutant T49Δ showed in the indicated regions shifted CD signals and in part lower amplitudes of the peaks compared with the wild type. Deletion of Thr-49 shifted the local maxima at 440 and 342 nm to 428 and 348 nm, respectively. In addition, a new shoulder appeared at 455 nm in the T49Δ spectrum. The signal changes in the range of 310–650 nm clearly reflect a rearrangement in the proximity of the iron-sulfur cluster of this mutant. To study the mutational effect of the deletion of Thr-49 on the aromatic region of T49Δ, 1H NMR spectra of T49Δ and Adx were recorded under the same conditions and compared with each other (Fig. 3). Both spectra show the same chemical shifts for the various aromatic residues (assignment according to Beckert et al. (Ref. 34Beckert V. Schrauber H. Bernhardt R. Van Dijk A.A. Kakoschke C. Wray V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)), indicating that the three-dimensional global structure of the protein was maintained after deletion of the amino acid Thr-49. To analyze the effect of mutations on the protein stability, thermal unfolding of Adx was performed. A buffer system that prevents the destruction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster during heating (35Burova T.V. Bernhardt R. Pfeil W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) allows unfolded proteins to regain the original absorption spectrum after renaturation (36Grinberg A.V. Bernhardt R. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Wild-type Adx and all substitution mutants renatured after a 12-h incubation at 4 °C in the sulfide-containing buffer. In contrast, mutant T49Δ denatured irreversibly. The CD signal of melting curves of all analyzed proteins recorded at 440 nm decreased in a sigmoidal manner (Fig.4), allowing a data fit according to a two state model. The thermal transition temperatures Tm of mutants T49A, T49S, and T49L are nearly unchanged. Tm values of mutants T49Y and T49Δ are 2.5 °C and 13.3 °C lower compared with the wild type (TableI). The denaturation enthalpy Δd Hm seems to be correlated with the size of the substituting amino acid (Fig.5). The values for the Δd Hm differences in kJ/mol decrease in the row T49A (+24), T49S (+2), wild type (0), T49L (−9), and T49Y (−14).Table IThermodynamic parameters of unfolding for wild type Adx and Thr-49 mutantsProteinTdΔd H(Td)1-aEnthalpie parameters for mutant T49Δ are not presented because its unfolding is not reversible.ΔTdΔ(Δd H(Td))°CkJ/mol°CkJ/molWild type49.3 ± 0.1367 ± 1700T49Δ36.0 ± 1.2−13.3T49A50.2 ± 0.4391 ± 2+0.9+24T49S48.8 ± 0.3369 ± 3−0.5+2T49L49.4 ± 0.4358 ± 10+0.1−9T49Y46.8 ± 0.4353 ± 8−2.5−14Thermal unfolding parameters were derived from heat denaturation curves measured by CD spectroscopy at 440 nm.

Standard deviations were calculated for each protein from three independent determinations. In order to analyze the stability of mutant T49Δ in the respective buffer system of different functional assays, absorption spectra were recorded before and after the indicated incubation time. The spectral properties of the mutant remained nearly unchanged in all buffer systems used (spectra not shown). The redox potential of an electron transport protein indicates its ability to accept and donate electrons. The midpoint redox potentials for wild type Adx and mutant ferredoxins were analyzed by spectrophotometric redox measurements using safranin T as indicator and mediator. Substitutions of the amino acid in position 49 did not affect the redox properties of the proteins (TableII). The measured redox potential of wild type Adx and the replacement mutants show an almost identical value of −276 mV, which resembles the potential for the native Adx isolated from bovine adrenal glands (38Estabrook R.W. Suzuki K. Mason J.I. Baron J. Taylor W.E. Simpson J.P. Purvis J. McCarthy J. Iron-Sulfur Proteins. 2. Academic Press, New York1973: 193-223Google Scholar). The value for the deletion mutant T49Δ (−370 mV) was about 100 mV lower than that measured for the wild type protein, indicating a significant role of this position in modulating the redox potential.Table IIRedox potentials of Adx and Thr-49 mutantsProteinRedox potential2-aStandard deviation for T49Δ is ±20 mV, for all other proteins ±5 mV.mVWild type−276T49Δ−370T49A−278T49S−276T49L−270T49Y−271Redox potentials were measured by the dye photoreduction method with safranin T as indicator and mediator.

In order to determine the extent to which the mutations affect the interaction with AdR, an assay involving cytochrome c as an artificial electron acceptor was used. Under the conditions employed, cytochrome c is in large excess, and the derived Km values are essentially equivalent to dissociation constants (Kd) of the AdR-Adx complex (39Lambeth J.D. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2766-2774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TableIII shows that the affinity of the mutants T49A, T49S, and T49L to AdR is in the same range as the wild type. Replacement of Thr-49 with tyrosine resulted in a 3-fold increase in complex formation, whereas the deletion of Thr-49 caused a 120-fold increase of the Km value.Table IIIKinetic constants of adrenodoxin and Thr-49 mutantsProteinCytochrome creduction assayCholesterol side chain cleavageSpectral binding KdKmVmax3-aExpressed by nanomoles of cytochrome c reduced/min.KmVmax3-bExpressed by nanomoles of pregnenololone produced/min/nmol of CYP11A1.nmμmμmWild type0.31 ± 0.03259 ± 30.67 ± 0.20.53 ± 0.0524 ± 1T49Δ38.6 ± 14.4263 ± 43n.d.3-cn.d., not detected.n.d.n.d.T49A0.37 ± 0.02309 ± 51.34 ± 0.30.61 ± 0.05197 ± 9T49S0.29 ± 0.2333 ± 90.31 ± 0.20.57 ± 0.0566 ± 7T49L0.2 ± 0.035250 ± 51.57 ± 0.40.37 ± 0.0351 ± 2T49Y0.095 ± 0.005336 ± 280.98 ± 0.20.58 ± 0.0524 ± 3Interaction of wild type Adx and mutants with AdR was assayed following the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm.

Binding of oxidized Adx to oxidized CYP11A1 was followed spectrophometrically by the high spin shift of the P450 heme iron in the Soret region, caused by Adx induced cholesterol binding. Binding of the oxidized form of adrenodoxin to its electron acceptor CYP11A1 is comparable to that of the reduced form (40Lambeth J.D. Kriengsiri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8810-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus allowing to analyze the affinities of wild type and mutant adrenodoxin to CYP11A1 by optical difference spectroscopy. Compared with wild type Adx, mutants T49S, T49L, and T49Y exhibit Kd values in the same range, mutant T49A shows a nearly 8-fold increased Kd value, and the Kd value of mutant T49Δ was not detectable (TableIII). The effect of mutations in position 49 on the enzymatic activity of the native electron acceptor CYP11A1 was investigated by HPLC analysis of the substrate conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone (Table III). The values for maximal substrate conversion, Vmax, are quite similar for the wild type and the mutants T49A, T49S, and T49Y. The Vmax value for mutant T49L is decreased by 30%. A substrate conversion with the deletion mutant T49Δ was not detectable. The Km values for the substrate conversion are similar for the wild type and mutant T49S and slightly increased for mutants T49A, T49L, and T49Y, whereas no Km for the reaction with the mutant T49Δ can be calculated. To investigate the effect of mutations at position 49 on the electron transfer rate to CYP11A1, stopped-flow experiments in oxygen-free atmosphere were performed. In the experiments adrenodoxin, preincubated with AdR and NADPH in the first test tube, was rapidly mixed with oxidized CYP11A1 present in the second test tube. Under these conditions the rate constants of electron transfer from the reduced Adx to the oxidized CYP11A1 are fully Adx-dependent since the flavin to iron-sulfur electron transfer is not rate-limiting. The apparent rate constant, kapp, measured for wild type Adx is 0.098 s−1 (TableIV). The value for mutant T49S is slightly increased (0.140 s−1), whereas the value for mutant T49A is slightly decreased (0.063 s−1). The rate constants for mutants T49L and T49Δ are 3- and 6-fold reduced, respectively. Substitution of the threonine in position 49 by a tyrosine resulted in a kapp value increased by a factor of 3.Table IVReduction rate of CYP11A1Proteinkapps −1Wild type0.098 ± 0.005T49Δ0.016 ± 0.0008T49A0.063 ± 0.003T49S0.140 ± 0.007T49L0.030 ± 0.002T49Y0.346 ± 0.020The velocity of formation of the CYP11A1-CO complex upon transfer of the first electron by wild type Adx or mutant proteins was measured in a stopped flow assay.

Open table in a new tab The velocity of formation of the CYP11A1-CO complex upon transfer of the first electron by wild type Adx or mutant proteins was measured in a stopped flow assay. The apparent rate constants and standard deviations were calculated from six determinations. A global coupling map of the Adx molecule was calculated with the program Pathway (version 0.97) using Fe-1 of the [2Fe-2S] cluster as donor and all other atoms as acceptors. The coupling map was displayed on the surface of the three-dimensional structure of the truncated mutant of adrenodoxin, consisting of amino acids 4–108, with the program InsightII (Fig. 6). A small region with high coupling values can be identified on the surface of the molecule. All amino acids with high coupling are located in the loop covering the iron-sulfur center comprising the residues between position 47 and 54. The highest coupling values were calculated with the program Harlem for the residues Thr-54 (6.4 × 103), Thr-49 (5.3 × 103), Leu-50 (4.0 × 103), and Glu-47 (3.7 × 103), indicating a high probability that these amino acids are involved in electron transfer from the redox active iron-sulfur cluster to the Adx surface. The importance of the threonine residue in position 49 in bovine Adx for its function as electron mediator has been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and detailed analysis of the obtained mutants. Special attention has been attributed to structural and stability properties, to the redox potential, to the electron transfer function, and to the influence on binding affinities to the redox partners. In the mature Adx, Thr-49 is located in a 5-residue-containing loop between the [2Fe-2S] cluster coordinating cysteines Cys-46 and Cys-52. This amino acid is conserved in [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins of the vertebrate-type as threonine or serine. In plant-type ferredoxins a corresponding residue is missing, and the iron-sulfur cluster loop contains only 4 residues. To determine the influence of amino acid substitutions or a deletion in position 49 on the structural properties of the protein, CD spectra have been recorded. As concluded from unchanged spectra, the introduction of alanine, serine, leucine, or tyrosine instead of threonine did not lead to changes in the environment of the iron-sulfur cluster. This observation is in agreement with computer modeling studies, which indicated that the introduction of the respective amino acids does not cause any steric hindrance in its surrounding (data not shown). Differences in the spectroscopic properties of wild type Adx and mutant T49Δ were discernible in the CD spectra of the proteins. Significant changes in both the near-UV and visible region sensitively reflect conformational changes in the surrounding of the optically active iron-sulfur cluster of mutant T49Δ. The CD spectrum of this mutant shows shifted CD signals, in part lower amplitudes of the peaks compared with the wild type, and the appearance of a new shoulder at 455 nm in the region of the largest CD maximum. Thus, shortening of the cluster loop by only one amino acid causes rearrangements in the active center, whereas the CD signals of substitution mutants seem not to be sensitive to a larger or smaller side chain volume of the amino acid in position 49. For further analysis of the extent of the apparent structural changes of mutant T49Δ, 1H NMR spectroscopy was applied. The1H assignments of residues His-10, His-56, His-62, and Tyr-82 have been confirmed as obtained previously (34Beckert V. Schrauber H. Bernhardt R. Van Dijk A.A. Kakoschke C. Wray V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and display the same chemical shift in wild type Adx and in the mutant T49Δ. Residue Tyr-82 is part of the interaction domain, and residue His-56 forming hydrogen bonds to Tyr-82 and Ser-88 connects the core domain with the interaction domain and transmits conformational changes upon reduction of Adx. Since NMR signals of both residues indicate the same chemical environment in the mutant and in the wild type, a transduction of conformational changes in the cluster region of mutant T49Δ to the interaction domain can be excluded. The deletion, therefore, has no obvious effect influencing the structure around the residues on the acidic domain described as critical for the interactions studied. In the tertiary structure of Adx, the iron-sulfur redox center is located close to the protein surface, where Thr-49 is positioned at the boundary separating the redox center from the aqueous phase (Fig.7). Several potential hydrogen bonds around the iron sulfur cluster have been identified (5Muller A. Muller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the immediate vicinity of Thr-49, the backbone amide groups of Glu-47 (E47N to S1), Gly-48 (G48N to C46Sγ), and Ala-51 (A51N to C46Sγ) may form a hydrogen bond to the sulfur atom S1 or to the sulfur atom of Cys-46 of the iron-sulfur cluster. The importance of these hydrogen bonds was directly studied by thermal unfolding of the proteins in a CD spectropolarimeter. The nearly unchanged conformational stability of the iron sulfur cluster in substitution mutants compared with wild type Adx is in agreement with the suggestion that the hydrogen bond network in the neighborhood of position 49 was not affected by the mutations. In contrast, the reduced Tm value for the deletion mutant indicates that the stability of the iron-sulfur cluster vicinity is dramatically affected by lost or by weaker hydrogen bonds. This finding is supported by the irreversibility of the unfolding of mutant T49Δ, which is in contrast to reversible folding properties of the other Adx mutant proteins. The deletion of the threonine in position 49 and the accompanying distortion of the hydrogen bond network results in a dramatic redox potential drop from −276 mV (wild type) to −370 mV (T49Δ). In contrast, all substitution mutants display an unchanged midpoint redox potential. The results of redox potential determinations suggest that the amino acid in position 49 stabilizes the hydrogen bond network and tunes the microenvironment of the iron-sulfur cluster and therefore the redox potential in bovine Adx. An effect of hydrogen-bonding interactions between [2Fe-2S] cluster ligand atoms and side chain or main chain donor atoms on the oxidation-reduction potentials of Adx (41Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29959-29966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and Anabaena ferredoxin (42Vidakovic M. Fraczkiewicz G. Dave B.C. Czernuszewicz R.S. Germanas J.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13906-13913Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) has been observed previously. The redox potentials of bovine Adx mutants T54A and T54S are reduced by 55 and 34 mV, respectively. In this case, a hydrogen bond from the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr-54 to the sulfur atom of Cys-52 is affected in the mutant proteins and results in structural changes in the vicinity of the iron-sulfur cluster. In Anabaena ferredoxin mutant A45S, the presence of an additional hydrogen bond in the metal-binding loop from the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser-45 to the sulfur atom of Cys-41 seems to be responsible for the higher midpoint potential of mutant ferredoxin (−382 mV) relative to the wild type (−406 mV). The redox potential for the Adx deletion mutant T49Δ (−370 mV) reaches the potential range of plant-type ferredoxins (−305 to −455 mV), which is in general lower as in vertebrate-type ferredoxins. Since the deletion in mutant T49Δ results in a 4-residue-containing [2Fe-2S] cluster loop as present in plant-type ferredoxins, similar structures may be formed, which are a prerequisite to determine the redox potential in this range. Further crystallographic studies solving the detailed structure of the [2Fe-2S] center vicinity of the mutant T49Δ will present more insight into the general field of redox potential determination in ferredoxins. The affinity of Adx to the redox partners CYP11A1 and AdR is particularly affected by mutations in position 49. The most pronounced effects can be observed for the deletion mutant T49Δ, which shows a 120-fold decrease in binding affinity to AdR and a drop to zero in the binding affinity to CYP11A1. Smaller effects were measured after replacement of Thr-49 with tyrosine or alanine. Mutant T49Y shows a 3-fold increase in complex formation with AdR, and mutant T49A shows an 8-fold decrease in complex formation with CYP11A1. Measurement of the binding constants of the other mutants to AdR and CYP11A1 revealed only slight changes or similar results compared with the wild type. Since binding constants for the substitution mutants are only changed for the largest and smallest introduced residues (T49A, T49Y), the surface contact via Thr-49 seems to be optimized for interaction with different redox partners. Dramatically changed binding properties of the deletion mutant, caused by structural rearrangements in the cluster region, suggest a crucial role of Thr-49 for direct interaction with binding partners or for the formation of an interacting surface represented by the [2Fe-2S] cluster loop. Corresponding to Thr-49 in Adx, in the bacterial ferredoxin putidaredoxin (Pdx) residue Ser-44 was substituted in a mutagenesis study (43Shimada H. Nagano S. Ariga Y. Unno M. Egawa T. Hishiki T. Ishimura Y. Masuya F. Obata T. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9363-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that substitution of Ser-44 with the smaller amino acid, glycine, increases solvent accessibility to the cluster and simultaneously induces distortion around the ferrous iron as indicated by shifting the though in the g⊥ electron spin resonance signal to a higher magnetic field. This mutation causes the same spectral changes of Pdx as the formation of the ternary complex Pdx-CYP101-CO. In the complex the change in the CYP101 active site upon CO binding is transmitted to Pdx within the complex and produces a conformational change of the iron-sulfur active center. Ser-44 in Pdx, homologous to Thr-49 in Adx, is part of a surface loop around the [2Fe-2S] center including the residues Asp-34, Asp-38, and Ser-42 involved in redox partner binding (44Holden M. Mayhew M. Bunk D. Roitberg A. Vilker V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both proteins, the vertebrate ferredoxin Adx and the bacterial ferredoxin Pdx, comprise therefore a corresponding recognition domain involved in protein-protein interaction during the general function of electron transfer. The efficiency of the cholesterol side chain cleavage is not significantly changed with Thr-49 substitution mutants. However, no CYP11A1-dependent enzymatic activity can be detected in reactions with the deletion mutant T49Δ, which is in agreement with the finding that no Adx T49Δ-CYP11A1 complex formation is detectable under the applied conditions. Stopped-flow analysis of the first electron transfer from T49Δ to CYP11A1 revealed a 6-fold reduced electron flux and indicates a very low binding affinity, which might be under the detection limit of optical titration experiments, which were used for estimation of the binding constant. Furthermore, the results of stopped-flow measurements suggest on the one hand a reduced electron transfer to CYP11A1 for mutants that contain no alcoholic residue in position 49, and on the other hand an 3-fold increased electron transfer after substitution of threonine by the aromatic tyrosine residue. Interestingly, although the redox potential of mutant T49Y and the binding constant for CYP11A1 are not changed, the introduced tyrosine residue seems to form a preferred route for the electron transfer between Adx and CYP11A1, which is in good agreement with previous observations that aromatic residues enhance electron transfer in proteins (45Farver O. Skov L.K. Young S. Bonander N. Karlsson B.G. Vanngard T. Oecht I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5453-5454Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments indicate that residue 49 is involved in the electron transfer pathways from Adx to CYP11A1. This indication is in accordance with the calculated electron coupling between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and the surface of Adx, which pointed out a hot spot in the [2Fe-2S] cluster loop containing residue 49. The experimental and theoretical evidences obtained by stopped-flow measurements and electron transfer calculations imply that residue 49 is positioned at the boundary separating the [2Fe-2S] redox center from the surface of the interacting redox partner protein during complex formation. The nature of the influence of Thr-49 in this position on the complex formation and electron transfer, which can be a direct interaction with binding partners or a structure-forming function in the [2Fe-2S] cluster loop, remains unclear and is subject to further studies. Taken together, residue Thr-49 of bovine Adx plays an important role in the stabilization of the hydrogen bond network of the [2Fe-2S] center. Deletion of this residue markedly decreases the redox potential of the protein indicating that this residue determines the redox potential in Adx. Structural rearrangements of the cluster vicinity in this mutant also led to decreased stability and dramatically reduced binding affinities of the redox partner proteins AdR and CYP11A1. Introduction of the smaller alanine and the larger tyrosine in this position significantly changes the binding constants, providing further evidence that amino acid Thr-49 is involved in the interaction with the other proteins in the electron transfer chain. The measured apparent rate constants for the first electron transfer and the calculated electron coupling map of the surface of Adx provide evidence for the participation of the position 49 in the electron pathways between the iron-sulfur center of Adx and the heme of the cytochrome CYP11A1. We thank Wolfgang Reinle and Walter Klose for purifying AdR and CYP11A1, Michael Lisurek for preparing the picture of Adx, and Elena Olkova for calculating the electron coupling values. We greatly acknowledge the technical assistance of Katharina Bompais."

A homologous gene, sel-12, has been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans. We now demonstrate that wild-type (wt) SEL-12 undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage in C. elegans similar to the PSs in human tissue. In contrast, SEL-12 C60S protein expressed from thesel-12(ar131) allele is miscleaved in C. elegans, resulting in a larger mutant N-terminal fragment. Neither SEL-12 wt nor C60S undergo endoproteolytic processing upon expression in human cells, suggesting that SEL-12 is cleaved by aC. elegans-specific endoproteolytic activity. The loss of function of sel-12 in C. elegans is not associated with a dominant negative activity in human cells, because SEL-12 C60S and the corresponding PS1 C92S mutation do not interfere with Notch1 cleavage. Moreover, both mutant variants increase the aberrant production of the highly amyloidogenic 42-amino acid version of amyloid β-peptide similar to familial Alzheimer's disease-associated human PS mutants. Our data therefore demonstrate that the C60S mutation in SEL-12 is associated with aberrant endoproteolysis and a loss of function in C. elegans, whereas a gain of misfunction is observed upon expression in human cells."

Nevertheless, aside from the protein folding steps that are prerequisite for its ER-to-Golgi transport (4Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J.

Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 8-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Cameron R.S. Castle J.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 79: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Regulated apical secretion is particularly relevant to thyrocytes, which have an exocrine organization and an acute thyrotropin-stimulated exocytotic response (2Arvan P. Kim P.S. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Muresan Z. Yoo S.E. Hossain S.A. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently described two heterologously regulated secretory proteins that can be secreted apically upon transient expression in filter-grown primary thyrocytes. From this and other studies, we have proposed important relationships between the apical trafficking of Tg and its sorting into the regulated secretory pathway (6Arvan P. Lee J. J.

Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and although Tg secreted from dispersed thyroid cells is fully soluble in the presence or absence of cold Triton X-100 (34Tarutani O.

Zhang, and P. Arvan, our unpublished observations. we have investigated the possibility that Tg might associate with GEMs/rafts in the secretory pathway. We now report the targeting of newly synthesized recombinant Tg to Triton X-100 insoluble microdomains in MDCK and FRT cells, as well as endogenous Tg in PC Cl3 thyrocytes. From these studies, we can report that Tg is the first secretory protein positively identified to enter the GEM/raft pathway en route to the apical surface of epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONApical targeting of Tg to the lumen of thyroid follicles is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis (2Arvan P. Kim P.S. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Muresan Z. Yoo S.E. Hossain S.A. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All studies to date indicate that pathophysiological conditions in which Tg is either delivered insufficiently to the follicle lumen (3Medeiros-Neto G. Targovnik H.M. Vassart G. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 165-183PubMed Google Scholar) or delivered abnormally to the basolateral surface (48Marino M. Zheng G. Chiovato L. Pinchera A. Brown D. Andrews D. McCluskey R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7125-7137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 49Marino M. McCluskey R.T. Thyroid. 2000; 10: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are associated with serious disorders of thyroid hormone production. To understand such disorders, it is first necessary to begin to understand the normal apical targeting of Tg, the mechanism(s) of which have never previously been explored. We now demonstrate that in MDCK cells, which lack a classical regulated secretory pathway, recombinant Tg is secreted apically (Fig. 1); it can be recovered in the GEM/raft fraction (Fig. 2); and its apical secretion is severely inhibited by cellular cholesterol depletion (Fig. 3). By contrast, Tg expressed endogenously in thyrocytes is packaged into the regulated secretory pathway (6Arvan P. Lee J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Prabakaran D. Kim P.S. Kim K.-R. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9041-9048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Bjorkman U. Ekholm R. Ericson L.E. Endocrinology. 1978; 102: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 51Chambard M. Depetris D. Gruffat D. Gonzalvez J. Mauchamp J. Chabaud O. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, endogenously expressed Tg in PC Cl3 thyrocytes is also secreted apically and is recovered in the GEM/raft fraction (Fig. 4). Thus, whether in MDCK cells or thyrocytes, Tg is the first secretory protein demonstrated to associate with Triton X-100-insoluble membrane domains en route to the apical surface of epithelial cells. Superficially, the new findings in MDCK cells would seem to cast doubt on our previous postulate that the apical Tg targeting mechanism in thyrocytes is in some way related to, or dependent upon, sorting to the regulated secretory pathway (9Prabakaran D., S., A.R. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Arvan P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1247-1256PubMed Google Scholar). However, in light of very recent reports suggesting that two different secretory proteins may enter the regulated secretory pathway as a consequence of association with GEM/raft microdomains (25Blazquez M. Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Docherty K. Shennan K.I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it now appears that, for some cases, there are indeed important similarities in the mechanisms of regulated secretory protein sorting and apical secretory protein sorting.In PC Cl3 cells and MDCK cells, the detection of Triton X-100-insoluble Tg is limited to the Golgi/post-Golgi (endoglycosidase H-resistant) form (Figs. 1 and 2). Such detergent insolubility does not occur when the cells are lysed in octylglucoside,2 a detergent that is known to solubilize the GEM/raft fraction. Further, because these cell types secrete rather than store post-Golgi Tg, only a small quantity of cellular Tg is ever recovered in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions (Fig. 2). Once secreted into the medium, Tg is completely soluble in cold Triton X-100.2 Thus, we conclude that in MDCK and PC Cl3 cells, the detection of Triton X-100 insolubility represents a transient state of the protein that takes place during its biosynthetic transport to the plasma membrane.Although Tg is also recovered in GEMs/rafts of FRT cells (Fig. 5 A), the situation differs in two important ways. First, most Tg becomes Triton X-100-insoluble within 60 min of chase (Fig. 5 C), i.e. with a half-time that is faster than the half-time of Golgi arrival (39Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4873-4879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and indeed, a portion (albeit a minority) of the Tg recovered in the GEM/raft fraction is endoglycosidase H-sensitive (Fig. 5 B). Indeed, it appears likely (Fig. 5 D) that GEM/raft assembly may begin even in pre-Golgi or early Golgi compartments (45Muniz M. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Second, in a manner different from what has been observed in primary thyrocytes (6Arvan P. Lee J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 52Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12412-12418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Tg is not effectively secreted from FRT cells into either the apical or basolateral medium (Fig. 6 A) even at very prolonged chase times (Fig. 6 B). Instead, Tg remains cell-associated and is distributed between two predominant regions of these cells.One portion of Tg in FRT cells is extracellularly disposed on the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 8). Indeed, surface biotinylation of FRT cells indicates that apically bound surface Tg represents a significant minority of the total cellular pool (Fig. 7 B). Importantly, all of this surface Tg is recovered in GEMs/rafts (Fig. 7 C), and the apical predominance is blocked by cholesterol depletion. Thus, in FRT cells, although GPI-anchored proteins are unable to enter Triton X-100-insoluble GEMs/rafts (44Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), Tg is still able to do so. The situation is quite intriguing, as the extent and affinity of Tg association either with lipids or proteins endogenous to the GEM/raft pathway is dramatically greater in FRT than other cell types (Fig. 5). However, because FRT cells are not known to express any thyroid-specific gene products, and because cultured primary thyrocytes and PC Cl3 cells are known to secrete large quantities of Tg into the medium (Ref. 6Arvan P. Lee J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and this report), we must presume until further evidence becomes available that the absence of Tg secretion in FRT cells is atypical and not reflective of endogenous Tg trafficking in the secretory pathway of normal thyrocytes. A second portion of Tg in FRT cells is located intracellularly (Fig. 6 C) in a perinuclear distribution. This seems consistent with Tg entry into the endosome/lysosome system, as suggested by the degradation of surface-biotinylated Tg in a chloroquine-inhibitable manner (Fig. 9). Interestingly, Tg entry into the endosomal system in FRT cells is reminiscent of such entry during hormonogenesis in the thyroid gland (1Ekholm R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 120: 243-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 53Herzog V. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1984; 91: 107-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Kostrouch Z. Munari-Silem Y. Rajas F. Bernier-Valentin F. Rousset B. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2202-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Much of this endosomal Tg seems to be localized with transferrin in recycling endosomes rather than in early sorting endosomes (Fig. 10), although other endosomal compartments may also be involved in Tg trafficking in FRT cells. It will be of interest in future studies to examine whether expression of caveolin-1 in FRT cells could cause relocation of any portion of intracellular Tg from its perinuclear distribution to the cell surface (28Mora R. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A. Scherer P.E. Brown D. Lisanti M.P. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25708-25717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).Data from each of the three epithelial cell types investigated strongly suggest that Tg, the first documented member of what is certainly a larger class of apical secretory proteins, is specifically recruited into membrane carriers destined for the apical surface. The fact that newly synthesized Tg is insoluble in Triton X-100, under conditions in which some compartments are completely solubilized and most others are permeabilized, points strongly to the idea that Tg is specifically bound to one or more components of GEMs/rafts. To date, we do not know what these components are. A popular model to explain apical-selective transport is that one or more lectins incorporated into GEM/raft microdomains capture and deliver glycoprotein cargo (11Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature ( Lond. ). 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 14Yeaman C. Gall A.H.L. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Bivic A.L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 27Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Etzold T. Simons K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 55Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U. Zimmer K.P. Naim H. Naim H.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 56Benting J.H. Rietveld A.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Although this model may be plausible for Tg, we do not wish to argue that this represents the sole mechanism for all apical secretory protein targeting. First, expression of at least two regulated secretory proteins, growth hormone and parathyroid hormone (neither of which is glycosylated), leads to apical delivery in primary thyrocytes (9Prabakaran D., S., A.R. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Arvan P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1247-1256PubMed Google Scholar). Second, certain glycoproteins, such as the extensivelyO-glycosylated human neurotrophin receptor, are delivered apically in thyroid-derived FRT cells but are not incorporated into the GEM/raft fraction (33Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Further, apical pathways that are independent of glycosylation (57Marzolo M.P. Bull P. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or GEM/raft incorporation (58Alonso M.A. Fan L. Alarcon B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30748-30752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have also been described in MDCK cells.Thus, many possibilities for apical cargo delivery still exist. Nevertheless, it does appear that proteins that are recruited into GEM/raft microdomains (18Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Horber J.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) are dependent upon cellular cholesterol levels either at the level of cargo entry or at the level of delivery of the membrane carrier to the apical surface (41Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and this is certainly true for Tg (Fig. 3). At present, we speculate that of these possibilities, cholesterol might be more important in the pathway of delivery of the apical membrane carrier, because cholesterol depletion does not appear to prevent Tg recruitment into the GEM/raft fraction. 3F. Martin-Belmonte, M. A. Alonso, X. Zhang, and P. Arvan, our preliminary data. Prior to this report, two apical secretory proteins, a truncated form of alkaline phosphatase (21Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and the endogenous gp80/clusterin of MDCK cells (20Graichen R. Losch A. Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15854-15857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), were specifically tested and not recovered in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. The secretory form of alkaline phosphatase appears to exhibit identical polarized sorting to its GPI-anchored, GEM/raft-associated counterpart in FRT cells (21Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, polarized trafficking of the latter form is unaffected by cholesterol depletion and instead is perturbed by FB1, an inhibitor of glycosphingolipid synthesis (21Lipardi C. Nitsch L. Zurzolo C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By contrast, we find that apical Tg trafficking in MDCK cells is largely blocked by cellular cholesterol depletion and is unaffected by FB1 (Fig. 3). Interestingly, apical trafficking of the endogenous gp80 glycoprotein in MDCK cells is also largely blocked by cellular cholesterol treatment (41Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and is unaffected by FB1 (59Mays R.W. Siemers K.A. Fritz B.A. Lowe A.W. van Meer G. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of recovery of gp80 in GEM/raft microdomains may imply the existence of more than one kind of cholesterol-containing apical raft in MDCK cells, consistent with recent suggestions (60Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the same GEM/raft pathway used by Tg may also carry gp80, but the association is insufficiently strong for gp80 to remain intact after Triton X-100 extraction (41Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we report that Tg is the first apical secretory protein demonstrated to associate with Triton X-100-insoluble GEMs/rafts, implying a cargo-selective process. Hopefully, these findings will promote further investigations to define both cargo-selective as well as possible cargo-nonselective secretory mechanisms. The functional unit of the thyroid gland is the thyroid follicle, each follicle representing a simple epithelium in which a monolayer of thyroid epithelial cells surrounds a central (apical) lumen (1Ekholm R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 120: 243-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin (Tg),1 the thyroid hormone precursor protein and predominant gene product of the thyroid, is a large, homodimeric glycoprotein that is secreted overwhelmingly to the apical (luminal) side of thyrocytes (2Arvan P. Kim P.S. Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Muresan Z. Yoo S.E. Hossain S.A. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A failure of Tg secretion is an established cause of hypothyroidism and goiter (3Medeiros-Neto G. Targovnik H.M. Vassart G. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 165-183PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, aside from the protein folding steps that are prerequisite for its ER-to-Golgi transport (4Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) responsible for apical Tg trafficking remain undefined. In thyrocytes, it is clear that not only is thetrans-Golgi network the site of polarized sorting of surface membrane proteins (5Kuliawat R. Lisanti M.P. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2478-2482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but it is also the site of segregation of apically bound Tg away from basolaterally secreted proteins (such as thrombospondin 1, laminin, or tissue-type plasminogen activator (6Arvan P. Lee J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Prabakaran D. Kim P.S. Kim K.-R. Arvan P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 29A: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). Indeed, polarized sorting of secretory proteins shows similarities between thyrocytes and MDCK cells (9Prabakaran D., S., A.R. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Arvan P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1247-1256PubMed Google Scholar). Because in both cell types basolaterally as well as apically secreted proteins are highly polarized rather than exhibiting random distributions, the implication is that both basolateral (10Caplan M.J.

In addition to this relative lack of resolution, Pi levels vary with cell metabolism, and the chemical shift of Pi has been demonstrated to be affected by ionic strength (4Gillies R.J.

The search for improved exogenous 31P NMR pH indicators as alternatives to Pi yielded a variety of alkyl- and aminoalkylphosphonic acids having their resonance peak distinct from that of phosphorylated metabolites, and an NMR sensitivity Δδab (defined as the mean difference between the chemical shifts of the protonated δa and the unprotonated δb forms) in the range of Pi (i.e.2–3 ppm). There have been a number of studies on the in vitro properties of synthetic alkylphosphonates as 31P NMR pH probes (14Slonczewski J.L. Rosen B.P. Alger J.R. Macnab R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gillis N. Van Hecke P. Vanstapel F. NMR Biomed. 1997; 10: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), no information could be obtained on the occurrence of more acidic organelles participating in proton transport mechanisms (25Scharschmidt B.F.

By introducing an amino function in the α or β position of the alkyl group of the charged phosphonate structure, suitable NMR pH probes of lower pK a values (in the range 5.5–6.3) that entered in Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae were used to study the pH compartmentation and the kinetics of endosomal acidification (27Brénot F. Aubry L. Martin J.B. Satre M. Klein G. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the effect of ammonia on cytosolic and vesicular pH (28Davies L. Satre M. Martin J.B. Gross J.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 321-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In view of these previous results (27Brénot F. Aubry L. Martin J.B. Satre M. Klein G. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Davies L. Satre M. Martin J.B. Gross J.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 321-327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we have recently proposed that uncharged aminophosphonates that protonate at the amine function may show enhanced properties as 31P NMR pH probes in biological systems (29Pietri S. Miollan M. Martel S. Le Moigne F. Blaive B. Culcasi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19505-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A large series of such uncharged α- and β-aminophosphonates have been tested as pH markers in standard perfusion buffers and found to give access to a large range of pK a values, with a 4-fold better NMR sensitivity than Pi and other previously reported alkyl- and aminophosphonates (29Pietri S. Miollan M. Martel S. Le Moigne F. Blaive B. Culcasi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19505-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present study, the non-toxic α-aminophosphonate diethyl(2-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)phosphonate (DEPMPH), having a pK a of 6.8 at 37 °C and an extended Δδab of 9.7 ppm (29Pietri S. Miollan M. Martel S. Le Moigne F. Blaive B. Culcasi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19505-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was used to probe the pH changes occurring during ischemia/reperfusion of isolated rat hearts and livers. It was observed that DEPMPH, which did not affect the cellular phosphorylated metabolite content during ischemia in both organs, allowed for the first time the simultaneous and accurate31P NMR monitoring of extra- and intracellular pH in the normoxic and ischemic heart and liver. In the liver, use of DEPMPH as31P NMR pH probe offered the possibility to investigate in real time the ischemia-induced pH changes associated with the acidic compartments (pH < 5.5). Ultrapure DEPMPH was obtained by as described previously (30Pietri S. Liebgott T. Fréjaville C. Tordo P. Culcasi M. Eur. J Biochem. 1998; 254: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by using commercial 2-methylpyrroline and diethyl phosphite as starting material (Aldrich). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Doubly distilled deionized water was used throughout. All solutions were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter prior to use. Male Wistar rats weighing 80–100 g (liver studies) or 300–390 g (heart studies) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body mass), and the studied organ was immediately perfused at 37 °C in a non-recirculating mode either via the portal vein (liver studies) or the ascending aorta (heart studies). Isolated perfused hearts were instrumented to provide continuous monitoring of hemodynamic function as described below. The perfusion medium (pH 7.35) used in liver (heart) studies was a Krebs-Henseleit buffer consisting of 143 (144) mm Na+, 5.0 (5.8) mmK+, 2.0 (2.5) mm Ca2+, 1.2 (1.2) mm Mg2+, 127 (129.8) mmCl−, 25 (25) mm HCO3−, 1.2 (0) mmH2PO4−/HPO42−, 2.0 (1.2) mm SO42−, 0 (10McLaughlin A.C. Takeda H. Chance B. Dutton P.L. Leigh J.S. Scarpa A. Frontiers of Biological Energetics. Academic Press, New York1978: 1351-1363Crossref Google Scholar) mm glucose, and 0 (0.5) mm EDTA (throughout referred to as “standard” buffer). The buffer was saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 by using a membrane oxygenator (liver studies) or by bubbling (heart studies). Perfusion was performed at a flow rate of 3 ml·min−1·g−1liver wet weight or at a constant pressure of 100 cm of H2O in hearts. For NMR experiments, organs were inserted into a 20-mm NMR sample tube that was placed into the wide-bore 9.4-Tesla magnet of the spectrometer. In a recent study, it was found that DEPMPH did not affect base-line cardiac function when perfused up to 10 mmin normoxic rat hearts (30Pietri S. Liebgott T. Fréjaville C. Tordo P. Culcasi M. Eur. J Biochem. 1998; 254: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consequently, the selected DEPMPH concentration for all perfusion experiments was 5 mm. Liver perfusion at 37 °C (n = 6) included a 20-min perfusion with plain standard buffer followed by a 20-min normoxic perfusion with DEPMPH, 60 min of ischemia, and a final 20-min reperfusion with plain buffer. Heart perfusion at 37 °C (n = 6) included a 30-min normoxic control period followed by 30 min of no-flow normothermic ischemia and a final 60-min reperfusion. In these latter experiments, DEPMPH was added to the perfusion medium during the last 15 min of control period and the first 5 min of postischemic reflow. In matched untreated groups, livers (n = 8) or hearts (n = 7) underwent perfusion with plain buffer throughout. To test whether DEPMPH (5 mm) could be a sensitive marker of extracellular pH variations, an additional NMR experiment was carried out in which the effects of increasing the concentration of Pi or decreasing the pH of the perfusate were assessed. For this purpose, livers (n = 2) were perfused normoxically at 37 °C according to the following protocol: an initial 30-min perfusion with plain standard buffer; a 10-min perfusion with DEPMPH-supplemented standard buffer; a 10-min perfusion with a DEPMPH-supplemented buffer in which the concentration of KH2PO4 was raised to 3 mm; a 12-min perfusion with DEPMPH-, KH2PO4 (3 mm)-, and isobutyric acid (35 mm)-supplemented buffer; a 15-min perfusion with the former buffer in which isobutyric acid was omitted; and a final 20 min of perfusion with plain standard buffer. In this experiment, the liver perfusate was timely collected for pH measurement. To assess whether the different NMR resonances seen in liver experiments with DEPMPH could be related to degradation products of the pyrrolidine, livers were subjected to perfusion as in the untreated and DEPMPH (5 mm) groups described above (n = 2/group), except that organs were freeze-clamped with aluminum tongs precooled in liquid nitrogen at the end of ischemia. The frozen tissue was weighed, grounded in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized with 6 volumes of 0.9 mHClO4 (w/v) at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was neutralized by 9 n KOH as described previously (31Desmoulin F. Canioni P. Crotte C. Gérolami A. Cozzone P.J. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After a second centrifugation at 3,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was lyophilized and stored in 2 aliquots at −80 °C. An aliquot was used for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (see below) after suspension into doubly distilled deionized water. Before use for NMR spectroscopy, the second aliquot was dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O containing 50 mm EDTA, and methylene diphosphonic acid (MDPA) was added as chemical shift reference. In this latter sample, two NMR measurements were performed by consecutively adjusting its pH at 5.5 and 7.5 with KOH or HCl, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed using a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA) coupled with a Finnigan Mat TSQ700 mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) operating in electron impact mode and controlled by a Dec Station 5000/33. Helium was the carrier gas, and the column was a fused silicon 25-m capillary column OV1. Mass spectrometer settings were as follows: electron energy, 70 eV in the range 60–650 m/z, scan speed, 600m/z. The column temperature was programmed from 100–280 °C (10 °C/min) with the injector temperature fixed at 220 °C. 31P NMR spectra of isolated perfused organs and perchloric extracts were recorded at 161.9 MHz using a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a 31P/13C dual 20-mm probe. A one-pulse sequence was used to acquire spectra in 2-min blocks corresponding to 240 free induction decays obtained using a 70° flip angle, a 0.5-s repetition time, 4K data points, and a 10-kHz spectral width. A Lorentzian line broadening of 15 Hz was applied prior to Fourier transformation. All chemical shifts were expressed with respect to the resonance from a capillary of MDPA at 18.4 ppm. The peak area of the β-NTP resonance was measured by integrating the peak from the spectrum and by comparing the area with that of MDPA (13 μmol of 31P nuclei). Variations in β-NTP content were expressed as percentage of the control β-NTP level obtained during the initial perfusion period with plain buffer. pHi was estimated from the position of the intracellular Pi resonance. A one-pulse sequence was used to acquire spectra in 5-min blocks corresponding to 140 summed free induction decays obtained using a 60° pulse, a 2.151-s interpulse delay, a 8K data table, and a 9.4-kHz spectral width. A Lorentzian line broadening of 15 Hz was applied prior to Fourier transformation. The peak areas of the β-ATP and creatine phosphate (CrP) resonances were analyzed by both planimetry and an automatic integration procedure. Variations in β-ATP and CrP contents were expressed as percentage of the base-line levels obtained during the initial phase of perfusion with DEPMPH-free buffer. pHi was measured from the chemical shift of the Pi peak relative to CrP (32Jacobus W.E. Pores I.H. Lucas S.K. Kallman C.H. Weisfeldt M.L. Flaherty J.T. Nuccitelli R. Deamer D.W. Intracellular pH: Its Measurement, Regulation, and Utilization in Cellular Functions. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1982: 537-565Google Scholar). 31P NMR spectra were recorded in a 5-mm tube using a reverse probe tuned at 161.9 MHz. Instrument settings were as described in the isolated liver experiments except that acquisition time was extended to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The aim of these studies was to compare the effects of pH on the 31P NMR chemical shift of the resonance peak of DEPMPH in three environments having the ionic strength representative of either the extracellular medium (i.e. the standard Krebs- Henseleit medium described in perfusion studies), or the protein-free, or complete cytosolic medium (i.e. aqueous 125 mm KCl or a supernatant solution of a rat heart homogenate (see below) diluted in aqueous 125 mm KCl, respectively). Each of these three solutions was supplemented with KH2PO4 (1.2 mm) and DEPMPH (5 mm) and was allowed to equilibrate at 22 °C or 37 °C. The pH was then adjusted to 30 different values in the range 4.0–10.0 with 6 n solutions of HCl or NaOH and transferred into a 10-mm NMR tube for 31P NMR analysis (Bruker AMX 400 NMR spectrometer) at its corresponding equilibration temperature. The pK a values were calculated by iterative fitting of the chemical shift δ and pH data according to the standard Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation 1,pH=pKa+log[(δ−δa)/(δb−δ)]Equation 1 using a nonlinear regression (δa and δb are the protonated and unprotonated DEPMPH chemical shifts, respectively). To assess the influence of metal ions on DEPMPH resonance chemical shift, increasing concentrations of Fe3+ (5 μm to 1 mm) or Fe2+ (1 μm to 1 mm) as sulfate salts were added to a test 5 mm DEPMPH solution adjusted to pH 7.35, and31P NMR spectra were obtained at 37 °C. Heart homogenates were obtained by a modification of the method described in Ref. 32Jacobus W.E. Pores I.H. Lucas S.K. Kallman C.H. Weisfeldt M.L. Flaherty J.T. Nuccitelli R. Deamer D.W. Intracellular pH: Its Measurement, Regulation, and Utilization in Cellular Functions. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1982: 537-565Google Scholar as follows: a total of 25 g of freshly excised rat heart was minced in 35 ml of 125 mm KCl at 2 °C, homogenized in a blender for 10 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 2–3 °C, and the clear supernatant solution was used in titration experiments. 31P NMR spectra of rat livers (n = 3) perfused normoxically for 80 min with standard Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 5 mm DEPMPH were acquired at 37 °C as described above. T 1calculation was achieved using a progressive saturation experiment consisting of a pulse sequence, (90° − T a − τ]n n, with an acquisition time (T a ) of 0.18 s and τ values varying from 0.1 to 16 s. For each spectrum a total of 100 transients were acquired. A 5-Hz line broadening was applied before Fourier transformation. To allow correct T 1 estimation, spectra were first deconvoluted into Lorentzian lines. Relaxation parameters were evaluated using the same non-linear least squares fitting method to the repetition time dependence of the resonance area. To assess the effect of DEPMPH on cardiac function, additional untreated (n = 13) or DEPMPH (5 mm)-treated (n = 11) rat hearts were placed into a small water-jacketed chamber at a controlled temperature of 37 °C and underwent the ischemia-reperfusion protocol described above. Contractile function was assessed by means of a saline-filled latex balloon inserted into the left ventricle and connected to a pressure transducer (Gould Statham P23); the filling pressure was adjusted until left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was in the range 8–12 mm Hg. Throughout perfusion, LVEDP, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), and its first derivative with time (dp/dt), and heart rate were monitored at 5-min intervals (Gould 8000S recorder). Rate pressure product, an index of overall cardiac performance, was calculated as the product of heart rate and LVDP. Coronary flow was measured by timely collecting the coronary perfusate. Metabolic and hemodynamic data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Evaluation of statistical significance was performed with two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures over the different phases of the experimental protocols. If a difference was established, the values in the DEPMPH-treated groups were compared with that of the corresponding untreated groups using the Newman-Keuls test. One-way analysis of variance was then carried out to test for any differences among the mean values of the different groups at every time, and this was followed by the Duncan test. Significance was accepted at the p < 0.05 level. When necessary, significance values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with use of the Bonferroni correction. Animal care and handling conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (33United States Department of Health and Human Services (1985) NIH Publication 85-23Google Scholar). The variation of the 31P NMR chemical shift of DEPMPH (5 mm) was determined as a function of pH at 22 and 37 °C in the standard Krebs-Henseleit medium used for heart studies which contained 1.2 mm Pi (ionic strength 164 mm). The results in Table Ishow that, in this medium, the apparent pK a of DEPMPH is in the physiological range and that the sensitivity Δδab of the pyrrolidine as a pH marker is about 3.6 times higher than that of Pi at both tested temperatures. These variables did not significantly vary when titrations were performed either in an aqueous solution of physiological cellular ionic strength (i.e. aqueous 125 mm KCl; ionic strength 125 mm) or in a KCl (125 mm)-supplemented rat heart homogenate taken as a complete intracellular medium (Table I). These latter data showed that pH measurement from DEPMPH 31P NMR chemical shift is rather insensitive to the release of cytosolic proteins or to changes in ionic concentrations within physiological limits. Since phosphates are good ion chelators and since ischemia/reperfusion of isolated organs has been shown to trigger the release of metal ions, including Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions (34Voogd A. Sluiter W. van Eijk H.G. Koster J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the effect on the chemical shift of DEPMPH of adding iron ions to the Krebs medium has been examined. Supplementing the Krebs medium with concentrations of Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions in large excess of the physiological range (i.e. 1 μm to 1 mm) at pH 7.35 had no displacing effect on the chemical shift of DEPMPH (data not shown).Table IEffect of milieu and temperature on pH-dependent 31 P NMR parameters of DEPMPH (5 mm) and Pi (1.2 mm)Chemical shift (ppm)22 °C37 °CδaδbΔδabpK aδaδbΔδabpK aKH2PO4 (Pi) Krebs-Henseleit−0.10 ± 0.002.46 ± 0.032.56 ± 0.036.70 ± 0.02−0.02 ± 0.012.63 ± 0.012.65 ± 0.016.69 ± 0.02 KCl 125 mm−0.12 ± 0.042.47 ± 0.042.59 ± 0.056.73 ± 0.02−0.10 ± 0.042.78 ± 0.062.88 ± 0.106.70 ± 0.03 Heart homogenate + KCl (125 mm)−0.15 ± 0.022.45 ± 0.022.60 ± 0.046.78 ± 0.02−0.10 ± 0.052.75 ± 0.072.85 ± 0.116.75 ± 0.03DEPMPH Krebs-Henseleit23.08 ± 0.0632.85 ± 0.069.77 ± 0.117.01 ± 0.0223.15 ± 0.0632.73 ± 0.049.58 ± 0.096.81 ± 0.02 KCl 125 mm23.15 ± 0.0532.82 ± 0.059.67 ± 0.106.96 ± 0.0223.27 ± 0.0532.75 ± 0.059.48 ± 0.106.85 ± 0.03 Heart homogenate + KCl (125 mm)23.14 ± 0.0532.81 ± 0.059.67 ± 0.107.09 ± 0.0223.23 ± 0.0532.86 ± 0.069.63 ± 0.1116.85 ± 0.04The composition of Krebs-Henseleit medium used in heart studies, the preparation of rat heart homogenates, and the protocol for titrations were described under “Materials and Methods.” Values are means ± S.D. from three independent experiments. δa, limiting chemical shift in acidic medium; δb, limiting chemical shift in basic medium; Δδab = δa − δb.

During normoxia, when DEPMPH was added to the perfusion medium at 5 mm, no significant alteration of the base-line metabolic variables or pHi was observed as compared with livers perfused with plain buffer (TableII). This pre-ischemic perfusion of DEPMPH had also no effect on ischemia-induced decrease of the levels of phosphorylated metabolites and pHi , and on post-ischemic recovery of metabolic variables of livers reperfused with plain buffer (Table II and Fig. 1, C and D).Table IIEffect of DEPMPH on metabolic variables in perfused rat liversGroupMetabolic variablesBuffer, 20 minBuffer + DEPMPH, 40 minTotal ischemiaReperfusion with buffer 20 min25 min60 minUntreatedβ-NTP (%)10089.6 ± 4.95.2 ± 0.4NM59.6 ± 3.7(n = 8)pHi7.19 ± 0.037.19 ± 0.046.34 ± 0.046.24 ± 0.037.17 ± 0.02DEPMPHβ-NTP (%)10084.6 ± 3.954.4 ± 0.5NM50.0 ± 4.7(n= 6)pHi7.19 ± 0.037.14 ± 0.056.33 ± 0.096.29 ± 0.097.14 ± 0.03DEPMPH (5 mm) was added to the Krebs-Henseleit buffer during the last 20 min of the 40-min normoxic period.

Recently, the peptoid PD168368 was found to be a potent selective neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) antagonist. To investigate the molecular basis for its selectivity for the NMBR over the closely related receptor for gastrin-releasing peptide (GRPR), we used a chimeric receptor approach and a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Mutated receptors were transiently expressed in Balb 3T3. The extracellular domains of the NMBR were not important for the selectivity of PD168368. However, substitution of the 5th upper transmembrane domain (uTM5) of the NMBR by the comparable GRPR domains decreased the affinity 16-fold. When the reverse study was performed by substituting the uTM5 of NMBR into the GRPR, a 9-fold increase in affinity occurred. Each of the 4 amino acids that differed between NMBR and GRPR in the uTM5 region were exchanged, but only the substitution of Phe220 for Tyr in the NMBR caused a decrease in affinity. When the reverse study was performed to attempt to demonstrate a gain of affinity in the GRPR, the substitution of Tyr219 for Phe caused an increase in affinity. These results suggest that the hydroxyl group of Tyr220 in uTM5 of NMBR plays a critical role for high selectivity of PD168368 for NMBR over GRPR. Receptor and ligand modeling suggests that the hydroxyl of the Tyr220 interacts with nitrophenyl group of PD168368 likely primarily by hydrogen bonding. This result shows the selectivity of the peptoid PD168368, similar to that reported for numerous non-peptide analogues with other G protein-coupled receptors, is primarily dependent on interaction with transmembrane amino acids.

Melchiorri P. Negri L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 547: 1-541Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These peptides mediate a spectrum of biological activities by binding to two structurally and pharmacologically distinct receptors, the NMB receptor (NMBR) and GRP receptor (GRPR) (19Corjay M.H.

The NMBR and GRPR are members of the bombesin receptor family within the GPCR superfamily and share ∼50% overall amino acid sequence identity (19Corjay M.H. Dobrzanski D.J. Way J.M. Viallet J.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 547: 1-541Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the potential physiological role of GRP and its receptor has been a major focus of research (18Tache Y. Melchiorri P. Negri L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 547: 1-541Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 20Kroog G.S. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the role of NMB in physiological or pathophysiological processes has received much less attention. Some studies suggest that NMB may play an important role in a number of biological processes, including causing growth of some tumor cells (31Moody T.W. Staley J. Zia F. Coy D.H. Jensen R.T. J.

Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, which of these are physiological or the principal roles of NMBR activation in pathological processes remains unclear. The development of selective, high affinity NMBR agonists and antagonists would enable a more precise definition of the role of NMB in these processes.In contrast to GRPR antagonists for which numerous classes of high affinity antagonists have been described (38Jensen R.T. Coy D.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 13-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the discovery process for NMBR antagonists has been slower. None of the strategies successfully used previously yielded potent antagonists when applied to the NMBR (38Jensen R.T. Coy D.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 13-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 39Lin J.T. Coy D.H. Mantey S.A. Jensen R.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 285-295PubMed Google Scholar). However, a peptoid based on a 3-amino acid template, PD165929, was recently characterized as a high affinity NMBR antagonist (10Eden J.M. Hall M.D. Higginbottom M. Horwell D.C. Howson W. Hughes J. Jordan R.E. Lewthwaite R.A. Martin K. McKnight A.T. O'Toole J.C. Pinnock R.D. Pritchard M.C. Suman-Chauhan N. Williams S.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 2617-2622Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we evaluated the pharmacology of a second generation peptoid from this series, PD168368 (40Ryan R.R. Katsuno T. Mantey S.A. Pradhan T.P. Weber H.C. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. J. Exp. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 290: 1202-1211PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ashwood V. Brownhill V. Higginbottom M. Horwell D.C. Hughes J.

The results confirmed that PD168368 was a potent and selective antagonist for NMBR over GRPR regardless of species origin, which could prove generally useful in understanding the role of NMBR in physiological and pathological processes.To attempt to provide insight into the molecular basis of the specificity of the peptoid PD168368 for the NMBR receptor, in the present study we have investigated in detail the high affinity of PD168368 for the NMBR, and its selectivity for the NMBR over the GRPR using a chimeric and mutagenesis approach. To identify which domains of the NMBR are important for high affinity binding of PD168368, we used a chimeric receptor approach, which has proven useful in elucidating the structural basis of GPCR interaction with ligands (42Fathi Z. Benya R.V. Shapira H. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14622-14626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A site-directed mutagenesis approach was then used to identify critical amino acid(s) within these domains. Here we report the peptoid antagonist PD168368's selectivity for the NMBR over the GRPR depends primarily on an interaction with amino acids in the 5th upper transmembrane region of the NMBR. Detailed site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that Tyr220 in this region is a key amino acid for high affinity PD168368 binding. Computer modeling of the receptor and analysis of the ligand support the conclusion that PD168368 interacts with the hydroxyl group of Tyr220 principally through hydrogen bonding.DISCUSSIONThere are now more than 30 GPCRs mediating the action of GI hormones or neurotransmitters such as bradykinin, GRP, or cholecystokinin (CCK) (53Jensen R.T. Lewis J.H. Dubois A. Current Clinical Topics in Gastrointestinal Pharmacology. Blackwell Science, Inc., Malden, MA1997: 144-223Google Scholar). In most cases their roles in physiological processes or in pathological conditions are still unclear because only recently have high affinity antagonists been developed for some of these receptors. The antagonists for these receptors generally fall into one of three types: peptide antagonists, nonpeptide antagonists, or peptoid antagonists, which have features of both peptides and nonpeptides (1Horwell D.C. Howson W. Rees D.C. Drug Des. Discov. 1994; 12: 63-75PubMed Google Scholar, 2Horwell D.C. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 132-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In general the molecular basis of action of these antagonists is poorly understood, and it is unclear whether it is similar to the well studied adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonists (54Gouldson P.R.

In this study we examined the molecular basis of action of the novel peptoid receptor antagonist PD168368, which is reported to be selective for the NMBR in the bombesin family of receptors (10Eden J.M. Hall M.D. Higginbottom M. Horwell D.C. Howson W. Hughes J. Jordan R.E. Lewthwaite R.A. Martin K. McKnight A.T. O'Toole J.C. Pinnock R.D. Pritchard M.C. Suman-Chauhan N. Williams S.C. Bioorg. Med.

Williams S.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 8: 2589-2594Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar).A number of our results support the conclusion that the NMBR receptor extracellular domains do not play a prominent role in determining the selectivity of PD168368 for NMBR over the structurally closely related receptor, the GRPR. First, when extracellular domains of the GRPR were substituted into the NMBR to assess loss of affinity for PD168368, only the substitution of the 3rd extracellular domain in the NMBR by the comparable domain of the GRPR altered affinity and the decrease in affinity was less than 2-fold. Second, when the reverse study was performed by substituting into the GRPR the extracellular domain of the NMBR to produce gain of affinity chimeras, only the substitution of the 3rd extracellular domain in the GRPR by the comparable domain of the NMBR altered affinity causing an almost 3-fold increase for PD168368. The contribution of the 3rd extracellular domain for high selectivity of PD168368 was small compared with the almost 40-fold higher affinity PD168368 had for the native NMBR over GRPR. These results therefore suggest that differences in the 3rd extracellular domain of these two receptors play only a small role in the selectivity of PD168368. This result has both similarities and differences from studies on the interaction of peptide and nonpeptide agonists and antagonists with other GPCRs. Mutagenesis and biophysical analyses of several GPCRs indicate that the receptor extracellular domain can be an important receptor region for determining high affinity ligand binding (16Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Only a few studies have explored whether peptide antagonists interacting with receptor extracellular domains. Such an interaction is important for determining high affinity of the peptide antagonist JMV179 for the human CCK-A receptor (12Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Fehrentz J.A. Poirot S. Maigret B. Moroder L. Gully D. Martinez J. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20457-20464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, for other peptide antagonists such as the interaction ofd-Arg-[Hyp3,d-Phe7]bradykinin (NPC567) with the B2 bradykinin receptor (57Nardone J. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and BQ-123 with the endothelin A (ET-A) receptor (13Krystek Jr., S.R. Patel P.S. Rose P.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12383-12386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the receptor extracellular domains are not important for high affinity interaction. Numerous studies show that with most nonpeptide antagonists such as the interaction of losartan with the AT1b angiotensin II receptor, L365,260 with the CCK-B/gastrin receptor, or BMS-182874 with the ET-A receptor, the extracellular region does not contain important determinants for high affinity interaction (11Beinborn M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16533-16536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, interaction of nonpeptide substance P antagonist CP96345 with the 3rd extracellular domain of the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor is important for determining selectivity for this receptor (61Sachais B.S. Snider R.M. Lowe III, J.A. Krause J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2319-2323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For a number of peptide GI receptor neurotransmitter/hormones that function as agonists high affinity receptor binding has been shown to dependent on interaction with receptor extracellular domain, including CCK-8 with the CCK-A or CCK-B receptor (62Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), bradykinin with B2bradykinin receptor (63Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25664-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, with many nonpeptide agonists such as α- and β-adrenergic agents, nucleosides, eicosanoids, muscarinic cholinergic agents, and lipid moieties, the extracellular receptor domains are not important generally in determining receptor selectivity and high affinity interaction (17Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). However, with small molecular nonpeptide agonists for the G protein-coupled Ca2+-sensing receptor; Ca2+ and Gd3+ interaction with the large NH2-terminal extracellular segment of the receptor is important for high affinity interaction (65Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J. Garrett J.E. Alasti N. Hung B.C. Simin R.T. Levinthal C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 642-648PubMed Google Scholar).Because the extracellular domains play only a minor role in the selectivity of PD168368 for the NMBR over the GRPR, we applied a similar chimeric approach to the receptor's upper transmembrane region, which is also likely to interact with small ligands (16Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 17Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Our results support the conclusion that amino acids in the 5th upper transmembrane region play a major role, and in the 6th upper transmembrane region a minor role in determining the high selectivity of PD168368 for the NMBR over the GRPR. In contrast, the amino acids in the other five upper transmembrane regions did not play a significant role in this ligand's selectivity. The importance of the 5th upper transmembrane region for PD168368 selectivity is consistent with the interaction of some small ligands (α- and β-adrenergic agents, nucleosides, eicosanoids, or muscarinic cholinergic agents) (16Strader C.D.

Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17299-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). High affinity receptor binding of some peptide agonists have been shown to primarily depend on interactions with the receptor upper transmembrane domains. This includes interaction of various peptide agonists with angiotensin II receptor (66Hunyady L. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol.

We report here experimental evidence for the direct interaction of p13 SUC1 with a model CDC25 peptide, dependent on the phosphorylation state of its threonine. Chemical shift perturbation of backbone1HN, 15N, and13Cα resonances during NMR titration experiments allows accurate identification of the binding site, primarily localized around the anion-binding site, occupied in the crystal structure of the homologous p9 CKSHs2 by a sulfate molecule.

No direct interaction between the PIN1 WW domain or its catalytic proline cis/trans-isomerase domain and p13 SUC1 was detected, but our study showed that in vitro the WW domain of the human PIN1 antagonizes the binding of the p13 SUC1 to the CDC25 phosphopeptide, by binding to the same phosphoepitope. We thus propose that the full cyclin-dependent kinase complex stimulates the phosphorylation of CDC25 through binding of its p13 SUC1 module to the phosphoepitope of the substrate and that the reported WW antagonism of p13 SUC1 -stimulated CDC25 phosphorylation is caused by competitive binding of both protein modules to the same phosphoepitope.

The complex consists of a regulatory subunit, the cyclin, and a catalytic subunit, the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK).1 This latter specifically recognizes the serine/threonine-proline motif, and a structural basis for the proline preference has been recently described (1Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A complex interplay of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by and of the complex regulates tightly the cell cycle; at the G2/M transition, for example, the activation of the complex requires dephosphorylation of the CDK Thr-14 and Tyr-15 residues by the phosphatase CDC25. CDC25 is highly phosphorylated at mitosis, in part by the CDK complex that carries out the up-regulation of CDC25 activity. The hyperphosphorylated CDC25 activates in turn the CDK complex, creating a positive feedback loop. The kinase complex contains, in addition to the cyclin and the CDK, a small essential regulatory protein, called CKS (cyclin-dependent kinase subunit), whose function is not precisely known. Depletion and overexpression of CKS caused a G2 delay or abolished entry into mitosis, and in the latter case, accumulation of inactive kinase molecules phosphorylated on Tyr-15 (2Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro CKS enhances the phosphorylation of the CDC25, even though the kinase activity of the CDK complex is not directly modified by the CKS binding, suggesting a role for CKS in substrate recognition (4Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A similar stimulation of phosphorylation of a CDK substrate by CKS was demonstrated in the case of the CDC27 substrate in the proteasome (5Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2549-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the CKS from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, commonly called the p13 SUC1 protein, can bind the proteasome in a phosphorylation-dependent way (6Sudakin V. Steinberg M. Ganoth D. Hershko J. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18051-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This evidence leads to a commonly accepted picture where the CKS subunit of the CDK complex targets the activated complex (7Egan E.A. Solomon M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3659-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to specific phosphoproteins, such as the CDC25 phosphatase. The presence of a conserved anion-binding site at the surface of CKS molecule, occupied in the crystal structure of human p9 CKSHs2 by a sulfate molecule (8Parge H.E. Arvai A.S. Murtari D.J.

Biol. 1995; 249: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), gives some structural basis to this hypothesis, although no structural data on CKS with a bona fide substrate have been reported. PIN1 is another essential regulator at mitotic entry that binds mitosis-specific phosphoproteins such as CDC25 (10Lu K. Hanes S. Hunter T.

The human PIN1 protein contains two domains, a 100-residue prolyl cis/trans-isomerase C-terminal catalytic domain and a small N-terminal WW domain (15Sudol M. Bork P. Einbond A. Kastury K. Druck T. Negrini M. Huebner K. Lehman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14733-14741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The WW domain of the human PIN1 is responsible for the binding to the Thr(P)/Ser(P)-proline motifs (16Lu P.J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain shows specificity for the Thr(P)/Ser(P)-Pro bond. Both site-specific catalytic activity and binding are essential for PIN1 biological activity (16Lu P.J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 17Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A functional interplay between the PIN1 protein and the CDK complex was recently demonstrated, as PIN1 completely abolishes the stimulation of the CDK-mediated phosphorylation of CDC25 by CKS (4Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, only the WW domain seems to be involved in this antagonistic action (4Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similar to the CKS protein, PIN1 does not affect the CDK kinase activity directly, at least in vitro, suggesting that competition between CKS and the WW domain for the phosphorylated substrate might be at the origin of the antagonistic action of PIN1. NMR spectroscopy is most suitable to investigate potential molecular interactions and can lead to accurate values of interaction constants but also to mapping of the residues implicated in the interaction (both on the protein target and the peptidic ligand), kinetic parameters related to interaction and/or catalysis, and eventually a structural model of the interaction complex. We report here the results of our NMR study to determine whether the CKS protein indeed binds phosphorylated substrates, such as a model CDC25 peptide containing a Thr(P). We found a phosphorylation-dependent binding of p13 SUC1 to the peptide substrate, and we mapped the interaction site by a chemical shift perturbation method. The importance of the proline residue at position +1 following the Thr(P), as in the threonine-proline motif corresponding to the minimal CDK recognition site, was demonstrated. The affinity of p13 SUC1 for a phosphopeptide containing an alanine/proline substitution at position +1 following the Thr(P) was indeed significantly decreased. Finally, we checked whether the antagonism between the WW domain of PIN1 and CKS for the phosphorylation of CDC25 could be due to direct interaction between both proteins or, alternatively, to their competition for binding the phosphorylated substrate. No direct interaction was detected, confirming that the competition for the same substrate is the underlying molecular mechanism of the observed antagonism. p13 SUC1 (Swissprot accession numberP08463) and p13PA90 were expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) using the T7 promoter-based vector pRK172 (18Brizuela L.

P13PA90 was purified by anion exchange with a Q-HyperD column (Biosepra, Marlborough, MA) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, followed by gel filtration with a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Tris-HCl, 50 mm, pH 8.0, and finally by reverse phase chromatography with a Poros 50R1 column (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and developed with an acetonitrile gradient. Synthesis of phosphopeptides is as described (20Landrieu I. De Veyder L. Fruchart J.-S. Odaert B. Casteels P. Portetelle D. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10577-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The 10-amino acid phospho-CDC25 peptide used in this study is derived from the conserved Thr(P)-Pro site at Thr-48 of CDC25 of Xenopus laevis (Swissprot accession number P30309); the exact sequence is QPLpTPVTDL. The human WW domain from PIN1 (Swissprot accession number Q13526) was obtained by chemical synthesis and purified by reverse phase with a C18 Hyperprep column. All the NMR experiments were performed in a buffer of 50 mm deuterated Tris-HCl, pH 6.3 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mmDTT. The spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Bruker 600-MHz DMX spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). Sequential backbone resonance assignment of p13PA90 was achieved using the following three pairs of triple resonance (three-dimensional) experiments: HNCA/HN(CO)CA, HNCO/HN(CA)CO, and 15N-edited HSQC NOESY/15N-edited HSQC TOCSY as will be described elsewhere. 2B. Odaert, I. Landrieu, G. Schuurman-Wolters, G. Lippens, and R. Scheek, manuscript in preparation. Increasing amounts of unlabeled synthetic peptide of sequence EQPLpTPVTDL (phospho-CDC25 peptide) or EQPLpTAVTDL (Ala/Pro-substituted phospho-CDC25 peptide) were added to a [15N,13C]p13PA90 sample. Final concentrations were successively 0.83/0.22, 0.82/0.40, 0.78/0.80, 0.70/1.7, 0.66/2.2, and 0.66/3.5 mm for the p13PA90/phospho-CDC25 peptide sample and 0.66/0.33, 0.66/0.66, 0.66/1.32, 0.66/2.0, and 0.66/3.3 mm for the p13PA90/Ala/Pro-substituted phospho-CDC25 peptide sample. 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were recorded at each titration point. The backbone 1HN, 15N, and13Cα resonances of the ligand-bound p13PA90 protein were unambiguously assigned by three-dimensional HNCA experiments. The binding constant was calculated by fitting the formula, Δppm = 0.5 Δppmmax (1 + X +Kd /[p13PA90) − ((1 + X +Kd/[p13PA90])2 − 4 X)1/2 to the observed resonances, with Δppm as the observed 1HN and 15N combined chemical shift (see Fig. 2 legend), Δppmmax as the maximum shift at saturation with the peptide, Kd as the dissociation constant, and X as the molar ratio of phosphorylated peptide on protein concentration [p13PA90]. Control experiments were performed by adding 1 mm EQPLTPVTDL (unphosphorylated control peptide) to a 0.27 mm[15N,13C]p13PA90 sample or 2.2 mmEQPLpTPVTDL to a 0.85 mm[15N,13C]p13 SUC1 sample. For the phosphate titration, an increasing amount of sodium phosphate, pH 6.3, was added to a 2 mm p13PA90 sample. In the competition experiment against the WW domain, the sample contained 0.48 mm p13PA90, 0.48 mm WW, and 0.48 mmphospho-CDC25 peptide. To check the effect of the catalytic domain of PIN, the samples contained 0.48 mm p13PA90 and 0.48 mm PIN1At from Arabidopsis thaliana (20Landrieu I. De Veyder L. Fruchart J.-S. Odaert B. Casteels P.

In a first phase of this work, we performed the sequence assignment of the wild-type p13 SUC1 molecule by triple resonance spectroscopy on a 15N,13C doubly labeled sample.2 However, due to conformational heterogeneity, 10 amide functions proved to be broadened beyond detection in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. Mutation of the β-hinge Pro-90 to Ala, previously described to enhance the stability of the protein (21Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Sánchez del Pino M. Itzhaki L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), allowed us to almost complete the assignment, with only Arg-39 that could not be attributed. All resonances observed in both the wild-type p13 SUC1 and the mutant p13PA90 protein are virtually identical, confirming that both proteins share a common three-dimensional structure. Chemical shift analysis and observation of medium range nuclear Overhauser effect signals indicated that the secondary structure in solution for both proteins is similar to the crystal structure of the monomeric globular form of p13 SUC1 (22Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Brown N. Rasmussen B. Nurse P. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).2 To analyze the interaction between p13PA90 and a phosphorylated substrate, we titrated a synthetic phosphorylated peptide of CDC25 into a 15N,13C-labeled p13PA90 protein sample, and we observed chemical shift changes in the corresponding HSQC spectra (Fig. 1, A and B, and Fig. 2 A and B). Peptide addition affected the p13PA90 amide1HN and/or 15N chemical shift values in either of the following ways. Gradual, be it large, chemical shift changes were observed upon binding for some residues as follows: His-26, Arg-30, Tyr-31, His-40, Thr-77, Leu-80, Gly-81, Phe-97, Arg-99, and Glu-100 showed composite chemical shift perturbations above 0.5 ppm (Fig. 1 B and Fig. 2). Other signals of peptidic groups disappeared from the spectra during the titration (Gln-78, Ser-79, Trp-82, lateral chain of Trp-82) until an excess of ligand was added (Fig. 1 A). The Gln-78 amide group did not emerge until our maximum molar ratio of 1:5. Although for one interacting system, the thermodynamic (Kd) and kinetic (kon and koff) parameters are constant, the NMR behavior of the resonances can be quite different according to the change in chemical shift that a nucleus undergoes upon interaction. For nuclei that are not involved directly in the interaction, we expect a relatively small chemical shift perturbation, leading to the case of rapid exchange (kexch > Δω), with the observation of an averaged resonance line (Fig. 1,B–D). For resonances that undergo larger chemical shift perturbations, intermediate exchange will contribute significantly to the apparent line broadening. Upon saturation with ligand, all binding sites become constitutively occupied, leading to reappearance of the lines (Fig. 1 A). Based on the gradual chemical shift perturbation observed for 5 residues during the peptide titration (residues Glu-37, Val-41, Gly-81, Glu-83, and Lys-98), we estimated the affinity constant to be on the order of 900 ± 260 μm (Fig. 2 B). The combined1HN-15N perturbations were confirmed by the chemical shift perturbation of the 13Cα (data not shown), which also gave information on the proline residues. None of the 7 prolines found in p13PA90 showed perturbation of the13Cα chemical shift upon phospho-CDC25 titration. The interactions are mainly localized in the β-sheet of p13PA90. Large chemical shift modifications were observed for the conserved surface residues forming the sulfate-binding site (8Parge H.E. Arvai A.S. Murtari D.J. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Arvai A. Bourne Y. Hickey M. Tainer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which are residues Arg-30, Arg-39, Gln-78, Trp-82, and Arg-99 in p13 SUC1 . These residues are most likely in direct contact with the phosphorylated CDC25 peptide. The largest perturbations were observed in the loop connecting helix-α3 and the β3-strand of the β-sheet (Fig. 2 A and Fig. 3). The other smaller resonance perturbations corresponded to neighboring residues, with similar small chemical shift perturbation of residues located in the α3-helix (Glu-68, Glu-69, Glu-70, Arg-72, and Gly-73). As a control, we also recorded an HSQC spectra of the p13 SUC1 wild-type protein in the presence of an excess of phosphorylated CDC25 peptide, and we found identical perturbations as those of the mutant protein for all the resonances that could be observed (data not shown). The observed interaction is specific for the phosphorylated peptide, as no modification of the p13PA90 resonances was observed upon addition of the non-phosphorylated control peptide (data not shown). However, the addition of inorganic phosphate did cause chemical shift perturbation of the same residues implicated in the phospho-peptide binding. The perturbations were, however, less important, and a binding constant of 40 mm was estimated. This indicated that in addition to the phosphate group on the threonine, other contacts were involved in the binding of the phosphopeptide by the p13PA90. As the motif threonine-proline is the minimal recognition site of the CDK, we wanted to test if the CKS had a similar specificity for the proline at position +1. The NMR titration experiment was repeated with a modified phospho-CDC25 peptide that contained an alanine instead of a proline at the position +1 following the Thr(P). The residues that showed major changes upon binding of the original phospho-CDC25 peptide (Gln-78, Ser-79, and Trp-82) were also affected by addition of the Pro/Ala-substituted phospho-CDC25 peptide, but at an equivalent molar ratio of peptide to p13PA90 protein, the chemical shift perturbations observed upon addition of Pro/Ala-substituted phospho-CDC25 peptide were far inferior to the equivalent results obtained with the phospho-CDC25 peptide (Fig.1 and Fig. 2 B). The dissociation constant Kd was estimated by a titration experiment, based on the chemical shift change observed for 5 residues (Thr-77, Gln-78, Gly-81, Trp-82, and Lys-98) to be 5.4 ± 1 mm, a 6-fold increase compared with the dissociation constant for the phospho-CDC25 peptide (Fig. 2 B). The proline residue at position +1 is thus clearly involved in the recognition of the substrate by the p13 SUC1 protein, as could be expected for an adaptor protein of the CDK complex to its substrate. We next asked whether p13 SUC1 and PIN1 interact through the WW and/or the catalytic domain of the latter, affecting potentially the binding of p13 SUC1 to the phospho-CDC25 peptide. The resonances of p13PA90 in the 1H-15N HSQC were not significantly affected by addition of an equimolar amount of WW domain alone, and no catalytic activity of the prolyl cis/trans-isomerase domain PIN1At from A. thaliana on the Glu-91—Pro-92 motif of p13PA90 was observed. This precludes a direct interaction between PIN1 and CKS to be at the basis of the functional antagonism between both molecules (4Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The WW domain of PIN1 was previously shown to bind to the phospho-CDC25 peptide (16Lu P.J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). This interaction was indeed verified by NMR spectroscopy, and the molecular contacts between the CDC25 peptide and the WW domain agreed with the recent structural data (30Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noël J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) on the complex between PIN1 and a peptide representing a heptad repeat of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain of the large subunits. 3R. Wintjens, G. Lippens, and I. Landrieu, submitted for publication. More importantly, we could follow the molecular competition between PIN1 and CKS by adding the WW domain to a 0.8 mm [15N,13C]p13PA90/0.8 mm phospho-CDC25 sample. After addition of non-labeled WW, resulting in final concentrations of 0.5 mm p13PA90/0.5 mm WW/0.5 mm phospho-CDC25 peptide, we observed a significant decrease in the chemical shift perturbation of the p13PA90 resonances (Fig. 4). The p13PA90 resonances observed in the presence of WW were shifted back at a position roughly equivalent to the ones observed in the sample 0.8 mm p13PA90/0.25 mm phospho-CDC25. This showed that an important fraction of the phospho-CDC25 peptide is unavailable to p13PA90 binding, due to competitive binding of the WW domain. Addition of the prolyl cis/trans-isomerase catalytic domain PIN1At of A. thaliana to a p13PA90/phospho-CDC25 sample to final concentrations of 0.35 mm p13PA90/0.35 mm PIN1At/1 mmphospho-CDC25 did not result in significant modifications of the HSQC spectra compared with the equivalent spectra of a 1:3 p13PA90/phospho-CDC25 sample without PIN1At, although the phospho-CDC25 peptide was a good substrate for the PIN1At enzyme (data not shown (20Landrieu I. De Veyder L. Fruchart J.-S. Odaert B. Casteels P. Portetelle D. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10577-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)). We therefore conclude that the catalytic domain of PIN1At alone does not affect directly the binding of the p13PA90 to the phospho-CDC25 peptide. We have shown by NMR chemical shift perturbation mapping that p13 SUC1 is able to bind a phosphopeptide corresponding to a fragment of CDC25 centered on Thr-48. As revealed by large chemical shift perturbations, the residues involved in the binding correspond primarily to the conserved sulfate-binding site (Arg-30, Gln-78, Trp-82, and Arg-99) reported in an earlier structural study of the p9 CKSHs2 homologue (8Parge H.E. Arvai A.S. Murtari D.J. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Arvai A. Bourne Y. Hickey M. Tainer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The largest perturbations were observed in the loop connecting the α3-helix and the β3-strand (Thr-77, Gln-78, Ser-79, Leu-80, Gly-81, and Trp-82). The other smaller observed perturbations correspond to neighboring residues in the β-sheet and to residues from helix-α3. The interaction was shown to be dependent on the phosphorylation of the Thr and to involve the Pro at position +1 following the Thr(P). Although the exact motif recognized by the CKS could be even more specific, the Ser/Thr kinase that generates this motif was previously shown to be proline-directed (1Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Based on our results, we propose that the stimulation of the CDC25 phosphorylation by the CDK complex in the presence of CKS (4Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) is mediated by binding of the CKS to the CDC25 substrate. The estimated dissociation constant of the order of 1 mm is rather low but could be higher when the full protein rather than a peptide is the substrate. A second factor contributing potentially to an increased affinity might be the stabilization of the highly flexible β-sheet of CKS by the binding to the CDK kinase. The affinity of the CKS for the CDK complex is high (18Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) (the Kd is estimated to be about 100 nm (23Morris M.C. Heitz F. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14257-14266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)), and most probably the CKS will only interact with its substrate when it is itself bound to the CDK kinase. Finally, if the CKS has to target the CDK complex to its substrate, a high turnover might be necessary, with preference of weak over strong binding constants. It was recently shown that PIN1 completely abolishes the stimulation of the CDK-mediated phosphorylation of CDC25 by CKS, although neither p13 SUC1 nor PIN1 affect directly the CDK activity, at least in vitro (4Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We first tested if PIN1 had any interaction with the CKS protein. The conserved EP motif found in the β-hinge of the CKS could indeed be a potential substrate of the catalytic prolyl cis/trans-isomerase domain of PIN1 (11Ranganathan R. Lu K. Hunter T. Noel J. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 12Yaffe M. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X. Stukenberg P. Rahfeld J. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M. Fischer G. Cantley L. Lu K. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). This β-hinge plays an important role in the binding of CKS to the CDK (24Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,25Watson M.H. Bourne Y. Arvai A.S. Hickey M.J. Santiago A. Bernstein S.L. Tainer J.A. Reed S.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in the stability and folding of the CKS protein (21Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Sánchez del Pino M. Itzhaki L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).2 We did not observe by NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis any significant binding to or modification of p13PA90 by the PIN1At catalytic domain of A. thaliana. The PIN1At enzyme had also no effect on the binding of the phospho-CDC25 peptide by p13PA90, although we observed catalysis of the cis/trans-isomerization of the Thr(P)-Pro bound contained in the phospho-CDC25 peptide (20Landrieu I. De Veyder L. Fruchart J.-S. Odaert B. Casteels P. Portetelle D. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10577-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Not only the catalytic domain but also the WW domain of human PIN1 does not interact directly with p13 SUC1 . However, it does bind to the same Thr(P)-Pro motif as CKS, classifying both of them as proline-directed phosphothreonine-binding modules. This differentiates them from another sequence-specific phosphopeptide-binding protein, the 14-3-3 protein (26Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 27Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar), that is also involved in CDC25 binding and regulation of the entry into mitosis (28Peng C.Y.

The distinction can be further extended to the structural level, with WW and CKS both being mainly β-sheet proteins that use their β-sheet to construct the binding site (16Lu P.J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), whereas the anion-binding site on the 14-3-3 protein is located on a surface composed of α-helices (27Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). The structure of the protein PIN1 in complex with a phosphoserine-containing peptide shows that the proline is recognized by aromatic residues Tyr-23 and Trp-34 on the WW domain and that the Ser(P) is in direct contact with residues Ser-16 and Arg-17 located in the loop I connecting the strand β1 and β2 (30Verdecia M.A. Bowman M.E. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noël J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The recognition is highly selective but of low affinity, consistent with our results. Recognition of Pro-rich ligand peptides by a different type of WW domain was shown to be similar to that found in SH3 complexes, although both protein modules have different structures (31Zarrinpar A. Wendell A.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). That this might result in a molecular competition is indicated by the polyproline region of formin binding interchangeably to the WW or SH3 domain of a formin-binding protein (32Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The WW domains of formin might therefore regulate the function of the SH3 domains by modulating their interaction with ligand peptides through direct competition for the same Pro-rich sequence (32Sudol M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Bedford M.T. Chan D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2376-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The presented evidence of direct competition between the WW domain of PIN1 and CKS for Thr(P)-Pro-containing peptides could in a very similar way regulate the substrate binding of CKS and hence the CDK activity. Our data are consistent with a previous biochemical study that strongly suggests that PIN1 could slow down the entry into mitosis by competition with the CKS protein for binding to substrates of the CDK complex (4Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In vivo, PIN1 was shown to interact with CDC25 (13Crenshaw D. Yang J. Means A. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14Shen M. Stukenberg P. Kirschner M. Lu K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and the overexpression of CKS leading to accumulation of inactive kinase molecules phosphorylated on Tyr-15 indicates a direct interaction between CKS and CDC25 (2Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have shown that the PIN1 protein regulates negatively the entry into mitosis (10Lu K. Hanes S. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 13Crenshaw D. Yang J. Means A. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14Shen M. Stukenberg P. Kirschner M. Lu K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and is necessary for the replication checkpoint control (17Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the previously described in vitrocompetition for the same substrate (4Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36839-36842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and our direct interaction mapping do not prove of itself that PIN1 and CKS compete in vivo, the combined evidence points toward a balance between both proteins with the level of phosphorylation of mitotic phosphoproteins ensuring a precise control of the timing of entry into mitosis. The role of the prolyl cis/trans-isomerase catalytic domain remains an unclarified point, as we were not able to detect any effect of this domain on binding of phosphorylated substrate by the CKS. The entire PIN1 protein is necessary to perform its essential function in vivo (34Rippmann F. Hobbie S. Daiber C. Guilliard B. Bauer M. Birk J. Nar H. Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 409-416PubMed Google Scholar) and to ensure the replication checkpoint at mitosis (16Lu P.J. Zhou X. Shen M. Lu K.

https://openalex.org/W2084150481,"A protocol was developed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that resulted in the specific desensitization of glycogen synthase activation by insulin. Cells were pretreated for 15 min with 100 nm insulin, and then recovered for 1.5 h in the absence of hormone. Subsequent basal and insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IRS-1, MAPK, Akt kinase, and GSK-3 were similar in control and pretreated cells. Additionally, enhanced glucose transport and incorporation into lipid in response to insulin were unaffected. However, pretreatment reduced insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis by over 50%, due to a nearly complete inhibition of glycogen synthase activation. Removal of extracellular glucose during the recovery period blocked the increase in glycogen levels, and restored insulin-induced glycogen synthase activation. Furthermore, incubation of pretreated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with glycogenolytic agents reversed the desensitization event. Separation of cellular lysates on sucrose gradients revealed that glycogen synthase was primarily located in the dense pellet fraction, with lesser amounts in the lighter fractions. Insulin induced glycogen synthase translocation from the lighter to the denser glycogen-containing fractions. Interestingly, insulin preferentially activated translocated enzyme while having little effect on the majority of glycogen synthase activity in the pellet fraction. In insulin-pretreated cells, glycogen synthase did not return to the lighter fractions during recovery, and thus did not move in response to the second insulin exposure. These results suggest that, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the translocation of glycogen synthase may be an important step in the regulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin. Furthermore, intracellular glycogen levels can regulate glycogen synthase activation, potentially through modulation of enzymatic localization."

As a result, DNA is typically a flexible macromolecule. However, it was established some time ago that particular DNA sequences can cause a region of DNA to assume a distinct nonlinear curved structure (for reviews, see Refs. 2Dieckmann S. Nucleic Acids Mol. Biol. 1987; 1: 138-156Crossref Google Scholar, 3Crothers D.M. Haran T.E. Nadeau J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7093-7096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hagerman P.J.

This property is referred to as intrinsic DNA bending or DNA curvature. Intrinsically bent DNA has a preferred conformation and thus is more rigid than a typical DNA molecule, a property that causes this DNA to migrate more slowly than random (non-bent) DNA during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 7Dieckmann S. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Intrinsic DNA bending has been found to play a significant role in the transcriptional regulation of many prokaryotic genes (8Perez-Martin J. Rojo F. de Lorenzo V. Microbiol.

In prokaryotes, intrinsic bending helps implement both repression and activation, operating by a number of distinct mechanisms. However, the possible role of intrinsic bending in eukaryotic transcription is less clear. Schroth et al. (10Schroth G. Siino J. Cooney C. Th'ng J. Ho P. Bradbury E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9958-9964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described two intrinsically bent regions that flank the transcription start site of rRNA in Physarum. An intrinsic bend in the promoter region has been detected on several human genes: β-actin (11Kawamoto T. Makino K. Orita S. Nakata A. Kakunaga T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), β- and ε-globin (12Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 197-259Crossref Google Scholar). The structural genes,e.g. GAL1–10, are induced to very high level expression in galactose by the action of the activator Gal4p. Gal4p binds to activation sequences (UASG) that lie upstream of GAL genes (Fig. 1) and activates transcription in a process that depends on gene-proximal TATA elements and involves numerous coactivators and general transcription factors including TBP (for a review see Ref. 25Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 197-259Crossref Google Scholar). The activation function of Gal4p is modulated by Gal80p, an inhibitory regulator that binds specifically to the activation domain of Gal4p, thus preventing gene activation in nongalactose carbon sources (21Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene that encodes this negative regulator is constitutively expressed at a basal level in all carbon sources via an Inr element located at +1 and at higher induced levels in galactose through a UASG and TATA (26Shimada H.

Both basal and induced GAL80 expression depend on the UASGAL80 (Fig. 1), a far upstream GAL80-specific activation sequence (27Sakurai H. Ohishi T. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6819-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). During the course of working with GAL promoter region DNA, we have noticed gel migration anomalies. The results presented below confirm the source of these anomalies, intrinsic DNA bends on the GAL1–10 and GAL80 promoter DNAs. The extensive knowledge base for GAL regulation allows us to correlate quite accurately the locations of the intrinsic bends with the locations of known DNA regulatory sites on these promoters. In addition, the chromatin structure of both the GAL1–10 (28Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and GAL80 promoter regions (29Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) are known, as well as the role that promoter nucleosome structure plays in regulation of the GAL genes (cf. Refs. 25Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 197-259Crossref Google Scholar and 30Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26795-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, perhaps more importantly, we are also able to correlate bend locations with promoter nucleosome locations, a comparison that has not been possible with the intrinsic bends detected on other eukaryotic promoters. Indeed, this comparison provides some very interesting results regarding the relationship of bends and nucleosomes. Plasmids containing the promoter regions of GAL1–10or GAL80 (29Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Lohr D. Hopper J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8409-8423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were isolated according to Birnboim (32Birnboim H.C. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and the insert DNA excised from the plasmids by restriction digestion as follows: EcoRI to release a 907-bp fragment containing the GAL1–10 intergenic region;EcoRI-NcoI to release a 1005-bp fragment containing the upstream and 5′ coding region of GAL80. The insert DNA was separated from the plasmid vectors by preparative gel electrophoresis, the bands of interest were identified by UV shadowing, and the DNA was eluted from the gel by a gel crush method (33Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8985) Google Scholar). Restriction digests of promoter region DNA were electrophoresed on analytical gels (7.5%, 29.4:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide-TBE), along with DNA size standards (pBR322-MspI, φx174-HaeIII) at 4 °C and 1.5 V/cm for 96 h in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide in the gels (34Dieckmann S. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5765-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The relative migrations (Rf) of DNA fragments were calculated by dividing band migration distances by the migration distance of a DNA standard, which would correspond to the same number of base pairs, determined from a plot of migration distance versus size for standard reference digests, e.g. pBR-MspI. This method avoids the possibility of an intrinsically bent standard DNA fragment affecting promoter Rf values. The desired DNA fragment was cut out from the promoter region DNA by restriction digestion and isolated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV shadowing, and gel crush as described above. To make concatamers of the fragment, a T4 ligase blunt end reaction was carried out at 16 °C for 2–6 h, and BamHI linkers were then ligated to the ends of these fragments (T4 ligase, 16 °C for 16 h). The resulting products were digested with BamHI and analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel to estimate the DNA concentration. This concatamer mixture was ligated into a BamHI cut (and dephosphorylated) pBSK+vector under sticky end ligation conditions (1:1–4:1 insert to plasmid molar ratio), transformed into a UV-XL1Blue Escherichia colihost and grown in L broth to stationary phase with ampicillin selection (35Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., Maniatis, T. (1989) in Molecular Cloning, Ed. 2, pp. 1, 68–86, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The resulting library was screened for the desired head-to-tail dimer insert using standard α-complementation and miniprep restriction digest screening techniques (35Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., Maniatis, T. (1989) in Molecular Cloning, Ed. 2, pp. 1, 68–86, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The desired dimeric fragments were isolated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/UV shadowing/gel crush. For the circular permutation assay, a head-to-tail dimer fragment was cut with various single cut (per monomer unit) restriction enzymes and analyzed on polyacrylamide gels (8%, 1-mm thick) run at 4 °C and 1.5 V/cm for 120–200 h. Rf values for the monomer fragments were calculated by dividing the migration distance for the fragment by the migration distance of a standard DNA fragment of the same length (obtained from a plot of log bp versus migration for a standard restriction digest). The bend center was determined as the intersection of two lines on the plot of restriction cut site versus Rf from the circular permutation analysis. Each line was a best fit of a weighted least squares formula for data approaching the maximum Rf from the left or right, respectively. Where there was a scarcity of data approaching from one side, the data were wrapped from the other side of the plot. A minimum of four independent electrophoretic determinations were carried out for each bend site. The program LORDS (Long Range DNA Simulator, P. S. Ho laboratory), which incorporates the helical parameters of rise, twist, roll, and tilt from any number of different bending models, was used to construct low resolution, three-dimensional structures for the GAL1–10 and GAL80 promoter DNA (cf. Fig. 2). In this study, we used the parameters derived by Bolshoy et al.(36Bolshoy P. McNamara P. Harrington R. Trifonov E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2313-2316Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar), the parameters derived by Goodsell and Dickerson (37Goodsell D. Dickerson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5497-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), or the parameters from Brukner et al. (40Brukner I. Sanchez R. Suck D. Pongor S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) to construct DNA models with LORDS. We initially applied several computational bending algorithms (36Bolshoy P. McNamara P. Harrington R. Trifonov E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2313-2316Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 37Goodsell D. Dickerson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5497-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 38Ulyanov N. James T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 90-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to the promoter DNA sequences of the GAL1–10 and GAL80 genes. Although all models predicted intrinsic bending, the models differed in the predicted locations and strengths of the bends within the promoter regions (cf. Fig.2 A). Thus, a preliminary experimental screening method was utilized to identify intrinsically bent regions of DNA on which to carry out circular permutation analysis. The screen involved carrying out several restriction digests of GAL1–10 and GAL80 promoter DNA and testing the resulting sets of small (100–400-bp) fragments for anomalous migration during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Two such sets of results are shown in Fig. 3. The data identify some GAL1–10 promoter DNA fragments that consistently demonstrate anomalously slow migration under these electrophoresis conditions. That the anomalous migration is due to intrinsic bending is confirmed by the observation that the anomalies completely disappear when electrophoresis is carried out in the presence of ethidium bromide, a treatment that has been shown to remove migration anomalies that are caused by bending (34Dieckmann S. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5765-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). DNA fragments containing the region immediately upstream of the GAL1 TATA consistently show the most anomalous migration behavior (b or 1, Fig. 3 A). However, in a fragment with an upstream terminus closer to GAL1, at 659 bp, the anomalous migration is largely abolished (not shown). This observation would suggest that an intrinsic DNA bend lies between 600 and 659 bp. Based on those types of observations, we carried out a circular permutation analysis (6Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar) on a tandem head-to-tail dimer of a fragment containing DNA from 550 to 896 bp on the GAL1–10 promoter (Fig. 1), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this type of analysis, the dimer is cleaved with restriction enzymes that cut once within each monomer unit, producing a set of identically sized (monomer) DNA molecules but with varying internal locations of any intrinsic bends. The fragments with the highest relative mobility arise when the restriction site that is cut lies at or near the center of the bend; monomer fragments produced by this enzyme will not contain the entire internal bend (6Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig.4. To locate the bend center, we carried out a best-fit analysis on each of the two distinct arms of the plot. By this analysis, the bend center maps to 645 bp. Again, the presence of ethidium bromide removes all anomalous migration and all Rf differences among the fragments (Fig. 4,open circles), indicating that intrinsic curvature is responsible for the migration anomalies. Based on the slopes of the lines in these plots, one can estimate the average bending angle (39Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). For the 645-bp bend, this average angle is ∼70° (TableI).Table IStrong DNA bend locationsExperimentalPredicted1-aFrom LORDS analysis, Goodsell and Dickerson model (37).Bend centerCalculated bend angleBend centerBend anglebpbpGAL1645∼70 °65186 °GAL1536∼50 °52950 °GAL80551∼50 °56050 °1-a From LORDS analysis, Goodsell and Dickerson model (37Goodsell D. Dickerson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5497-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab The bending models and the restriction digests predict two other strong bends, at sites around 500 bp on the GAL1–10 promoter and around 500 bp on the GAL80 promoter. Circular permutation analysis confirms both of these intrinsic bending sites (Fig.5), at 536 bp on GAL1–10 and at 551 bp on GAL80. Again, these migration anomalies are not observed in the presence of ethidium bromide (not shown). The estimated bending angles for these bends are ∼50° for each (Table I). These experimental results show fairly good agreement with the Goodsell and Dickerson bending model (37Goodsell D. Dickerson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5497-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which is based on nucleosome positioning data. For example, the experimentally determined bend centers and magnitudes of the GAL1–10 536- and 645-bp bends and the 551-bp bend of GAL80 show excellent agreement with model predictions (Table I). Moreover, this model predicts a broad curvature above 900 bp on GAL80 (well within the coding region), and we find evidence for a bend centered at 960 bp (not shown). Also, in our initial screen (gel migration anomalies), we did not detect evidence for any intrinsic promoter region bends besides those predicted by the Goodsell and Dickerson model. Thus, 300–500 bp on the GAL1–10 promoter and 300–500 and 600–800 bp on the GAL80 promoter are bend-free. The Goodsell and Dickerson model (Fig. 2 B) also predicts two weaker bends just upstream of GAL10 (at ∼220 and ∼280 bp) and a bend in the GAL10 5′ coding region (at ∼130 bp). Another bending model, Brukner et al. (40Brukner I. Sanchez R. Suck D. Pongor S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1812-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), also predicts bends at ∼130, ∼190, and ∼ 280 bp (not shown). Migration anomaly and circular permutation studies yield results that are consistent with the presence of bends at ∼130 and ∼200 bp (cf. fragments 32 c in Fig. 3 Aand data not shown), but there is a much greater variability in the mobility studies, and the circular permutation signals are much weaker for these bends than for the 536- and 645-bp bends. Thus, it is likely that there are intrinsic bends at ∼130 and ∼200 bp, but these bends are probably weaker than the GAL1 proximal bends, as predicted (Table I). The close proximity of the three GAL10-proximal bends might also affect the strength of the bending signal from this region and definitely complicates circular permutation studies. We feel that these GAL10-proximal bends are not likely to be as important as the stronger bends upstream of GAL1 and GAL80 and therefore have not pursued their study. The bend centered at ∼ 280 bp is predicted to be the weakest of the GAL10-proximal bends (Fig.2 B) and lies in a region with few restriction sites. Using gel mobility and circular permutation analyses, we have detected fairly strong (≥50°) sites of intrinsic DNA bending in the promoters of the yeast GAL1–10 structural genes and the GAL80 regulatory gene . In vivo, these GAL promoters contain two distinct types of chromatin regions: constitutively non-nucleosomal hypersensitive regions in which the major promoter elements, the UASG, reside; and nucleosomal regions, where the TATA, Inr, and transcription start sites are found (30Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26795-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The single intrinsic DNA bend on the GAL80 promoter lies in the non-nucleosomal region, between the UASGAL80 and the more gene-proximal promoter elements (Fig. 6). The GAL80-specific UASGAL80 activation sequence is the most upstream element on GAL80 and is required for both basal and induced expression. The intrinsic DNA bend might help to bring this constitutively functioning promoter element closer to the gene or to the other promoter elements. Intrinsic bends on prokaryotic promoters often function in such an architectural role (9Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 593-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There are no intrinsic bends in the nucleosomal regions of the GAL80promoter (α or D, Fig. 6). In contrast, the intrinsic bends in the GAL1–10 promoter are all found within the promoter nucleosomal regions. These nucleosomes (A–C, Fig. 6) cover the TATA and transcription start sites of GAL1 and GAL10 under inactive (noninducing) conditions, and their presence helps to implement gene repression in those carbon sources (cf. Refs. 25Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 197-259Crossref Google Scholar and 30Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26795-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The strongest bends lie at 536 and 645 bp within a nucleosome referred to as B (Fig. 6). In vivo, nucleosome B clearly has a strong locational preference, although it is not clear whether nucleosome B is absolutely positioned (25Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 197-259Crossref Google Scholar). The dyad center of this nucleosome should lie around 595 bp (28Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), roughly midway between the two bending sites. Based on the nucleosome positions estimated by recent nuclease digestion studies (41Fisher-Adams G. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1468-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 42Reagan M. Majors J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the bend centers would lie within the terminal 20 bp or so on each end of a 147-bp core nucleosome B. These two intrinsic DNA bends might help determine the location of nucleosome B in its preferred position. For example, it has been suggested that nucleosomes have a preference to locate more flexible DNA in their central region and that this can be a determinant of nucleosome positioning (43Fitzgerald D. Dryden G. Bronson E. Williams J. Anderson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21303-21314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Widlund H. Kuduvalli P. Bengtsson M. Hui C. Tullius T. Kubista M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31847-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The preferred position of nucleosome B is consistent with this suggestion; it places the more rigid (intrinsically bent) DNA near the nucleosome termini, in regions where DNA is less constrained by nucleosome structure (45Van Holde K. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 247-251Google Scholar, 46Luger K. Mäder A. Richmond R. Sargent D. Richmond T. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar) and locates the more flexible interbend DNA within the nucleosome. However, nucleosome B does not show positioning in vitro (47Rainbow M. Lopez J. Lohr D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, these intrinsic bends are apparently not capable by themselves of imposing locational boundaries on nucleosome B. Other features that could also contribute to the in vivo positioning of nucleosome B have been discussed elsewhere (25Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 197-259Crossref Google Scholar). Despite the presence of these intrinsic bends, nucleosome B is stable, perhaps because the 110 bp of DNA between the two bending sites is close to the length of DNA (∼120 bp) that is strongly associated with the core histones in the nucleosome (45Van Holde K. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 247-251Google Scholar, 46Luger K. Mäder A. Richmond R. Sargent D. Richmond T. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these intrinsic DNA bends might interfere enough with the normal wrapping of DNA on the nucleosome to cause B to be less stable than a nucleosome without such bends. These two intrinsic bends may play their most important roles in the processes that are associated with the transcriptional activation of GAL1. 1) When GAL1–10 expression is activated in galactose, the promoter nucleosomes (A—C, Fig. 6) appear to be completely removed (28Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 48Lohr D. Lopez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27671-27678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fact that the strongest bends on the GAL1–10 intergenic region lie in nucleosome B may reflect the central role of B in the nucleosome disruption process (for a review, see Ref. 25Bash R. Lohr D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 197-259Crossref Google Scholar). For example, the bends could preferentially destabilize nucleosome B, either intrinsically (see above) or by attracting factors (see below), thus facilitating its complete disruption. The 645-bp bend also lies very near the nucleosome terminus that shows accessibility changes when histone H4 N termini are deleted or the acetylation sites are removed (41Fisher-Adams G. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1468-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These H4 mutations decrease GAL1 induction levels by severalfold, indicating that the H4 tails normally play a role in GAL1 activation. Perhaps that role involves the intrinsic bend. 2) It has been shown that placing an intrinsically bent DNA sequence between an upstream activation element and a TATA element will enhance transcription activation in vivo (20Kim J. de Haan G. Shapiro D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and a bent sequence in phase with the TATA strongly enhances TBP-TATA binding (49Parvin J.A. McCormick R.J. Sharp P.A. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1995; 373: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The center of the 645-bp bend lies 31 bp from the first TA step of the GAL1 TATA, roughly three helical repeats of 10.5 bp, the solution repeat of DNA (50Peck L.J. Wang J.C. Nature. 1981; 292: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, the 645-bp bend could function to enhance TBP-TATA binding and GAL1 expression, as observed in the model systems. The intrinsic bend and the bend induced by TBP would, if combined in phase, produce an ∼150° bend. 3) The 645-bp bend may also recruit the yeast HMG analogues NHP 6A/6B, which are absolutely required for high-level GAL1 induced expression in vivo (1Paull T. Carey M. Johnson R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NHP6A displays an enhanced affinity for distorted DNA structures and bends DNA significantly upon binding to it (51Paull T. Johnson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 52Yen Y-M. Wong B. Johnson R.C. J. Biolem. Chem. 1998; 273: 4424-4435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Complete removal of nucleosome B (during gene induction) will expose both the 536- and 645-bp intrinsic bends to NHP6A, which could then bind to one or both of these bent sequences. Competition of NHP6A for these binding sites could even aid the nucleosome disruption process, at least thermodynamically. Bending induced by NHP6A binding should significantly shorten the distance between the UASG sequences and the TATA-bound TBP. Perhaps, more importantly, it has been shown in vitro that NHP6A stimulates polymerase II transcription by promoting the formation of an especially favorable TBP initiation complex (1Paull T. Carey M. Johnson R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The bend at 645 bp would appear to be a suitable site from which NHP6A could promote the TBP complex assembly on GAL1. Both the TATA and UASG functions on GAL1 depend on NHP6A/6B (1Paull T. Carey M. Johnson R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the strong bends upstream of GAL1 may function in nucleosome location in the inactive state and in gene activation during induction. We thank Stefan Dieckmann for stimulating discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2058805049,"The papillomavirus E2 protein plays an important role in viral transcriptional regulation and replication. We chose to study the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) E2 protein as a transcriptional regulator because of the availability of an animal model for papilloma formation, which may be relevant for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and replication. We studied the effect of expression levels of E2 on the long control region, which contains transcriptional promoter and enhancer elements, and synthetic E2-dependent artificial promoters in which the E2 was the dominant factor in the transcriptional activation. These experiments indicated that high levels of E2 were inhibitory and low levels were stimulatory for transactivation. In addition, we showed that the complex formed between CRPV E2 and the cognate binding site was less stable than the complex formed between HPV E2 and the same cognate binding site. Furthermore, we showed that CRPV E2 binding to its transcriptional regulatory sequence was stabilized by other proteins such as E1, which produced increments in transcriptional activation of E2-dependent genes. The data may be used to define conditions in which the rabbit model can be used for the screening of drugs which are inhibitory to the HPV and CRPV replication and gene expression."
