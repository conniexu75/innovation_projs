https://openalex.org/W2032819570,A permanent human cell line that maintains the granulocytic characteristics of acute myelogenous leukemia cells has been established. The cells of this line form myeloid colonies in soft gel culture in the presence of human colony-stimulating activity. The cell line may be useful for studying human acute myelogenous leukemia and the mechanism of response to colony-stimulating activity.

https://openalex.org/W2029770423,Tumor-promoting phorbol esters and related plant macrocyclic diterpenes inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor to its receptors on HeLa cells. This effect shows marked structural specificity and correlates with other biological effects of these compounds on mouse skin and in cell culture systems. The active compounds inhibited binding of 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor with a 50 per-cent effective dose in the range of 10(-8) to 10(-9) M. Inhibition appears to be due to a decrease in the number of available epidermal growth factor receptors rather than a change in receptor affinity. These results suggest that certain biologic effects of tumor promoters may result from alterations in the function of cell surface receptors involved in growth regulation.
https://openalex.org/W1606919023,"Exposure of confluent nondividing 3T3 cells to 10 nm mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF) at 37/sup 0/, followed by incubation for 4.5 h at 37/sup 0/, leads to a 70 to 85% reduction in the binding capacity for /sup 125/I-EGF. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicate that the reduction of /sup 125/I-EGF binding is due to a decrease in the number of available EGF-receptors per cell, without any change in the affinity of the receptors for EGF. This modulation of the EGF-receptor by the growth factor, termed ''down regulation,'' is dependent on temperature, EGF concentration, time, and the physiological state of the cell. Receptor loss occurs at physiological EGF concentrations (0.1 to 10 nm) which span the concentration range which is mitogenic for 3T3 cells. Maximal stimulation of either (/sup 3/H)thymidine uptake or cell division occurs at 1 nm EGF, a concentration at which only 20% of the EGF-receptor sites are occupied and down regulation is only 55% complete. Low EGF concentrations (< or = to 1 nm) result in down regulation of unoccupied EGF-receptors. Down regulation of the EGF-receptor also occurs in SV 40-transformed 3T3 cells. Growing 3T3 cells exposed to EGF also loose available EGF-receptors. In contrastmore » to confluent cells, dividing 3T3 cells rapidly replace EGF-receptors on the surface of the cell, in the presence of EGF.« less"

https://openalex.org/W2126617061,"Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase from human lymphoblasts binds 2'-deoxy[3H]adenosine tightly. Binding is associated with time-dependent, saturable, irreversible inactivation of catalytic activity which occurs with first order kinetics, suggesting suicide inactivation. Adenine arabinoside produces similar inactivation but is more potent. These results suggest a basis for a heretofore unrecognized mechanism of action for these and other analogs of adenosine, in which toxicity results from actions of the nucleosides themselves, rather than from nucleotides to which they may be converted."
https://openalex.org/W2087132510,"An extra eye primordium was implanted into the forebrain region of embryonic Rana pipiens. During development both normal and supernumerary optic tracts terminated within a single, previously uninnervated tectal lobe. Autoradiographic tracing of either the normal or supernumerary eye's projection revealed distinct, eye-specific bands of radioactivity running rostrocaudally through the dually innervated tectum. Interactions among axons of retinal ganglion cells, possibly mediated through tectal neurons, must be invoked to explain this stereotyped disruption of the normally continuous retinal termination pattern."

https://openalex.org/W2021044670,"IN the mouse the injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) results in the appearance of very large numbers of IgM globulin-secreting cells1. Furthermore, it has been shown that LPS induces B lymphocytes, both in vivo2,3 and in vitro4–6 to secrete IgM antibodies to a wide range of seemingly unrelated antigens. It was reported recently that about 8% of all IgM globulin-secreting cells arising as a consequence of LPS injection into CBA mice secrete an antibody-like molecule with specificity for a heterospecific (bovine) IgG (BIG) molecule1. It was suggested that such IgM molecules were reminiscent of a rheumatoid factor, although at that time plaque-forming cells (PFC) had not been demonstrated using mouse IgG (MIG) as the target antigen. I have now been able to demonstrate the presence of auto-(anti-MIG)-antibody-forming cells. About half (35–75%) of all IgM-secreting cells appearing after both mitogen and immunogen injection into mice produce IgM globulin which is not specific for the inducing immunogen, but which does have specificity for self-IgG. The description by Steel and Cunningham7 of a large proportion of IgM-PFC having specificity for normally hidden (syngeneic) erythrocyte antigens, supports a view that a majority of both mitogen and immunogen stimulated IgM-PFC are producing auto-antibodies. Although a mouse rheumatoid-like IgM with binding activity against antigen-bound (syngeneic) IgG was described previously8, until now attempts to develop a haemolytic plaque assay for autologous mouse M-anti-G have failed. After unsuccessful attempts involving various forms of mouse IgG, partially denatured mouse IgG and also a procedure used successfully in the rabbit9, a successful method has been developed. An account of some of the results from experiments using this methodology is presented here."

https://openalex.org/W1985098580,"A putative neurotransmitter, serotonin, may be used to transmit temporal information in the eye of Aplysia, because it can shift the phase of the circadian rhythm of spontaneous optic nerve impulses from the eye and the eye contains a significant quantity of serotonin. Serotonin acts either directly on the cell, or cells, containing the circadian pacemaker or on cells electronically coupled to the pacemaker cells."

https://openalex.org/W1514985534,"Abstract Two proteinases (proteinases I and II) have been purified from Crotalus adamanteus venom to the stage of electrophoretic homogeneity and proteinase II has been crystallized. The proteinase differ slightly in molecular weight and amino acid composition. Both are metalloenzymes requiring Zn2+ or Ca2+, or both; neither requires thiol compounds for activation. The proteinases are free of esterolytic activity against benzoly-L-arginine ethyl ester and benzoyl--tyrosine ethyl ester. Proteinase II cleaves the oxidized B chain of insulin at the bonds Phe1-Val2, His5-Leu6, His10-Leu11, Ala14-Leu15, Leu15-Tyr16, and Tyr-16-Leu17. Digestion of polylsine and polyarginine by proteinase II liberates products ranging from dodecapeptides to hexapeptides. Proteinases I and II catalytically inactive human plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (54,000 daltons). Electrophoretic analysis of the reaction of proteinase II with alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor reveals that an inactivated inhibitor species of 50,000 daltons is formed, and a peptide of 4,000 daltons is released. The gradual disappearance of the native inhibitor results in the corresponding loss of inhibitory activity against trypsin and chymotrypsin."

https://openalex.org/W1999243294,"Abstract The regulation of cytoplasmic proteins in mutants of mouse myeloid leukemic cells, differing in their competence to be induced to differentiate by the normal macrophage- and granulocyte-inducing protein (MGI) and the steroid inducer dexamethasone, was analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 35 S-methionine-labeled proteins. Before induction, no consistent differences in the pattern of cytoplasmic proteins were found between clones with different capabilities to differentiate. Four MGI + D + clones, which are induced by MGI for Fc and C3 rosettes, the synthesis and secretion of lysozyme, and the formation of mature macrophages and granulocytes, all showed the same nine prominent changes in cytoplasmic proteins after induction. Five of these changes were either an increase or a decrease in proteins present in uninduced cells; four proteins appeared to be newly synthesized. One of the proteins that increased after induction was identified as actin. The pattern of cytoplasmic proteins from MGI-induced MGI + D + clones more closely resembled that of normal peritoneal macrophages and granulocytes than the pattern of the uninduced clones. The relationship of these protein changes to cell differentiation was further substantiated by the finding that MGI + D − cells, which can be induced by MGI for Fc and C3 rosettes and lysozyme, but not for mature cells, showed only four cytoplasmic protein changes which were quantitatively less than those found for MGI + D + clones. An MGI − D − clone which was not inducible for any differentiation-associated properties by MGI showed no alteration in protein synthesis. Thus in all the clones studied, there was a correlation between the number and extent of protein changes and the degree of MGI-induced differentiation. In MGI + D + clones, some of the differentiation-associated properties induced by MGI can be induced by the steroid hormone dexamethasone. Of the nine protein changes induced by MGI, six were also induced by dexamethasone, and no changes were induced by dexamethasone which were not also induced by MGI. These results, which were also shown by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicate that in cells which can respond to both MGI and dexamethasone, the proteins induced by dexamethasone were a subset of those induced by MGI."
https://openalex.org/W1513607681,"The topology of the steroid hydroxylase complexes in bovine adrenocortical mitochondria was studied by using nonpenetrating artificial electron acceptors and the impermeable protein reagent diazobenzenesulfonate. Inhibition of steroid hydroxylase activity by ferricyanide and dichlorophenolindophenol sulfonate was only observed in mitochondria which had been damaged by various techniques. Intact mitochondria were not inhibited by these reagents. The reaction was monitored by oxygen uptake due to hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone, as well as P-450 reduction and corticosterone formation. The results obtained were similar regardless of how the activity was measured. Labeling of the mitochondria with the nonpenetrating protein reagent diazobenzenesulfonate also inhibited P-450 reduction and corticosterone formation in mitochondria which had been damaged prior to addition of this reagent. Intact mitochondria which were labeled with this reagent showed very little inhibition of both activities. These results strongly suggest that all protein components of the steroid 11beta-hydroxylase system are located on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The inability of ferricyanide, dichlorophenolindophenol sulfonate, and diazobenzenesulfonate to inhibit the malate-dependent reduction of P-450 in intact mitochondria implies that all the P-450-dependent mitochondrial steroid hydroxylase systems are located on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2085151080,"Isolated vertebrate retinas bathed in circulating Ringer solution cannot regenerate all of their bleached visual pigments. When dioleoyl-lecithin vesicles containing certain retinol congeners are added to the Ringer solution, such retinas begin to regenerate pigment immediately. The visual pigment of a bleached perfused retina can now be restored fully, making the isolated retina an independent unit for study. Loposomes can protect oxygen-sensitive, lipid-soluble substances and deliver them to living cells."

https://openalex.org/W1573985122,"We have utilized 11beta-hydroxylase activity and visible absorption spectrophotometry to detect possible complex formation among adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin, and cytochrome P-450(11)beta. At low ionic strength, a 1:1 complex between adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin occurs but does not support maximal rates of 11beta hydroxylation; at least 1 additional molecule of adrenodoxin in excess of the 1:1 complex is required for full hydroxylase activity. Spectrophotometric titration of a mixture of adrenodoxin reductase and cytochrome P-450(11)beta with adrenodoxin indicates sequential formation of 1:1 complexes between adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin and then between a second adrenodoxin and cytochrome P-450(11beta; the adrenodoxin-cytochrome P-450(11)beta complex is only detectable when the concentration of adrenodoxin exceeds that of adrenodoxin reductase."

https://openalex.org/W1510315551,"The enzymatic activity of bacterial luciferase from Beneckea harveyi (a heterodimer, Mr = approximately 79,000) is rapidly lost upon treatment with trypsin or chymotrypsin. Under nondenaturing conditions, the proteolytically inactivated molecule has the same apparent molecular weight as the native enzyme, and appears to be relatively stable to further proteolytic degradation. Gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate of the products of this digestion shows that only the alpha subunit is degraded during the time of these experiments, and its rate of loss is the same as the rate of loss of light-producing activity. The action of either protease produces a species with mobility indicative of a molecular weight of about 28,000 and smaller fragments, and an unaltered beta subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1974543990,"Sertoli cell-only seminiferous tubules of sterile XX, Sxr/-male mice served as an excellent source of pure Sertoli cells. When H-2-compatible female mice were immunized 3 times with these Sertoli cells, resulting antibodies recognized two antigens on the plasma membrane of testicular Sertoli cells. They were male-specific, but ubiquitously expressed H-Y antigen and the cell lineage-specific antigen which Sertoli cells shared with ovarian follicular cells. Doubly primed (2 or 3 times in vivo, and once in vitro) cytotoxic T cells from these females lysed target Sertoli cells in both H-2-restricted and nonrestricted manners. While H-2-restricted killings were attributable to H-Y antigen, further work is needed to identify the Sertoli follicular cell lineage-specific antigen as the cause of H-2-nonrestricted killings."
https://openalex.org/W1578228444,The complete amino acid sequence of a CNBr-fragment from human alpha1-protease inhibitor has been determined and is shown below. The peptide consists of 109 amino acid residues with 1 oligosaccharide unit. The 2 glutamic acid residues which have previously been shown to be substituted by lysine in the Z and by valine in the S mutant proteins are both located in this CNBr fragment. (formula: see text).
https://openalex.org/W1608387031,"Cytochrome P-45011beta has been solubilized and partially purified from bovine adrenal cortex mitochondria by means of chromatography on Octyl-Sepharose CL-4B or DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B. The partially purified P-450 preparations were about 90% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but had a low specific content of P-450 (between 1 and 2 nmol of P-450 per mg of protein). In the presence of purified preparations of adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin, the partially purified P-450 preparations catalyzed NADPH-supported 11beta-hydroxylation of unconjugated and sulfoconjugated deoxycorticosterone. In the reconstituted system the hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone sulfate proceeded at a much higher rate than in intact mitochondria, indicating that in the former case interactions between the hydrophilic substrate and P-450 were facilitated. In the presence of Triton X-100 the partially purified cytochrome P-45011beta had a Stokes radius of 4.5 nm, a sedimentation coefficient of 3.1 S, and a partial specific volume of about 0.85 cm3/g. These results indicate that the cytochrome P-45011beta . Triton X-100 complex had a molecular weight of about 100,000 and that P-45011beta bound about 1.1 g of Triton X-100 per g of protein. The P-45011beta . Triton X-100 complex was catalytically active in hydroxylation reactions supported by NADPH or the hydroxylating agent ortho-nitroiodosobenzene, suggesting that the monomer of cytochrome P-45011beta is the active form of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1993931936,"Partial denervation of parasympathetic neurons in the frog heart by surgical section of one vagus nerve results in a marked reorganization of functional synaptic connections made by the remaining vagus nerve. These changes are not simply due to a lack of impulse activity per se in the sectioned nerve because blockage of impulses in one vagus with tetrodotoxin-impregnated cuffs did not cause similar changes in the innervation pattern of the ganglion. Furthermore, tetrodotoxin-blocked vagal fibers retain their ability to sprout and can form new synapses on denervated neurons."
