https://openalex.org/W1968713831,"Cachectin (tumor necrosis factor), a protein produced in large quantities by endotoxin-activated macrophages, has been implicated as an important mediator of the lethal effect of endotoxin. Recombinant human cachectin was infused into rats in an effort to determine whether cachectin, by itself, can elicit the derangements of host physiology caused by administration of endotoxin. When administered in quantities similar to those produced endogenously in response to endotoxin, cachectin causes hypotension, metabolic acidosis, hemoconcentration, and death within minutes to hours, as a result of respiratory arrest. Hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia were also observed after infusion. At necropsy, diffuse pulmonary inflammation and hemorrhage were apparent on gross and histopathologic examination, along with ischemic and hemorrhagic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, and acute renal tubular necrosis. Thus, it appears that a single protein mediator (cachectin) is capable of inducing many of the deleterious effects of endotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2013540958,The complete nucleotide and primary structure (1276 amino acids) of a full length mdr cDNA capable of conferring a complete multidrug-resistant phenotype is presented. The deduced amino acid sequence suggests that mdr is a membrane glycoprotein which includes six pairs of transmembrane domains and a cluster of potentially N-linked glycosylation sites near the amino terminus. A striking feature of the protein is an internal duplication that includes approximately 500 amino acids. Each duplicated segment includes a consensus ATP-binding site. Amino acid homology is observed between the mdr gene and a series of bacterial transport genes. This strong homology suggests that a highly conserved functional unit involved in membrane transport is present in the mdr polypeptide. We propose that an energy-dependent transport mechanism is responsible for the multidrug-resistant phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W1990832845,"Unmyelinated (C) fibers are the most numerous sensory elements of mammalian peripheral nerve and comprise many of those responsible for initiating pain and temperature reactions; however, direct evidence has been lacking as to where and how these fibers terminate in the central nervous system. A plant lectin (Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin) was applied intracellularly by iontophoresis as an immunocytochemical marker. This permitted visualization of the central terminations of cutaneous C sensory fibers that had been identified by the nature of stimuli that excited them. The central branch of C-fiber units arborized and terminated mainly in the superficial layers of the spinal dorsal horn in defined patterns that related to their functional attributes. Thus, the superficial dorsal horn seems to act as a processing station for signals from fine sensory fibers."

The sequence of the viral genome (1,678 nucleotides) has been determined and an open reading frame within the complementary strand has been shown to encode an antigen that binds specifically to antisera from patients with chronic hepatitis delta viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W2007902841,Covalently closed circular (CCC) double-stranded DNA believed to be the transcriptional template for duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) is amplified in aging primary cultures of hepatocytes from congenitally infected ducklings. Analysis of 5-bromodeoxyuridine-labeled heavy/light CCC DNA shows that the relaxed circular DNA synthesized in the cytoplasm by reverse transcription is the predominant precursor to the amplified pool of nuclear viral CCC DNA. In vitro infection of uninfected hepatocyte cultures with DHBV demonstrates that a similar 50-fold amplification of CCC DNA occurs during an early stage in the infection before virus production. This amplification allows the establishment of a pool of transcriptional templates in the cell without the need for semiconservative replication or multiple rounds of infection. This process may account for the ability of hepadnavirus-infected cells persistently to produce virus particles in the absence of stable integration of viral DNA.
https://openalex.org/W2043059431,"When pulsed, ultraviolet laser radiation falls on the surface of an organic polymer or biological tissue, the material at the surface is spontaneously etched away to a depth of 0.1 to several micrometers. In the process, the depth of etching is controlled by the width of the pulse and the fluence of the laser, and there is no detectable thermal damage to the substrate. The material that is removed by etching consists of products ranging from atoms to small fragments of the polymer. They are ejected at supersonic velocities. This dry photoetching technique is useful in patterning polymer films. It is also under serious investigation in several areas in surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2032215155,"The regulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) protein and NGF messenger RNA (mRNA) in the developing rat brain has been studied to assess the hypothesis that NGF supports the differentiation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. In the adult, the major targets of these neurons, the hippocampus and neocortex, contain the highest concentrations of NGF mRNA, but comparatively low ratios of NGF protein to its mRNA. In contrast, a high concentration of NGF protein and a low concentration of NGF mRNA were seen in the basal forebrain, consistent with retrograde transport of NGF protein into this region from the neocortex and hippocampus. In these two target regions NGF and NGF mRNA were barely detectable at birth, their concentrations increased to a peak at day 21, and then NGF mRNA, but not NGF protein, declined threefold by day 35. NGF accumulation in the basal forebrain paralleled that in the target regions and preceded an increase in choline acetyltransferase, suggesting that the differentiation of cholinergic projection neurons is indeed regulated by retrogradely transported NGF. In addition, high ratios of NGF protein to NGF mRNA, comparable to that in the basal forebrain, were seen in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, suggesting that NGF may be transported into these regions by unidentified neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2137999969,"The polypeptide encoded in URF6, the last unassigned reading frame of human mitochondrial DNA, has been identified with antibodies to peptides predicted from the DNA sequence. Antibodies prepared against highly purified respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase from beef heart or against the cytoplasmically synthesized 49-kilodalton iron-sulfur subunit isolated from this enzyme complex, when added to a deoxycholate or a Triton X-100 mitochondrial lysate of HeLa cells, specifically precipitated the URF6 product together with the six other URF products previously identified as subunits of NADH dehydrogenase. These results strongly point to the URF6 product as being another subunit of this enzyme complex. Thus, almost 60% of the protein coding capacity of mammalian mitochondrial DNA is utilized for the assembly of the first enzyme complex of the respiratory chain. The absence of such information in yeast mitochondrial DNA dramatizes the variability in gene content of different mitochondrial genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1997146539,"A novel 56,000-dalton growth factor found in mouse salivary gland was purified, molecularly cloned, and expressed in monkey COS cells. The protein is a neurotrophic factor and also, surprisingly, a lymphokine product of lectin-stimulated T cells. The factor was therefore named neuroleukin. Neuroleukin promotes the survival in culture of a subpopulation of embryonic spinal neurons that probably includes skeletal motor neurons. Neuroleukin also supports the survival of cultured sensory neurons that are insensitive to nerve growth factor, but has no effect on sympathetic or parasympathetic neurons. The amino acid sequence of neuroleukin is partly homologous to a highly conserved region of the external envelope protein of HTLV-III/LAV, the retrovirus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2011039989,"U1 and U2 snRNAs are thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II. A conserved sequence known as the 3' box is located just downstream from the snRNA coding region and directs formation of the 3' end of pre-U1 and pre-U2 snRNA. We show here that a U1 or U2 promoter containing an intact snRNA enhancer is required for the U1 3' box to function efficiently. Promoters for genes encoding mRNAs cannot substitute for the snRNA promoter. Thus snRNAs must be transcribed by a specialized transcription complex that differs from transcription complexes synthesizing mRNAs. Moreover, in contrast to polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated mRNAs, the 3' ends of pre-snRNAs must be generated either by termination of transcription, or by an RNA processing event intimately coupled to transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2088171363,"Retrovirus expression is restricted in embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. To study how a virus can overcome this block, we selected and analyzed rare proviruses that are expressed in F9 cells. Our results indicate that provirus expression occurs by two different mechanisms: one provirus acquired a single base pair mutation in the retrovirus tRNA primer binding site, permitting provirus expression; expression of three proviruses was mediated by 5â€²-flanking DNA sequences. Surprisingly, five proviruses in 17 selected cell lines integrated into the same two distinct chromosomal regions, suggesting that the number of chromosomal positions in the cellular genome that allows virus expression is very limited. Our results suggest that genomic sequences that are actively transcribed in EC cells can be isolated by selection for retrovirus expression."

https://openalex.org/W2026482135,"We deleted the cytoplasmic domain of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor. When expressed in fibroblasts, the truncated receptor, like the wild-type, reaches the cell surface, can bind ligand, and is cleaved to secretory component. Unlike the wild-type, it is not endocytosed. When expressed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, the mutant receptor is transported from the Golgi apparatus directly to the apical surface and cleaved to secretory component. In contrast, the wild-type receptor travels from the Golgi to the basolateral surface and is then endocytosed and sent to the apical surface. These results suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is necessary for both basolateral localization and endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1559244050,"Tomato cell suspensions have been selected for sustained growth on normally lethal concentrations of CdCl2. In cadmium-resistant (CdR) cells, Cd2+ is found complexed with non-protein, cysteine-rich polypeptides which accumulate in high amounts when cells are grown in the presence of Cd2+. Sequence and linkage analysis of these peptides by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry establishes structures of (gamma-Glu-Cys)3-Gly and (gamma-Glu-Cys)4-Gly. Necessity of these peptides for the CdR phenotype is demonstrated by inhibition of their accumulation by buthionine sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Treatment of CdR cells with a concentration of buthionine sulfoximine below that inhibiting growth in the absence of Cd2+ renders CdR cells sensitive to Cd2+ ion."

https://openalex.org/W1510897788,"The effects of 5' proximal secondary structure in mRNA molecules on their translation and on their interaction with the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF)-4F, eIF-4A, and eIF-4B have been examined. Secondary structures were generated in the 5' noncoding region of rabbit globin and reovirus mRNAs by means of hybridization with cDNA molecules. cDNAs hybridized to the first 15 bases downstream from the cap inhibited the translation of the mRNAs in both reticulocyte and wheat germ lysates. The degree of inhibition was directly related to the monovalent ion concentration and inversely related to reaction temperature. These hybrid structures also reduced the competitive ability of the messages. Hybrid structures beginning downstream from the first 15 bases did not inhibit the translation of beta-globin mRNA or reovirus s3 mRNA. None of the hybrid structures were detrimental to the interaction of the mRNAs with the 26-kDa cap binding protein of eIF-4F, as determined by chemical cross-linking assays. However, in the presence of ATP, hybrid structures immediately adjacent to the cap severely inhibited the cross-linking to the p46 subunit of eIF-4F or to additional eIF-4A or eIF-4B. In order to account for these observations, a two-step mechanism is proposed for the interaction of eIF-4F with the 5' end of an mRNA molecule. The first step involves a weak initial interaction of the p26 subunit with the cap. The second step requires the hydrolysis of ATP and results in the formation of a stable initiation factor-mRNA complex, which may involve eIF-4A and eIF-4B. This second step is inhibited by the presence of 5' proximal secondary structure. In any event, our results demonstrate that the effect of mRNA structure on translation rate depends strongly on its position with respect to the 5' end and that this effect is due at least in part to an inhibition of the action of initiation factors normally required for the unwinding of structure."
https://openalex.org/W1994053857,"A novel genetic scheme was used to isolate mutants altered in the formation or maintenance of amplified rDNA in the Tetrahymena macronucleus. One such mutant had a cis-acting rDNA mutation that affected the ability of mutant rDNA molecules to replicate in macronuclei in the presence of a wild-type (B strain) rDNA. The mutant rDNA was lost from these heterozygous macronuclei during vegetative cell divisions, although it was maintained normally in the homozygous or hemizygous state. In contrast, wild-type macronuclear rDNA of the C3 strain used to obtain the mutant outreplicated B strain rDNA in heterozygote macronuclei. Sequence differences were found between wild-type B and C3 and mutant C3 rDNAs in the replication origin region, changing an upstream repeat of a highly conserved rRNA promoter element. We propose that the various rDNA alleles differentially compete for limiting amounts of trans-acting factors that bind to these enhancer-like repeats and positively regulate rDNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W1658543891,"The nucleotide sequence of the malate dehydrogenase (mdh) gene from a thermophilic bacterium, Thermus flavus, was determined. The amino acid sequence of the Thermus malate dehydrogenase resembled that of the porcine heart cytoplasmic enzyme to a certain extent, and Asp-159 and His-187 were identified as possible essential residues for the catalytic function. The mutated mdh gene was also cloned from a spontaneous mutant of T. flavus containing a higher activity of the enzyme. Its mutation point was determined to be a single nucleotide exchange from C to T which caused Thr-190 to be substituted by isoleucine. The mutated enzyme showed resistance to substrate inhibition, an increase in both kcat and Km, and a shift toward a more acid optimum pH for the enzyme reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1544129026,"Fibronectin binds to specific receptors on the surface of washed, thrombin-activated platelets. Evidence suggests that these receptors are closely associated with the platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (GP IIb-IIIa). To determine whether GP IIb-IIIa itself can form a platelet receptor for fibronectin, we used a filtration assay to examine the interaction of purified fibronectin with purified GP IIb-IIIa incorporated into phospholipid vesicles. 125I-Fibronectin binding to the phospholipid vesicles required the presence of incorporated GP IIb-IIIa and was specific, time-dependent, reversible, saturable, and divalent cation-dependent (Mg2+ greater than Ca2+). The dissociation constant for 125I-fibronectin binding to the GP IIb-IIIa-containing vesicles in the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 was 87 nM. Proteins or peptides that inhibit 125I-fibronectin binding to whole platelets also inhibited 125I-fibronectin binding to the GP IIb-IIIa vesicles. Thus, specific 125I-fibronectin binding was inhibited by excess unlabeled fibrinogen or fibronectin, the anti-GP IIb-IIIa monoclonal antibody 10E5, the decapeptide from the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen gamma-chain, and the tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser from the cell-binding domain of fibronectin. In contrast to results obtained using whole platelets, unlabeled fibronectin inhibited 125I-fibronectin binding to the GP IIb-IIIa vesicles. These results show that 125I-fibronectin binds directly to purified GP IIb-IIIa with most of the previously reported properties of 125I-fibronectin binding to washed, thrombin-stimulated platelets. Thus, GP IIb-IIIa has the potential to function as a platelet receptor for fibronectin as well as for fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1996013296,"Forms of RNA polymerase I prepared from growing or encysted Acanthamoeba are equal in the ability to transcribe poly(dI:dC). Polymerase from cysts, whose rRNA genes are transcriptionally inactive, is unable to utilize the rDNA promoter in vitro, whereas the transcription initiation factor from cysts is fully able to bind the promoter and direct transcription. Footprinting shows that polymerase from cysts is functionally inactive because of its inability to bind to the promoter. The polymerase footprint moves downstream the appropriate number of base pairs upon various nucleotide additions, without affecting the factor footprint. These results support our hypothesis that rRNA synthesis in eukaryotes is regulated by polymerase I modification and not by alterations to additional DNA-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1488834135,"A membrane skeleton-associated protein with calmodulin-binding activity recently has been purified and characterized from human erythrocytes (Gardner, K. and Bennett, V. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1339-1348). This new protein (CaM-BP103/97) has now been identified as a major substrate for protein kinase C in erythrocytes since phosphorylation of both of its subunits (Mr = 103,000 and 97,000) is elevated 3-15-fold in the presence of the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol beta-acetate (TPA), under the following conditions: ghost membranes incubated with protein kinase C purified from rat brain, ghost membranes from erythrocytes pretreated with TPA, and intact erythrocytes metabolically labeled with 32PO4 and stimulated by TPA. The sites of phosphorylation of this protein by exogenous and endogenous protein kinase C are identical since two-dimensional 32P-peptide maps of both subunits labeled by either endogenous or exogenous enzyme are indistinguishable. Each subunit of CaM-BP103/97 accepts up to 3 mol of phosphate/polypeptide chain. In the presence of low calcium concentrations and in the absence of cytosol, the phosphorylation of CaM-BP103/97 is, on a molar basis, equal to or greater than that of proteins 4.1 and 4.9. As a target for both calmodulin and protein kinase C, CaM-BP103/97 is likely to play a key role in the effect of calcium on erythrocyte membrane shape and stability."
https://openalex.org/W1526140678,"The complete amino acid sequence of the B-chain of Shigella toxin has been determined using both liquid- and gas-phase sequenators. It reveals a 69-amino acid peptide with a single disulfide bridge, predicting a subunit molecular weight of 7691. No Asn-X-Ser(Thr) sequence was found, confirming the absence of potential N-glycosylation sites. A computer data bank search using a mutation data matrix did not detect any similarity greater than 30% with known sequences to date, indicating a novel primary structure. However, some distant homology with the 103-residue B-chain of cholera and Escherichia coli enterotoxins was revealed. Hydropathy, fractional exposure, and Chou and Fasman calculations all point to an ordered structure with a hydrophobic core spanning residues 36-52 and a hydrophilic domain between residues 10 and 20, the latter probably representing the most antigenic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1612390895,"Rabbit tracheal epithelial (RbTE) cells in culture undergo terminal squamous differentiation characterized by enhanced transglutaminase activity, synthesis of specific keratins, and the formation of cross-linked envelopes. The expression of each of these markers of differentiation occurs spontaneously after the cells reach confluency, but this expression can be inhibited by the inclusion of retinoids in the extracellular medium. In the current work, we demonstrate that radioactive sulfate incorporation into the organic phase of a CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) extract of RbTE cells increases 50- to 100-fold upon differentiation and that this accumulation can be completely blocked by the inclusion of retinoic acid in the culture medium. By the techniques of specific metabolic radiolabeling, thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, the sulfated amphiphile was shown to be cholesterol 3-sulfate. Cholesterol sulfate accumulation begins 1 to 2 days after the RbTE cells reach the stationary phase of growth which is the same time that other differentiated functions begin to be expressed. The inhibition of accumulation by retinoic acid is concentration-dependent and half-maximal at 5 X 10(-11) M. The relative efficacy of a series of synthetic retinoids in inhibiting cholesterol sulfate accumulation correlated with their binding to the cellular retinoic acid-binding protein. These data taken together indicate that cholesterol sulfate is a marker of squamous differentiation in RbTE cells in culture. Possible biochemical mechanisms of the regulation of cholesterol sulfate levels during differentiation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1578747716,"The technique of aqueous two-phase partitioning has been used to study changes in estrogen receptor (ER) structure that occur upon ligand binding and/or heating in vitro. Studies with steroidal and nonsteroidal ligands indicate that the difference in partitioning properties between unoccupied and nontransformed ER is due to a ligand-induced change in this conformation of the protein. Furthermore, this conformational change is only partially induced by binding of 4-OH-tamoxifen. Although nontransformed 4-OH-tamoxifen complexes can be transformed by heat, there are significant differences in the transformation process for receptors bound to 4-OH-tamoxifen versus estrogenic ligands. A kinetic analysis of estrogen receptor transformation indicates that the process follows apparent first order kinetics, but is 2.5-fold slower for the 4-OH-tamoxifen-receptor complex. Direct heating of the unoccupied ER causes a significant change in receptor structure. Ligand binding to the heat-altered unoccupied receptor results in a further alteration of receptor structure. Experiments using polyethylene glycol palmitate indicate that the ligand-binding transition is associated with a reduction of the hydrophobic characteristics of the receptor. These results demonstrate that there are a number of independent conformational changes that occur within the monomeric ER steroid-binding subunit upon ligand binding and exposure to elevated temperature in vitro."

(1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12157-12160) that two protein kinases, designated CPK1 (25 kDa) and CPK2 (38 kDa), are present in spinach thylakoid membranes was investigated in light of results from this laboratory (Coughlan, S. J., and Hind, G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11378-11385) showing that 75-80% of the measurable protein kinase activity of isolated thylakoids is attributable to a protein kinase of 64 kDa apparent molecular mass. Extraction of thylakoid membranes with octyl glucoside/cholate according to the procedure of Lin et al. (Lin, Z. F., Lucero, H. A., and Racker, E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12153-12156) released proteins assignable to CPK1 and CPK2 on the basis of photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P]ATP. The 64-kDa protein kinase was present in this extract and accounted for greater than 80% of the total phosphotransferase activity toward lysine-rich histone as substrate; it was not labeled by the photoaffinity reagent. The three presumptive kinases were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and affinity chromatography. CPK1 was specifically eluted from Cibacron blue-Sepharose by 10 mM ATP; it electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels as a single band with apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa. Its specific activity toward lysine-rich histone as substrate was approximately 250 pmol of phosphate transferred (mg protein)-1 min-1. The 64-kDa protein kinase was eluted from the affinity column by 1% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate or from a histone IIIs-Sepharose affinity column by 0.25 M NaCl. Its specific activity towards lysine-rich histone was 100-200 times greater than that of CPK1. CPK2 eluted from the Cibacron blue affinity column in 10 mM NADP+; it had an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa, possessed NADPH-dependent diaphorase activity (specific activity: 225 nmol of ferricyanide reduced (mg protein)-1 min-1), and cross-reacted with immunoglobulin raised against purified ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase, with which it was thus identified. Kinase activity was not detectable in CPK2 or in reductase isolated by conventional procedures."

Examination of the effect of ionic strength on the various partial activities of nitrate reductase revealed that while NADH:ferricyanide and reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase activities were unaffected by ionic strength, NADH:cytochrome c and reduced flavin:nitrate reductase activities were inhibited and stimulated by increased ionic strength, respectively. Comparison of the rates for the partial activities indicated electron transfer from heme to molybdenum to be the rate-limiting step in enzyme turnover. The pH optimum for NADH:nitrate reductase activity was found to be 7.9 while values for the partial activities ranged from 5.5 to 8.1. Phosphate was found to stimulate both NADH:nitrate and reduced methyl viologen:nitrate reductase activities indicating the molybdenum center as the site of interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1497969442,"The Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line was investigated with respect to the cellular polarity of amino acid transport in early confluent versus late confluent cultures. Early confluent cultures could take up amino acids from the apical and the basolateral sides of the cell layer via amino acid transport Systems A, ASC, and L. However, in late confluent cultures the activities of Systems A and L were clearly localized to the basolateral surface of the cell monolayer. In addition to the presence of systems A, ASC, and L, a novel activity, measurable under conditions used for quantitating System ASC, was found to be active in the apical membrane of these cells. This transporter, termed System G (for general), recognized basic and neutral amino acids with high affinity and acidic amino acids with lower affinity. System G exhibited broad substrate specificity, strict cation specificity, and a broad pH optimum with maximal activity at acidic pH. The activity of System G was relatively low after growth in serum-containing medium but was induced in a defined medium. Induction of System G activity was dependent upon the presence of prostaglandin E1. The broad substrate specificity, low pH optimum, and Na+ dependence suggest that System G may function in apical membranes as an energy-dependent transport route during reabsorption of amino acids from the kidney tubule lumen."

(1974) Vox Sang. 26, 163-166). We have purified the lectin to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. The agglutinin was found to be a glycoprotein of Mr = 50,000, composed of two identical subunits of Mr = 35,000 linked together by disulfide bonds. The purified lectin agglutinates specifically Tn erythrocytes and, at higher concentrations, also Cad erythrocytes. Native A, B, or O red blood cells are not agglutinated by the lectin and, even after treatment with sialidase or papain, these cells are not recognized. Tn red cells present 1.45 X 10(6) accessible sites to the lectin which binds to these erythrocytes with an association constant of 1.8 X 10(6) M-1. On Cad red cells, 1.73 X 10(6) sites are accessible to the lectin which binds with an association constant of 1.0 X 10(6) M-1. The carbohydrate specificity of the S. sclarea lectin has been determined in detail, using well defined monosaccharide, oligosaccharide, and glycopeptide structures. The lectin was found to be specific for terminal N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues. It binds preferentially alpha GalNAc determinants either linked to Ser or Thr (as in Tn structures) or linked in 1-3 to a beta GalNAc or to an unsubstituted beta Gal. Although more weakly, the lectin binds beta GalNAc residues linked in 1-4 to a beta Gal (as in Cad structures). It does not recognize beta GalNAc determinants linked in 1-3 to a Gal (as in globoside) or the alpha GalNAc residues of blood group A structures."
https://openalex.org/W2112042901,"We have reported previously that a number of metabolites and toxins which cause Ca2+ release from mitochondria do so by increasing the permeability of the inner membrane. The metabolic basis of this permeability change is proposed to be perturbation of a phospholipid deacylation-reacylation cycle which results in an accumulation of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids (see Broekemeier, K. M., Schmid, P. C., Schmid, H. H. O., and Pfeiffer, D. R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 105-113 and references therein). This hypothesis predicts that inhibitors of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase would be among those agents which increase membrane permeability and that their effects on permeability could occur in the absence of pyridine nucleotide oxidation or of an accumulation of glutathione disulfide. The hypolipidemic drugs WY-14643 and clofibric acid inhibit the mitochondrial acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase and have the predicted effects on mitochondrial permeability properties. The development of increased permeability due to WY-14643 and clofibric acid requires accumulated Ca2+ specifically, is sensitive to inhibitors of phospholipase A2, and results in a pattern of solute release and swelling which is typical of other Ca2+-releasing agents. Neither agent promotes pyridine nucleotide nor sulfhydryl glutathione oxidation in the absence of Ca2+. In addition, the swelling response to hypolipidemic drugs is not significantly inhibited by dithiothreitol. In the presence of Ca2+, both agents promote an accumulation of free fatty acids. The composition of these lipid degradation products suggests that mitochondria treated with hypolipidemic drugs retain an active lysophospholipase whereas this enzyme is inactivated by Ca2+-releasing agents which alter mitochondrial sulfhydryl groups."
https://openalex.org/W1551933062,"We have studied the effect of butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids on thyroid hormone nuclear receptors in C6 cells, a rat glioma cell line. Exposure of C6 cells to butyrate leads to increased levels of L-triiodothyronine (T3) in the nuclear and extranuclear compartments. The rise in nuclear binding is not merely a reflection of the higher cellular hormone content, and Scatchard analysis of T3 binding to isolated nuclei reveals that butyrate increases receptor number without changing affinity. The effect on the receptor is quantitatively important: a 48-h incubation with 2 mM butyrate increases nuclear binding by 2-3-fold, and 5 mM butyrate by 3-5-fold. Other short-chain fatty acids were found to similarly influence both nuclear receptor and extranuclear T3 levels with the following potency: butyrate greater than valerate greater than propionate greater than acetate. On the contrary, ketone bodies were ineffective. Butyrate increases receptor levels by decreasing receptor degradation, since the apparent t1/2 of receptor disappearance increased by approximately 3-fold in cells incubated with 2 mM butyrate for 48 h. The regulation of receptor number might be secondary to an action of butyrate on regions of the chromatin to which the receptor associates. We then examined the effect of butyrate on histone acetylation. The fatty acid had little effect in increasing the level of multiacetylated forms of H3 and H4 histone when studied in acid-urea gels, but it markedly inhibited the turnover of [3H] acetate from the histone fraction. There was a striking similarity in the dose-response of butyrate for increasing receptor levels and inhibiting histone deacetylation. Furthermore, a very close correlation between receptor levels and [3H]acetate release was also found when different short-chain fatty acids were used. We thus conclude that the effect of butyrate on the receptor could be explained by a modification of the chromatin structure of C6 cells secondary to acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W1603025348,"The isomeric composition of retinal in membrane-bound and in purified but detergent-free, dark-adapted halorhodopsin was found to be about 70% 13-cis and 30% all-trans. Any illumination increased the all-trans content relative to the dark-adapted state, but blue illumination shifted the isomeric composition more toward all-trans while red illumination of blue-adapted samples shifted it more toward 13-cis. In the presence of chloride this photoisomerization caused the kind of photochromic behavior reported earlier in Smith, S. O., Marvin, M. J., Bogomolni, R. A., and Mathies, R. A. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12326-12329, i.e. blue light caused the absorption maximum to move toward longer wavelengths and red light reversed the shift. Only the all-trans chromophore exhibited the complete photocycle described earlier in detergent-solubilized halorhodopsin, and this was the form that could be associated with light-driven chloride transport activity in cell envelope vesicles. In the absence of chloride the spectroscopic changes caused by illumination were much smaller. Reconstitution of bleached preparations with 13-cis- and all-trans-retinal, in the presence and absence of chloride, confirmed that the difference between the absorption maxima of the two isomeric forms of the chromophore is affected by chloride: 13-cis-halorhodopsin absorbs at about 567-568 nm with and without chloride, and the all-trans pigment absorbs near 568 nm in the absence of chloride, but at 578 nm in its presence. The simplest explanation of this finding is that most of the red-shift which accompanies the 13-cis----all-trans transition originates from electrostatic interaction of the retinal with chloride bound in its vicinity."
https://openalex.org/W1563529384,"Oxamate, structural analog of pyruvate, inhibits gluconeogenesis from pyruvate or substrates yielding pyruvate. The inhibitory effect is the result of a decreased mitochondrial pyruvate utilization. Although the inhibition of gluconeogenesis is competitive for pyruvate, in isolated mitochondria oxamate displays a mixed type kinetics inhibitory pattern of pyruvate utilization. Evidence is presented indicating that this mixed type pattern of inhibition is the result of the action of oxamate on two different sites: noncompetitive inhibition of pyruvate carboxylation, and competitive inhibition of pyruvate entry into the mitochondria. At concentrations of pyruvate above 0.4 mM, although pyruvate carboxylation is decreased by 40% by oxamate, no detectable effects on the gluconeogenic flux were observed. This finding strongly indicates that pyruvate carboxylase is not an important rate-limiting step for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Thus, the inhibition of gluconeogenesis at low pyruvate concentrations (less than 0.4 mM) seems to be the result of an interaction of oxamate with the mitochondrial pyruvate translocator, indicating that pyruvate transport across the mitochondrial membrane is the first nonequilibrium step in the gluconeogenic pathway when low physiological concentrations of this substrate are utilized."
https://openalex.org/W1501583163,"beta-(+/-)-2-Aminobicyclo-(2.2.1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) stimulated, in a concentration-dependent manner, the formation of glutamate by mitochondria isolated from rat liver and incubated with 20 mM glutamine. Maximum enhancement was seen with 10 mM BCH while 5 mM leucine was without effect. The initial lag in the rate of glutamate formation was not eliminated by BCH. Preincubation of the mitochondria without glutamine also did not abolish the lag period; to the contrary, it resulted in a progressive deactivation of the glutaminase. The decrease in enzyme activity during the preincubation without glutamine was partially reversed by the addition of either 10 mM BCH or 1.4 mM NH4Cl and was essentially abolished by their combined action. The apparently sigmoid rise in the activity of glutaminase with increasing concentration of glutamine became hyperbolic in the presence of 1.4 mM NH4Cl. BCH stimulated the NH4Cl-activated glutaminase in the entire range of glutamine concentrations studied (2-40 mM) without changing the S50 value. In mitochondria disrupted by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, the enzymatic activity was maximal even in the absence of BCH. It is postulated that BCH is a potent activator of mitochondrial glutaminase and that manifestation of its action requires intact organelle structure. In addition, it is concluded that BCH-induced stimulation of glutamine catabolism in isolated hepatocytes (Zaleski, J., Wilson, D. F., and Erecinska, M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14082-14090) is the consequence of activation of the mitochondrial glutaminase."
https://openalex.org/W1954164235,"A new reactive ADP analogue has been synthesized: 2-(4-bromo-2,3-dioxobutylthio)adenosine 5'-diphosphate (2-BDB-TADP). Reaction of ADP with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid gave ADP 1-oxide, which was treated with NaOH, followed by reaction with carbon disulfide to yield 2-thioadenosine 5'-diphosphate. The final product was synthesized by condensation of 2-thioadenosine 5'-diphosphate with 1,4-dibromobutanedione. Reaction of pig heart NAD-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase with this nucleotide analogue (0.4 mM) causes a time-dependent loss of activity to a limiting value of 75% inactivation. The rate constant for inactivation exhibits a nonlinear dependence on the concentration of 2-BDB-TADP, with kmax = 0.021 min-1 and KI = 0.067 mM. Complete protection against inactivation by 0.2 mM 2-BDB-TADP is provided by ADP + Mn2+, but not by Mn2+ alone, isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, or NAD. Incorporation of 2-BDB-TADP is proportional to the extent of inactivation, reaching 1 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme subunit when the enzyme is maximally inactivated. However, when inactivation is totally prevented by incubation with 2-BDB-TADP in the presence of ADP and Mn2+, 0.5 mol of reagent/mol of subunit is still incorporated, suggesting that inactivation may be attributed to 0.5 mol of reagent/mol of average subunit. In the native enzyme, the Km for total isocitrate is 1.8 mM and is decreased 6-fold to 0.3 mM in the presence of 1 mM ADP, whereas in the modified enzyme, with 25% residual activity, the Km for total isocitrate is about the same in the absence (2.0 mM) or presence (1.8 mM) of ADP. These results indicate that 2-BDB-TADP acts as an affinity label of the ADP allosteric site of NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1651951341,"The metabolic effects of beta-(+/-)-2-aminobicyclo-(2.2.1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), a nonmetabolizable analog of leucine and known activator of glutamate dehydrogenase, were studied in hepatocytes isolated from fed and fasted rats. With glutamine as substrate, BCH stimulated in a concentration-dependent manner urea synthesis in both physiological states and glucose formation in hepatocytes from fasted rats. Despite the much higher rates of ureagenesis in the fasted animals, the degree of stimulation by BCH, over 2-fold, was similar. The effect of the drug was specific for glutamine since the rates of urea synthesis from NH4Cl, alanine, and asparagine were essentially unaltered. The stimulation of glutamine catabolism by BCH led to a decrease in the content of intracellular glutamine. The redox states of the mitochondrial and cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides remained unaltered. In hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats and incubated with 5 mM glutamine the BCH-induced increases in urea, ammonia, and the amino acids, glutamate, aspartate, and alanine, accounted fully for the 2.4-fold rise in glutamine utilization. The stimulatory effects of BCH and glucagon on the formation of glucose, urea, and 14CO2 from [U-14C]glutamine were additive. Aminooxyacetate, and inhibitor of transaminases, neither blocked glutamine catabolism (as measured by the sum of urea, ammonia, and glutamate) nor prevented its activation by BCH. It is suggested that, in isolated hepatocytes, BCH-induced stimulation of glucose and urea formation from glutamine results from activation of glutaminase by a mechanism which is distinct from that of glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W1488758244,"Cytochrome b5 was incorporated into large vesicles of 1-palmitoyl-2-dibromostearoylphosphatidylcholine by mixing lipid, protein, and deoxycholate followed by removal of the detergent by gel filtration. The tryptophan fluorescence emanating from the hydrophobic membrane-binding domain was quenched more effectively when the bromine atoms were in the 6,7-positions than when they were in the 15,16-positions of the acyl chain. To more precisely define the position of the quenchable tryptophan, the experiment was repeated with lipids with the bromine atoms at the 4,5-, 6,7- or 9,10-positions. Again the 6,7 species was the most efficient quencher. The cytochrome b5 bound to these vesicles would not transfer to small unilamellar sonicated vesicles and so was in the configuration. If the cytochrome were added to the vesicles after the detergent was removed, the same order of quenching was seen but the cytochrome would transfer to other vesicles. These data indicate that the quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence is greatest when the bromines are at the 6,7-positions whether the vesicles are large or small and whether the cytochrome is in the tight or loose configuration and so place the tryptophan 0.7 nm below the vesicle surface in all of these membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1569209865,"Abstract Protease nexin-I (PN-I) is representative of a newly described class of serine protease inhibitors secreted by human fibroblasts, the protease nexins. Protease nexins form covalent complexes with their target proteases, subsequently binding to cells via specific receptors. PN-I preferentially binds thrombin, urokinase, trypsin, and plasmin, and its binding to thrombin is accelerated by heparin. We have previously described the production of a polyclonal antibody against PN-I which is able to block the binding of PN-I X proteinase complexes to cells and will immunoprecipitate metabolically labeled PN-I. Anti-PN-I was used to investigate the biosynthesis and regulation of PN-I in human fibroblasts. Unlabeled PN-I could compete for the binding of metabolically labeled PN-I to anti-PN-I, as shown by the elimination of the 43-kDa band representing PN-I on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis autoradiographs. Excision of this 43-kDa band from gels, followed by amino-terminal sequencing, showed a homogeneous protein that is homologous with that described by Scott et al. (Scott, R. W., Bergman, B. L., Bajpai, A., Hersh, R. T., Rodriguez, H., Jones, B. N., Barreda, C., Watts, S., and Baker, J. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7029-7034). An analysis of the biosynthesis of the PN-I revealed that a lower Mr precursor exists intracellularly. This apparent rough endoplasmic reticulum form appears as a doublet on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, as does mature PN-I. The PN-I precursor was also sensitive to endoglycosidase H, suggesting that it contains N-linked carbohydrates of the high mannose form. Mature PN-I is not sensitive to endoglycosidase H, but does contain 3 kDa of N-linked carbohydrate. PN-I appears to be constitutively secreted by fibroblasts. PN-I levels in conditioned media reach a steady state within 48 h, although PN-I synthesis maintains a constant rate. This steady state is due to the continuous uptake of PN-I from medium, presumably through a specific receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1604049163,"Tritium-hydrogen isotope exchange techniques have been employed to study the effect of tri-N-acetylglucosamine binding on the conformational dynamics of hen egg white lysozyme. Numerical Laplace inversion of the data provides exchange rate probability density functions that reveal three overlapping peaks for both the free enzyme and (GlcNAc)3-enzyme complex. Binding of (GlcNAc)3 decreases the exchange rates of all protons to some extent with by far the largest effect being observed for the slow exchanging protons. These have been located, by comparison with neutron diffraction results (Mason, S. A., Bentley, G. A., and McIntyre, G. J. (1984) in Neutrons in Biology (Schoenborn, B. P., ed) pp. 323-334, Plenum Press, New York), within the beta-sheet structure and on helices (8-13), (28-34), and (89-97), that define the edges of the so-called hydrophobic box in lysozyme. The regions of the protein that are most affected by binding (GlcNAc)3, as revealed by hydrogen exchange, are found to be quite distinct from the regions observed to undergo conformational changes by x-ray diffraction. Most of these segments of the protein are located at some distance from the (GlcNAc)3-binding site itself. Two segments (the beta-sheet and helix (28-34)) are closely associated with the two active-site carboxylate groups. These results suggest that exchange-stable regions having strong, highly organized hydrogen bonding may have an important role in catalytic function and the differential propagation of conformational and dynamic perturbations caused by ligand binding at distant sites on the protein."

https://openalex.org/W3118743019,"We present evidence which demonstrates that L-cycloserine, structural analog of L-alanine, which is known to be an effective aminotransferase inhibitor, is also a potent inhibitor of cellular pyruvate metabolism. This effect was found to be related to its almost instantaneous action in decreasing pyruvate concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance studies clearly demonstrate that the irreversible removal of pyruvate induced by L-cycloserine is caused by the decarboxylating action of the latter. Pyruvate disappearance induced by L-cycloserine can be stoichiometrically accounted for as acetate. The process does not involve any chemically detected transformation of L-cycloserine. These observations lead to two main considerations regarding the known action of L-cycloserine. First, its inhibitory effect on gluconeogenesis from lactate could be explained only on the basis of its ability to reduce pyruvate availability with no apparent need for transaminase inhibition. Second, its ability as a transaminase inhibitor should be reconsidered in view of its potent decarboxylating action on pyruvate and probably other oxoacids."
