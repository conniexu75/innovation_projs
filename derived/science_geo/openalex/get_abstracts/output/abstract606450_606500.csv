Thaiss et al. found that mice with systemic infection of a Salmonella analog, Citrobacter rodentium , also exhibited hyperglycemia. Deletion of the glucose transporter GLUT2 altered sensitivity to chemically induced epithelial permeability and protected mice from pathogen invasion. The authors also found a correlation in humans between glycated hemoglobin (an indicator of hyperglycemia) and serum levels of pathogen recognition receptor ligands. Science , this issue p. 1376"

MBSs have been observed in heterostructures that require careful nanofabrication, but the complexity of such systems makes further progress tricky.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by senile plaques enriched with β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016Selkoe D.J. Hardy J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease at 25 years.EMBO Mol. Med. 2016; 8: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar). Oligomeric forms of Aβ (oAβ) are believed to trigger a pathological cascade leading to AD (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016Selkoe D.J. Hardy J.

Interestingly, a subset of these genes, including TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2), CD33, CR1, MS4A, ABCA7, and EPHA1, is expressed in myeloid cell types such as microglia, suggesting that immune cell dysfunction may play a key role in AD pathogenesis (Efthymiou and Goate, 2017Efthymiou A.G.

In addition to familial β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin (PS) 1/2 alleles linked to early AD onset (Vetrivel et al., 2006Vetrivel K.S. Zhang Y.W. Xu H. Thinakaran G.

Additional variants of the TREM2 ectodomain—e.g., R62H—are also linked to increased AD risk (Jin et al., 2014Jin S.C. Benitez B.A. Karch C.M. Cooper B. Skorupa T. Carrell D. Norton J.B. Hsu S.

TREM2 has been shown to mediate phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cell debris and modulate inflammatory response (Doens and Fernández, 2014Doens D. Fernández P.L.

Med. 2014; 6: 243ra86Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). TREM2 binds to its adaptor, DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) on the surface of microglia to enact innate immune responses and downstream cellular responses or signaling pathways (Jay et al., 2017bJay T.R. von Saucken V.E.

Despite recent identification of lipids and ApoE as TREM2 ligands (Atagi et al., 2015Atagi Y. Liu C.C. Painter M.M. Chen X.F. Verbeeck C. Zheng H. Li X. Rademakers R. Kang S.S.

To determine whether TREM2 could function as a receptor for Aβ, we prepared synthetic Aβ1-42 monomers and oligomers (Figures S1A and S1B) using protocols previously reported (Kim et al., 2013Kim T. Vidal G.S. Djurisic M. William C.M. Birnbaum M.E. Garcia K.C. Hyman B.T. Shatz C.J. Human LilrB2 is a β-amyloid receptor and its murine homolog PirB regulates synaptic plasticity in an Alzheimer’s model.Science. 2013; 341: 1399-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and we investigated whether the TREM2 ectodomain (TREM2-Fc) could bind to Aβ. TREM2-Fc co-precipitated with oAβ and, to a much lesser extent, with Aβ monomers; minimal binding was observed with TREM1-Fc or Fc controls (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1C). Immobilized TREM2-Fc bound to oAβ with an affinity comparable to previously described Aβ receptor proteins, such as CD36-Fc and RAGE-Fc (Figure 1C), with TREM2-Fc exhibiting little binding with Aβ monomers (data not shown). Similarly, immobilized oAβ bound TREM2-Fc with a comparable affinity to CD36-Fc and RAGE-Fc (Figure 1D), with little interaction detected in Fc and TREM1-Fc controls. Bio-layer interferometry assays consistently demonstrated high-affinity Aβ interactions with TREM2-His (KD = 12.7 ± 0.5 nM) (Figure 1E), where TREM1-His showed minimal oAβ binding (Figure 1F). We also confirmed Aβ/TREM2 interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays (Figure S1D). Interestingly, TREM2 R47H or R62H mutation compromised TREM2-Fc interactions with oAβ in solid phase-binding assays (Figure 1G). In agreement with these results, increased oAβ binding was observed in microglia-derived BV2 cells with stable TREM2 overexpression (Figure 1H), where TREM2 mRNA and protein levels were determined to be elevated to almost 3-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively (Figures S1E and S1F), compared to BV2 controls. Likewise, TREM2 also co-immunoprecipitated with Aβ in BV2 cells incubated with oAβ (Figure S1G). Importantly, an endogenous Aβ/TREM2 complex was co-immunoprecipitated from AD mouse brain lysates (TgCRND8, overexpressing mutant human APP) (Figure 1I) and human AD brain lysates (Figures 1J and S1H–S1J). Although we were unable to differentiate binding of Aβ monomers from oligomers in our assays, we anticipate that TREM2 interacts preferentially to oAβ, as seen in our in vitro-binding assays. We next determined whether TREM2 could modulate microglial Aβ catabolism. Given that a variety of Aβ surface receptors are redundantly expressed in microglia (Doens and Fernández, 2014Doens D. Fernández P.L. Microglia receptors and their implications in the response to amyloid β for Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis.J. Neuroinflammation. 2014; 11: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), it was not surprising that TREM2 deletion had little effect on surface binding (Figure S2A) and phagocytic uptake of Aβ in microglia (Figure 2A). However, we found that TREM2-deficient microglia showed significantly reduced Aβ degradation; fluorescent dye FAM-labeled Aβ was largely cleared 2–4 hr after internalization in wild-type (WT), but it was mostly retained in TREM2 knockout (KO) microglia (Figures 2B–2D). Although Aβ degradation was inhibited by exposure to the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, only partial effects were observed using a lysosomal/autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine [CQ]) (Figures 2C and 2D). These results were confirmed by ELISA using unlabeled oAβ (Figure S2B). In agreement with partial effects in Aβ turnover with CQ, only a small fraction of Aβ was found in LAMP1-positive compartments (Figure S2C). These results indicate that TREM2 mediates Aβ catabolism largely through proteasomal degradation pathways. Indeed, it is widely accepted that proteasome and lysosome pathways are interconnected through autophagosomes (Kwon and Ciechanover, 2017Kwon Y.T. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin code in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2017; 42: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). How TREM2 is involved in proteasome- and/or lysosome-mediated Aβ degradation warrants further examination. We also determined whether TREM2 deletion affects turnover rates of ligands for other microglial receptors, such as Gas6, which has been previously reported to bind to the MerTK receptor (Chen et al., 1997Chen J. Carey K. Godowski P.J. Identification of Gas6 as a ligand for Mer, a neural cell adhesion molecule related receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in cellular transformation.Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2033-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We found little or no Gas6 binding to TREM2 (Figure S2D); fluorescent-labeled Gas6 featured slower turnover rates compared to Aβ, where WT and TREM2 KO microglia showed no differences in Gas6 degradation (Figure S2E). Together, these data support a specific role for TREM2/Aβ interactions in Aβ degradation. Next, we characterized electrophysiological effects of oAβ on microglial membranes in culture. Induction of potassium (K+) currents by oAβ has been shown to promote microglial membrane depolarization (Franciosi et al., 2006Franciosi S. Ryu J.K. Choi H.B. Radov L. Kim S.U. McLarnon J.G. Broad-spectrum effects of 4-aminopyridine to modulate amyloid beta1-42-induced cell signaling and functional responses in human microglia.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11652-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We observed significant depolarization and associated changes in resting membrane potential (RMP) with oAβ treatment and TREM2 deletion; however, oAβ failed to induce further changes in membrane potential with TREM2 deletion (Figure 2E). Blocking either Kv1.3 or Kir3.1 channels eliminated the effect of TREM2 deficiency on RMP (Figure S2F). The presence of K+ currents in microglia is an early indicator of microglial activation associated with increased microglial excitability, proliferation, chemotaxis, and migration (Boucsein et al., 2000Boucsein C. Kettenmann H. Nolte C. Electrophysiological properties of microglial cells in normal and pathologic rat brain slices.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2049-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, Lam and Schlichter, 2015Lam D. Schlichter L.C. Expression and contributions of the Kir2.1 inward-rectifier K(+) channel to proliferation, migration and chemotaxis of microglia in unstimulated and anti-inflammatory states.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 185Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We then characterized K+ inward current induction and observed similar changes as seen in membrane potential above (Figures 2F–2H). Since TREM2 KO microglia did not show a corresponding decrease in cell capacitance (Figure S2G), the effect of TREM2 deficiency on K+ inward current was not due to decreased membrane surface area in TREM2 KO microglia. Together, this suggests a role for TREM2 in mediating oAβ-dependent changes in microglial excitability through K+ inward currents, and it provides functional evidence for the significant downregulation of K+ channels, such as Kir4.1 (KCNJ10), Kir7.1 (KCNJ13), and Kir 5.1 (KCNJ16), in TREM2-deficient microglia, as described previously (Ulland et al., 2017Ulland T.K. Song W.M. Huang S.C. Ulrich J.D. Sergushichev A. Beatty W.L. Loboda A.A. Zhou Y. Cairns N.J.

Given the central role inwardly rectifying K+ channels play in RMP and transition from resting to activated states, reduced expression of functional K+ channels is a key contributing factor to the depolarized RMP observed in TREM2-deficient microglia. Microglia are critical mediators of the inflammatory response in brain. We observed increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α (MIP-1α, also known as CCL3), and decreased anti-inflammatory Arg1 expression with oAβ exposure in WT microglia, whereas Aβ-induced effects on cytokine production were abolished in TREM2 KO microglia (Figure 3A). Using multiplex ELISA assays, we next examined cytokine secretion profiles from cultured WT and TREM2 KO microglia in the presence or absence of oAβ. Exposure to oAβ for 24 or 48 hr resulted in significantly elevated secretion of IL-6 and MIP-1α in WT microglia, with little or no oAβ-induced change observed in TREM2 KO microglia (Figures 3B and 3C). We did not observe any significant oAβ-induced changes in IL-1α, IL-4, interferon γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) secretion in WT and TREM2 KO microglia; steady-state levels of these cytokines were also equivalent in WT and TREM2 KO microglia (Figures S3A and S3B). As our results suggest that TREM2 mediates Aβ-induced microglial response, we next investigated downstream events that potentially drive TREM2-dependent microglial activation. Interestingly, interaction between TREM2 and its obligate adaptor DAP12 was increased in primary microglia with acute Aβ exposure (30–60 min), as indicated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay (Figure 3D) and TREM2/DAP12 co-immunoprecipitation assays (Figures 3E and S3C). Overexpression of TREM2 increased DAP12 levels (Figure S3D), likely due to stabilizing interactions previously described (Zhong et al., 2015Zhong L. Chen X.F. Zhang Z.L. Wang Z. Shi X.Z. Xu K. Zhang Y.W. Xu H. Bu G. DAP12 stabilizes the c-terminal fragment of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) and protects against LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 15866-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); TREM2-DAP12 interactions were further enhanced by oAβ treatment (Figure S3E). In addition, brief oAβ exposure induced SYK phosphorylation (a key component of the TREM2/DAP12-signaling pathway) in WT, but not TREM2 KO, microglia (Figure 3F). Overexpression of human TREM2 in a BV2 microglial cell line pretreated with mouse TREM2 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) dramatically increased GSK3β phosphorylation under steady-state conditions, and it further enhanced GSK3β phosphorylation with oAβ treatment, while little change was observed with oAβ treatment in control BV2 cells lacking human TREM2 (Figure S3F). These results indicate that TREM2 is required for downstream signal transduction in response to Aβ stimulation. We next determined the effects of stereotactic Aβ injection in WT and TREM2 KO mouse brain. At 16 hr post-injection, we found a significant decrease in the number of microglia clustering at FAM-Aβ-enriched regions in TREM2 KO compared to WT, as indicated by IBA1 immunostaining (Figures 4A and 4B ), whereas FAM-Aβ deposition was similar between WT and TREM2 KO brain at this time point (Figure 4C). No microglia clustering was observed in control vehicle-injected WT or TREM2 KO mouse brain (Figure S4). These results suggest that TREM2 deletion attenuates microglial migration in response to acute Aβ injection. We next investigated microglial response to extended Aβ exposure in WT and TREM2 KO mice. We observed decreased hippocampal Aβ clearance in TREM2 KO mice 3 days after oAβ injection into the microglia-enriched lacunosum moleculare layer within the hippocampus where fewer neuronal cell bodies are found (Figures 4D and 4E). This is in good agreement with recent findings that TREM2 modulation may regulate Aβ pathology (Yuan et al., 2016Yuan P. Condello C. Keene C.D. Wang Y. Bird T.D. Paul S.M. Luo W. Colonna M. Baddeley D. Grutzendler J.

Upon stereotactic oAβ injection, we observed an increase in microglial proliferation (PCNA positivity) and caspase-3 activation in WT mice (Figures 4F and 4G), indicative of Aβ-induced microgliosis and apoptotic cell death, which may occur concurrently (Askew et al., 2017Askew K. Li K. Olmos-Alonso A. Garcia-Moreno F. Liang Y. Richardson P. Tipton T. Chapman M.A. Riecken K. Beccari S. et al.Coupled proliferation and apoptosis maintain the rapid turnover of microglia in the adult brain.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 391-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TREM2 deletion largely abolished Aβ-induced microglial proliferation (Figure 4F) and apoptosis (Figure 4G). Additionally, microglial process length, previously shown to be associated with microglial activation (Zhong et al., 2017Zhong L. Chen X.F. Wang T. Wang Z. Liao C. Wang Z. Huang R. Wang D. Li X. Wu L. et al.Soluble TREM2 induces inflammatory responses and enhances microglial survival.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214: 597-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), was found to be significantly reduced in Aβ-injected WT brain, but not in TREM2 KO brain (Figure 4H). Together, our results provide evidence that TREM2/Aβ interactions can mediate downstream TREM2/DAP12-signaling pathways, thereby triggering microglial Aβ degradation and microglia depolarization, activation, and consequent cytokine expression/release. TREM2 also drives microglial activation and migration to sites of Aβ enrichment in vivo, indicating that TREM2 is an Aβ sensor that mediates Aβ clearance and Aβ-dependent microglia activation and cytokine release. Although a role for TREM2 in AD pathogenesis has been recently proposed, opposing effects on Aβ plaque deposition are observed with TREM2 deletion in differing AD models (Jay et al., 2015Jay T.R. Miller C.M. Cheng P.J. Graham L.C. Bemiller S. Broihier M.L. Xu G. Margevicius D. Karlo J.C.

Han P.L. An update of animal models of Alzheimer disease with a reevaluation of plaque depositions.Exp. Neurobiol. 2013; 22: 84-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent work in an APP/PS1 AD mouse model indicates that TREM2 deletion can reduce Aβ plaque load at early stages of AD onset yet exacerbates Aβ deposition at late stages of onset (Jay et al., 2017aJay T.R. Hirsch A.M. Broihier M.L. Miller C.M. Neilson L.E. Ransohoff R.M. Lamb B.T. Landreth G.E. Disease progression-dependent effects of TREM2 deficiency in a mouse model of alzheimer’s disease.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As the involvement of TREM2 in Aβ-associated pathogenesis is likely complex, a definitive model of how TREM2 contributes mechanistically to Aβ pathology and AD pathogenesis has yet to be established. Our work provides pioneering evidence that TREM2 directly interacts with Aβ and regulates Aβ degradation, and it demonstrates a novel role for TREM2 as a microglial Aβ receptor capable of transducing various microglial responses to Aβ. Changes in MIP-1α in response to Aβ are particularly interesting: in addition to playing a key role in inflammation, MIP-1α has been shown to promote microglial activation and migration (Wang et al., 2008Wang H.K. Park U.J. Kim S.Y. Lee J.H. Kim S.U. Gwag B.J. Lee Y.B. Free radical production in CA1 neurons induces MIP-1alpha expression, microglia recruitment, and delayed neuronal death after transient forebrain ischemia.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The absence of Aβ-induced MIP-1α induction in TREM2 KO microglia may contribute to reduced microglial clustering at Aβ deposits. Interestingly, TREM2 deficiency has been recently shown to attenuate microglial migration toward injured neurons (Mazaheri et al., 2017Mazaheri F. Snaidero N. Kleinberger G. Madore C. Daria A. Werner G. Krasemann S. Capell A. Trümbach D. Wurst W. et al.TREM2 deficiency impairs chemotaxis and microglial responses to neuronal injury.EMBO Rep. 2017; 18: 1186-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Together, our findings demonstrate that TREM2 plays an important role in mediating microglial migration in response to pathological stimuli. Our observation that AD-associated R47H and R62H mutations compromise interactions between Aβ and TREM2 provides a plausible mechanism for TREM2 and its disease-prone genetic variants in AD pathogenesis. Our findings are in good agreement with recent structural analysis predicting that AD-associated TREM2 mutations might compromise a potential TREM2 ligand-binding interface (Kober et al., 2016Kober D.L. Alexander-Brett J.M. Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Colonna M. Holtzman M.J. Brett T.J.

Our previous work and evidence from other groups have identified ApoE and lipids as TREM2 ligands (Atagi et al., 2015Atagi Y. Liu C.C. Painter M.M. Chen X.F. Verbeeck C. Zheng H. Li X. Rademakers R.

Since ApoE is the most potent genetic risk factor associated with late-onset AD (Kanekiyo et al., 2014Kanekiyo T. Xu H. Bu G.

Neurodegener. 2013; 8: 34Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine the interplay among ApoE, lipids, and Aβ in TREM2 signaling in future studies. Although our results present evidence that Aβ-induced microglial response is in part mediated through TREM2 function, there remains a possibility that Aβ effects may be also derived through parallel pathways or through indirect microglial changes with TREM2 deletion. Although TREM2 is not a component of ion channels, our results indicate that TREM2 deletion itself could induce changes in membrane inward current and membrane potential. Thus, although TREM2/Aβ interactions likely drive some microglia-modulating effects with Aβ exposure, there may also be secondary changes with perturbation resulting from TREM2 deletion that may also modulate Aβ-dependent signaling and microglial function. A detailed analysis of the potential significance of alternative pathways and secondary changes is indeed interesting, and it warrants further investigation. As current strategies targeting Aβ generation and use of Aβ antibody clearance have seen little success, modulation of microglial clearance through receptors such as TREM2 may be a favorable alternative for future pharmacological development.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. AD neuropathology is characterized by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, and reactive Astrogliosis and microgliosis. Such pathology affects brain regions critical for memory and cognition, including the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and basal forebrain. The genetic etiology of AD was revealed by studies of rare early-onset familial AD (fAD) patients as well as sporadic late-onset AD patients (LOAD; Karch et al., 2014Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Goate A.M. Alzheimer’s disease genetics: From the bench to the clinic.Neuron. 2014; 83: 11-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The pathogenic fAD-causing mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 were found to elevate the generation of pathogenic β-amyloid (Aβ) species and amyloid deposition, hence supporting a pivotal role for amyloid in AD pathogenesis (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease: Progress and problems on the road to therapeutics.Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10962) Google Scholar). By far, the most common and potent genetic risk factor for LOAD is the Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4) (Liu et al., 2013Liu C.C. Liu C.C. Kanekiyo T. Xu H. Bu G. Apolipoprotein E and Alzheimer disease: Risk, mechanisms and therapy.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2013; 9: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of LOAD revealed more than 20 AD-associated loci (Karch et al., 2014Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Goate A.M. Alzheimer’s disease genetics: From the bench to the clinic.Neuron. 2014; 83: 11-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), implicating multiple innate immunity genes expressed in microglia and peripheral myeloid cells in AD pathogenesis (Efthymiou and Goate, 2017Efthymiou A.G.

Microglia are resident innate immune cells in the brain derived from myeloid precursors (Graeber, 2010Graeber M.B. Changing face of microglia.Science. 2010; 330: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In the healthy brain, resting microglia have ramified processes that constantly survey the microenvironment (Nimmerjahn et al., 2005Nimmerjahn A. Kirchhoff F. Helmchen F. Resting microglial cells are highly dynamic surveillants of brain parenchyma in vivo.Science. 2005; 308: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (3938) Google Scholar) and contribute to synaptic plasticity and learning (Parkhurst et al., 2013Parkhurst C.N. Yang G. Ninan I. Savas J.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Lafaille J.J. Hempstead B.L. Littman D.R. Gan W.B. Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor.Cell. 2013; 155: 1596-1609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). In response to injury or neurodegenerative disorders, reactive microglia mediate phagocytic uptake and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (Ransohoff, 2016Ransohoff R.M. How neuroinflammation contributes to neurodegeneration.Science. 2016; 353: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that short-term microglia activation may promote tissue repair. However, chronic microglia activation, such as in the case of AD, may elicit neurotoxicity and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Rare variants in the microglia-enriched gene TREM2 confer high risk for LOAD (Guerreiro et al., 2013aGuerreiro R. Wojtas A. Bras J. Carrasquillo M. Rogaeva E. Majounie E. Cruchaga C. Sassi C.

TREM2 signals through its binding partner DAP12 (TYROBP) to elicit responses including phagocytosis, suppression of proinflammatory response, and promoting cell survival (Poliani et al., 2015Poliani P.L. Wang Y. Fontana E. Robinette M.L. Yamanishi Y. Gilfillan S. Colonna M. TREM2 sustains microglial expansion during aging and response to demyelination.J. Clin.

Clearance of apoptotic neurons without inflammation by microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Complete loss of TREM2 or DAP12 leads to Nasu-Hakola disease, a recessive disorder characterized by bone cysts and early dementia (Paloneva et al., 2002Paloneva J. Manninen T. Christman G. Hovanes K. Mandelin J. Adolfsson R. Bianchin M. Bird T. Miranda R.

Genet. 2002; 71: 656-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), highlighting the pivotal role of TREM2 in microglia and related myeloid cells in age-dependent disease processes. Importantly, a subset of the loss-of-function TREM2 variants are found to enhance the risk for a frontotemporal dementia-like syndrome without apparent bone involvement (Guerreiro et al., 2013bGuerreiro R.J. Lohmann E. Brás J.M. Gibbs J.R. Rohrer J.D. Gurunlian N. Dursun B. Bilgic B. Hanagasi H.

Together, human genetics suggests that an in-depth understanding of TREM2 biology in microglia could provide insights into the pathogenesis of AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have begun to unravel the functional roles of TREM2 in molecular, cellular, and animal models that are informative to AD. Substantial effort has been devoted to identify TREM2 ligands. TREM2 has been shown to bind anionic and zwitterionic lipids found on damaged neurons (Wang et al., 2015Wang Y. Cella M. Mallinson K. Ulrich J.D. Young K.L. Robinette M.L. Gilfillan S. Krishnan G.M.

In APP mouse models, Trem2 plays a role in clustering and activating microglia around Aβ plaques (Jay et al., 2015Jay T.R. Miller C.M. Cheng P.J. Graham L.C. Bemiller S. Broihier M.L. Xu G. Margevicius D. Karlo J.C. Sousa G.L. et al.TREM2 deficiency eliminates TREM2+ inflammatory macrophages and ameliorates pathology in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models.J. Exp.

The impact of Trem2 deficiency on amyloid plaque formation is dynamic and complex. At an early disease stage, the plaque load is reduced in an AD model crossed to Trem2 knockout mouse (Jay et al., 2015Jay T.R. Miller C.M. Cheng P.J. Graham L.C. Bemiller S. Broihier M.L. Xu G. Margevicius D. Karlo J.C. Sousa G.L. et al.TREM2 deficiency eliminates TREM2+ inflammatory macrophages and ameliorates pathology in Alzheimer’s disease mouse models.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), while in more advanced disease stages, the plaque load increased in multiple AD models (Jay et al., 2017Jay T.R. Hirsch A.M.

Moreover, Trem2 in plaque-associated microglia plays an important role in plaque compaction and insulation to reduce the neuritic toxicity of fibrillary Aβ (Wang et al., 2016Wang Y. Ulland T.K. Ulrich J.D. Song W. Tzaferis J.A. Hole J.T. Yuan P. Mahan T.E. Shi Y. Gilfillan S. et al.TREM2-mediated early microglial response limits diffusion and toxicity of amyloid plaques.J. Exp.

Thus far, most Trem2 studies in disease models in vivo have used loss-of-function mutants, yet very little is known about the impact of increased Trem2 expression under its genomic regulation on normal brain function and in disease responses. In the current study, we aimed to interrogate TREM2 function in microglia at baseline and in AD disease mice through a gain-of-function genetic approach that mimics gene-dosage increase in the germline, which commonly occurs during evolution (Zarrei et al., 2015Zarrei M. MacDonald J.R. Merico D. Scherer S.W. A copy number variation map of the human genome.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Although in vitro studies suggest that overexpression of TREM2 in microglia promotes DAP12 signaling, phagocytosis of dead neurons, and suppression of pro-inflammatory responses (Takahashi et al., 2005Takahashi K. Rochford C.D.P. Neumann H. Clearance of apoptotic neurons without inflammation by microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), currently there are no in vivo studies to assess the impact of increased TREM2 gene dosage on microglial function and AD pathogenesis. To directly test the effect of upregulating TREM2 in AD mouse models in vivo, we used bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-mediated transgenesis to insert extra copies of the human TREM2 genomic DNA segment into the mouse genome, resulting in elevated TREM2 expression selectively in microglia in the brain. We found that increase in TREM2 gene dosage reprogramed microglia responsivity and ameliorated disease phenotypes in multiple amyloid deposition mouse models of AD. To increase Trem2 gene dosage, we undertook a BAC transgenic approach, which can increase the expression of genes on the BAC under genomic regulation (Yang et al., 1997Yang X.W. Model P. Heintz N. Homologous recombination based modification in Escherichia coli and germline transmission in transgenic mice of a bacterial artificial chromosome.Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 1999Yang X.W. Wynder C. Doughty M.L. Heintz N. BAC-mediated gene-dosage analysis reveals a role for Zipro1 (Ru49/Zfp38) in progenitor cell proliferation in cerebellum and skin.Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We used a human TREM2 BAC for several reasons: first, human TREM2 and murine Trem2 are highly homologous (77% protein homology) and hence should have evolutionarily conserved function. Second, human TREM2 BAC is likely to preserve regulation of the human TREM2 gene expression at baseline and in disease state (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson M.D. Barbosa-Morais N.L. Schmidt D. Conboy C.M. Vanes L. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Fisher E.M.C. Tavaré S. Odom D.T. Species-specific transcription in mice carrying human chromosome 21.Science. 2008; 322: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Finally, the human TREM2 protein may contain residues distinct from murine Trem2 that could be relevant to the future studies of disease variants (Jordan et al., 2015Jordan D.M. Frangakis S.G. Golzio C. Cassa C.A. Kurtzberg J. Davis E.E. Sunyaev S.R. Katsanis N. Katsanis N. Task Force for Neonatal GenomicsIdentification of cis-suppression of human disease mutations by comparative genomics.Nature. 2015; 524: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To generate human TREM2 BAC transgenic mice, we chose a BAC (RP11-237K15) that encompasses the TREM2 coding region as well as surrounding genomic regions (>50 kb on each side) with conserved gene regulatory elements (Gong et al., 2003Gong S. Zheng C. Doughty M.L. Losos K. Didkovsky N. Schambra U.B. Nowak N.J. Joyner A. Leblanc G. Hatten M.E. Heintz N. A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes.Nature. 2003; 425: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Since this BAC contains three other TREM-like genes, TREML1, TREML2, and TREML4, which likely serve critical innate immune functions (Colonna, 2003Colonna M. TREMs in the immune system and beyond.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), their overexpression may confound the interpretation of TREM2 gene-dosage studies in vivo. To ensure the BAC only overexpresses TREM2, we used sequential BAC modification steps to delete key coding exons of these TREM-like genes on the BAC (Figure 1A). The properly engineered BAC was used to generate BAC TREM2 transgenic founders in the FvB/NJ inbred background. Two independent BAC TREM2 founders (A and B) gave germline transmission of their transgenes, and genomic qPCR was used to estimate the transgene copy number to be 1–2 copies (data not shown). We next selected the BAC TREM2 line A (referred to as BAC-TREM2) to confirm the proper expression of human TREM2 RNA and protein. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of cortices from BAC-TREM2 and wild-type (WT) mice was used to identify unique reads of the mouse and human genomes covering murine Trem2 or human TREM2 genes (Figure 1B; see also online track links http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&hgS_otherUserName=yueqin27&hgS_otherUserSessionName=mTrem2_CPM_mm10 and http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgS_doOtherUser=submit&hgS_otherUserName=yueqin27&hgS_otherUserSessionName=hTREM2T2WT_CPM_hg38_ylim15). The human TREM2 transcripts are only found in BAC-TREM2 mouse brains but not in WT brains at all ages tested. Importantly, consistent with our genetic design, we did not observe reads mapping to human TREML1, TREML2, and TREML4 among the BAC-TREM2 transcripts (Figure 1B). BAC-TREM2 mice expressed murine Trem2 transcripts at levels comparable to WT mice (Figure S1). Next, we confirmed the expression of human TREM2 protein in BAC-TREM2 mice by western blot and showed the expression of murine Trem2 protein is also similar between BAC-TREM2 and WT mice (Figure 1C). To verify the cell-type-specific expression of the TREM2 transgene, we first attempted to use available human TREM2 antibodies for immunostaining but did not get robust signals. This might have been due to low baseline of TREM2 expression or to poor antibody specificity, as reported before (Jay et al., 2017Jay T.R. Hirsch A.M. Broihier M.L. Miller C.M. Neilson L.E. Ransohoff R.M. Lamb B.T. Landreth G.E. Disease progression-dependent effects of TREM2 deficiency in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We thus engineered and created a BAC-TREM2-GFP reporter mouse line, which used the same TREM2 BAC as BAC-TREM2 but express TREM2 protein with a C-terminal GFP fusion. Double immunostaining of brain sections from BAC-TREM2-GFP mice demonstrated that the TREM2-GFP transgene was exclusively expressed in the Iba1+ microglia, but not in astrocytes or neurons (Figures 1E–1N). We noted that only a subset of Iba1+ cells were GFP+ (about 5.8% in the cortex and 8.7% in the hippocampus) (Figures 1E–1G and S2A–S2C). This is consistent with the low levels of TREM2 expression in the homeostatic microglia in the healthy brain (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017Keren-Shaul H. Spinrad A. Weiner A. Matcovitch-Natan O. Dvir-Szternfeld R. Ulland T.K. David E. Baruch K. Lara-Astaiso D.

In summary, our novel BAC-TREM2-GFP reporter line demonstrates that the genomic regulatory elements on the human TREM2 BAC confer microglia-specific TREM2 expression in vivo. Microglia are known to have important functions in the brain, such as synaptic pruning in the hippocampus (Stephan et al., 2012Stephan A.H. Barres B.A. Stevens B. The complement system: An unexpected role in synaptic pruning during development and disease.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 369-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). However, we found that BAC-TREM2 mice exhibited normal hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) compared to WT controls at 10 months of age (Figure S2D). Moreover, BAC-TREM2 mice did not exhibit any detectable locomotion deficits (Figure S2E). Together, these results suggested that BAC-mediated increase in TREM2 expression does not elicit overt brain functional deficits in mice. To address whether increased TREM2 gene dosage could alter disease-associated microglial function and other AD-related phenotypes, we bred BAC-TREM2 to 5xFAD mice (carrying 5 familial APP and PSEN1 mutations), which is an aggressive mouse model of amyloid deposition in AD (Oakley et al., 2006Oakley H. Cole S.L. Logan S. Maus E. Shao P. Craft J. Guillozet-Bongaarts A. Ohno M. Disterhoft J.

Staining of amyloid plaques with Thioflavin S (ThioS) on cortical sections from 7-month-old 5xFAD and 5xFAD/BAC-TREM2 (termed 5xFAD/TREM2 or 5xFAD/T2) mice revealed a significant reduction of amyloid plaque load in 5xFAD/TREM2 mice (Figures 2A–2C and S3). We next measured the levels of soluble and insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in cortical lysates using ELISA and found both the soluble and insoluble Aβ42 were significantly decreased in 5xFAD/TREM2 mice at 4 months of age (Figures 2D and 2E). However, the difference in Aβ levels was less pronounced and no longer statistically significant at 7 months of age. We did not detect any significant differences of Aβ40 levels, the minor Aβ species in this AD mouse model, at both ages (Figures 2F and 2G). In order to examine whether the reduction of amyloid load resulted from alteration of APP expression, we examined the human-specific APP transcript reads in our RNA sequencing and found that the transgene was expressed at comparable levels in 5xFAD and 5xFAD/TREM2 cortices (Figure S1C). Thus, the decreased plaque burden is likely due to TREM2-mediated changes in microglia-plaque interactions. Recent studies have reported that Trem2 deficiency may disrupt the microglial barrier function in limiting the diffusion of fibrillary Aβ deposits (Wang et al., 2016Wang Y. Ulland T.K. Ulrich J.D.

To examine whether increased TREM2 expression alters the plaque property, we categorized and quantified distinct forms of plaques in the cortex (Yuan et al., 2016Yuan P. Condello C. Keene C.D.

We found that Aβ plaques in 5xFAD/TREM2 mice significantly shifted in composition toward the more inert form (strong ThioS+ with minor 6E10 staining) and less filamentous form (diffused 6E10+ staining with filamentous or missing ThioS+ labeling) compared to 5xFAD mice (Figures 2H–2J), a pattern that is opposite of that found in the Trem2-deficient mice crossed to 5xFAD (Yuan et al., 2016Yuan P.

Together, our study demonstrates that augmenting TREM2 expression can ameliorate Aβ pathology in 5xFAD mice. To evaluate the impact of increasing TREM2 gene dosage on the molecular pathogenesis in 5xFAD mice, we performed transcriptional profiling of the cortical samples from WT, BAC-TREM2, 5xFAD, and 5xFAD/TREM2 mice at 2, 4, and 7 months of age. We first examined the transcripts specifically mapping to murine Trem2 or human TREM2 (Figures S1A and S1B). We observed a low baseline level of murine Trem2 reads that are significantly increased in 5xFAD and 5xFAD/TREM2 cortices at an advanced (7 months) but not at early (4 months) disease stage. Interestingly, the human TREM2 reads in 5xFAD/TREM2 mice significantly increased compared to those in BAC-TREM2 mice at 4 and 7 months, but not at 2 months. Together, our results suggest the BAC-TREM2 transgene drives early low level overexpression of human TREM2 in 5xFAD mouse brains, and there is a surge in the TREM2 transgene expression as disease progresses, recapitulating the disease-associated upregulation of murine Trem2 in this model. We next performed principal component (PC) analyses including all the RNA-seq samples at the three ages (Figures S4A–S4C). We observed a more defined separation based on 5xFAD genotypes at 4 and 7 months only, but did not detect a clear separation based on BAC-TREM2 genotype. These findings suggest the impact of the transgene on gene expression in WT or 5xFAD background is not robust enough to be detectable with this analysis. We then examined genes with significant differential expression (DE) in the cortex among different genotypes across all three ages (Table S1). As shown in Figure 3A, we found that very few genes were significantly differentially expressed (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.1) between BAC-TREM2 and WT at all ages, suggesting that the BAC-TREM2 transgene does not elicit a detectable molecular effect in the normal mouse brains. In 5xFAD mice, we observed over 1,000 DE genes at 4 and 7 months, but not at 2 months, consistent with the progression of cortical pathology in this aggressive amyloidosis model of AD (Oakley et al., 2006Oakley H. Cole S.L. Logan S. Maus E. Shao P. Craft J. Guillozet-Bongaarts A. Ohno M. Disterhoft J.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10129-10140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 5xFAD/TREM2 mice had only 161 DE genes at 4 months, and 916 genes at 7 months compared to WT, both of which are fewer than those in 5xFAD littermates. Finally, 5xFAD/TREM2 mice had 44 and 54 DE genes when compared to 5xFAD mice at 4 and 7 months of age, respectively. We performed enrichment analyses of DE genes (Table S2) using both public gene sets (e.g., GO and MSigDB) and an internal gene set collection (Langfelder et al., 2016Langfelder P. Cantle J.P.

However, the extent to which functional properties of the EC are altered in the aging brain, even in the absence of clinical symptoms, is not understood. Recent human fMRI studies have identified a functional dissociation within the EC, similar to what is found in rodents. Here, we used high-resolution fMRI to identify a specific hypoactivity in the anterolateral EC (alEC) commensurate with major behavioral deficits on an object pattern separation task in asymptomatic older adults. Only subtle deficits were found in a comparable spatial condition, with no associated differences in posteromedial EC between young and older adults. We additionally linked this condition to dentate/CA3 hyperactivity, and the ratio of activity between the regions was associated with object mnemonic discrimination impairment. These results provide novel evidence of alEC-dentate/CA3 circuit dysfunction in cognitively normal aged humans."

https://openalex.org/W2791777845,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women of the Western world. Doxorubicin (DOX) continues to be used extensively to treat early-stage or node-positive breast cancer, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, and metastatic disease. We have previously demonstrated in a mouse model that sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate isolated from cruciferous vegetables, protects the heart from DOX-induced toxicity and damage. However, the effects of SFN on the chemotherapeutic efficacy of DOX in breast cancer are not known. Present studies were designed to investigate whether SFN alters the effects of DOX on breast cancer regression while also acting as a cardioprotective agent. Studies on rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and multiple rat and human breast cancer cell lines revealed that SFN protects cardiac cells but not cancer cells from DOX toxicity. Results of studies in a rat orthotopic breast cancer model indicated that SFN enhanced the efficacy of DOX in regression of tumor growth, and that the DOX dosage required to treat the tumor could be reduced when SFN was administered concomitantly. Additionally, SFN enhanced mitochondrial respiration in the hearts of DOX-treated rats and reduced cardiac oxidative stress caused by DOX, as evidenced by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, the activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and associated antioxidant enzymes. These studies indicate that SFN not only acts synergistically with DOX in cancer regression, but also protects the heart from DOX toxicity through Nrf2 activation and protection of mitochondrial integrity and functions."

https://openalex.org/W2791448702,"To identify electrical vehicle (EV) distribution paths with high robustness, insensitivity to uncertainty factors, and detailed road-by-road schemes, optimization of the distribution path problem of EV with multiple distribution centers and considering the charging facilities is necessary. With the minimum transport time as the goal, a robust optimization model of EV distribution path with adjustable robustness is established based on Bertsimas' theory of robust discrete optimization. An enhanced three-segment genetic algorithm is also developed to solve the model, such that the optimal distribution scheme initially contains all road-by-road path data using the three-segment mixed coding and decoding method. During genetic manipulation, different interlacing and mutation operations are carried out on different chromosomes, while, during population evolution, the infeasible solution is naturally avoided. A part of the road network of Xifeng District in Qingyang City is taken as an example to test the model and the algorithm in this study, and the concrete transportation paths are utilized in the final distribution scheme. Therefore, more robust EV distribution paths with multiple distribution centers can be obtained using the robust optimization model."
https://openalex.org/W2782826853,"The axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are topographically sorted before they arrive at the optic tectum. This pre-target sorting, typical of axon tracts throughout the brain, is poorly understood. Here, we show that cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting proteins (CYFIPs) fulfill non-redundant functions in RGCs, with CYFIP1 mediating axon growth and CYFIP2 specifically involved in axon sorting. We find that CYFIP2 mediates homotypic and heterotypic contact-triggered fasciculation and repulsion responses between dorsal and ventral axons. CYFIP2 associates with transporting ribonucleoprotein particles in axons and regulates translation. Axon-axon contact stimulates CYFIP2 to move into growth cones where it joins the actin nucleating WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) in the periphery and regulates actin remodeling and filopodial dynamics. CYFIP2’s function in axon sorting is mediated by its binding to the WRC but not its translational regulation. Together, these findings uncover CYFIP2 as a key regulatory link between axon-axon interactions, filopodial dynamics, and optic tract sorting."

Research on the mental health of trafficked children is limited, and little is known about the use of mental health services by this group. This study aimed to investigate the mental health and service use characteristics of trafficked children in contact with mental health services in England.The study employed an historical cohort design. Electronic health records of over 250,000 patients were searched to identify trafficked children, and a matched cohort of non-trafficked children was randomly selected. Data were extracted on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, abuse history, and trafficking experiences of the trafficked children. Logistic and linear random effects regression models were fitted to compare trafficked and non-trafficked children on their clinical profiles and service use characteristics. Fifty-one trafficked children were identified, 78% were female. The most commonly recorded diagnoses for trafficked children were post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (22%) and affective disorders (22%). Records documented a high prevalence of physical violence (53%) and sexual violence (49%) among trafficked children. Trafficked children had significantly longer duration of contact with mental health services compared to non-trafficked controls (b = 1.66, 95% CI 1.09-2.55, p<0.02). No significant differences were found, however, with regards to pathways into care, prevalence of compulsory psychiatric admission, length of inpatient stays, or changes in global functioning.Child trafficking is associated with high levels of physical and sexual abuse and longer duration of contact with mental health services. Research is needed on most effective interventions to promote recovery for this vulnerable group."

PG05 enhanced the Th2 response, the recovery of B cells, and the concentration and opsonophagocytic activity of anti-pneumococcal antibodies. In addition, by performing comparative studies with the peptidoglycans from lactobacilli of the same species (L. rhamnosus CRL534) or with similar immunomodulatory properties (L. plantarum CRL1506), we demonstrated here that PG05 has unique immunomodulatory properties that cannot be extended to peptidoglycans from other probiotic strains.

https://openalex.org/W2793206566,"Dentists must be skilled when using dental mirrors. Working with mirrors requires spatial perception, bimanual coordination, perceptual learning and fine motor skills. Many studies have attempted to determine the predictors of manual skills among pre-clinical students, but consensus has yet to be reached. We hypothesized that valid and reliable occupational therapy test performance regarding indirect vision would differ between dental students and junior dentists and would explain the variance in manual skill performance in pre-clinical courses. To test this hypothesis, we applied the Purdue Pegboard test and O'Connor Tweezer Dexterity test under different conditions of direct and indirect vision. We administered these tests to students in phantom-head academic courses in 2015 and 2016 and to junior dentists. Students performed the tests at three time points: before phantom training (T0), at the end of the training (T1) and in the middle of the following year of study (T2). Dentists performed the same tests twice at 1st and 2nd trials one week apart. The results showed that indirect tasks were significantly more difficult to perform for both groups. These dexterity tests were sensitive enough to detect students' improvement after phantom training. The dentists' performances were significantly better than those of students at T0, specifically with regard to the use of tweezers under direct and indirect vision (the O'Connor test). A regression analysis showed that students' manual grades obtained at the beginning of the phantom course, their performance on the Purdue test using both hands, and their performance on the O'Connor test under indirect vision predicted phantom course success in 80% of cases. The O'Connor test under indirect vision is the most informative means of monitoring and predicting the manual skills required in the pre-clinical year of dentistry studies."

The identification of S-sulfhydrated proteins by proteomic approach could be a major step towards understanding the mechanisms of H2S in response to atherosclerosis. The present study studied targeted S-sulfhydrated proteins using the modified biotin switch method followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight tandem mass spectrometry identification. The results showed that H2S can protect against atherosclerosis by reducing body weight gain and alleviating aortic plaque formation. In addition, H2S treatment can increase aortic protein S-sulfhydration. Seventy targeted S-sulfhydrated aortic proteins were identified, mainly involved in metabolism, stimulus response and biological regulation, as determined by gene ontology database analysis. H2S also induced S-sulfhydration of glutathione peroxidase 1 and further reduced lipid peroxidation and increased antioxidant defence in the aorta by prompting glutathione synthesis. Our data suggest that H2S is a cardiovascular-protective molecule that S-sulfhydrates a subset of proteins that are mainly responsible for lipid metabolism and exerts its cytoprotective effects to clear free radicals and inhibit oxidative stress through cysteine S-sulfhydration."

Two selected mAbs, 7B8 and 8G4, could bind with the initial pentasaccharide with affinity constants of approximately 5.3 nM and 6.4 nM, respectively, based on surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor assay. The glycoarray, built from a series of synthetic oligosaccharide derivatives representing different galactomannan fragments, demonstrated that mAb 8G4 could effectively recognize the parental pentasaccharide while mAb 7B8 recognizes its constituting trisaccharide parts. Immunofluorescence studies showed that both 7B8 and 8G4 could stain A. fumigatus cells in culture efficiently, but not the mutant strain lacking galactomannan. In addition, confocal microscopy demonstrated that Candida albicans, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and numerous gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were not labeled by mAbs 7B8 and 8G4. The generated mAbs can be considered promising for the development of a new specific enzyme-linked assay for detection of A. fumigatus, which is highly demanded for medical and environmental controls."

This study was performed to elucidate the presence of miRNAs with exosomes in human gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), and the expression profile of miRNA-29 during orthodontic tooth movement. Four healthy volunteer and fifteen orthodontic patients were enrolled in the study. Secretory miRNA in GCF was collected and analyzed using a bioanalyzer, realtime PCR and Western blot analysis. The expression profile of secretory miR-29 family in GCF was analyzed during the course of canine retraction for 6 weeks. The results demonstrated the presence of miRNAs in the GCF. After series of ultracentrifugation and RT-PCR array, exosome-depleted fractions and pellets were isolated and we found that secretory miRNAs were detected in both the exosome-associated fraction and the exosome-depleted supernatant fraction; however, the concentration of miRNAs was higher in the exosome-associated fraction than in the exosome-depleted fraction suggesting a close association between the secretory miRNAs and exosomes in GCF. We also demonstrated the increased expression profiles of miR-29 family during six weeks of orthodontic tooth movement in humans. Secretory miRNAs are present in GCF and secretory miRNA-29 family expression profiles increase during the tooth movement in humans.

https://openalex.org/W2790052575,"Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) has been associated with cancer cell growth and invasion, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. NAT1 is located on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p21), a region that is commonly deleted in colon cancer. Previously, it was reported that HT-29 colon cancer cells, which have a large deletion at 8p21-22, show marked morphological changes, increased E-cadherin expression and altered cell-cell contact inhibition following down-regulation of NAT1 with shRNA. By contrast, no effects on growth were observed in HeLa cells. In the present study, cellular changes following knockout of NAT1 with CRISPR/Cas9 in HT-29 and HeLa cells were compared in the presence and absence of glucose. Cell growth decreased in both cell-lines during glucose starvation, but it was enhanced in HT-29 cells following NAT1 deletion. This was due to an increase in ROS production that induced cell apoptosis. Both ROS production and cell death were prevented by the glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine. NAT1 knockout also resulted in a loss of the gain-of-function p53 protein in HT-29 cells. When p53 expression was inhibited with siRNA in parental HT-29 cells, ROS production and apoptosis increased to levels seen in the NAT1 knockout cells. The loss of p53 may explain the decreased colony formation and increased contact inhibition previously reported following NAT1 down-regulation in these cells. In conclusion, NAT1 is important in maintaining intracellular ROS, especially during glucose starvation, by stabilizing gain-of-function p53 in HT-29 cells. These results suggest that NAT1 may be a novel target to decrease intracellular gain-of -function p53."
https://openalex.org/W2789474678,"Sphingosine Kinase-2 (Sphk2) is responsible for the production of the bioactive lipid Sphingosine-1 Phosphate, a key regulator of tissue repair. Here we address the in vivo significance of Sphingosine Kinase -2 in renal inflammation/fibrosis in response to unilateral ureteral obstruction using both genetic and pharmacological strategies. Obstructed kidneys of Sphk2-/- mice showed reduced renal damage and diminished levels of the renal injury markers TGFβ1 and αSMA when compared to wild type controls. We found a consistently significant increase in anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages in obstructed Sphk2-/- kidneys by flow cytometry and a decrease in mRNA levels of the inflammatory cytokines, MCP1, TNFα, CXCL1 and ILβ1, suggesting an anti-inflammatory bias in the absence of Sphk2. Indeed, metabolic profiling showed that the pro-inflammatory glycolytic pathway is largely inactive in Sphk2-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with the M2-promoting cytokines IL-4 or IL-13 demonstrated that macrophages lacking Sphk2 polarized more efficiently to the M2 phenotype than wild type cells. Bone marrow transplant studies indicated that expression of Sphk2-/- on either the hematopoietic or parenchymal cells did not fully rescue the pro-healing phenotype, confirming that both infiltrating M2-macrophages and the kidney microenvironment contribute to the damaging Sphk2 effects. Importantly, obstructed kidneys from mice treated with an Sphk2 inhibitor recapitulated findings in the genetic model. These results demonstrate that reducing Sphk2 activity by genetic or pharmacological manipulation markedly decreases inflammatory and fibrotic responses to obstruction, resulting in diminished renal injury and supporting Sphk2 as a novel driver of the pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype."

An International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) mapping population comprising 105 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) developed from a cross between a Synthetic hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) ‘W7984’ and a spring wheat variety ‘Opata M85’ was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with grain number per spike under two treatment conditions, normal watering and water stress during meiosis. Two major QTL for grain number per spike on the main stem Q.Gnu.uwa-5A-1 and Q.Gnu.uwa-5A-2 with phenotypic variations of 25.71% and 24.93%, respectively, were detected on the long arm of chromosome 5A when plants were exposed to water stress during meiosis. One QTL (Q.Gnu.uwa-2A) with a LOD score of 2.8 was detected on the long arm of chromosome 2A under normal watering condition. The alleles associated with higher grain number per spike under different treatment conditions came from the Synthetic W7984 parent. Two populations developed from crosses Synthetic W7984 × Lang and Synthetic W7984 × Westonia were used to validate the identified QTL under water stress during meiosis. SSR markers Xbarc230 and Xbarc319 linked with the identified QTL on chromosome 5AL were validated in the two F2:4 segregating populations. These closely linked SSR markers could potentially be utilized in marker-assisted selection to reduce yield loss in regions where water stress during meiosis occurs frequently. The identified QTL can be incorporated into elite lines / cultivars to improve wheat grain yield."
https://openalex.org/W2789993787,"Brain pericytes are important to maintain vascular integrity of the neurovascular unit under both physiological and ischemic conditions. Ischemic stroke is known to induce an inflammatory and hypoxic response due to the lack of oxygen and glucose in the brain tissue. How this early response to ischemia is molecularly regulated in pericytes is largely unknown and may be of importance for future therapeutic targets. Here we evaluate the transcriptional responses in in vitro cultured human brain pericytes after oxygen and/or glucose deprivation. Hypoxia has been widely known to stabilise the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) and mediate the induction of hypoxic transcriptional programs after ischemia. However, we find that the transcription factors Jun Proto-Oncogene (c-JUN), Nuclear Factor Of Kappa Light Polypeptide Gene Enhancer In B-Cells (NFκB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) bind genes regulated after 2hours (hs) of omitted glucose and oxygen before HIF1α. Potent HIF1α responses require 6hs of hypoxia to substantiate transcriptional regulation comparable to either c-JUN or STAT3. Phosphorylated STAT3 protein is at its highest after 5 min of oxygen and glucose (OGD) deprivation, whereas maximum HIF1α stabilisation requires 120 min. We show that STAT3 regulates angiogenic and metabolic pathways before HIF1α, suggesting that HIF1α is not the initiating trans-acting factor in the response of pericytes to ischemia."

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of age, anthropometric and biochemical variables on LDI and CCM.80 healthy volunteers (43 males) (age: 39.7±15.2 yrs.) underwent LDIFLARE and CCM assessment and the effect of age, anthropometric and biochemical variables was determined using multivariate analysis.There was an age-related decline in LDIFLARE (0.07cm2/yr; R2 = 0.669; p = <0.0001) and CCM parameters (CNFD: 0.05 fibres/mm2 /yr; R2 = 0.590; p = <0.0001, CNBD: 0.06 branches/mm2/yr; R2 = 0.549; p = 0.001and CNFL 0.07 mm/mm2/yr; R2 = 0.369; p = 0.009). BMI did not influence SFF (p = 0.08) but had a significant independent association with CNFD (p = 0.01). Fasting triglycerides (TG) independently influenced the LDIFLARE (βc:-0.204; p = 0.008) and all CCM indices (βc:-0.191 to -0.243; p = <0.05). HbA1c was significantly associated with CNFD only (p = 0.001) but not with LDIFLARE, CNBD or CNFL (p = ≥0.05). Blood pressure and total cholesterol were not associated with LDIFLARE or any CCM parameters. There was a significant correlation between LDIFLARE and all CCM parameters (p = ≤0.01).This study shows that in healthy controls, both SFF measured by LDIFLARE and SFS assessed by CCM showed a significant inverse correlation with age and triglycerides, perhaps suggesting the use of age-specific normative values when interpreting these outcomes. Furthermore, this study shows that in healthy controls, despite measuring different neural parameters, both methods correlated significantly with each other."
https://openalex.org/W2791366385,"The effect of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)-previously known as hormone replacement therapy-on cardiovascular health remains unclear and controversial. This cross-sectional study examined the impact of MHT on left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) structure and function, alterations in which are markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease, in a population-based cohort.Post-menopausal women who had never used MHT and those who had used MHT ≥3 years participating in the UK Biobank who had undergone cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and free of known cardiovascular disease were included. Multivariable linear regression was performed to examine the relationship between cardiac parameters and MHT use ≥3 years. To explore whether MHT use on each of the cardiac outcomes differed by age, multivariable regression models were constructed with a cross-product of age and MHT fitted as an interaction term.Of 1604 post-menopausal women, 513 (32%) had used MHT ≥3 years. In the MHT cohort, median age at menopause was 50 (IQR: 45-52) and median duration of MHT was 8 years. In the non-MHT cohort, median age at menopause was 51 (IQR: 48-53). MHT use was associated with significantly lower LV end-diastolic volume (122.8 ml vs 119.8 ml, effect size = -2.4%, 95% CI: -4.2% to -0.5%; p = 0.013) and LA maximal volume (60.2 ml vs 57.5 ml, effect size = -4.5%, 95% CI: -7.8% to -1.0%; p = 0.012). There was no significant difference in LV mass. MHT use significantly modified the effect between age and CMR parameters; MHT users had greater decrements in LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume and LA maximal volume with advancing age.MHT use was not associated with adverse, subclinical changes in cardiac structure and function. Indeed, significantly smaller LV and LA chamber volumes were observed which have been linked to favourable cardiovascular outcomes. These findings represent a novel approach to examining MHT's effect on the cardiovascular system."

For different parameters values that influence the solution, the problem is numerically solved by the network method, which provides all the variables of the problems. Although the model is extremely sensitive to the above parameters, no assumptions are considered as regards the linearization of the variables. The design of the models, which are run on standard electrical circuit simulation software, is explained in detail. The network model results are compared with common numerical methods or experimental data, published in the scientific literature, to show the reliability of the model."
https://openalex.org/W2789622233,"A considerable body of research has documented the negative effects of job burnout on employees and their organizations, emphasizing the importance of the identification of early signs of the phenomenon for the purposes of prevention and intervention. However, such timely identification is difficult due to the time and cost of assessing the burnout levels of all employees in an organization using established scales. In this paper, we propose an innovative way to identify employees at risk of job burnout by analyzing their e-mail communication patterns. Building on the Job Demands–Resources model, we theorize about the relationship between e-mail communication patterns and levels of employee exhaustion and disengagement (two dimensions of burnout). We analyzed 52,190 e-mails exchanged between 57 employees of a medium sized R&D company over a five-month period. We then related these employees’ communication patterns to their levels of burnout, collected using an established scale (the OLBI–Oldenburg Burnout Inventory). Our results provide support for the overall proposition of the paper, that e-mail communications can be used to identify individuals at risk of job burnout. Our models explain up to 34% of the variance of burnout and up to 37% and 19% respectively of the variance of exhaustion and disengagement. They also successfully distinguish between employees with a higher risk of burnout and those with lower levels of risk (F1 score of 84% with recall of 100% and 73% precision). We discuss the implications of our results and present suggestions for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2790132514,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been associated with silent brain lesions; however, there are no data on the relationship between MetS and the incidence of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal association between MetS and incidence of CMBs in the Japanese population. We performed a prospective cohort study involving 684 Japanese participants (mean age, 61.7 years) with a mean 6.5 ± 3.4 years follow-up. All participants underwent 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging, and CMBs were classified by their locations. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship of MetS and its components with the incidence of CMBs. MetS was observed in 7.5% of the study population. Forty-nine (7.2%) subjects (36 had new deep or infratentorial CMBs, 13 had new strictly lobar CMBs) developed new CMBs during the follow-up period. In multivariable analysis, MetS was significantly associated with the incidence of deep or infratentorial CMBs (odds ratio, 4.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.72–9.41), and the elevated blood pressure component was most robustly associated with the incidence of deep or infratentorial CMBs (odds ratio, 5.16; 95% confidence interval, 2.02–13.2). Increased body mass index was also associated with incidence of deep or infratentorial CMBs (odds ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–5.67). The present study showed that MetS predicts incidence of CMBs in the deep brain regions and high blood pressure is the most important among the MetS components."
https://openalex.org/W2791412372,"Protein arginine methyl transferase 5 (PRMT5) is a signaling protein and histone modifying enzyme that is important in many cellular processes, including regulation of eukaryotic gene transcription. Reported here is a 3.7 Å structure of PRMT5, solved in complex with regulatory binding subunit MEP50 (methylosome associated protein 50, WDR77, p44), by single particle (SP) cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) using micrographs of particles that are visibly crowded and aggregated. Despite suboptimal micrograph appearance, this cryo-EM structure is in good agreement with previously reported crystal structures of the complex, which revealed a 450 kDa hetero-octameric assembly having internal D2 symmetry. The catalytic PRMT5 subunits form a core tetramer and the MEP50 subunits are arranged peripherally in complex with the PRMT5 N-terminal domain. The cryo-EM reconstruction shows good side chain definition and shows a well-resolved peak for a bound dehydrosinefungin inhibitor molecule. These results demonstrate the applicability of cryo-EM in determining structures of human protein complexes of biomedical significance and suggests cryo-EM could be further utilized to understand PRMT5 interactions with other biologically important binding proteins and ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2793959369,"Genistein (GEN) is a type of isoflavone mainly derived from soy products. In this experiment, we added 40 and 400 mg/kg GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens to clarify the maternal effects of GEN on the development and metabolism of chick embryos. GEN treatment at 40 mg/kg increased embryonic length, weight, and liver index, as well as the width of the proliferative zone in the tibial growth plate of chick embryos. Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis of the hepatic transcriptome showed that GEN treatment promoted embryonic development and cell proliferation. Low-dose GEN treatment increased insulin growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)3 mRNA expression in the embryonic liver, whereas high-dose GEN treatment increased IGFBP5 expression and activated the apoptosis and protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Furthermore, adding supplemental GEN to the diet of hens promoted the glycolysis process in the embryonic liver through the insulin-signaling pathway, upregulated target genes (phosphoglucomutase-2, hexokinase 1, dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldolase, phosphofructokinase, platelet, and enolase 2), and enhanced the transport of carboxylic acids and cholesterol and the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acid (arachidonic acid) in the embryonic liver through upregulation of liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and patatin-like phospholipase A. Additionally, GEN treatment increased fatty acid β-oxidation and Na+/K+-ATPase activity in the embryonic liver through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs; PPARα and PPARδ) and the AMPK signaling pathway, which could provide energy for embryonic development. In addition, GEN treatment in hens increased superoxide dismutase activity and metallothionein expression in the chick embryonic liver and promoted lymphocyte proliferation through upregulation of mRNA expression of CDKN1A, IL12RB1, Sox11, PRKAR1A, PRKCQ, and TCF3. The improved immunity and antioxidant capacity, as a result of maternal GEN effects, was conducive to embryonic development. In summary, the addition of GEN to the diet of laying broiler breeder hens significantly promoted the development and metabolism of chick embryos.-Lv, Z., Fan, H., Zhang, B., Ning, C., Xing, K., Guo, Y. Dietary genistein supplementation in laying broiler breeder hens alters the development and metabolism of offspring embryos as revealed by hepatic transcriptome analysis."

To this end, rich data on 1,179 games played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League are analysed. In contrast to the myth, we find that, conditional on the goal difference and other game characteristics at half time, the final goal difference at the advantage of the home team is 0.520 goals lower in case of a goal just before half time by this team. We show that this finding relates to this team's lower probability of scoring a goal during the second half."
https://openalex.org/W2791047011,"Airway sensory nerves are known to express several receptors and channels that are activated by exogenous and endogenous mediators that cause coughing. Toll-like receptor (TLR) s are expressed in nociceptive neurons and play an important role in neuroinflammation. However, there have been very few studies of TLR expression in lung-derived sensory neurons or their relevance to respiratory symptoms such as cough. We used the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model to investigate the change in TLR expression in pulmonary neurons and the association of TLRs with transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in pulmonary neurons. After 2 weeks of bleomycin or saline administration, pulmonary fibrosis changes were confirmed using tissue staining and the SIRCOL collagen assay. TLRs (TLR 1–9) and TRP channel expression was analyzed using single cell reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in isolated sensory neurons from the nodose/jugular ganglion and the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Pulmonary sensory neurons expressed TLR2 and TLR5. In the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model, TLR2 expression was detected in 29.5% (18/61) and 26.9% (21/78) of pulmonary nodose/jugular neurons and DRG neurons, respectively. TLR5 was also detected in 55.7% (34/61) and 42.3% (33/78) of pulmonary nodose/jugular neurons and DRG neurons, respectively, in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model. TLR5 was expressed in 63.4% of TRPV1 positive cells and 43.4% of TRPM8 positive cells. In conclusion, TLR2 and TLR5 expression is enhanced, especially in vagal neurons, in the bleomycin-induced fibrosis model group when compared to the saline treated control group. Co-expression of TLR5 and TRP channels in pulmonary sensory neurons was also observed. This work sheds new light on the role of TLRs in the control and manifestation of clinical symptoms, such as cough. To understand the role of TLRs in pulmonary sensory nerves, further study will be required."
https://openalex.org/W2791085293,"The activity of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), a key enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis, is regulated by reversible interactions of a lipid-inducible amphipathic helix (domain M) with membrane phospholipids. When dissociated from membranes, a portion of the M domain functions as an auto-inhibitory (AI) element to suppress catalysis. The AI helix from each subunit binds to a pair of α helices (αE) that extend from the base of the catalytic dimer to create a four-helix bundle. The bound AI helices make intimate contact with loop L2, housing a key catalytic residue, Lys122. The impacts of the AI helix on active-site dynamics and positioning of Lys122 are unknown. Extensive MD simulations with and without the AI helix revealed that backbone carbonyl oxygens at the point of contact between the AI helix and loop L2 can entrap the Lys122 side chain, effectively competing with the substrate, CTP. In silico, removal of the AI helices dramatically increased αE dynamics at a predicted break in the middle of these helices, enabling them to splay apart and forge new contacts with loop L2. In vitro cross-linking confirmed the reorganization of the αE element upon membrane binding of the AI helix. Moreover, when αE bending was prevented by disulfide engineering, CCT activation by membrane binding was thwarted. These findings suggest a novel two-part auto-inhibitory mechanism for CCT involving capture of Lys122 and restraint of the pliable αE helices. We propose that membrane binding enables bending of the αE helices, bringing the active site closer to the membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W2792578395,"The Hippo pathway controls cell proliferation and differentiation through the precisely tuned activity of a core kinase cassette. The activity of Hippo kinase is modulated by interactions between its C-terminal coiled-coil, termed the SARAH domain, and the SARAH domains of either dRassF or Salvador. Here, we wanted to understand the molecular basis of SARAH domain–mediated interactions and their influence on Hippo kinase activity. We focused on Salvador, a positive effector of Hippo activity and the least well-characterized SARAH domain–containing protein. We determined the crystal structure of a complex between Salvador and Hippo SARAH domains from Drosophila. This structure provided insight into the organization of the Salvador SARAH domain including a folded N-terminal extension that expands the binding interface with Hippo SARAH domain. We also found that this extension improves the solubility of the Salvador SARAH domain, enhances binding to Hippo, and is unique to Salvador. We therefore suggest expanding the definition of the Salvador SARAH domain to include this extended region. The heterodimeric assembly observed in the crystal was confirmed by cross-linked MS and provided a structural basis for the mutually exclusive interactions of Hippo with either dRassF or Salvador. Of note, Salvador influenced the kinase activity of Mst2, the mammalian Hippo homolog. In co-transfected HEK293T cells, human Salvador increased the levels of Mst2 autophosphorylation and Mst2-mediated phosphorylation of select substrates, whereas Salvador SARAH domain inhibited Mst2 autophosphorylation in vitro.

This study investigated the diagnostic performance of immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect Salmonella antigens, when applied to stored grown blood culture broth. Material/Methods The SD Bioline One Step Salmonella Typhi Ag Rapid Detection Kit (Standard Diagnostics, Republic of Korea), marketed for the detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi) in stool and the Salmonella Ag Rapid Test (Creative Diagnostics, USA), marketed for the detection of all Salmonella serotypes in stool, were selected for evaluation based on a pre-test evaluation of six RDT products. The limits of detection (LOD) for culture suspensions were established and the selected RDT products were assessed on 19 freshly grown spiked blood culture broth samples and 413 stored clinical blood culture broth samples, collected in Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Results The LOD of both products was established as 107−108 CFU/ml. When applied to clinical blood culture broth samples, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the SD Bioline RDT were respectively 100% and 79.7% for the detection of Salmonella Typhi; 94.4% (65/69) of false-positive results were caused by Salmonella Enteritidis. When considering the combined detection of Salmonella Typhi and Enteritidis (both group D Salmonella), sensitivity and specificity were 97.9% and 98.5% respectively. For Creative Diagnostics, diagnostic sensitivity was 78.3% and specificity 91.0% for all Salmonella serotypes combined; 88.3% (53/60) of false negative results were caused by Salmonella Paratyphi A. Conclusions When applied to grown blood culture broths, the SD Bioline RDT had a good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Enteritidis. The Creative Diagnostics product had a moderate sensitivity and acceptable specificity for the detection of all Salmonella serovars combined and needs further optimization. A RDT that reliably detects Salmonella Paratyphi A is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2793901015,"Factor analysis is broadly used as a powerful unsupervised machine learning tool for reconstruction of hidden features in recorded mixtures of signals. In the case of a linear approximation, the mixtures can be decomposed by a variety of model-free Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms. Most of the available BSS algorithms consider an instantaneous mixing of signals, while the case when the mixtures are linear combinations of signals with delays is less explored. Especially difficult is the case when the number of sources of the signals with delays is unknown and has to be determined from the data as well. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a new method based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) that is capable of identifying: (a) the unknown number of the sources, (b) the delays and speed of propagation of the signals, and (c) the locations of the sources. Our method can be used to decompose records of mixtures of signals with delays emitted by an unknown number of sources in a nondispersive medium, based only on recorded data. This is the case, for example, when electromagnetic signals from multiple antennas are received asynchronously; or mixtures of acoustic or seismic signals recorded by sensors located at different positions; or when a shift in frequency is induced by the Doppler effect. By applying our method to synthetic datasets, we demonstrate its ability to identify the unknown number of sources as well as the waveforms, the delays, and the strengths of the signals. Using Bayesian analysis, we also evaluate estimation uncertainties and identify the region of likelihood where the positions of the sources can be found."
https://openalex.org/W2791096285,"Increased consumption of Western-type diets and environmental insults lead to wide-spread increases in the plasma levels of saturated fatty acids and lipoprotein oxidation. The aim of this study is to examine whether palmitate and minimally modified low-density lipoprotein (mmLDL) exert an additive effect on macrophage activation. We found that CXCL2 and TNF-α secretion as well as ERK and p38 phosphorylation were additively increased by co-treatment of J774 macrophages with palmitate and mmLDL in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, the analysis of differentially expressed genes using the KEGG database revealed that several pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and genes were significantly altered. These results were validated with real-time PCR, showing upregulation of Il-6, Csf3, Il-1β, and Clec4d. The present study demonstrated that palmitate and mmLDL additively potentiate the LPS-induced activation of macrophages. These results suggest the existence of synergistic mechanisms by which saturated fatty acids and oxidized lipoproteins activate immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W2791147657,"Some gene transcripts have cellular functions as regulatory noncoding RNAs. For example, ∼23-nucleotide (nt)–long siRNAs are loaded into Argonaute proteins. The resultant ribonucleoprotein assembly, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), cleaves RNAs that are extensively base-paired with the loaded siRNA. To date, base complementarity is recognized as the major determinant of specific target cleavage (or slicing), but little is known about how Argonaute inspects base pairing before cleavage. A hallmark of Argonaute proteins is their bilobal structure, but despite the significance of this structure for curtailing slicing activity against mismatched targets, the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, our structural and functional studies of a bilobed yeast Argonaute protein and its isolated catalytic C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) revealed that the C-lobe alone retains almost all properties of bilobed Argonaute: siRNA-duplex loading, passenger cleavage/ejection, and siRNA-dependent RNA cleavage. A 2.1 Å–resolution crystal structure revealed that the catalytic C-lobe mirrors the bilobed Argonaute in terms of guide-RNA recognition and that all requirements for transitioning to the catalytically active conformation reside in the C-lobe. Nevertheless, we found that in the absence of the N-terminal lobe (N-lobe), target RNAs are scanned for complementarity only at positions 5–14 on a 23-nt guide RNA before endonucleolytic cleavage, thereby allowing for some off-target cleavage. Of note, acquisition of an N-lobe expanded the range of the guide RNA strand used for inspecting target complementarity to positions 2–23.

The first type, including tRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and riboswitches, folds into unique tertiary structures that are stabilized by employing hydrogen bonds through their 2′-hydroxyl groups. They build characteristic shapes complementary to their cognate substrates, which bolsters their extremely high specificity. Another type of ncRNA, exemplified by CRISPR-targeting RNAs (crRNAs), siRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), uses a linear single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) region to hybridize with target sequences (2Hirose T. Mishima Y. Tomari Y. Elements and machinery of non-coding RNAs: toward their taxonomy.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15 (24731943): 489-50710.1002/embr.201338390Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This type achieves high substrate specificity for DNA and RNA targets by forming ∼23 nucleotides (nt) of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes (or in some cases even longer than 30 base pairs) and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), respectively. However, there is a trade-off between the length of ssRNAs and their specificity. Although their thermal stability may increase with guiding sequence length, their chance of binding to similar sequences also increases due to the possibility of multiple nucleation events occurring independently at different positions (3Herschlag D.

These small RNAs serve as guides to take the RISCs to the target mRNAs. Canonical Argonaute proteins seen in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic clades adopt bilobal structures. The N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) includes the N and PAZ domains. The N domain serves as a wedge to pry apart the loaded duplex during passenger ejection (11Kwak P.B. Tomari Y. The N domain of Argonaute drives duplex unwinding during RISC assembly.Nat. Struct. Mol.

The C-terminal lobe (C-lobe) comprises the MID and PIWI domains. The Rossmann-like MID domain is responsible for recognition of the 5′ end of the guide (30Ma J.B. Yuan Y.R. Meister G. Pei Y.

The PIWI domain adopts an RNase H fold and houses the conserved four residues tasked with endonucleolytically cleaving the targets (13Nowotny M.

RNase H functions as a stand-alone nuclease that directly recognizes preformed RNA-DNA heteroduplexes and slices the RNA strands (16Nakamura H. Oda Y. Iwai S. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. How does RNase H recognize a DNA.RNA hybrid?.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Unlike Argonaute, this enzyme does not make use of any auxiliary domains to scrutinize its substrate and facilitate target specificity, which results in nonspecific cleavage of RNAs (17Crooke S.T. Lemonidis K.M. Neilson L. Griffey R. Lesnik E.A. Monia B.P. Kinetic characteristics of Escherichia coli RNase H1: cleavage of various antisense oligonucleotide-RNA duplexes.Biochem. J. 1995; 312 (8526876): 599-60810.1042/bj3120599Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Given that RNase H is one of the oldest protein folds (18Majorek K.A. Dunin-Horkawicz S. Steczkiewicz K. Muszewska A. Nowotny M. Ginalski K. Bujnicki J.M. The RNase H-like superfamily: new members, comparative structural analysis and evolutionary classification.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24464998): 4160-417910.1093/nar/gkt1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is plausible that Argonaute proteins have evolved in an RNase H–centered manner by acquiring each of the above mentioned functional domains. These two lobes are connected through the L2 linker, shaping an intervening nucleic acid-binding channel that accommodates both guide and target strands. Previous structures of RISC revealed that the loaded guide RNA is exposed at positions 2–6 (g2–g6) to the solvent, whereas the remainder of the guide is sequestered within the channel (8Nakanishi K.

These structural observations proposed a model that the exposed g2–g6 is used to scan target mRNAs. This idea was supported by a single-molecule approach showing the unidirectional propagation of the guide-target duplex from its 5′ side of the guide strand toward its 3′ end (24Yao C. Sasaki H.M. Ueda T. Tomari Y. Tadakuma H. Single-molecule analysis of the target cleavage reaction by the Drosophila RNAi enzyme complex.Mol.

It is well-known that catalytically active Argonaute proteins can modulate their slicing activity against mismatched targets (8Nakanishi K. Weinberg D.E. Bartel D.P. Patel D.J.

Zinchenko M.K. Djuranovic S. Green R. Regulation of Argonaute slicer activity by guide RNA 3′ end interactions with the N-terminal lobe.J. Biol.

Meanwhile, a recent phylogenetic study reported that an N-lobe is naturally missing in some prokaryotic Argonaute proteins, such as Archaeoglobus fulgidus Argonaute (AfPIWI) (27Swarts D.C. Makarova K. Wang Y. Nakanishi K. Ketting R.F. Koonin E.V. Patel D.J. van der Oost J. The evolutionary journey of Argonaute proteins.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 (25192263): 743-75310.1038/nsmb.2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all such unilobed Argonaute proteins are catalytically inactive. These results collectively imply that the bilobal structure is critical for Argonaute proteins to inspect the bound target for complementarity with the guide before cleavage. Despite its significance, the molecular basis for the mismatch sensor of bilobed Argonaute proteins remains unknown. Molecular dissection of a bilobed Argonaute and its C-lobe is essential toward understanding the mechanism of mismatch sensing. However, the loaded guide sews all Argonaute domains and stabilizes the entire ribonucleoprotein complex. Due to such an inseparable relationship between Argonaute and guide, it was difficult to design a stable, catalytically active C-lobe, which has hampered research exploring the mechanisms by which Argonaute proteins optimize the use of linear ncRNAs for target recognition. In this study, we set out to reveal how the N-lobe enhances the activity of AGO proteins with respect to target specificity. More specifically, we wanted to understand why the absence of the N-lobe allows AGO to slice off-targets and to raise appreciation for the cooperativity between AGO's two lobes for target slicing beyond simple guide-target complementarity. To this end, we successfully designed a competent C-lobe of a yeast Argonaute and investigated its functional capabilities by comparing with its bilobal parent construct. Our structural and functional studies revealed that the bilobal structure is indispensable for catalytically active Argonaute proteins. Compared with their prokaryotic counterparts, eukaryotic Argonaute proteins expanded their molecular weight with insertion of specific segments. A previous study revealed an N-terminal fragment that is conserved throughout eukaryotic Argonaute proteins and thus named it conserved segment 1 (cS1) (Fig. 1A) (8Nakanishi K. Weinberg D.E. Bartel D.P. Patel D.J. Structure of yeast Argonaute with guide RNA.Nature. 2012; 486 (22722195): 368-37410.1038/nature11211Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We aligned the corresponding fragment from Argonaute and PIWI clades, revealing that the Argonaute clade possesses a characteristic sequence, RXXGXXG, whereas the PIWI clade retains an alternative motif, GXXG (Fig. 1B). The crystal structure of Kluyveromyces polysporus Ago1 shows that cS1 reinforces the local structure composed of the L2 linker and the PIWI domain (Fig. S1A) (8Nakanishi K. Weinberg D.E. Bartel D.P. Patel D.J. Structure of yeast Argonaute with guide RNA.Nature. 2012; 486 (22722195): 368-37410.1038/nature11211Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), although these elements are far away from one another in the primary sequence (Fig. 1A). A similar network is seen in the crystal structure of silkworm PIWI-clade Argonaute, SIWI, showing that the PIWI clade-specific GXXG motif and a relatively conserved lysine residue, instead of the arginine, harden the local structure (Fig. S1B) (28Matsumoto N. Nishimasu H. Sakakibara K. Nishida K.M. Hirano T. Ishitani R. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nureki O. Crystal Structure of silkworm PIWI-clade Argonaute Siwi bound to piRNA.Cell. 2016; 167 (27693359): 484-497.e910.1016/j.cell.2016.09.002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These structural observations prompted us to investigate the significance of cS1. We deleted cS1 from a previously reported construct encompassing K. polysporus Ago1(207–1251) (hereafter referred to as AGO207) that retains the properties of its full-length counterpart (8Nakanishi K. Weinberg D.E. Bartel D.P. Patel D.J. Structure of yeast Argonaute with guide RNA.Nature. 2012; 486 (22722195): 368-37410.1038/nature11211Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The cS1-truncated construct was named AGO236 (Fig. 1A), and the recombinant protein could be purified in its RNA-free form (Fig. S1C). To test its guide-RNA–binding activity, purified AGO236 was incubated with a synthetic single-stranded miR-20a, and their interaction was investigated by gel filtration analysis. AGO236 bound a 5′-monophosphorylated miR-20a but not a 5′-hydroxylated RNA of the same sequence (Fig. 1, C and D), indicating that cS1 is dispensable for monophosphate-dependent guide-RNA binding, a hallmark of Argonaute proteins (29Boland A.

Next, we tested whether AGO236 retains guide-dependent RNA slicing activity. AGO207 and AGO236 were loaded with the synthetic single-stranded miR-20a, followed by incubation with a 60-nt target RNA containing a sequence that is fully complementary to miR-20a. As expected, AGO207 cleaved the cognate target, but AGO236 failed to produce a cleavage product (Fig. 1E), demonstrating that cS1 is indispensable for guide-dependent RNA cleavage. These results suggest that cS1 plays an important role in a step after 5′-end capture of the guide RNA by the MID domain. A previous study designed an isolated C-lobe of QDE-2 (29Boland A. Huntzinger E. Schmidt S. Izaurralde E. Weichenrieder O. Crystal structure of the MID-PIWI lobe of a eukaryotic Argonaute protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lee H.C. Liu Y. QIP, a putative exonuclease, interacts with the Neurospora Argonaute protein and facilitates conversion of duplex siRNA into single strands.Genes Dev. 2007; 21 (17311884): 590-60010.1101/gad.1497607Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This C-lobe was composed of only the MID and PIWI domains without the corresponding cS1 (Fig. 1A). Although this earlier study did not investigate slicing activity of QDE-2, the recombinant protein displayed 5′-monophosphate–dependent RNA binding, albeit with lower affinity. Another recent study reported that fly Ago1 C-lobe retained guide-dependent RNA cleavage (Fig. 1A) (26Hur J.K. Zinchenko M.K. Djuranovic S. Green R. Regulation of Argonaute slicer activity by guide RNA 3′ end interactions with the N-terminal lobe.J. Biol.

Based on K. polysporus Ago1, we designed a corresponding C-lobe that encompassed only the 768–1251 and named it AGO768 (Fig. 1A), to determine whether it retains the functional properties of Argonaute proteins. The recombinant AGO768 purified from Escherichia coli weakly bound to nucleic acids and readily degraded during the purification (data not shown). Given that cS1 interacts with the L2 linker and the PIWI domain (Fig. S1A), the composite local structure seems to be critical to form a stable ribonucleoprotein complex. To design a stable C-lobe construct, AGO768 was extended by fusing cS1 and fragments of the N domain and L2 linker (Fig. S1D). The resultant construct was named KpC-lobe (Fig. 1A). Unlike AGO768, the recombinant KpC-lobe purified from E. coli tightly bound to nucleic acids (Fig. S1E), which were resistant to DNase but susceptible to RNase (Fig. 1F), demonstrating that KpC-lobe preferentially bound cellular RNAs over DNAs. The observation that the reinforced C-lobe significantly increases RNA-binding affinity proved that KpC-lobe is capable of forming a ribonucleoprotein complex. The interaction between KpC-lobe and the co-purified RNAs was too strong to be dissociated during the purification. Such strong RNA binding was reported previously in the preparation of bilobed Argonaute proteins encoded by yeast (8Nakanishi K. Weinberg D.E. Bartel D.P. Patel D.J.

We attempted to remove the bound RNA from KpC-lobe by purifying the protein under denaturing conditions; however, the protein failed to properly refold, yielding an insufficient amount of soluble sample for experimentation (data not shown). To see how KpC-lobe recognizes the co-purified RNAs, we crystallized the purified protein with the tightly bound small RNAs and determined the 2.1 Å crystal structure by molecular replacement (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contained four KpC-lobe molecules, and the initial Fo − Fc map showed clear and continuous electron density on each (Fig. S2). Because KpC-lobe co-purified with tightly bound endogenous E. coli RNA, we surmised that the observed electron density reflects a composite signal corresponding to a complex mixture of sequences. Extraction and analysis of the RNA from the crystallized sample validated the presence of RNA in the crystal (Fig. S1F), further suggesting that the observed strong density was derived from the bound RNA. Following previous methods (8Nakanishi K. Weinberg D.E. Bartel D.P. Patel D.J.

The backbones of RNAs bound to the four molecules in the asymmetric unit were structurally indistinguishable when the protein chains were superposed, but slight variations can be observed (Fig. S4, A–C, right). Each RNA bound to the different asymmetric KpC-lobe molecules showed similar but discernibly different thermal stability (Fig. S4C, left).Table 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for KpC-lobe in complex with endogenous E. coli RNAData collection Space groupP2 Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)119.6, 85.6, 127.9 α, β, and γ (°)90.0, 89.8, 90.0 Resolution (Å)50.00–2.10 (2.14–2.10)aValues in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell.

https://openalex.org/W2791976732,"We give an overview of the basic principles of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a class of stochastic methods that enable flexible and likelihood-free model comparison and parameter estimation. Our new open-source software called ABrox is used to illustrate ABC for model comparison on two prominent statistical tests, the two-sample t-test and the Levene-Test. We further highlight the flexibility of ABC compared to classical Bayesian hypothesis testing by computing an approximate Bayes factor for two multinomial processing tree models. Last but not least, throughout the paper, we introduce ABrox using the accompanied graphical user interface."
https://openalex.org/W2792424777,"To evaluate circadian fluctuations and night/day ratio of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) spectral components in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in comparison with controls.This is a simultaneous HRV-polysomnographic (PSG) study including 29 patients with OSA and 18 age-sex-matched controls. Four patients with OSA dropped out. All participants underwent PSG and HRV analysis. We measured the 24-hour fluctuations and the night/day ratio of low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) spectral components of HRV in all subjects and controls. The LF night/day ratio was termed the cardiac sympathetic index while the HF night/day ratio was termed the cardiac parasympathetic index.All twenty-five OSA patients were PSG positive (presence of OSA) while 18 controls were PSG negative (absence of OSA). There was no significant difference in LF and HF 24-hour fluctuation values between OSA patients and controls. In OSA patients, LF and HF values were significantly higher during night-time than day time recordings (p<0.001). HF night/day ratio (cardiac parasympathetic index) accurately (100%) differentiated OSA patients from controls without an overlap of individual values. The LF night/day ratio (cardiac sympathetic index) had sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 72.2% and accuracy of 79.1% in distinguishing between groups.The cardiac parasympathetic index accurately differentiated patients with OSA from controls, on an individual basis."
https://openalex.org/W2793094812,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia and a significant economic burden. Antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae has become more prevalent in recent years and many pneumonia cases are caused by S. pneumoniae that is resistant to at least one antibiotic. The ubiquitin ligase natural killer lytic-associated molecule (NKLAM/RNF19b) plays a role in innate immunity and studies using NKLAM-knockout (NKLAM-KO) macrophages have demonstrated that NKLAM positively affects the transcriptional activity of STAT1. Using an inhalation infection model, we found that NKLAM-KO mice had a significantly higher lung bacterial load than WT mice but had less lung inflammation. Coincidently, NKLAM-KO mice had fewer neutrophils and NK cells in their lungs. NKLAM-KO mice also expressed less iNOS in their lungs as well as less MCP-1, MIP1α, TNFα, IL-12, and IFNγ. Both neutrophils and macrophages from NKLAM-KO mice were defective in killing S. pneumoniae as compared to wild type cells (WT). The phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in NKLAM-KO lungs was lower than in WT lungs at 24 hours post-infection. NKLAM-KO mice were afforded some protection against a lethal dose of S. pneumoniae compared to WT mice. In summary, our novel data demonstrate a role for E3 ubiquitin ligase NKLAM in modulating innate immunity via the positive regulation of inflammatory cytokine expression and bactericidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2791667676,"Karst topography is formed from the dissolution of soluble rocks, such as limestone and dolomite. In soils of such a landform, excessive contents of exchangeable calcium seriously limit the growth of vegetations. Researches have proved that rhizosphere microorganisms and endophytes help host plants to adapt to various adverse environments. The adaptive capacity of plants that grow in adverse environment with salt, drought, thermal and heavy metal stresses partially or completely comes from symbiotic microorganisms. By using the high-throughput amplicon sequencing, the bacterial community structures in soil with high calcium contents and roots and leaves of Cochlearia henryi that is commonly seen in karst area were analyzed. The bacteria community structures in these three compartments showed obvious differences. This indicates that C. henryi, which is adaptive to high calcium stress, selectively co-exists with specific bacteria. Although the bacteria community structures in these three compartments differed significantly, there were 73 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) shared by karst soils as well as roots and leaves of C. henryi. The phylogenetic diversity of these 73 OTUs differed significantly from that of overall OTUs detected. There were also obvious differences in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways and abundance values between the 73 OTUs and overall bacterial communities. A large number of OTUs shared by the karst soils, roots and leaves of C. henryi had close genetic relationship with known stress-resistant bacterial strains. Our results showed that the functional bacteria can be predicted by exploring core bacteria, bacteria shared by soils, adaptable plant roots and leaves. This information will potentially accelerate studies on natural microbial communities which can promote the adaptive capacity of host plants to high calcium stress, and will be valuable for finding microbial strains for field application in karst topography."
https://openalex.org/W2792308115,"Respiratory tract infections are of significant concern in the agriculture industry. There is a requirement for the development of well-characterised in vitro epithelial cell culture models in order to dissect the diverse molecular interactions occurring at the host-pathogen interface in airway epithelia. We have analysed key factors that influence growth and differentiation of ovine tracheal epithelial cells in an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture system. Cellular differentiation was assessed at 21 days post-ALI, a time-point which we have previously shown to be sufficient for differentiation in standard growth conditions. We identified a dose-dependent response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in terms of both epithelial thickening and ciliation levels. Maximal ciliation levels were observed with 25 ng ml-1 EGF. We identified a strict requirement for retinoic acid (RA) in epithelial differentiation as RA exclusion resulted in the formation of a stratified squamous epithelium, devoid of cilia. The pore-density of the growth substrate also had an influence on differentiation as high pore-density inserts yielded higher levels of ciliation and more uniform cell layers than low pore-density inserts. Differentiation was also improved by culturing the cells in an atmosphere of sub-ambient oxygen concentration. We compared two submerged growth media and observed differences in the rate of proliferation/expansion, barrier formation and also in terminal differentiation. Taken together, these results indicate important differences between the response of ovine tracheal epithelial cells and other previously described airway epithelial models, to a variety of environmental conditions. These data also indicate that the phenotype of ovine tracheal epithelial cells can be tailored in vitro by precise modulation of growth conditions, thereby yielding a customisable, potential infection model."
https://openalex.org/W2792448345,"Xpert MTB/RIF is increasingly used in many countries as the initial diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB). Few studies have evaluated the effect of Xpert on TB diagnosis under programmatic conditions in Brazil. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of introduction of Xpert MTB/RIF on TB diagnosis in a city with high TB incidence in Brazil.We included patients evaluated with conventional diagnostic tests during one year before Xpert introduction (pre-Xpert group) and patients evaluated using Xpert during one year after the test introduction (post-Xpert group).620 patients met the inclusion criteria (208 in the pre-Xpert group and 412 in the post-Xpert group) and were included in the analysis. The time until TB diagnosis was shorter in post-Xpert group (0.7 day, IQR: 0.5-1.0 day) than in pre-Xpert group (2.0 days, IQR: 2.0-2.0 days) (p<0.0001). Atypical disease characteristics, such as less weight loss, fever, dyspnea, night sweats, and hemoptysis; a negative sputum smear; a negative culture, and a chest X-ray atypical of TB were more common in post-Xpert group than in pre-Xpert group (p<0.0001 for all).We found that the implementation of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, under programmatic conditions, improve and facilitate TB diagnosis, especially in cases with atypical disease manifestations. These results are likely to be generalizable to settings with a similar high TB incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2791609866,"Osteoporosis has a complex etiology and is considered a multifactorial polygenic disease, in which genetic determinants are modulated by hormonal, lifestyle, environmental, and nutritional factors. Therefore, investigating these multiple factors, and the interactions between them, might lead to a better understanding of osteoporosis pathogenesis, and possible therapeutic interventions. The objective of this study was to identify the relationship between three blood metals (Pb, Cd, and Al), in smoking and nonsmoking patients’ sera, and prevalence of osteoporosis. In particular, we focused on gene-environment interactions of metal exposure, including a dataset obtained through genome-wide association study (GWAS). Subsequently, we conducted a pathway-based analysis, using a GWAS dataset, to elucidate how metal exposure influences susceptibility to osteoporosis. In this study, we evaluated blood metal exposures for estimating the prevalence of osteoporosis in 443 participants (aged 53.24 ± 8.29), from the Republic of Korea. Those analyses revealed a negative association between lead blood levels and bone mineral density in current smokers (p trend <0.01). By further using GWAS-based pathway analysis, we found nuclear receptor (FDR<0.05) and VEGF pathways (FDR<0.05) to be significantly upregulated by blood lead burden, with regard to the prevalence of osteoporosis, in current smokers. These findings suggest that the intracellular pathways of angiogenesis and nuclear hormonal signaling can modulate interactions between lead exposure and genetic variation, with regard to susceptibility to diminished bone mineral density. Our findings may provide new leads for understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of osteoporosis, including possible interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2791946857,"Some natural alkaloids, e.g. capsaicin and camphor, are known to induce a desensitization state, causing insensitivity to pain or noxious temperatures in mammals by acting on TRP receptors. Our research, for the first time, demonstrated that a phenomenon of pharmacological blockade of heat sensitivity may operate in American cockroach, Periplaneta americana (L.). We studied the escape reaction time from 50°C for American cockroaches exposed to multiple doses of different drugs affecting thermo-TRP. Capsaicin, capsazepine, and camphor induced significant changes in time spent at noxious ambient temperatures. Moreover, we showed that behavioral thermoregulation in normal temperature ranges (10–40°C) is altered in treated cockroaches, which displayed a preference for warmer regions compared to non-treated insects. We also measured the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and catalase activity to exclude the secondary effects of the drugs on these processes. Our results demonstrated that increase in time spent at 50°C (five versus one trial at a heat plate) induced oxidative stress, but only in control and vehicle-treated groups. In capsaicin, capsazepine, menthol, camphor and AITC-treated cockroaches the number of exposures to heat had no effect on the levels of MDA. Additionally, none of the tested compounds affected catalase activity. Our results demonstrate suppression of the heat sensitivity by repeated capsazepine, camphor and capsaicin administration in the American cockroach."
https://openalex.org/W2793570825,"Previous reports have proposed that personality may have played a role on human Out-Of-Africa migration, pinpointing some genetic variants that were positively selected in the migrating populations. In this work, we discuss the role of a common copy-number variant within the SIRPB1 gene, recently associated with impulsive behavior, in the human Out-Of-Africa migration. With the analysis of the variant distribution across forty-two different populations, we found that the SIRPB1 haplotype containing duplicated allele significantly correlated with human migratory distance, being one of the few examples of positively selected loci found across the human world colonization. Circular Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C-seq) experiments from the SIRPB1 promoter revealed important 3D modifications in the locus depending on the presence or absence of the duplication variant. In addition, a 3' enhancer showed neural activity in transgenic models, suggesting that the presence of the CNV may compromise the expression of SIRPB1 in the central nervous system, paving the way to construct a molecular explanation of the SIRPB1 variants role in human migration."
https://openalex.org/W2794050584,"The fatty acid-binding proteins L-BABP and Rep1-NCXSQ bind to anionic lipid membranes by electrostatic interactions. According to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, the interaction of the protein macrodipole with the membrane electric field is a driving force for protein binding and orientation in the interface. To further explore this hypothesis, we studied the interactions of these proteins with cationic lipid membranes. As in the case of anionic lipid membranes, we found that both proteins, carrying a negative as well as a positive net charge, were bound to the positively charged membrane. Their major axis, those connecting the bottom of the β-barrel with the α-helix portal domain, were rotated about 180 degrees as compared with their orientations in the anionic lipid membranes. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of the proteins showed that the positively charged membranes were also able to induce conformational changes with a reduction of the β-strand proportion and an increase in α-helix secondary structure. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are involved in several cell processes, such as maintaining lipid homeostasis in cells. They transport hydrophobic molecules in aqueous medium and deliver them into lipid membranes. Therefore, the interfacial orientation and conformation, both shown herein to be electrostatically determined, have a strong correlation with the specific mechanism by which each particular FABP exerts its biological function."
https://openalex.org/W2790166829,"Netrin receptors of the DCC/NEO/UNC-40/Frazzled family have well established roles in cell migration and axon guidance but can also regulate epithelial features such as adhesion, polarity and adherens junction (AJ) stability. Previously, we have shown that overexpression of Drosophila Frazzled (Fra) in the peripodial epithelium (PE) inhibits wing disc eversion and also generates cellular protrusions typical of motile cells. Here, we tested whether the molecular pathways by which Fra inhibits eversion are distinct from those driving motility. We show that in disc proper (DP) epithelial cells Fra, in addition to inducing F-Actin rich protrusions, can affect localization of AJ components and columnar cell shape. We then show that these phenotypes have different requirements for the three conserved Fra cytoplasmic P-motifs and for downstream genes. The formation of protrusions required the P3 motif of Fra, as well as integrins (mys and mew), the Rac pathway (Rac1, wave and, arpc3) and myosin regulatory light chain (Sqh). In contrast, apico-basal cell shape change, which was accompanied by increased myosin phosphorylation, was critically dependent upon the P1 motif and was promoted by RhoGef2 but inhibited by Rac1. Fra also caused a loss of AJ proteins (DE-Cad and Arm) from basolateral regions of epithelial cells. This phenotype required all 3 P-motifs, and was dependent upon the polarity factor par6. par6 was not required for protrusions or cell shape change, but was required to block eversion suggesting that control of AJ components may underlie the ability of Fra to promote epithelial stability. The results imply that multiple molecular pathways act downstream of Fra in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2789976804,"The Drosophila GATA factor gene serpent (srp) is required for the early differentiation of the anterior and posterior midgut primordia. In particular, srp is sufficient and necessary for the primordial gut cells to undertake an epithelial-to-mesenchimal transition (EMT). Two other GATA factor genes, dGATAe and grain (grn), are also specifically expressed in the midgut. On the one hand, dGATAe expression is activated by srp. Embryos homozygous for a deficiency uncovering dGATAe were shown to lack the expression of some differentiated midgut genes. Moreover, ectopic expression of dGATAe was sufficient to drive the expression of some of these differentiation marker genes, thus establishing the role of dGATAe in the regulation of their expression. However, due to the gross abnormalities associated with this deficiency, it was not possible to assess whether, similarly to srp, dGATAe might play a role in setting the midgut morphology. To further investigate this role we decided to generate a dGATAe mutant. On the other hand, grn is expressed in the midgut primordia around stage 11 and remains expressed until the end of embryogenesis. Yet, no midgut function has been described for grn. First, here we report that, as for dGATAe, midgut grn expression is dependent on srp; conversely, dGATAe and grn expression are independent of each other. Our results also indicate that, unlike srp, dGATAe and grn are not responsible for setting the general embryonic midgut morphology. We also show that the analysed midgut genes whose expression is lacking in embryos homozygous for a deficiency uncovering dGATAe are indeed dGATAe-dependent genes. Conversely, we do not find any midgut gene to be grn-dependent, with the exception of midgut repression of the proventriculus iroquois (iro) gene. In conclusion, our results clarify the expression patterns and function of the GATA factor genes expressed in the embryonic midgut."
https://openalex.org/W2794083657,"Skin barrier function is often deficient in obese individuals, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated how skin structure and lipid metabolism, factors strongly associated with barrier function, differed among 50 Japanese women of greatly varying body mass index (BMI). Subjects receiving breast reconstruction surgery were chosen for analysis to obtain skin samples from the same site. The subjects were classified into two groups, control (BMI < 25 kg/m2) and obese (25 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 35 kg/m2), according to standards in Japan. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess skin thickness, Ki-67 immunostaining to examine keratinocyte proliferation, and real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure skin expression levels of genes associated with lipid metabolism. Total lipids, cholesterol, and fatty acids were also measured from these same skin samples. In the obese group, structural changes included epidermal thickening and an increase in the number of Ki-67-positive (proliferating) cells. Both skin cholesterol and fatty acid levels exhibited an “inverted-U” relationship with BMI, suggesting that there is an optimal BMI for peak lipid content and barrier function. Decreased lipid levels at higher BMI were accompanied by downregulated expression of PPARδ and other genes related to lipid metabolism, including those encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase and HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzymes for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, respectively. Thus, elevated BMI may lead to deficient skin barrier function by suppressing local lipid synthesis."
