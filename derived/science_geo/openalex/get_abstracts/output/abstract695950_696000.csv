https://openalex.org/W4281687206,"Multiple COVID-19 vaccines, representing diverse vaccine platforms, successfully protect against symptomatic COVID-19 cases and deaths. Head-to-head comparisons of T cell, B cell, and antibody responses to diverse vaccines in humans are likely to be informative for understanding protective immunity against COVID-19, with particular interest in immune memory. Here, SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific immune responses to Moderna mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S, and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 were examined longitudinally for 6 months 100% of individuals made memory CD4+ T cells, with cTfh and CD4-CTL highly represented after mRNA or NVX-CoV2373 vaccination. mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S induced comparable CD8+ T cell frequencies, though only detectable in 60–67% of subjects at 6 months. A differentiating feature of Ad26.COV2.S immunization was a high frequency of CXCR3+ memory B cells. mRNA vaccinees had substantial declines in antibodies, while memory T and B cells were comparatively stable. These results may also be relevant for insights against other pathogens."

To demonstrate one approach for their characterization, mass spectrometry of intestinal contents from gnotobiotic mice, plus in vitro studies, revealed liberation of N-methylserotonin from orange fibers by human gut microbiota members including Bacteroides ovatus. Functional genomic analyses of B. ovatus strains grown under permissive and non-permissive N-methylserotonin “mining” conditions revealed polysaccharide utilization loci that target pectins whose expression correlate with strain-specific liberation of this compound. N-methylserotonin, orally administered to germ-free mice, reduced adiposity, altered liver glycogenesis, shortened gut transit time, and changed expression of genes that regulate circadian rhythm in the liver and colon. In human studies, dose-dependent, orange-fiber-specific fecal accumulation of N-methylserotonin positively correlated with levels of microbiome genes encoding enzymes that digest pectic glycans. Identifying this type of microbial mining activity has potential therapeutic implications."

https://openalex.org/W4283695534,"Background High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is increasingly used in critically ill cancer patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) to avoid mechanical ventilation (MV). The objective was to assess prognostic factors associated with mortality in ICU cancer patients requiring MV after HFNC failure, and to identify predictive factors of intubation. Methods We conducted a retrospective study from 2012–2016 in a cancer referral center. All consecutive onco-hematology adult patients admitted to the ICU treated with HFNC were included. HFNC failure was defined by intubation requirement. Results 202 patients were included, 104 successfully treated with HFNC and 98 requiring intubation. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 26.2% (n = 53) and 42.1% (n = 85) respectively, and 53.1% (n = 52) and 68.4% (n = 67) in patients requiring MV. Multivariate analysis identified 4 prognostic factors of hospital mortality after HFNC failure: complete/partial remission (OR = 0.2, 95%CI = 0.04–0.98, p&lt;0.001) compared to patients with refractory/relapse disease (OR = 3.73, 95%CI = 1.08–12.86), intubation after day 3 (OR = 7.78, 95%CI = 1.44–41.96), number of pulmonary quadrants involved on chest X-ray (OR = 1.93, 95%CI = 1.14–3.26, p = 0.01) and SAPSII at ICU admission (OR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1–1.12, p = 0.019). Predictive factors of intubation were the absence of sepsis (sHR = 0.32, 95%CI = 0.12–0.74, p = 0.0087), Sp02&lt;95% 15 minutes after HFNC initiation (sHR = 2.05, 95%CI = 1.32–3.18, p = 0.0014), number of quadrants on X-ray (sHR = 1.73, 95%CI = 1.46–2.06, p&lt;0.001), Fi02&gt;60% at HFNC initiation (sHR = 3.12, 95%CI = 2.06–4.74, p&lt;0.001) and SAPSII at ICU admission (sHR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.02–1.05, p&lt;0.01). Conclusion Duration of HFNC may be predictive of an excess mortality in ARF cancer patients. Early warning scores to predict HFNC failure are needed to identify patients who would benefit from early intubation."

https://openalex.org/W4283691225,"The construction of refuge spaces in rapidly urbanizing historic cities is a challenging task owing to their complex urban form, unique urban fabric, and historic preservation requirements. Refuge green space (RGS) is a green space that can serve as an emergency shelter in cities, providing a flexible means to increase the emergency shelter capacity for rapidly urbanized historic cities. After major earthquakes, spatial accessibility to GRSs is a critical planning strategy for disaster prevention and emergency response in historic cities. To match the RGS planning with the emergency service demand, we must examine the spatial disparity in access to existing RGSs. In this study, the urban area of Nanjing was selected as the target region to analyze the spatial disparity in access to RGSs using the Gaussian two-step floating catchment area method at four evacuation times (10, 20, 30, and 60 min). The results showed that the spatial accessibility exhibited clustering characteristics, where high-accessibility spaces were mainly distributed in the northern and southern regions of Nanjing. The increase in the evacuation time improved accessibility to RGSs, but the existing RGSs still could not sufficiently satisfy the emergency shelter needs of citizens. Based on the bivariate local Moran’s I analysis of the RGS accessibility and population density, the spatial mismatch regions were dominant in the center of the urban area. These findings not only are expected to assist emergency planners by improving their strategic plans for emergency shelter investment in Nanjing and their ability to respond to catastrophic earthquakes, but also provide a strong reference for the construction of a safe environment in other rapidly developing historic cities that face earthquake threats."
https://openalex.org/W4285743364,"Although vitamin D concentration is reportedly associated with the pathogenesis and pathology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), benefits of vitamin D supplementation in SLE patients have not been elucidated, to our knowledge. We investigated the clinical impacts of vitamin D supplementation in SLE.A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from a lupus registry of nationwide institutions. We evaluated vitamin D supplementation status associated with disease-related Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) as a parameter of long-term disease activity control.Of the enrolled 870 patients (mean age: 45 years, mean disease duration: 153 months), 426 (49%) received vitamin D supplementation. Patients with vitamin D supplementation were younger (43.2 vs 47.5 years, P < 0.0001), received higher doses of prednisolone (7.6 vs 6.8 mg/day, P = 0.002), and showed higher estimated glomerular filtration rates (79.3 vs 75.3 mL/min/1.73m2, P = 0.02) than those without supplementation. Disease-related SDI (0.73 ± 1.12 vs 0.73 ± 1.10, P = 0.75), total SDI, and SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) did not significantly differ between patients receiving and not receiving vitamin D supplementation. Even after excluding 136 patients who were highly recommended vitamin D supplementation (with age ≥ 75 years, history of bone fracture or avascular necrosis, denosumab use, and end-stage renal failure), disease-related SDI, total SDI, and SLEDAI did not significantly differ between the two groups.Even with a possible Vitamin D deficiency and a high risk of bone fractures in SLE patients, only half of our cohort received its supplementation. The effect of vitamin D supplementation for disease activity control was not observed."
https://openalex.org/W4283465519,"Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are S-adenosylmethionine-dependent enzymes that transfer a methyl group to arginine residues within proteins, most notably histones. The nine characterized PRMT family members are divided into three types depending on the resulting methylated product: asymmetric dimethylarginine (Type I PRMT), symmetric dimethylarginine (Type II PRMT), or monomethylated arginine (Type III PRMT). In some cancers, the resulting product can lead to either increased or decreased transcription of cancer-related genes, suggesting PRMT family members may be valid therapeutic targets. Traditionally, peptide-based compounds have been employed to target this family of enzymes, which has resulted in multiple tool and lead compounds being developed. However, peptide-based therapeutics suffer from poor stability and short half-lives, as proteases can render them useless by hydrolytic degradation. Conversely, peptoids, which are peptide-mimetics composed of N-substituted glycine monomers, are less susceptible to hydrolysis, resulting in improved stability and longer half-lives. Herein, we report the development of a bioavailable, peptoid-based PRMT1 inhibitor that induces cell death in MDA468 and HCT116 cancer cell lines while not exhibiting any significant impact on nontumorigenic HepaRG or normal human mammary epithelial cells. Furthermore, the inhibitor described herein appears to induce both apoptosis and autophagy, suggesting it may be a less toxic cytostatic agent. In conclusion, we propose this peptoid-based inhibitor has significant anticancer and therapeutic potential by reducing cell viability, growth, and size in breast and colon cancer.

Arginine methylation is a common posttranslational modification that occurs when methyl groups are transferred to the guanidinyl side chain of arginine residues. The protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family of enzymes are S-adenosylmethionine-dependent enzymes that catalyze this transfer, which can result in significant changes to protein–protein interactions, as well as protein–DNA/RNA interactions. Among the most well-studied substrates for PRMT enzymes are the N-terminal tails of histone proteins. Given the critical role that histones play in the packaging of DNA, it is not surprising that posttranslational modifications to the histones affects the translation of some genes (1Pal S. Sif S.

RNA and protein interactions modulated by protein arginine methylation.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, dysregulation of these methylating enzymes has been associated with the aberrant expression of some cancer-related proteins, which makes this enzyme family a target for potential therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment (5Yang Y. Bedford M.T. Protein arginine methyltransferases and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). PRMT family members are subcategorized into three types based on their methylation products (Fig. 1). Type I enzymes, a group that includes PRMTs 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, catalyze the sequential additions of two methyl groups to yield asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) residues. Type II enzymes, which include PRMTs 5 and 9, catalyzed the sequential addition of two methyl groups to yield symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) residues. The lone member of the Type III group, PRMT 7, catalyzes the addition of a single methyl group to form monomethylarginine (MMA) residues (6Bedford M.T. Arginine methylation at a glance.J.

While there is some overlap in the substrate profiles for type I and II PRMTs, the resulting downstream effects of the methylation products (ADMA versus SDMA) can be markedly different. A notable example of differential outcomes due to alternate modification can be found at the R3 residue on the N terminus of histone H4. This arginine is a substrate for both PRMT 1 (type I) and PRMT 5 (type II), thus it can be converted to either ADMA or SDMA, respectively. The conversion of this residue to ADMA is associated with the transcriptional activation of genes under the control of p53 and estrogen receptors, among others (1Pal S. Sif S.

More specifically, PRMT1 has been shown to catalyze the production of H4R3me2a, and this specific modification is a key switch of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition at the ZEB1 promoter, activating its transcription leading to breast cancer (16Gao Y.

Further studies have also identified overexpression of PRMT1 in some cancers, including leukemia, prostate, esophageal, lung, bladder, and breast compared to normal cells leading to increased protein levels and promoting cell proliferation (5Yang Y.

Morettin A. Côté J. Role of PRMTs in cancer: could minor isoforms be leaving a mark?.World J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 5: 115-129PubMed Google Scholar). To date, several PRMT inhibitors have been reported, including some that are isozyme specific. One of the first non-AdoMet–based pan inhibitors for Type I PRMTs was developed in 2004 but only recently has a PRMT inhibitor made it to clinical trials (24Wu Q. Schapira M. Arrowsmith C.

Davies C. PRMTs and arginine methylation: cancer's best-kept secret?.Trends Mol. Med. 2019; 25: 993-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Given that PRMTs modify protein substrates, it is not surprising that many peptide-based compounds have been developed to study these enzymes (26Bicker K.L. Obianyo O. Rust H.L. Thompson P.R. A combinatorial approach to characterize the substrate specificity of protein arginine methyltransferase 1.Mol. Biosyst. 2011; 7: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Vhuiyan M.

Peptidic transition state analogues as PRMT inhibitors.Methods. 2020; 175: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). One obvious advantage of peptide-based inhibitors is the modularity and the natural recognition elements conveyed by the amino acid sequence, which can be used tune substrate specificities. For example, we recently reported the development a peptide-based chemical probe that exhibits selectively for PRMT1 over PRMT 5 in vitro (29Mann S. Salsburg A. Causey C. Knuckley B. The development and characterization of a chemical probe targeting PRMT1 over PRMT5.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2019; 27: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). One major limitation of peptide-based compounds as in vivo tools and therapeutics is their inherent susceptibility degradation by proteolysis. Recently, we began exploring the use of peptoid scaffolds as an alternative to peptides. Peptoids, which are polymers of N-substituted glycine residues, piqued our interests as a potential surrogate for traditional peptide backbones because as tertiary amides, they are less susceptible to hydrolytic degradation. However, these structures still allow a level of modularity that is comparable to peptides and can be constructed rapidly by submonomer synthesis (30Culf A. Ouellette R. Solid-phase synthesis of N-substituted glycine oligomers (alpha-peptoids) and derivatives.Molecules. 2010; 15: 5282-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 31Zuckermann R.N. Kerr J.M.

Soc. 2002; 114: 10646-10647Crossref Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Like peptides, specific sequence design may provide selectivity among various enzymes, improving the in vivo utility and making them suitable clinical therapeutics. Peptoid-based inhibitors have been previously developed for enzymes and used as antimicrobial compounds, further demonstrating their efficacy in drug discovery (32Raveendra B. Wu H. Baccala R.

Recent advances in the development of anti-infective peptoids.Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2020; 56: 11158-11168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies found that peptoid-based analogs of H4-16, a known PRMT substrate, were not modified by the PRMT enzymes; instead, these analogs were found to inhibit the enzyme at low millimolar concentrations (37Mann S. DeMart M. May B. Causey C. Knuckley B. Histone H4-based peptoids are inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1).Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This finding led us to pursue the development of peptoid-based compounds as selective inhibitors of PRMTs. Herein, we describe the development of a peptoid-based inhibitor that selectively inhibits PRMT1 over PRMT5 with an IC50 value in the low micromolar range. Additional in vitro studies have shown that this compound significantly reduces cell viability and growth potential in MDA468 breast carcinoma and HCT116 +/+ colon carcinoma cell lines, with no noticeable toxicity in normal and nontumorigenic cells. Further analysis reveals this inhibitor induces apoptosis and autophagy to stimulate growth arrest and cell death in cancer cells. Histone H4-16 peptoids have been shown to be moderate inhibitors of PRMT1 with some degree of selectivity over PRMT5. In addition, this peptoid contains only a single N-Arg residue, H4R3, in its sequence, which simplifies the analysis and can be used for the development of second-generation histone-based peptoid inhibitors. Modifying this single N-Arg residue to incorporate a reactive warhead would provide the ability to bind to the PRMT1 active site and potentially lead to greater inhibition and selectivity. PRMT1 contains a cysteine (Cys 101) within the active site, but this residue is not conserved in most other PRMT isozymes. Replacing H4R3 with a chloracetamidine warhead, a well-characterized Cys modifier, could lead to selective, irreversible modification of PRMT1. For this reason, we chose to construct an H4-16 peptoid replacing Arg3 with a chloracetamidine warhead (Fig. 2). To determine if acetylation was important in regard to these peptoids, we synthesized both an unacetylated (compound P2) and acetylated version (compound P2A) of the H4-16 warhead peptoid. Compounds P2 and P2A were synthesized and purified, then verified by ESI-MS with a mass of 1460.8 and 1502.8, respectively (Table S1). Compounds P2A and P2 were expected to have improved potency and selectivity as compared to the H4-16 peptoids that lacked the ability to irreversibly modify PRMT1 (37Mann S. DeMart M. May B. Causey C. Knuckley B. Histone H4-based peptoids are inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1).Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To this end, we conducted an IC50 analysis of these compounds for PRMT1 using a standard methyltransferase assay, in addition to evaluating their ability to selectively target PRMT1 over PRMT5. PRMT1 was treated with compound P2A and resulted in an IC50 value of 59.1 ± 2.21 μM (Fig. 3A), which is improved potency over the original AcH4-16 peptoid (15-fold; 916 ± 19.5 μM). However, compound P2 resulted in a IC50 value of 8.73 ± 0.314 μM with respect to PRMT1 (Fig. 3C) and a 45-fold increase in potency compared to the original unacetylated H4-16 peptoid (IC50 value for PRMT1 of 396 ± 31.4 μM). These data support previous studies that a positively charged N terminus leads to increased binding and inhibition of PRMT1 (38Osborne T.C. Obianyo O. Zhang X. Cheng X. Thompson P.R. Protein arginine methyltransferase 1: positively charged residues in substrate peptides distal to the site of methylation are important for substrate binding and catalysis.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13370-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we sought to determine if the Cl-warhead, which selectively modifies Cys residues, would provide further selectivity for PRMT1 over PRMT5. The IC50 value for compounds P2 and P2A warhead peptoids with PRMT5 were both determined to be >500 μM (Fig. 3, B and D). Compound P2 exhibited >60-fold difference in IC50 values and demonstrated improved selectivity for PRMT1 over PRMT5. The difference in IC50 values between PRMT1 and PRMT5 was not surprising but provides evidence that we can selectively target individual members of this family to develop isozyme-specific, peptoid-based inhibitors. Given the improved inhibition and selectivity, compound P2 was used for further studies. To study the anticancer potential of compound P2, MDA468 breast carcinoma and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells along with HepaRG immortalized, terminally differentiated liver cells were grown in the presence of various concentrations of compound P2 (0–20 μM) for 48 h, and cell viability was assessed using the crystal violet assay. Compound P2 had significant antiproliferative effect in a dose-responsive manner on both cancer cell lines, while no prominent change was seen in the viability of the nontumorigenic HepaRG cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, A and B). The proliferation was reduced most significantly in MDA468 cells (55% at 10 μM and 75% at 20 μM). Although HCT116 responded to the compound well, the effects were less pronounced with 40% reduction at 10 μM and 60% at the highest concentration (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined the specificity of compound P2 on cancer cells over 72 h time course using a panel of cancer and normal cells in the crystal violet assay. Once again, there was a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell viability in both cancer cell lines (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, trypan blue exclusion analysis showed significant increase in dead and dying cells at both 24 h and 48 h posttreatment with P2 in a dose-response manner in both MDA468 and HCT116 cancer cells (Fig. 5C and data not shown). In contrast, nontumorigenic HepaRG and normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) showed no detectable effect in growth (Fig. 5, D and E). These results suggest that compound P2 specifically targets cancer cells and reduces their viability and growth potential without significant toxicity to normal and nontumorigenic cells. After studying the effect of P2 treatment on the viability and growth of cells, the impact of the drug was tested on the cells ability to form and maintain colonies over 14 days (Fig. 6, A–C). The colony formation assay results show a significant dose-dependent decrease in the number of MDA468 and HCT116+/+ colonies formed posttreatment with P2. A decrease of approximately 50% in the number of HCT116 colonies was seen with 5 μM P2 (Fig. 6B) and with 10 μM P2 treatment in MDA468 (Fig. 6C). These results confirmed the ability of P2 to reduce tumorigenicity of cancer cells. To examine the mechanism of anticancer activity, we next observed cells treated with compound P2 after staining for morphological changes in response to the drug. Untreated cells remained healthy and normal in appearance throughout the experimental time frame, while several cells in the treated samples showed membrane blebbing indicative of apoptosis and presence of small vacuoles in rounded cells suggestive of autophagy (Fig. 7A). To test for apoptosis, caspase-3 activity was examined in protein extracts from untreated and treated cells. Significant caspase-3 activity was seen in a dose and time-response manner in MDA468 and HCT116 cells after 24 h and 48 h of treatment with compound P2 (Fig. 7, B and C; p < 0.02). In contrast, minimal activation of caspase-3 was seen in HepaRG cells and only at the highest dose at 24 h (Fig. 7, B and C). Combined, these results indicate apoptosis as a mechanism of action for the observed anticancer activity of compound P2. In addition, we examined if autophagy was also contributing to the reduced viability seen after treatment with compound P2 as a large percentage of treated cells showed presence of vacuoles (Fig. 7A). First, we measured cell areas using ImageJ analysis in treated and untreated stained cells grown on coverslips as a common morphological change in cells undergoing autophagy is a reduction in size. Results showed significant decrease in size of cells in both cancer cell lines post compound P2 treatment, while HepaRG remained unchanged (Fig. 7D). This reduction in cell size could also be an additional sign of active autophagy (Fig. 7D). To confirm, we monitored the levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), a well-known marker of autophagy, using Western blot analyses in all three cell lines as a response to compound P2 treatment. The data support active autophagy though the induction was much less pronounced in the nontumorigenic HepaRG (Fig. 7E). Taken together, the results find both apoptosis and autophagy are important pathways activated by compound P2 to induce growth arrest and cell death in cancer cells. PRMT family members catalyze the methylation of arginine residues in a variety of proteins but have been extensively studied in relation to their modification of the N-terminal tails of histone proteins. PRMT isozymes have varying substrate specificity in regard to these histone tails. For example, PRMT1 and PRMT5 are primarily responsible for more than 90% of the methylation of Arg3 on histone H4. Meanwhile, PRMT4 (CARM1) does not methylate H4R3 but is responsible for the majority of methylation found on Arg17 on histone H3. These similarities and differences in substrate specificity provide an opportunity to design inhibitors targeting either single PRMTs or multiple family members. Peptides based on the N-terminal tail of these histones have been shown to have kinetic parameters, kcat and Km, that are similar to those of native histones. Peptides present a unique niche of pharmaceutical compounds that provide distinct physical and biochemical features to specifically bind to disease-related proteins. For example, peptides have been used as synthetic signaling molecules to regulate physiological functions and have also been used to disrupt protein–protein interactions (39Wang L. Wang N. Zhang W. Cheng X. Yan Z. Shao G. et al.Therapeutic peptides: current applications and future directions.Signal Transduct. Target. Ther. 2022; 7: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Cheng S.-S. Yang G.-J. Wang W. Leung C.-H. Ma D.-L. The design and development of covalent protein-protein interaction inhibitors for cancer treatment.J. Hematol. Oncol. 2020; 13: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ease of synthesis and low cost of production have made peptides favorable compounds as disease therapeutics. However, one of the main challenges in developing peptide-based therapeutics is their poor stability and short half-lives due to proteolytic degradation. The use of peptoids, which are peptide-mimics displaying the amino acid side chain on the nitrogen of the amide backbone instead of the α-C, mitigates the problem of proteolysis. Furthermore, these compounds generally display greater cellular permeability than their peptide analogs, which also improves their potential as pharmaceuticals (41Kwon Y. Kodadek T. Quantitative evaluation of the relative cell permeability of peptoids and peptides.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 1508-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 42Schwochert J. Turner R. Thang M. Berkeley R. Ponkey A. Rodriguez K. et al.Peptide to peptoid substitutions increase cell permeability in cyclic hexapeptides.Org. Lett. 2015; 17: 2928-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As a result, peptoid versions of the histone H4 N-terminal tail (H4-16) were recently developed by replacing the amino acids residues with peptoid monomers, thus shifting the side chain from the α-C to the nitrogen on the backbone. However, the peptoid version of H4-16 was a very poor PRMT1 substrate with kcat/Km values ∼10−17 M−1 min−1. Interestingly, the peptoid version was a moderate inhibitor of PRMT1 with IC50 values in the high micromolar range (∼400–900 μM). Although the values are fairly high for pharmaceutical development, they did provide a novel scaffold for inhibitor design targeting the PRMT family (37Mann S. DeMart M. May B. Causey C. Knuckley B. Histone H4-based peptoids are inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1).Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Thus, this scaffold was used to develop compounds that have enhanced binding and specifically target PRMT1. Based on this information, we replaced the N-Arg side chain of the peptoid with a chloracetamidine warhead to develop a more potent and selective compound. The chloracetamidine ‘warhead’ in place of the guanidinium moiety of the arginine side chain, specifically Arg3 on the histone H4 N-terminal tail, allows for specific PRMTs to be covalently modified by this compound through inactivation of PRMT1 by formation of a thioether adduct with Cys101 (43Obianyo O. Causey C.P. Osborne T.C. Jones J.E. Lee Y.H. Stallcup M.R. et al.A chloroacetamidine-based inactivator of protein arginine methyltransferase 1: design, synthesis, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation.Chembiochem. 2010; 11: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This strategy was previously used to develop some peptide-based tool compounds against PRMT1, however given the advantages of peptoids over peptides, we incorporated this chloracetamidine warhead into the H4-16 peptoid. Based on the IC50 values, the incorporation of the warhead into the acetylated H4-16 peptoid (compound P2A) increased the potency more than 15-fold as compared to the nonwarhead version. Moreover, replacing NArg3 with the warhead in the unacetylated H4-16 peptoid (compound P2) resulted in >45-fold increase in potency. As PRMT1 and PRMT5 are responsible for more than 90% of all protein arginine methylation in mammals, we measured the low micromolar inhibitors against PRMT5 to determine selectivity between these two isozymes. Based on the IC50 values, compound P2 is selective for PRMT1 over PRMT5 by more than 60-fold, based on the IC50 values. The warhead-based peptoids result in improved potency, selectivity, bioavailability, and half-life potential as compared to the peptide versions. However, the peptide versions of these compounds were also synthesized, and the IC50 values were measured to compare the role that the peptoid backbone may play in contributing to inhibition (Fig. S1). The AcH4-16 warhead peptide had an IC50 value similar to the peptoid version (46.9 ± 4.86 μM compared to 59.1 ± 2.21 μM). Whereas, the unacetylated H4-16 warhead peptoid (compound P2) was ∼3-fold better than the peptide version (29.6 ± 5.16 μM versus 8.73 ± 0.314 μM; Fig. S2). In total, this suggests the peptoid-based inhibitors improve potency and possess better stability overall, while also improving selectivity over the peptide version as compared with PRMT5. Given the role of PRMTs in cancer, such as breast and colon cancer, we evaluated the bioactivity of compound P2 in MDA468 and HCT116 cell lines compared to both HepaRG and HMECs. Compound P2 showed antiproliferation activity in a dose-dependent manner in both tested cancer cell lines, MDA468 and HCT116+/+, without interfering with the growth of normal cell lines HMEC and HepaRG. This suggests that compound P2 has both specificity and anticancer activity. This inhibitory effect is consistent with the result seen in experiments studying PRMT pan inhibitors AMI-1 and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) conducted by Janisiak et al. (44Janisiak J. Kopytko P. Tkacz M. Rogińska D. Perużyńska M. Machaliński B. et al.Protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) inhibitors—AMI-1 and SAH are effective in attenuating rhabdomyosarcoma growth and proliferation in cell cultures.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) where they observed a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability of Rh30 and RD Rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines with the administration of the inhibitors. Given that AMI-1 and SAH are pan PRMT inhibitors, inhibition of PRMT1 was seen by a reduction in the levels of PRMT1 methylated product, H4R3me2a. Likewise, Eram et al. (45Eram M.S. Shen Y. Szewczyk M. Wu H. Senisterra G. Li F. et al.A potent, selective, and cell-active inhibitor of human type I protein arginine methyltransferases.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) also saw similar results of decreased viability using MS023, a PRMT type I pan inhibitor. MS023 showed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability and a downstream inhibition of both PRMT1 and PRMT6 by the undermethylation of H4R3 and H3R2, respectively (37Mann S. DeMart M. May B. Causey C. Knuckley B. Histone H4-based peptoids are inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1).Biochem. J. 2020; 477: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Unlike the mentioned PRMT inhibitors, compound P2 is a PRMT1-specific peptoid inhibitor, and the chlorine warhead brings this specificity to the molecule. However, the in vitro specificity of compound P2 against PRMT1 was not confirmed in this study. Compound P2 was effective in both tested cancer cell lines, but MDA468 cells showed less but more sustained response while HCT116 had a delayed, but more effective response. This difference is potentially explained by the unique genetic makeup of each cell line, the different pathways activated, and the protein profile of each, with MDA468 lacking both the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) and p53 genes. Fedoriw et al. (46Fedoriw A. Rajapurkar S. O'Brien S. Gerhart S. Mitchell L. Adams N. et al.Anti-tumor activity of the type I PRMT inhibitor, GSK3368715, synergizes with PRMT5 inhibition through MTAP loss.Cancer Cell. 2019; 36: 100-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) looked at type I PRMT inhibitor, GSK3368715, across 249 cell lines and 12 tumor types, each showing a decrease in proliferation to a different extent. These results suggest that each cell line has its own IC50 value. In addition, they suggested that the loss of the MTAP gene may increase the susceptibility of cell lines to PRMT type I inhibitors through synergistic inhibition of PRMT5 due to the accumulation of 2-methylthioadenosine, a natural PRMT 5 inhibitor. MTAP is a tumor suppressor gene near CDKN2A and can be co-deleted in cancer cell lines. This proposed a possible explanation for early sensitivity in MDA-MB-468 to compound P2 during the time course experiments. However, as MDA468 has a mutated p53, this lack of fully functional p53 may contribute to the limited efficacy of P2. The increased caspase-3 activity in both cancer cell lines compared to the normal cells suggests a role for a tumor-specific apoptosis mechanism of action by compound P2. This was supported by the observance of apoptotic vacuoles in cells treated with the inhibitor. Apoptosis has been seen as the common cause of cell death after treatment with PRMT pan inhibitors due to the downregulation of cyclin D. Cells treated with PRMT inhibitors also exhibit cell cycle arrest at the G1/S (47Zhang B. Zhang S. Zhu L. Chen X. Zhao Y. Chao L. et al.Arginine methyltransferase inhibitor 1 inhibits gastric cancer by downregulating eIF4E and targeting PRMT5.Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2017; 336: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 48Tsapras P. Nezis I.P. Caspase involvement in autophagy.Cell Death Differ. 2017; 24: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell cycle studies looking at HepaRG-FUCCI cells suggest that treatment with compound P2 inhibited the cells from re-entering the cell cycle. Western blot data looking at the expression of cyclin D in the three cell lines, MDA468, HCT116, and HepaRG, suggest a downregulation in cyclin D expression posttreatment (data not shown). However, the significance of this downregulation is yet to be verified. The morphological studies show the presence of multiple vacuoles and the reduction in the average size specifically in cancer cells treated with compound P2, and the increased expression of LC3 in all three cell lines. Western blots suggest that autophagy may also play a role in the mechanism of action of compound P2. Autophagy is often the go-to survival response of the cell after it undergoes stress or starvation. It is seen as a protective method utilized before cell suicide via apoptosis. Caspases are a primary contributor to apoptotic cell death, but recent studies have also shown they can directly interact with core autophagy proteins, slowing down the autophagic process to preserve survival. Under most conditions, caspases inhibit autophagy and induce apoptosis. However, caspase-1, -3, -8, and -9 have favored an autophagy response (48Tsapras P. Nezis I.P. Caspase involvement in autophagy.Cell Death Differ. 2017; 24: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It may be possible that Caspase-3 levels are increased to quench autophagy, as many a-ketoglutarates have been discovered as substrates for caspases. These previous studies suggest a link between apoptosis and autophagy because of caspase activity. Thus, compound P2 may elicit a similar response in these cells, leading to growth arrest and cell death. In their review, Tsapras and Nezis (48Tsapras P. Nezis I.P. Caspase involvement in autophagy.Cell Death Differ. 2017; 24: 1369-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) suggest that specific caspases, including caspase-2, may promote autophagy in the presence of mitochondrial oxidation damage. Prolonged exposure to compound P2 would likely push the cell from undergoing autophagy into apoptosis (Fig. 8). The peptoid-based inhibitor, compound P2, has a greater potential over peptide-based compounds for development into therapeutics against PRMT-associate diseases. Overall, this PRMT inhibitor shows promising anticancer activity in MDA468 and HCT116 cell lines, reducing cell viability, relative growth, and cell size. Further experimentation regarding its specificity, bioavailability, synergistic ability, and its mechanism of action are necessary. Conducting experiments to confirm the specificity of compound P2 against PRMT1 and to assess the bioavailability and half-life of the peptoids in vitro is essential for determining its efficiency as a drug. The selectivity of compound P2 can be confirmed by running Western blots looking at the levels of PRMT1 and its products (e.g., H4R3me2a) in treated versus controlled cell lines. These data would help establish a more precise understanding of the downstream effects of this compound. Another helpful comparison would be between cells treated with compound P2 and a cell line with PRMT1 knockdown, e.g., MDA-MB-231. These studies, and others, will be conducted in the future in addition to elucidating the mechanism of action by compound P2 while also helping to shed light on a possible mechanistic pathway of the drug and the genes being transcribed posttreatment."
https://openalex.org/W4283645764,"To compare the retinal vascular pulsatile characteristics in subjects with normal (ICPn) and high (ICPh) intracranial pressure and quantify the interactions between intraocular pressure, intracranial pressure, and retinal vascular pulse amplitude in the Fourier domain.Twenty-one subjects were examined using modified photoplethysmography with simultaneous ophthalmodynamometry. A harmonic regression model was fitted to each pixel in the time-series, and used to quantify the retinal vascular pulse wave parameters including the harmonic regression wave amplitude (HRWa). The pulse wave attenuation was measured under different ranges of induced intraocular pressure (IOPi), as a function of distance along the vessel (VDist). Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured using lumbar puncture. A linear mixed-effects model was used to estimate the correlations between the Yeo-Johnson transformed harmonic regression wave amplitude (HRWa-YJt) with the predictors (IOPi, VDist and ICP). A comparison of the model coefficients was done by calculating the weighted Beta (βx) coefficients.The median HRWa in the ICPn group was higher in the retinal veins (4.563, interquartile range (IQR) = 3.656) compared to the retinal arteries (3.475, IQR = 2.458), p<0.0001. In contrast, the ICPh group demonstrated a reduction in the median venous HRWa (3.655, IQR = 3.223) and an elevation in the median arterial HRWa (3.616, IQR = 2.715), p<0.0001. Interactions of the pulsation amplitude with ICP showed a significant disordinal interaction and the loss of a main effect of the Fourier sine coefficient (bn1) in the ICPh group, suggesting that this coefficient reflects the retinal vascular response to ICP wave. The linear mixed-effects model (LME) showed the decay in the venous (HRWa-YJt) was almost twice that in the retinal arteries (-0.067±0.002 compared to -0.028±0.0021 respectively, p<0.00001). The overall interaction models had a total explanatory power of (conditional R2) 38.7%, and 42% of which the fixed effects explained 8.8%, and 5.8% of the variance (marginal R2) for the venous and arterial models respectively. A comparison of the damping effect of VDist and ICP showed that ICP had less influence on pulse decay than distance in the retinal arteries (βICP = -0.21, se = ±0.017 compared to [Formula: see text], se = ±0.019), whereas the mean value was equal for the retinal veins (venous [Formula: see text], se = ±0.015, βICP = -0.42, se = ±0.019).The retinal vascular pulsation characteristics in the ICPh group showed high retinal arterial and low venous pulsation amplitudes. Interactions between retinal vascular pulsation amplitude and ICP suggest that the Fourier sine coefficient bn1 reflects the retinal vascular response to the ICP wave. Although a matrix of regression lines showed high linear characteristics, the low model explanatory power precludes its use as a predictor of ICP. These results may guide future predictive modelling in non-invasive estimation of ICP using modified photoplethysmography."
https://openalex.org/W4283690622,"Photoreceptors consume glucose supplied by the choriocapillaris to support phototransduction and outer segment (OS) renewal. Reduced glucose supply underlies photoreceptor cell death in inherited retinal degeneration and age-related retinal disease. We have previously shown that restricting glucose transport into the outer retina by conditional deletion of Slc2a1 encoding GLUT1 resulted in photoreceptor loss and impaired OS renewal. However, retinal neurons, glia, and the retinal pigment epithelium play specialized, synergistic roles in metabolite supply and exchange, and the cell-specific map of glucose uptake and utilization in the retina is incomplete. In these studies, we conditionally deleted Slc2a1 in a pan-retinal or rod-specific manner to better understand how glucose is utilized in the retina. Using non-invasive ocular imaging, electroretinography, and histochemical and biochemical analyses we show that genetic deletion of Slc2a1 from retinal neurons and Müller glia results in reduced OS growth and progressive rod but not cone photoreceptor cell death. Rhodopsin levels were severely decreased even at postnatal day 20 when OS length was relatively normal. Arrestin levels were not changed suggesting that glucose uptake is required to synthesize membrane glycoproteins. Rod-specific deletion of Slc2a1 resulted in similar changes in OS length and rod photoreceptor cell death. These studies demonstrate that glucose is an essential carbon source for rod photoreceptor cell OS maintenance and viability."

This study aimed to evaluate knowledge about breast cancer and both practices and perceived barriers to breast self-examination among female university students in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 400 female students of Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh. Participants were sampled from female dormitories at the university from January to April 2020. Proportionate stratified random sampling was conducted to calculate the study sample from each dormitory. A validated semi-structured self-reported questionnaire was employed to collect data from participants during the survey periods. The questionnaire consisted of demographic variables, items about knowledge about breast cancer, breast self-examination practices and its barriers. We applied descriptive and inferential statistics and data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Participants were aged between 18-26 years and comprised university students of first year (20%), second year (24%), third year (22%), fourth year (21%) and Master's (14%). 18% of them reported positive family history (mother, aunt, sister/cousin, grandmother) of breast cancer. The overall mean score of total knowledge items was 15 (SD = 3) out of 43, with an overall correct rate of 34%. The mean score of total knowledge items was significantly higher (p<0.001) among Master's students and students with family members who have had breast cancer. Only one in five students (21%) ever practiced breast self-examination. The mean score of practice of breast self-examination was significantly higher (p<0.001) among participants who reported having family member of breast cancer. Total knowledge score about breast cancer and practice of breast self-examination were significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.54; p<0.001). About 33% participants reported 'lack of knowledge' as the main barrier to practicing breast self-examination followed by 'I do not have the symptoms' (22%), and 'shyness/ uncomfortable feelings' (17%). The study revealed low levels of knowledge about breast cancer and low breast self-examination practices. Our findings highlight the need to develop, implement and promote socially, culturally and demographically appropriate educational interventions programs aimed at breast cancer and breast self-examination awareness and practice in Bangladesh."

https://openalex.org/W4283690856,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in blood. Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted the link between both diseases; it is even considered that DM might be a risk factor for PD. To further investigate the likely relation of these diseases, we have used a Drosophila PD model based on inactivation of the DJ-1β gene (ortholog of human DJ-1), and diet-induced Drosophila and mouse type 2 DM (T2DM) models, together with human neuron-like cells. T2DM models were obtained by feeding flies with a high sugar-containing medium, and mice with a high fat diet. Our results showed that both fly models exhibit common phenotypes such as alterations in carbohydrate homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction or motor defects, among others. In addition, we demonstrated that T2DM might be a risk factor of developing PD since our diet-induced fly and mouse T2DM models present DA neuron dysfunction, a hallmark of PD. We also confirmed that neurodegeneration is caused by increased glucose levels, which has detrimental effects in human neuron-like cells by triggering apoptosis and leading to cell death. Besides, the observed phenotypes were exacerbated in DJ-1β mutants cultured in the high sugar medium, indicating that DJ-1 might have a role in carbohydrate homeostasis. Finally, we have confirmed that metformin, an antidiabetic drug, is a potential candidate for PD treatment and that it could prevent PD onset in T2DM model flies. This result supports antidiabetic compounds as promising PD therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4283699396,"CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) is a powerful tool for investigating complex biological phenomena. Although CRISPRa approaches based on the VP64 transcriptional activator have been widely studied in both cultured cells and in animal models and exhibit great versatility for various cell types and developmental stages in vivo, different dCas9-VP64 versions have not been rigorously compared. Here, we compared different dCas9-VP64 constructs in identical contexts, including the cell lines used and the transfection conditions, for their ability to activate endogenous and exogenous genes. Moreover, we investigated the optimal approach for VP64 addition to VP64- and p300-based constructs. We found that MS2-MCP-scaffolded VP64 enhanced basal dCas9-VP64 and dCas9-p300 activity better than did direct VP64 fusion to the N-terminus of dCas9. dCas9-VP64+MCP-VP64 and dCas9-p300+MCP-VP64 were superior to VP64-dCas9-VP64 for all target genes tested. Furthermore, multiplexing gRNA expression with dCas9-VP64+MCP-VP64 or dCas9-p300+MCP-VP64 significantly enhanced endogenous gene activation to a level comparable to CRISPRa-SAM with a single gRNA. Our findings demonstrate improvement of the dCas9-VP64 CRISPRa system and contribute to development of a versatile, efficient CRISPRa platform."

Analyses used RDS-II estimation.Mean age in 2013 and 2016 was 31 and 33 years, with 27% and 17% aged 18-24 years. Overall HIV prevalence was 59% at each timepoint, and 35% and 36% among younger FSW. From 2013 to 2016 there was an increase in young HIV-positive FSW knowing their status (38% vs 60%, OR = 2.51, p<0.01). Outcomes for all FSW improved significantly over time at all steps of the cascade, and the relative change over time was similar among older versus younger FSW for most cascade variables.Young FSW had improvements in care cascade outcomes, and proportionate improvements similar to older FSW, yet they remain less engaged in services overall. This implies that the dedicated FSW services in Zimbabwe are having a comparably positive impact across age groups, however more is likely required to address young FSW's unique vulnerabilities and needs."

It is of great significance to conduct ecological security assessments in rapidly urbanization areas. Based on the driving forces, pressure, state, impact, and response (DPSIR) model, five years (1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015) of remote sensing images, social and economic statistics, and field survey data were used to establish an ecological security assessment index system. The ecological security assessment of central Yunnan Province (CYP) urban agglomeration was conducted at the 1 km × 1 km pixel scale and at the county scale based on the multilevel weighted comprehensive index method. The results showed that: (1) With 2005 as the turning point, the ecological security situation in CYP first decreased and then increased. (2) The ecological security at the county scale was mainly categorized as unsafe. At the pixel scale, ecologically unsafe and relatively unsafe areas were mainly distributed in central, northern, and western CYP. (3) The ecological security deterioration and strengthened spatial distribution differences were caused by habitat fragmentation, different physical geographical conditions, and population agglomeration. These results can provide a basis for the coordination and sustainability of economic development and environmental protection in urban agglomerations with rapid urbanization."
https://openalex.org/W4285611927,"Telemedicine utilization increased significantly in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is concern that disadvantaged groups face barriers to access based on single-center studies. Whether there has been equitable access to telemedicine services across the US and during later parts of the pandemic is unclear. This study retrospectively analyzes outpatient medical encounters for patients 18 years of age and older using Healthjump-a national electronic medical record database-from March 1 to December 31, 2020. A mixed effects multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the association between telemedicine utilization and patient and area-level factors and the odds of having at least one telemedicine encounter during the study period. Among 1,999,534 unique patients 21.6% had a telemedicine encounter during the study period. In the multivariable model, age [OR = 0.995 (95% CI 0.993, 0.997); p<0.001], non-Hispanic Black race [OR = 0.88 (95% CI 0.84, 0.93); p<0.001], and English as primary language [OR = 0.78 (95% CI 0.74, 0.83); p<0.001] were associated with a lower odds of telemedicine utilization. Female gender [OR = 1.24 (95% CI 1.22, 1.27); p<0.001], Hispanic ethnicity or non-Hispanic other race [OR = 1.40 (95% CI 1.33, 1.46);p<0.001 and 1.29 (95% CI 1.20, 1.38); p<0.001, respectively] were associated with a higher odds of telemedicine utilization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, utilization of telemedicine differed significantly among patient groups, with older and non-Hispanic Black patients less likely to have telemedicine encounters. These findings are relevant for ongoing efforts regarding the nature of telemedicine as the COVID-19 pandemic ends."
https://openalex.org/W4283650730,"Many countries, such as Germany, struggle to vaccinate enough people against COVID-19 despite the availability of safe and efficient vaccines. With new variants emerging and the need for booster vaccinations, overcoming vaccination hesitancy gains importance. The research to date has revealed some promising, albeit contentious, interventions to increase vaccination intention. However, these have yet to be tested for their effectiveness in increasing vaccination rates.We conducted a preregistered survey experiment with N = 1,324 participants in Germany in May/June 2021. This was followed by a series of emails reminding participants to get vaccinated in August and concluded with a follow-up survey in September. We experimentally assess whether debunking vaccination myths, highlighting the benefits of being vaccinated, or sending vaccination reminders decreases hesitancy. In the survey experiment, we find no increase in the intention to vaccinate regardless of the information provided. However, communicating vaccination benefits over several weeks reduced the likelihood of not being vaccinated by 9 percentage points, which translates into a 27% reduction compared to the control group. Debunking vaccination myths and reminders alone also decreased the likelihood, yet not significantly.Our findings suggest that if soft governmental interventions such as information campaigns are employed, highlighting benefits should be given preference over debunking vaccination myths. Furthermore, it seems that repeated messages affect vaccination action while one-time messages might be insufficient, even for increasing vaccination intentions. Our study highlights the importance of testing interventions outside of survey experiments that are limited to measuring vaccination intentions-not actions-and immediate changes in attitudes and intentions-not long-term changes."
https://openalex.org/W4283651105,"Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry that seriously impacts the strawberry industry. To prevent the spread of anthracnose through symptomless plants, it is important to detect pathogenic Colletotrichum spp. at the latent infection stage in the nursery. Previous PCR-based methods developed for the diagnosis or detection of Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides have used primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA, β-tubulin gene, or mating type gene. In this study, to specifically detect Colletotrichum siamense and Colletotrichum fructicola , the most predominant and virulent Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, we conducted a comparative genomics analysis of 29 Colletotrichum spp. and identified a non-conserved 1157-bp intergenic region suitable for designing specific primers for a nested PCR assay. In silico analysis and actual tests suggested that the new nested PCR assay could detect pathogenic C . siamense and C . fructicola , but not other strawberry pathogens ( Botrytis sp., Fusarium spp., Neopestalotiopsis rosae , and Phytophthora sp.) or ubiquitous saprophytes ( Fusarium spp. and Trichoderma spp.). The inner to outer primer ratio was optimized to 1:10 to eliminate unexpected bands and enhance the signal. The assay could detect as little as 1 pg of C . siamense genomic DNA, which corresponds to ~15 cells. Application of the new detection assay on 747 leaf samples collected from 18 strawberry nurseries in 2019 and 2020 showed that an average of 20% of strawberry mother plants in Taiwan were latently infected by C . siamense or C . fructicola . The newly developed assay is being applied to facilitate the production of healthy strawberry runner plants in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W4283655674,"Suppressing the elevation in core body temperature is an important factor in preventing heatstroke. However, there is still no non-invasive method to sense core body temperature. This study proposed an algorithm that estimates core body temperature based on electrocardiogram signals. A total of 12 healthy men (mean age ± SD = 39.6 ± 13.4) performed an ergometric exercise load test under two conditions of exercise load in an environmental chamber adjusted to a temperature of 35°C and humidity of 50%. Vital sensing data such as electrocardiograms, core body temperatures, and body surface temperatures were continuously measured, and physical data such as body weight were obtained from participants pre- and post-experiment. According to basic physiological knowledge, heart rate and body temperature are closely related. We analyzed the relationship between core body temperature and several indexes obtained from electrocardiograms and found that the amount of change in core body temperature had a strong relationship with analyzed data from electrocardiograms. Based on these findings, we developed the amount of change in core body temperature estimation model using multiple regression analysis including the Poincaré plot index of the ECG R-R interval. The estimation model showed an average estimation error of -0.007°C (average error rate = -0.02%) and an error range of 0.457-0.445°C. It is suggested that continuous core body temperature change can be estimated using electrocardiogram signals regardless of individual characteristics such as age and physique. Based on this applicable estimation model, we plan to enhance estimation accuracy and further verify efficacy by considering clothing and environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4283706721,"Scene perception involves extracting the identities of the objects comprising a scene in conjunction with their configuration (the spatial layout of the objects in the scene). How object identity and configuration information is weighted during scene processing and how this weighting evolves over the course of scene processing however, is not fully understood. Recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their aptitude at scene processing tasks and identified correlations between processing in CNNs and in the human brain. Here we examined four CNN architectures (Alexnet, Resnet18, Resnet50, Densenet161) and their sensitivity to changes in object and configuration information over the course of scene processing. Despite differences among the four CNN architectures, across all CNNs, we observed a common pattern in the CNN’s response to object identity and configuration changes. Each CNN demonstrated greater sensitivity to configuration changes in early stages of processing and stronger sensitivity to object identity changes in later stages. This pattern persists regardless of the spatial structure present in the image background, the accuracy of the CNN in classifying the scene, and even the task used to train the CNN. Importantly, CNNs’ sensitivity to a configuration change is not the same as their sensitivity to any type of position change, such as that induced by a uniform translation of the objects without a configuration change. These results provide one of the first documentations of how object identity and configuration information are weighted in CNNs during scene processing."
https://openalex.org/W4283640360,"Across rural sub-Saharan Africa, people living with HIV (PLHIV) commonly seek out treatment from traditional healers. We report on the clinical outcomes of a community health worker intervention adapted for traditional healers with insight into our results from qualitative interviews. We employed a pre-post intervention study design and used sequential mixed methods to assess the impact of a traditional healer support worker intervention in Zambézia province, Mozambique. After receiving a positive test result, 276 participants who were newly enrolled in HIV treatment and were interested in receiving home-based support from a traditional healer were recruited into the study. Those who enrolled from February 2016 to August 2016 received standard of care services, while those who enrolled from June 2017 to May 2018 received support from a traditional healer. We conducted interviews among healers and participants to gain insight into fidelity of study activities, barriers to support, and program improvement. Medication possession ratio at home (based on pharmacy pick-up dates) was not significantly different between pre- and post-intervention participants (0.80 in the pre-intervention group compared to 0.79 in the post-intervention group; p = 0.96). Participants reported receiving educational and psychosocial support from healers. Healers adapted their support protocol to initiate directly observed therapy among participants with poor adherence. Traditional healers can provide community-based psychosocial support, education, directly observed therapy, and disclosure assistance for PLHIV. Multiple factors may hinder patients' desire and ability to remain adherent to treatment, including poverty, confusion about medication side effects, and frustration with wait times at the health facility."
https://openalex.org/W4283652782,"Covid-19 progression shows sex-dependent features. It is hypothesized that a better Covid-19 survival rate in females can be attributed to the presence of higher 17β-estradiol (E2) levels in women than in men. Virus SARS-CoV-2 is enabled to enter the cell with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The expression of several renin-angiotensin system components has been shown to exert a rhythmic pattern, and a role of the circadian system in their regulation has been implicated. Therefore, the aim of the study is to elucidate possible interference between E2 signalling and the circadian system in the regulation of the expression of ACE2 mRNA and functionally related molecules. E2 was administered at a dosage of 40 μg/kg/day for 7 days to male Wistar rats, and sampling of the lungs and colon was performed during a 24-h cycle. The daily pattern of expression of molecules facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell, clock genes and E2 receptors was analysed. As a consequence of E2 administration, a rhythm in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression was observed in the lungs but not in the colon. ADAM17 mRNA expression showed a pronounced rhythmic pattern in both tissues that was not influenced by E2 treatment. ESR1 mRNA expression exerted a rhythmic pattern, which was diminished by E2 treatment. The influence of E2 administration on ESR2 and GPER1 mRNA expression was greater in the lungs than in the colon as a significant rhythm in ESR2 and GPER1 mRNA expression appeared only in the lungs after E2 treatment. E2 administration also increased the amplitude of bmal1 expression in the lungs, which implicates altered functioning of peripheral oscillators in response to E2 treatment. The daily pattern of components of the SARS-CoV-2 entrance pathway and their responsiveness to E2 should be considered in the timing of pharmacological therapy for Covid-19."
https://openalex.org/W4283659008,"Aims Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension are at high risk of developing complications such as variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and cardiac dysfunction, the latter of which is known as cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Since non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) may aggravate hemodynamic complications we investigated the effect of real-time propranolol infusion on cardiac function in patients with varying degrees of cirrhosis. Methods Thirty-eight patients with Child-Pugh A (n = 17), B (n = 17) and C (n = 4) underwent liver vein catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed the effect of real-time propranolol infusion on the hepatic venous pressure gradient, cardiac index, stroke volume, ejection fraction, heart rate, and contractility. Results Nineteen patients were classified as responders to beta-blocker therapy. In pooling Child-Pugh B and C patients, the reduction in cardiac index by beta-blockade was weaker than in Child-Pugh A patients (-8.5% vs. -20.5%, p = 0.043). The effect of NSBB on portal pressure was inversely correlated to changes in the left atrium where the left atrial volume changed by 4 mL±18 in responders compared to 15 mL±11 in non-responders ( p = 0.03). Finally, the baseline ejection fraction correlated inversely with the reduction in portal pressure ( r = -0.39, p = 0.02). Conclusion We found the effect of beta-blockade on cardiac index in patients with advanced cirrhosis to be less potent than in patients with early cirrhosis, indicating that underlying cirrhotic cardiomyopathy increases, and the cardiac compensatory reserve becomes more compromised, with disease progression. The differential effects of beta-blockade in the left atrium may be used to predict the effect of beta-blockers on portal pressure, but further studies are needed to investigate this possibility."

https://openalex.org/W4283689301,"The US is currently experiencing a return to raising domestic pigs outdoors, due to consumer demand for sustainably-raised animal products. A challenge in raising pigs outdoors is the possibility of these animals interacting with feral pigs and an associated risk of pathogen transmission. California has one of the largest and widest geographic distributions of feral pigs. Locations at greatest risk for increased contact between both swine populations are those regions that contain feral pig suitable habitat located near outdoor-raised domestic pigs. The main aim of this study entailed identifying potential high-risk areas of disease transmission between these two swine populations. Aims were achieved by predicting suitable feral pig habitat using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt); mapping the spatial distribution of outdoor-raised pig operations (OPO); and identifying high-risk regions where there is overlap between feral pig suitable habitat and OPO. A MaxEnt prediction map with estimates of the relative probability of suitable feral pig habitat was built, using hunting tags as presence-only points. Predictor layers were included in variable selection steps for model building. Five variables were identified as important in predicting suitable feral pig habitat in the final model, including the annual maximum green vegetation fraction, elevation, the minimum temperature of the coldest month, precipitation of the wettest month and the coefficient of variation for seasonal precipitation. For the risk map, the final MaxEnt model was overlapped with the location of OPOs to categorize areas at greatest risk for contact between feral swine and domestic pigs raised outdoors and subsequent potential disease transmission. Since raising pigs outdoors is a remerging trend, feral pig numbers are increasing nationwide, and both groups are reservoirs for various pathogens, the contact between these two swine populations has important implications for disease transmission in the wildlife-livestock interface."

Our health care system has to deal with a high level of sick leave of health care workers (HCWs) with COVID-19 related complaints, in whom an infection with SARS-CoV-2 has to be ruled out before they can return back to work. The aim of the present study is to investigate if the recently described CoLab-algorithm can be used to exclude COVID-19 in a screening setting of HCWs.In the period from January 2021 till March 2021, HCWs with COVID-19-related complaints were prospectively collected and included in this study. Next to the routinely performed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, using a set of naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples, two blood tubes (one EDTA- and one heparin-tube) were drawn for analysing the 10 laboratory parameters required for running the CoLab-algorithm.In total, 726 HCWs with a complete CoLab-laboratory panel were included in this study. In this group, 684 HCWs were tested SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative and 42 cases RT-PCR positive. ROC curve analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.853 (95% CI: 0.801-0.904). At a safe cut-off value for excluding COVID-19 of -6.525, the sensitivity was 100% with a specificity of 34% (95% CI: 21 to 49%). No SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cases were missed with this cut-off and COVID-19 could be safely ruled out in more than one third of HCWs.The CoLab-score is an easy and reliable algorithm that can be used for screening HCWs with COVID-19 related complaints. A major advantage of this approach is that the results of the score are available within 1 hour after collecting the samples. This results in a faster return to labour process of a large part of the COVID-19 negative HCWs (34%), next to a reduction in RT-PCR tests (reagents and labour costs) that can be saved."
https://openalex.org/W4283701209,"Lumbar radiography is a primary screening tool for lumbar spondylosis (LS). Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) classification is widely used to evaluate LS; however, it cannot individually evaluate each radiographic feature. The purpose of this study was to 1) evaluate radiographic LS using a novel elemental grading system and 2) investigate the relationship between the grades of radiographic LS and low back pain (LBP) in a population-based cohort study.A total of 260 (75 men, 185 women; mean age, 71.5 ± 8.7 years) participants were included in this study. Participants were divided into two groups according to the presence of LBP (LBP- and LBP+ groups). Radiographic features, including osteophyte (OP), disc height narrowing (DHN), vertebral sclerosis (VS), and spondylolisthesis (SL), were classified between grades of 0-2 grades according to the extent of radiographic changes. The sum of grades at each intervertebral level was designated as the intervertebral grade (IG).Intra- and inter-observer reliability (kappa coefficient) of OP, DHN, VS, and SL were 0.82-0.92. OP, DHN, VS, and IG grades were significantly higher in the LBP+ group than in the LBP- group. There were no significant differences in KL grades between the LBP- and LBP+ groups. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that VS grade was a significant independent factor associated with LBP.The novel elemental grading system of LS would reflect LBP more accurately than the KL classification by individually evaluating each radiographic feature."

Here we present a skeletal and cardiac muscle specific TK2 knockout mouse (mTk2 KO). The mice showed dilated hearts and markedly reduced adipose tissue during week 12 to 16. A severe decrease of mtDNA was found only in skeletal muscle and heart tissue in mTk2 KO mice. Expression analysis of key metabolic genes of 16 weeks knockout mice showed significant changes of genes involved in lipid metabolism, with different patterns in heart and skeletal muscle. Our study further suggests that lipoprotein lipase (LPL) from liver supports the metabolism when heart and skeletal muscle were impaired due to mitochondrial dysfunction. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is involved in glucose homeostasis, was also affected by mtDNA deficiency in our study. Interestingly, both the gene and protein expression of ACE2 were increased in cardiac tissue of mTk2 KO mice. Since ACE2 is a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its regulation in relation to mitochondrial function may have important clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W4283705163,"Purpose Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is the mainstay treatment in advanced prostate cancer. We conducted a nationwide population-based study to evaluate the association of ADT and cardiovascular diseases. Methods Between 2005 and 2009, patient data from the National Health Insurance database were obtained. We divided newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients into four groups, injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists, oral antiandrogens, orchiectomy and radical prostatectomy only. Another matched non-cancerous control group was also assigned for comparison purposes. Study outcomes were newly onset Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and hospital admissions. Multi-variant Cox proportional regression analysis and the Kaplan–Meier method for cumulative incidence were performed. Results A total of 17,147 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients were found. After exclusion criteria was considered, the 2,565 remaining patients were then divided into 1,088 subjects in the injection group, 286 in the orchiectomy group, 812 in the oral group and 379 in the radical prostatectomy only group. The mean age of all the patients was 71.2 years. Multi-variant analysis showed a significantly increased risk of CVD in the injection group, orchiectomy group, oral group and radical prostatectomy group (HR = 2.94, 95% CI 2.51 to 3.45, p&lt;0.001, HR = 3.43, 95% CI 2.69 to 4.36, p&lt;0.001, HR = 2.87, 95% CI 2.42 to 3.39, p&lt;0.001, HR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.48, p&lt;0.001, respectively). A time dependent increased risk of CVD was also observed amongst the study groups (p&lt;0.001). Conclusions ADT is associated with an increased risk of CVD. For long-term prostate cancer castration therapy, doctors should be aware of this complication and arrange for proper management."

This study explored the accumulations of F . suspensa metabolites by performing widely targeted metabolomic analysis. The metabolites were studied at four stages of fruit development. Metabolites in the fruits and leaves of F . suspensa during fruit development included phenolic acids, flavonoids, lipids, lignans and coumarins, amino acids and their derivatives, terpenes, organic acids, nucleotides and their derivatives, alkaloids, quinones, steroids, and tannins. Fourteen Forsythia related metabolites were detected. Their contents varied among the developmental stages. Statistically significant correlations were found between the levels of forsythoside B and 11-methyl-forsythide, and forsythialan B and phillygenin, in both leaves and fruits. According to the correlation analysis between metabolites, Forsythia related metabolites were divided into two classes and five subclasses. In total, 33 compounds presented significant correlations in both fruits and leaves, which indicated the potential relationship in the synthesis of Forsythia related metabolites. Forsythialan B and phillygenin were both negatively correlated with L-valine, while Z-6,7-epoxyligustilid was positively correlated with both compounds. The quality control compounds forsythiaside A and phillyrin were positively and negatively correlated with uracil, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W4285505999,"Culex pipiens complex is an important vector of epizootic and zoonotic pathogens, including West Nile virus. Chicago, Illinois and its suburbs have suffered high incidence of human West Nile virus infections in the past. This makes abatement programs in and around the Chicago area an essential service. The control of Cx. pipiens is often complicated by rapidly evolving resistance to pyrethroids, which are the most widely used chemical class in US mosquito abatement programs. The present study assessed Sumithrin® resistance in Cx. pipiens collected from five locations around Cook County, Illinois, neighboring the city limits of Chicago. According to CDC guidelines, samples from all five locations demonstrated some resistance to Sumithrin®. When assessed with Anvil®, a formulated product made of Sumithrin® synergized with piperonyl butoxide, susceptibility was rescued in mosquitoes from three out of the five locations, suggesting involvement of mixed-function oxidases and/or carboxylesterases in Sumithrin® resistance at these locations. Not all locations had susceptibility rescued by Anvil®, but these locations had relatively low knockdown resistance allele frequencies, suggesting that mechanisms other than knockdown resistance may be involved. Enzyme activities did not reveal any marked trends that could be related back to mortality in the bottle bioassays, which highlights the need for multiple types of assays to infer enzymatic involvement in resistance. Future directions in pyrethroid resistance management in Chicago area Cx. pipiens are discussed."

Mixed models with a random intercept for Upper Tier Local Authority were analysed as quasibinomial Generalized Additive Models. The estimated random effects were then fitted with Bayesian linear mixed models using flu vaccination uptake, change in public health budgets, population proportion of vaccination sites at pharmacies, GP-led, vaccination centres, and hospital hubs, and Region.Models for the MSOA-level COVID-19 first and second vaccinations and the Third Injection (including the booster), fit well. Index of Multiple Deprivation, proportion Aged 15-24 and 25-44, and ethnicity groupings Other White, Indian-Pakistani-Bangladeshi, and African-Caribbean-Other Black-Other, are highly significant predictors of lower uptake. The estimated random effects vary widely amongst local authorities, with positive impact of flu vaccine uptake and change in public health budgets, and regional impacts which are positive for London and South East (first and second doses only), and negative for North West and North East. The impact of vaccination sites did not reach 90% credibility, in general.COVID-19 vaccination rates at each stage are very well modelled if local authority random effects are included along with non-linear terms for demographic, employment and health data. Deprivation, younger age, and Other White, South Asian, and African-Caribbean-Other ethnicities are associated with lower uptake. The estimated local effects show strong regional variation and are positively associated with flu vaccination and increasing public health budgets. One simple way to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake in England would be to increase local public health allocations."
https://openalex.org/W4283446712,"Lipoic acid is a sulfur-containing cofactor indispensable for the function of several metabolic enzymes. In microorganisms, lipoic acid can be salvaged from the surroundings by lipoate protein ligase A (LplA), an ATP-dependent enzyme. Alternatively, it can be synthesized by the sequential actions of lipoate protein ligase B (LipB) and lipoyl synthase (LipA). LipB takes up the octanoyl chain from C8-acyl carrier protein (C8-ACP), a byproduct of the type II fatty acid synthesis pathway, and transfers it to a conserved lysine of the lipoyl domain of a dehydrogenase. However, the molecular basis of its substrate recognition is still not fully understood. Using Escherichia coli LipB as a model enzyme, we show here that the octanoyl-transferase mainly recognizes the 4'-phosphopantetheine-tethered acyl-chain of its donor substrate and weakly binds the apo-acyl carrier protein. We demonstrate LipB can accept octanoate from its own ACP and noncognate ACPs, as well as C8-CoA. Furthermore, our 1H saturation transfer difference and 31P NMR studies demonstrate the binding of adenosine, as well as the phosphopantetheine arm of CoA to LipB, akin to binding to LplA. Finally, we show a conserved 71RGG73 loop, analogous to the lipoate-binding loop of LplA, is required for full LipB activity. Collectively, our studies highlight commonalities between LipB and LplA in their mechanism of substrate recognition. This knowledge could be of significance in the treatment of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4283456905,"Macrophages respond to their environment by adopting a predominantly inflammatory or anti-inflammatory profile, depending on the context. The polarization of the subsequent response is regulated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic signals and is associated with alterations in macrophage metabolism. Although macrophages are important producers of Wnt ligands, the role of Wnt signaling in regulating metabolic changes associated with macrophage polarization remains unclear. Wnt4 upregulation has been shown to be associated with tissue repair and suppression of age-associated inflammation, which led us to generate Wnt4-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages to investigate its role in metabolism. We show that loss of Wnt4 led to modified mitochondrial structure, enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, and depleted intracellular lipid reserves, as the cells depended on fatty acid oxidation to fuel their mitochondria. Further we found that enhanced lipolysis was dependent on protein kinase C-mediated activation of lysosomal acid lipase in Wnt4-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages. Although not irreversible, these metabolic changes promoted parasite survival during infection with Leishmania donovani. In conclusion, our results indicate that enhanced macrophage fatty acid oxidation impairs the control of intracellular pathogens, such as Leishmania. We further suggest that Wnt4 may represent a potential target in atherosclerosis, which is characterized by lipid storage in macrophages leading to them becoming foam cells."
https://openalex.org/W4283511914,"Fluorescent pseudomonads such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Pseudomonas fluorescens produce pyoverdine siderophores that ensure iron-supply in iron-limited environments. After its synthesis in the cytoplasm, the nonfluorescent pyoverdine precursor ferribactin is exported into the periplasm, where the enzymes PvdQ, PvdP, PvdO, PvdN, and PtaA are responsible for fluorophore maturation and tailoring steps. While the roles of all these enzymes are clear, little is known about the role of PvdM, a human renal dipeptidase-related protein that is predicted to be periplasmic and that is essential for pyoverdine biogenesis. Here, we reveal the subcellular localization and functional role of PvdM. Using the model organism P. fluorescens, we show that PvdM is anchored to the periplasmic side of the cytoplasmic membrane, where it is indispensable for the activity of the tyrosinase PvdP. While PvdM does not share the metallopeptidase function of renal dipeptidase, it still has the corresponding peptide-binding site. The substrate of PvdP, deacylated ferribactin, is secreted by a ΔpvdM mutant strain, indicating that PvdM prevents loss of this periplasmic biosynthesis intermediate into the medium by ensuring the efficient transfer of ferribactin to PvdP in vivo. We propose that PvdM belongs to a new dipeptidase-related protein subfamily with inactivated Zn2+ coordination sites, members of which are usually genetically linked to TonB-dependent uptake systems and often associated with periplasmic FAD-dependent oxidoreductases related to d-amino acid oxidases. We suggest that these proteins are necessary for selective binding, exposure, or transfer of specific d- and l-amino acid-containing peptides and other periplasmic biomolecules in manifold pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4283645281,"Learning objectives (LOs) are a common tool used to define learning goals and guide curricula. As the field of global health has expanded, more rigorous and tailored approaches to effectively teach the next generation of the workforce are needed. The STAR project developed and utilized individualized LOs as the basis for on-the-job learning plans for senior global health leaders from low- and middle-income countries and from the US.We analyzed basic demographic information and LOs from 36 STAR fellows. Descriptive statistics provided an overview of the STAR fellows, competency areas and planned outputs of their LOs. We utilized qualitative thematic analysis to further explore the LOs themselves.STAR fellows were based in the US and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The majority had over 10 years of experience and at least one advanced degree. Fellows commonly worked on LOs related to capacity strengthening, communications, and development practice. Capacity strengthening LOs focused on mentorship, decision-making, and technical skills such as data analysis. Communications LOs focused on language skills, dissemination of information, and writing. Development practice LOs included gaining understanding of key stakeholders in global health and building effective partnerships and teams.Our experience developing tailored LOs provided deeper understanding of diverse learning needs of global health leaders. While not representative of all global health learners, we captured priorities of senior US- and LMIC-based leaders and identified common themes for learning. Despite the labor required to tailor curricula in this way, more global health education programs can benefit by integrating similar processes."
https://openalex.org/W4283651944,"Southern China is at risk for arborvirus disease transmission, including Zika virus and dengue. Patients often present to clinical care with non-specific acute febrile illnesses (AFI). To better describe the etiology of AFI, we implemented a two-year AFI surveillance project at five sentinel hospitals in Yunnan and Guangdong Provinces.Between June 2017 and August 2019, we enrolled patients between 2 and 65 years of age presenting at one sentinel hospital in Mengla County, Yunnan, and four in Jiangmen City, Guangdong, with symptoms of AFI (acute onset of fever ≥ 37.5°C within the past 7 days) without respiratory symptoms or diarrhea. Demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical information was obtained and entered into a web-based AFI surveillance database. A custom TaqMan Array card (TAC) was used to test patients' whole blood specimens for 27 different pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays.During the two-year project period, 836 patients were enrolled; 443 patients from Mengla County and 393 patients from Jiangmen City. The median age was 33 years [range: 2-65], and most were hospitalized [641, 77%]. Of 796 patients with valid TAC results, 341 (43%) were positive for at least one of the 10 unique pathogens detected. This included 205 (26%) patients positive for dengue virus, 60 (8%) for Orientia tsutsugamushi, and 42 (5%) for Coxiella burnetii. Ten patients (1%) in Jiangmen City tested positive for malaria, 8 of whom reported recent travel outside of China. TAC results were negative for 455 (57%) patients. None of the patients had a positive TAC detection for Zika virus.The project detected variability in the etiology of AFI in Southern China and highlighted the importance of differential diagnosis. Dengue, O. tsutsugamushi, and C. burnetii were the most frequently identified pathogens among enrolled AFI patients. As a non-notifiable disease, the frequent detection of C. burnetii is noteworthy and warrants additional investigation. The project provided a framework for routine surveillance for persons presenting with AFI."

https://openalex.org/W4283694653,"Proteoglycan glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains are attached to a serine residue in the protein through a linkage series of sugars, the first of which is xylose. Xylosides are chemicals which compete with the xylose at the enzyme xylosyl transferase to prevent the attachment of GAG chains to proteins. These compounds have been employed at concentrations in the millimolar range as tools to study the role of GAG chains in proteoglycan function. In the course of our studies with xylosides, we conducted a dose-response curve for xyloside actions on neural cells. To our surprise, we found that concentrations of xylosides in the nanomolar to micromolar range had major effects on cell morphology of hippocampal neurons as well as of Neuro2a cells, affecting both actin and tubulin cytoskeletal dynamics. Such effects/morphological changes were not observed with higher xyloside concentrations. We found a dose-dependent alteration of GAG secretion by Neuro2a cells; however, concentrations of xylosides which were effective in altering neuronal morphology did not cause a large change in the rate of GAG chain secretion. In contrast, both low and high concentrations of xylosides altered HS and CS composition. RNAseq of treated cells demonstrated alterations in gene expression only after treatment with millimolar concentration of xylosides that had no effect on cell morphology. These observations support a novel action of xylosides on neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W4283695419,"We explore potential cross-informant discrepancies between child- and parent-report measures with an example of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self Report (YSR), parent- and self-report measures on children’s behavioral and emotional problems. We propose a new way of examining the parent- and child-report differences with an interaction map estimated using a Latent Space Item Response Model (LSIRM). The interaction map enables the investigation of the dependency between items, between respondents, and between items and respondents, which is not possible with the conventional approach. The LSIRM captures the differential positions of items and respondents in the latent spaces for CBCL and YSR and identifies the relationships between each respondent and item according to their dependent structures. The results suggest that the analysis of item response in the latent space using the LSIRM is beneficial in uncovering the differential structures embedded in the response data obtained from different perspectives in children and their parents. This study also argues that the differential hidden structures of children and parents’ responses should be taken together to evaluate children’s behavioral problems."
https://openalex.org/W4283698670,"Although combat has been found to be associated with adverse health outcomes, little is known about the impact of specific combat exposures, particularly among specialized personnel. This study examined the association of different types of combat exposures with behavioral health outcomes, and whether these associations differed by Army occupational specialization: General Purpose Forces infantrymen (n = 5,361), Ranger Qualified infantrymen (n = 308), and Special Forces personnel (n = 593). Multivariable regression models estimated the association of combat severity, type of combat event (fighting, killing, threat to oneself, death/injury of others), and type of killing with mental health disorders, trouble sleeping, and problem drinking. Combat severity, each type of combat event, and killing noncombatants were associated with adverse health outcomes after adjusting for covariates and other combat exposures. Except for trouble sleeping, these associations did not differ by occupational specialization, though the prevalence and odds of outcomes were generally lower for Special Forces personnel."
https://openalex.org/W4285412479,"Prior research has established that valence-trustworthiness and power-dominance are the two main dimensions of voice evaluation at zero-acquaintance. These impressions shape many of our interactions and high-impact decisions, so it is crucial for many domains to understand this dynamic. Yet, the relationship between acoustical properties of novel voices and personality/attitudinal traits attributions remains poorly understood. The fundamental problem of understanding vocal impressions and relative decision-making is linked to the complex nature of the acoustical properties in voices. In order to disentangle this relationship, this study extends the line of research on the acoustical bases of vocal impressions in two ways. First, by attempting to replicate previous finding on the bi-dimensional nature of first impressions: using personality judgements and establishing a correspondence between acoustics and voice-first-impression (VFI) dimensions relative to sex (Study 1). Second (Study 2), by exploring the non-linear relationships between acoustical parameters and VFI by the means of machine learning models. In accordance with literature, a bi-dimensional projection comprising valence-trustworthiness and power-dominance evaluations is found to explain 80% of the VFI. In study 1, brighter (high center of gravity), smoother (low shimmers), and louder (high minimum intensity) voices reflected trustworthiness, while vocal roughness (harmonic to noise-ratio), energy in the high frequencies (Energy3250), pitch (Quantile 1, Quantile 5) and lower range of pitch values reflected dominance. In study 2, above chance classification of vocal profiles was achieved by both Support Vector Machine (77.78%) and Random-Forest (Out-Of-Bag = 36.14) classifiers, generally confirming that machine learning algorithms could predict first impressions from voices. Hence results support a bi-dimensional structure to VFI, emphasize the usefulness of machine learning techniques in understanding vocal impressions, and shed light on the influence of sex on VFI formation."
https://openalex.org/W4285742337,"After encoding, memories go through a labile state followed by a stabilization process known as consolidation. Once consolidated they can enter a new labile state after the presentation of a reminder of the original memory, followed by a period of re-stabilization (reconsolidation). During these periods of lability the memory traces can be modified. Currently, some studies show a rapid stabilization after 30 min, while others show that stabilization occurs after longer periods (e.g. &gt; 6 h). Here we investigate the effect of an interference treatment on declarative memory consolidation, comparing distinct time intervals after acquisition. On day 1, participants learned a list of non- syllable pairs (List 1). 5 min, 30 min, 3 h or 8 h later, they received an interference list (List 2) that acted as an amnesic agent. On day 2 (48 h after training) participants had to recall List 1 first, followed by List 2. We found that the List 1 memory was susceptible to interference when List 2 was administered 5 min or 3 h after learning but not when it was administered 30 min or 8 h after. We propose the possibility that this rapid memory protection could be induced by a fast and transient neocortical integration. Our results open a discussion about the contribution of molecular and systemic aspects to memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W4285742963,"Urine-based biomarkers are a rational and promising approach for the detection of bladder cancer due to the proximity of urine to the location of the tumor site and the non-invasive nature of its sampling. A well-known and highly investigated biomarker for bladder cancer is survivin. For detection of very small amounts of urinary survivin protein a highly sensitive assay was developed. The assay is based on the immuno-PCR technology, more precisely a solid-phase proximity ligation assay (spPLA). The limit of detection for the survivin spPLA was 1.45 pg/mL, resulting in an improvement of the limit of detection by a factor of approximately 23 compared to the previously in-house developed survivin ELISA. A key step in development was the initial isolation of survivin by a molecular fishing rod based on magnetic beads. Interfering matrix compounds pose a special challenge for further analytical application, but can be overcome by this isolation step. The assay is designed to work with only 500 μL of voided urine. The survivin spPLA showed a sensitivity of 30% and specificity of 89% for bladder cancer detection in this study of 110 bladder cancer cases and 133 clinical controls. Moreover, the results demonstrated again that survivin is a useful complementary marker in combination with UBC ® Rapid by increasing the overall sensitivity to 70% with a specificity of 86%. Although the performance for detection of bladder cancer was rather low, the herein developed assay might serve as a new tool for survivin biomarker research in diverse human fluids, even if the biological matrix is complex or survivin is only present in small amounts."
https://openalex.org/W4285743155,"The purpose of this paper is to evaluate inequalities in care for people with diabetes in Brazil. This cross-sectional population-based study was carried out in 2019 and evaluated care provided by receiving advice, requesting laboratory tests, and performing examinations. We used the slope index of inequality and concentration index to assess inequalities according to educational level and Poisson regression to estimate prevalence ratios for each outcome in the education category. We assessed a total of 6317 people with diabetes, 41.8% had their eyes checked, and 36.1% had their feet examined in the previous year. Prevalence for both examinations was 2.45 times higher in those from the highest level of education compared to those from the lowest level. The largest absolute differences (in percentage points) between the lowest and highest education levels in care indicators were the following: request for glycated hemoglobin test (39.0), glucose curve test (31.4), and eyes checked in the previous year (29.7). There were notable inequalities in the prevalence ratios of care provided to people with diabetes in Brazil. Requests for glycated hemoglobin tests, glucose curve tests, eye and feet examinations should be emphasized, especially for people from lower educational levels."
https://openalex.org/W4285743173,"Thousands of youth are sexually trafficked each year worldwide. Increased public attention to the commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) of children has resulted in the rapid deployment of hybrid community public health and social service programs for these vulnerable youth. Research on the effectiveness of these advocacy programs is lacking, particularly whether they decrease psychosocial distress and increase readiness to leave CSE.Cisgender girls under age 18 at the time of CSE, and who were identified as at-risk for sex trafficking revictimization, were included in an evaluation of an anti-trafficking advocacy program in the North Texas region of the United States. The program includes crisis response, case management, referral, and mentoring services in collaboration with multi-disciplinary team (MDT) responses to identified youth sex trafficking. Case management notes, needs assessments and individualized treatment plans were collected at intake and every 30 days until study conclusion. Standardized surveys, including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, and the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA) were collected at intake and every 180 days until the study concluded. Analyses included descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, chi-square, multivariate linear and logistic regressions, Poisson regressions, and latent profile analysis.This study was approved by the Texas Christian University's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Results of this study will be presented to the scientific community at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals and non-scholarly outlets such as public health and social service conferences."
