https://openalex.org/W2065069831,"Development of strategies for mitigating the severity of a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2-3 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40-50%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics."

https://openalex.org/W2080883999,"Complement-mediated inflammation exacerbates the tissue injury of ischaemic necrosis in heart attacks and strokes, the most common causes of death in developed countries. Large infarct size increases immediate morbidity and mortality and, in survivors of the acute event, larger non-functional scars adversely affect long-term prognosis. There is thus an important unmet medical need for new cardioprotective and neuroprotective treatments. We have previously shown that human C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute-phase protein that binds to ligands exposed in damaged tissue and then activates complement, increases myocardial and cerebral infarct size in rats subjected to coronary or cerebral artery ligation, respectively. Rat CRP does not activate rat complement, whereas human CRP activates both rat and human complement. Administration of human CRP to rats is thus an excellent model for the actions of endogenous human CRP. Here we report the design, synthesis and efficacy of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane as a specific small-molecule inhibitor of CRP. Five molecules of this palindromic compound are bound by two pentameric CRP molecules, crosslinking and occluding the ligand-binding B-face of CRP and blocking its functions. Administration of 1,6-bis(phosphocholine)-hexane to rats undergoing acute myocardial infarction abrogated the increase in infarct size and cardiac dysfunction produced by injection of human CRP. Therapeutic inhibition of CRP is thus a promising new approach to cardioprotection in acute myocardial infarction, and may also provide neuroprotection in stroke. Potential wider applications include other inflammatory, infective and tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased CRP production, in which binding of CRP to exposed ligands in damaged cells may lead to complement-mediated exacerbation of tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2057015950,"Research over the past 25 years has led to the view that the rich tapestry of present-day cosmic structure arose during the first instants of creation, where weak ripples were imposed on the otherwise uniform and rapidly expanding primordial soup. Over 14 billion years of evolution, these ripples have been amplified to enormous proportions by gravitational forces, producing ever-growing concentrations of dark matter in which ordinary gases cool, condense and fragment to make galaxies. This process can be faithfully mimicked in large computer simulations, and tested by observations that probe the history of the Universe starting from just 400,000 years after the Big Bang."
https://openalex.org/W2082238466,"Noam Chomsky's work on ‘generative grammar’ led to the concept of a set of rules that can generate a natural language with a hierarchical grammar, and the idea that this represents a uniquely human ability. In a series of experiments with European starlings, in which several types of ‘warble’ and ‘rattle’ took the place of words in a human language, the birds learnt to classify phrase structure grammars in a way that met the same criteria. Their performance can be said to be almost human on this yardstick. So if there are language processing capabilities that are uniquely human, they may be more context-free or at a higher level in the Chomsky hierarchy. Or perhaps there is no single property or processing capacity that differentiates human language from non-human communication systems. Humans regularly produce new utterances that are understood by other members of the same language community1. Linguistic theories account for this ability through the use of syntactic rules (or generative grammars) that describe the acceptable structure of utterances2. The recursive, hierarchical embedding of language units (for example, words or phrases within shorter sentences) that is part of the ability to construct new utterances minimally requires a ‘context-free’ grammar2,3 that is more complex than the ‘finite-state’ grammars thought sufficient to specify the structure of all non-human communication signals. Recent hypotheses make the central claim that the capacity for syntactic recursion forms the computational core of a uniquely human language faculty4,5. Here we show that European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) accurately recognize acoustic patterns defined by a recursive, self-embedding, context-free grammar. They are also able to classify new patterns defined by the grammar and reliably exclude agrammatical patterns. Thus, the capacity to classify sequences from recursive, centre-embedded grammars is not uniquely human. This finding opens a new range of complex syntactic processing mechanisms to physiological investigation."

Adult rat brain was sequentially extracted with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), TBS-containing detergent, 1 m NaCl, and 6 m urea. Extracting tissue sections with these buffers showed that the diffuse and membrane-bound CSPGs were extracted in the first three buffers, but PNN-associated CSPGs remained and were only removed by 6 m urea. Most of the CSPGs were extracted to some degree with all the buffers, with neurocan, brevican, aggrecan, and versican particularly associated with the stable urea-extractable PNNs. The CSPGs in stable complexes only extractable in urea buffer are found from postnatal day 7–14 coinciding with PNN formation. Disaccharide composition analysis indicated a different glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composition for PGs strongly associated with extracellular matrix (ECM). For CS/dermatan sulfate (DS)-GAG the content of nonsulfated, 6-O-sulfated, 2,6-O-disulfated, and 4,6-O-disulfated disaccharides were higher and for heparan sulfate (HS)-GAG, the content of 6-O-sulfated, 2-N-, 6-O-disulfated, 2-O-, 2-N-disulfated, and 2-O-, 2-N-, 6-O-trisulfated disaccharides were higher in urea extract compared with other buffer extracts. Digestions with chondroitinase ABC and hyaluronidase indicated that aggrecan, versican, neurocan, brevican, and phosphacan are retained in PNNs through binding to hyaluronan (HA). A comparison of the brain and spinal cord ECM with respect to CSPGs indicated that the PNNs in both parts of the CNS have the same composition.

Whereas most of this matrix is amorphous, there are specialized structures of dense organized matrix called PNNs around many neurons with holes at the sites of synaptic contacts (1Hockfield S.

PNNs are composed of CSPGs versican, brevican, neurocan, cat-301 antigen (aggrecan), phosphacan (DSD-1-PG), HA, tenascin-C, tenascin-R (TN-R), and link proteins (4Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M.

Brain Res. 1999; 842: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The CSPGs in the brain can be grouped into secreted, membrane-bound, and GPI-anchored forms. Versican, aggrecan, neurocan, and brevican constitute a family of HA binding PGs called lecticans (17Ruoslahti E. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 18Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem.

The lecticans share a common structure with an N-terminal hyaluronan binding domain, C-terminal lectin binding domain, and GAG-carrying middle portion of variable length (6Yamaguchi Y. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 18Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem.

Except for the GPI-anchored splice variant of brevican, all lecticans are secreted. Phosphacan is a secreted CSPG, representing the entire extracellular domain of receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ), which is a transmembrane PG in the brain (21Maurel P. Rauch U. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2512-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). NG2 and neuroglycan C are two other transmembrane CSPGs expressed in the brain (22Levine J.M. Nishiyama A. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 3: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar, 23Watanabe E. Maeda N. Matsui F. Kushima Y. Noda M. Oohira A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26876-26882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HA and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein TN-R are two ligands of lecticans (24Bignami A. Asher R. Perides G. Brain Res. 1992; 579: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegard D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Much of the binding and biological activity of the CSPGs depends on the CS-GAGs, composed of repeating disaccharide units of d-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc). In mammals, the CS disaccharides can be disulfated in the positions 2 and 4 of GlcUA and GalNAc, respectively (CS-D) and in positions 4 and 6 of GalNAc (CS-E) or monosulfated in positions 4 or 6 of GalNAc (CS-A or CS-C, respectively) or nonsulfated (26Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 321-349Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The differential arrangement of these units results in the structural diversity of CS chains and defines the charge patterns that give the GAGs their binding properties (27Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43707-43716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 28Maeda N. He J. Yajima Y. Mikami T. Sugahara K. Yabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35805-35811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CSPGs in the CNS can interact with various growth factors and cell adhesion molecules, playing a significant role in development (18Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Bandtlow D.R. Zimmermann C.E. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). They mostly have an inhibitory effect toward neurite outgrowth and regeneration, either via their CS chains or core proteins (29Rhodes K.E. Fawcett J.W. J. Anat. 2004; 204: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). They are up-regulated after CNS injury (30Asher R.A. Morgenstern D.A. Fidler P.S. Adcock K.H. Oohira A. Braistead J.E. Levine J.M.

McMahon S.B. Nature. 2002; 416: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). Degradation of CSPGs induces sprouting of Purkinje axons in the cerebellum (36Corvetti L. Rossi F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7150-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and promotes retinal fiber sprouting after denervation of the superior colliculus in adult rats (37Tropea D. Caleo M. Maffei L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7034-7744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PNNs form late in development, surrounding particular classes of neurons. Their time of appearance corresponds with the termination of plasticity at the end of critical periods in many parts of the CNS, and their appearance in the visual cortex can be delayed by dark rearing, which prolongs plasticity. Chondroitinase digestion of CSPGs in the PNNs in the adult visual cortex reactivates plasticity after the critical period (11Pizzorusso T. Medini P. Berardi N. Chierzi S. Fawcett J.W. Maffei L. Science. 2002; 298: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). This and other evidence has led to the hypothesis that PNNs are involved in the control of plasticity in the CNS. The identity of the CSPGs in PNNs that are responsible for the control of plasticity has not been determined, but investigations of animals lacking brevican and neurocan have revealed abnormalities in one form of plasticity, long term potentiation (38Brakebusch C. Seidenbecher C.I. Asztely F. Rauch U. Matthies H. Meyer H. Krug M. Bockers T.M. Zhou X. Kreutz M.R. Montag D. Gundelfinger E.D. Fassler R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 21: 7417-7427Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because enhancement of plasticity promotes recovery after damage to the CNS, development of methods to control neural plasticity is a priority. We have therefore investigated the composition and properties of PNNs. We have developed a method to differentially extract the CSPGs that are diffusely present in CNS parenchyma and those that are present in the condensed matrix of PNNs. This enabled us to examine the composition of PNNs and changes in development; to analyze the GAG chain composition of the different extracts in the adult brain; to study how the various components are retained within the net structure and to compare the properties of the rather different PNNs from brain and spinal cord.

Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets and pepstatin were from Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany. Extraction of PGs from Rat Brain and Spinal Cord—Brains or spinal cords from 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Margate, UK) were homogenized with a tight-fitting Potter glass homogenizer using 5 ml/brain or 3 ml/spinal cord extraction buffer containing 50 mm TBS, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as protease inhibitors (buffer 1). The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was re-extracted with buffer 1 twice, and the supernatants from the first and second extractions were pooled together (extract 1), whereas the supernatant from third extraction was discarded. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was further extracted with buffer 2 (buffer 1 containing 0.5% Triton X-100) three times to obtain extract 2, followed by extraction with buffer 3 (buffer 2 containing 1 m NaCl) and buffer 4 (buffer 2 containing 6 m urea) to obtain extracts 3 and 4, respectively. Extracts 3 and 4 were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the protein content in all the four extracts was quantified by BCA protein assay kit. To investigate the release of CSPGs from PNNs, adult rat brain was sequentially extracted with buffers 1, 2, and 3. The precipitate obtained after three washes in buffer was resuspended in the digestion buffers for chondroitinase ABC (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.03 m sodium acetate) and hyaluronidase (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0 containing 0.15 m NaCl), separately and treated with 0.1 international unit (IU) of protease-free preparation of chondroitinase ABC at 37 °C for 3 h or 20 turbidity reducing unit (TRU)/ml of hyaluronidase containing protease inhibitors and 2 μg/ml pepstatin at 37 °C for 3 h, separately. The released CSPGs were analyzed by Western blotting as described later. Four separate extractions and analyses were performed on brain tissue, two on spinal cord. Partial Purification of PGs and Analysis of CS/DS and HS-GAG Disaccharide Composition—Brains from two 3-month-old rats were sequentially extracted with buffers 1, 2, 3, and 4 and after dialyzing the extracts against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 m urea, 0.2 m NaCl (wash buffer), the samples were separately applied to a Hiprep 16/10 DEAE-FF column (1.6 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with wash buffer. The unbound fraction was eluted with the wash buffer whereas the bound fraction was eluted with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against PBS, and the PGs were precipitated with 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate for 16 h at 4 °C, and the precipitate was dried. Each buffer extract (2–3 mg as ethanol precipitate) was treated with Pronase at 60 °C for 20 h to degrade proteins. After incubation and subsequent treatment with 5% trichloroacetic acid, the GAG-containing fractions were recovered by ethanol precipitation. An aliquot of the resultant GAG preparation derived from each buffer extract was digested exhaustively with chondroitinase ABC or a mixture of heparinase I and III. The reaction mixtures were lyophilized and derivatized with a fluorophore, 2AB. After removal of excess 2AB reagent by repeated extraction with a water-chloroform 1:1 mixture (v/v), the water phase was dried. An aliquot of each 2AB-derivative was analyzed by anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica column (39Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) to identify and quantify the resultant 2AB-labeled unsaturated CS or HS disaccharides. Western Blotting—The extracted proteoglycan fractions corresponding to 200 μg of protein was precipitated with 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate for 1 h in ice, and the precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min and digested with 10 international milliunits of a protease-free preparation of chondroitinase ABC in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.03 m sodium acetate for 3 h at 37 °C. The digest containing the core proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 5% gel under reducing conditions (except for versican, for which non-reducing condition was applied). The separated proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for 16 h at a constant current of 175 mA at 4 °C. All the following steps were performed at room temperature.

Open table in a new tab Immunohistochemistry—Postnatal (P) 7, 14, 21, and adult female Sprague-Dawley rats, three at each time point, were terminally anesthetized with an intraperiteonal overdose of sodium pentobarbitone and perfused through the heart with 200 ml of PBS prewash (pH 7.4) followed by 200 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C, transferred to 30% sucrose and then sectioned into 40-μm sagittal sections. Sections were quenched (10% methanol and 3% H2O2) for 5 min and blocked in 3% normal horse serum (NHS) in PBS with 0.02% Triton X-100 (TXPBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated overnight in anti-neurocan, anti-phosphacan, or anti-versican antibodies (see Table 1 for details) with 1% NHS in TXPBS at 4 °C, and then in biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature. Then they were incubated in ABC solution (Vectastain ABC elite kit) for 1 h at room temperature, and the staining was revealed using diaminobenzamide as a chromogen. For immunofluorescence on fresh frozen sections of adult cerebellum, adult rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and the cerebellum was immediately frozen on dry ice. Sagittal sections (16-μm thick) were cut on a cryostat, collected on SuperFrost® Plus slides, and air-dried at room temperature for 20–30 min. The slides were sequentially washed with buffers 1, 2, 3, and 4, each wash lasting 1 h, and then were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min. WFA and HABP histochemistry were performed by incubating sections in biotinylated WFA (20 μg/ml) or biotinylated HABP (10 μg/ml) in TXPBS overnight, then in Cy3 streptavidin (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. For CSPG immunostaining, sections were incubated overnight in primary antibodies (see Table 1) with 1.5% NHS in TXPBS at 4 °C, then in biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:200) in TXPBS containing 1.5% NHS for 1 h at room temperature and then in a solution made of Cy3 streptavidin and 10 μg/ml bisbenzimide fluorescent dye for 1 h at room temperature. In control experiments primary antibodies were omitted, yielding unstained sections. The slides were examined on a Leitz DMRD microscope. Digital images were produced using a Lucia imaging program (Nikon, Kingston upon Thames, UK) with a Nikon DXM 1200 digital camera. The images were imported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) in which size, contrast, and brightness were adjusted when necessary. For enzymatic digestions sagittal sections of adult rat cerebellum (16-μm thickness) was equilibrated either with 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0 containing 0.03 m sodium acetate for chondroitinase or 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0 containing 0.15 m NaCl for hyaluronidase digestions. A protease-free preparation of chondroitinase ABC (0.1 international units/ml) and hyaluronidase (10 TRU/ml) containing protease inhibitors and 2 μg/ml pepstatin were added to the slides separately and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and 37 °C for 120 min, respectively. After digestion, the slides were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% PFA in PBS and the PNN components were visualized by immunofluorescence as described earlier. To extract and analyze CSPGs loosely associated in the ECM, those associated with membranes and those bound in stable ternary complexes in PNNs, adult rat brain was sequentially extracted with four different buffers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The CSPGs were then characterized in each fraction. Concurrently we extracted CSPGs from tissue sections using the same sequential buffers so that we could visualize directly the locations of the CSPGs extracted by each step. In the present study we use the term PNN based on the evidence from immunohistochemical staining. However there is also condensed matrix containing CSPGs around the nodes of Ranvier in a perineuronal net-like structure (7Oohashi T. Hirakawa S. Bekku Y. Rauch U. Zimmermann D.R. Su W.D. Ohtsuka A. Murakami T. Ninomiya Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The components of these structures are probably extracted in the same conditions as PNNs. Types and Location of CSPGs Extracted by the Sequential Buffers—Extraction of adult rat brain with buffer 1, which is normal saline, released most of the neurocan, brevican, phosphacan, and part of the aggrecan, but only a small proportion of versican V2 and NG2 (Fig. 1, lane 1). The monoclonal antibody 1F6 detects two forms of neurocan: the full-length neurocan (240-kDa core protein) and the proteolytically cleaved N-terminal neurocan, neurocan-N (130-kDa core protein), and both these forms were present in the saline extract. All the full-length neurocan was extracted in saline, because none appeared in the other buffers, but the proteolytically cleaved neurocan-N was bound to other structures, and appeared in the later buffers. Phosphacan was detected as a 400-kDa core protein, and there was a single isoform of brevican corresponding to 145-kDa core protein. Two strong bands were detected for the soluble form of aggrecan (>500-kDa core protein) together with three or more faintly stained bands (between 450 and 250 kDa). Among the three spliced variants of versican, only versican V2 (400 kDa protein) was detected in the soluble extract. For NG2, a 290-kDa core protein was detected. To monitor anatomically the location of the matrix molecules extracted by saline we performed immunohistochemistry on the deep cerebellar nuclei, the PNNs of which have been investigated in detail (9Carulli D. Rhodes K. E. Brown D.J. Bonnert T. P. Pollack S.J. Oliver K. Strata P. Fawcett J.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 2006; 494: 559-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The sections were fixed after buffer extraction to prevent further removal of matrix during staining. Before extraction there was staining for neurocan, aggrecan, versican, and phosphacan in the PNNs and also diffusely in the cerebellar ECM (Fig. 2, A–D). Brevican was not studied since the anti-brevican antibody gave high background on fresh frozen sections. Washing with normal saline resulted in a decrease in neurocan, aggrecan, and phosphacan staining in the diffuse ECM, whereas the staining in PNNs remained unchanged. WFA, which is a marker of PNNs did not show any decrease in the ECM staining after saline wash (Fig. 2E). The staining intensity of HABP and TN-R (Fig. 2, F and G) in the general ECM was decreased by saline wash, whereas their staining in PNNs remained unaltered. Extraction with buffer 2 (detergent buffer), released neurocan-N, phosphacan/RPTPβ, brevican, and aggrecan in smaller amounts than was released by saline buffer (Fig. 1, lane 2). Large amounts of the membrane-attached CSPG NG2 (300-kDa core protein) was released along with a small proportion of 260-kDa core protein. Versican V2 was released in very small amounts by detergent buffer. The results from immunostaining of cerebellar sections indicated that the PNN staining for neurocan, aggrecan, versican, HABP, WFA, and TN-R (Fig. 2, A–C, E, F, and G), remained unchanged whereas phosphacan staining (Fig. 2D) was completely removed by detergent wash. Extraction with buffer 3 (saline-containing detergent and 1 m NaCl), released small amounts of versican and aggrecan as shown in Fig. 1 (lane 3). Large amounts of neurocan comparable to detergent wash were released by high salt buffer, but barely detectable amounts of NG2, phosphacan, and brevican were released. Immunohistochemical staining of sections showed that the ECM staining for neurocan, aggrecan, versican, and HABP was further reduced (Fig. 2, A–C and F), but their staining in PNNs remained more or less the same. PNN staining for TN-R was slightly decreased by"
https://openalex.org/W2041693709,"The attempt to understand copper oxide superconductors is complicated by the presence of multiple strong interactions in these systems. Many believe that antiferromagnetism is important for superconductivity, but there has been renewed interest in the possible role of electron-lattice coupling. The conventional superconductor MgB2 has a very strong electron-lattice coupling, involving a particular vibrational mode (phonon) that was predicted by standard theory and confirmed quantitatively by experiment. Here we present inelastic scattering measurements that show a similarly strong anomaly in the Cu-O bond-stretching phonon in the copper oxide superconductors La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO4 (with x = 0.07, 0.15). Conventional theory does not predict such behaviour. The anomaly is strongest in La(1.875)Ba(0.125)CuO4 and La(1.48)Nd(0.4)Sr(0.12)CuO4, compounds that exhibit spatially modulated charge and magnetic order, often called stripe order; it occurs at a wave vector corresponding to the charge order. These results suggest that this giant electron-phonon anomaly, which is absent in undoped and over-doped non-superconductors, is associated with charge inhomogeneity. It follows that electron-phonon coupling may be important to our understanding of superconductivity, although its contribution is likely to be indirect."

Using a mouse model for gene therapy of X-SCID, we find that the corrective therapeutic gene IL2RG itself can act as a contributor to the genesis of T-cell lymphomas, with one-third of animals being affected. Gene-therapy trials for X-SCID, which have been based on the assumption that IL2RG is minimally oncogenic, may therefore pose some risk to patients."
https://openalex.org/W2056919777,"Strain hardening, also called work hardening, is a property of crystalline materials much valued by engineers: under load, strong materials can become even stronger. For many years, strain hardening was thought to arise from pair-wise dislocation collisions in which intersecting dislocations form strength-generating junctions. Now a group working at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has shown that this theory is incomplete as it ignores many-body dislocation interactions. New simulations, backed up by experiments on molybdenum crystals, show that crystals harden under strain because dislocation lines bundle together in threes into tight knots that form multiple junctions. At the microscopic scale, the strength of a crystal derives from the motion, multiplication and interaction of distinctive line defects called dislocations. First proposed theoretically in 1934 (refs 1–3) to explain low magnitudes of crystal strength observed experimentally, the existence of dislocations was confirmed two decades later4,5. Much of the research in dislocation physics has since focused on dislocation interactions and their role in strain hardening, a common phenomenon in which continued deformation increases a crystal's strength. The existing theory relates strain hardening to pair-wise dislocation reactions in which two intersecting dislocations form junctions that tie the dislocations together6,7. Here we report that interactions among three dislocations result in the formation of unusual elements of dislocation network topology, termed ‘multi-junctions’. We first predict the existence of multi-junctions using dislocation dynamics and atomistic simulations and then confirm their existence by transmission electron microscopy experiments in single-crystal molybdenum. In large-scale dislocation dynamics simulations, multi-junctions present very strong, nearly indestructible, obstacles to dislocation motion and furnish new sources for dislocation multiplication, thereby playing an essential role in the evolution of dislocation microstructure and strength of deforming crystals8. Simulation analyses conclude that multi-junctions are responsible for the strong orientation dependence of strain hardening in body-centred cubic crystals."

https://openalex.org/W2153508530,"Based on its trophic influence on neurons and vascular cells, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a promising candidate for stroke treatment. VEGF's survival-promoting effects are purchased at the expense of an increased blood brain barrier permeability, which potentially compromises tissue survival. The mechanisms via which VEGF protects the brain against ischemia remained unknown. We examined signaling pathways underlying VEGF's neuroprotective activity in our transgenic mouse line, which expresses human VEGF165 under a neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. We show that VEGF receptor-2 (Flk-1) is expressed on ischemic neurons and astrocytes and is activated by VEGF. Following 90-min episodes of middle cerebral artery occlusion, VEGF increased phosphorylated (but not total) Akt and ERK-1/-2 and reduced phosphorylated mitogen activated protein kinase/p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)-1/-2 levels, at the same time decreasing inducible NO synthase expression in ischemic neurons. Inhibition of Akt with Wortmannin reversed VEGF's neuroprotective properties, diminished brain swelling, and restored the vascular permeability induced by VEGF to below levels in WT animals. The aggravation of brain injury by Wortmannin was associated with the restitution of p38, but not of JNK-1/-2, ERK-1/-2, or inducible NOS (iNOS). Our data demonstrate that VEGF mediates both neuroprotection and blood brain barrier permeability via the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Based on our observation that VEGF neuroprotection and vascular leakage depend on PI3K/Akt, which is putatively regulated by VEGF receptor-2, we predict that it may not easily be possible to make use of VEGF's neuroprotective function without accepting its unfavorable consequence, the increased vascular permeability."

https://openalex.org/W2068684928,"The significance of catechins, the main constituent of green tea, is being increasingly recognized with regard to cancer prevention. Catechins have been studied for interactions with various proteins, but the mechanisms of the various catechins are not yet elucidated. Based on our previous observation that nucleic acids extracted from catechin-treated cells are colored, we studied whether catechins directly interact with nucleic acids using surface plasmon resonance assay (Biacore) and cold spray ionization-mass spectrometry. These two methods clearly showed that (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) binds to both DNA and RNA molecules: the Biacore assay indicated that four catechins bound to DNA oligomers, and cold spray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis showed one to three EGCG molecules bound to single strand 18 mers of DNA and RNA. Moreover, one or two molecules of EGCG bound to double-stranded (AG-CT) oligomers of various nucleotide lengths. These results suggest that multiple binding sites of EGCG are present in DNA and RNA oligomers. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligomers were detected only as EGCG-bound forms at high temperature, whereas at low temperature both the free and bound forms were detected, suggesting that EGCG protects dsDNA oligomers from dsDNA melting to single-stranded DNA. Because both galloyl and catechol groups of EGCG are essential for DNA binding, both groups seem to hold strands of DNA via their branching structure. These findings reveal for the first time the link between catechins and polynucleotides and will intensify our understanding of the effects of catechins on DNA in terms of cancer prevention.

Using these two new technologies, we demonstrated for the first time the direct binding of EGCG to DNA and RNA oligomers and investigated the structure-function relationship of this interaction. The results will likely provide new knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of action of green tea catechins and show that green tea catechins have multifunctional targets for the prevention of human cancer. Materials—EGCG was purified from Japanese green tea leaves with 99.7% purity. EGCG, EGC, ECG, EC, gallic acid (GA), GCG, (-)-catechin gallate (CG), (-)-gallocatechin (GC), (+)-catechin (C), and theaflavin were purchased from Funakoshi Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). DNA and RNA oligomers were synthesized and further purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Their purities were examined using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and TOF-MASS by Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. Double-stranded DNAs (dsDNAs) were made by annealing complementary single strand DNAs (ssDNAs) in 100 mm ammonium acetate. The DNA and RNA oligomers used were as follows: oligo(dA)18, oligo(dT)18, oligo(dC)18, oligo(dG)18, oligo(A)18, oligo(U)18, oligo(G)18, oligo(C)18, oligo(dA·dT)9, and oligo(dG·dC)9. In addition, dsDNA oligomers of dAdC·dTdG from 6-14 nucleotides were also used (28Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For Biacore assay, 20 mers of oligo DNA biotinylated at the 5′-end were immobilized on sensor chip SA (streptavidine). Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay (Biacore Assay)—Biacore 3000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for surface plasmon resonance analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions. The methods with buffer can be described briefly as follows. We used sensor chip SA and HBS-N buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) as running buffer. 10 μl of 2 μm biotinylated DNA oligomers were immobilized to sensor chip SA. EGCG and other catechins were originally dissolved in methanol at 10 mm as stock solution. At various concentrations (1.6, 3.3, 6.5, 13, 25, and 50 μm) in HBS-N buffer, they were applied to the immobilized ssDNA and dsDNA at 20 μl/min as flow rate (Figs. 1 and 2). Blank was used as reference and was subtracted from all the raw data. For the affinity analysis, we used BIAevaluation steady state affinity software. The results with 10 μm EGCG and other catechins are presented in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Interaction between ssDNA oligomer and EGCG and the structure-function relationship of catechins.

J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 38: 473-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). For CSI mass spectrometry, high concentrations of molecules are necessary for detection. For binding analysis of dsDNA, annealed oligo (dA·dG)3 + oligo (dC·dT)3, oligo (dA·dG)4 + oligo (dC·dT)4, oligo (dA·dG)5 + oligo (dC·dT)5, oligo (dA·dG)6 + oligo (dC·dT)6, oligo (dA·dG)7 + oligo (dC·dT)7 were used (28Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mass spectral measurements were performed with sector (BE) mass spectrometer (JMS-700, JEOL) equipped with a CSI source. Experimental conditions were as follows: experimental (negative); acceleration voltage, 5.0 kV; needle voltage, -3.5 kV; orifice voltage, -73 V; ring lens voltage, -132 V; spray temp, room temperature; resolution, 1000; flow rate, 0.5 ml/hr; solvent, H2O. Interaction between DNA Oligomers and EGCG Determined by Biacore Assay and Their Structure-Function Relationship—We tested the interaction between catechins and DNA using two different methods: Biacore analysis, which indicates the real-time binding, and CSI-MS, which shows the end point binding. The Biacore assay method makes it possible to observe the association and subsequent dissociation of DNA with EGCG in real time. We analyzed the interaction between EGCG and poly(dT) 20-mer oligo ssDNA at various concentrations (1.6, 3.3, 6.5, 13, 25, and 50 μm) of EGCG (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows both the association, represented by an increase in resonance unit, and the dissociation, represented by a decrease in resonance unit. Poly(dT) ssDNA oligomers immediately associated with EGCG and rapidly dissociated from it. The resonance units of EGCG to DNA increased dose dependently (red for 1.6 μm, purple for 3.3 μm, green for 6.5 μm, blue for 13 μm, dark blue for 25 μm, and brown for 50 μm EGCG) (Fig. 1A). This is the first demonstration that EGCG directly binds to DNA. For the binding parameters, we conducted steady state affinity analysis using BIAevaluation software. The Kd value was estimated to be 5.4 × 10-5 m (Fig. 1B). The effective concentrations of EGCG for growth inhibition of a human lung cancer cell line are almost the same as this Kd value (3Fujiki H. Chem. Rec. 2005; 5: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and EGCG subsequently accumulated in the cells. Thus we think that the Kd value 5.4 × 10-5 m is reasonable (for more details, see “Discussion”). The binding curves of EGCG with poly(dA) (red line), poly(dT) (blue line), and poly(dG) (green line) 18-mer DNA oligomers are shown in Fig. 2a. (The results with poly(dC) are not shown). Poly(dT) oligomer bound to EGCG, and poly(dA) and poly(dG) oligomers showed weak binding to EGCG, indicating the presence of base preference for EGCG-DNA binding. Because ethidium derivatives are known to bind to AT-rich sequences via a minor groove, EGCG may recognize a higher order structure of DNA. To study the structure-function relationship of EGCG for DNA binding, we next determined which chemical group of EGCG is important for the interaction with DNA. We used several catechins and related chemicals: EGCG, ECG, EGC, EC, GA, GCG, CG, GC, C and theaflavin. In addition to EGCG, ECG, GCG, and CG also showed the association with poly(dT) 18 mer (Fig. 2, a, b, g, and h). Other catechins, such as EGC, EC, GC, C, and theaflavin, did not interact with DNA oligomers (Fig. 2, c, d, i-k). Based on our results, we think that the binding to DNA oligomers is not influenced by the (-)-epi- or non (-)-epi forms of catechins. Next, we designed a putative tertiary structure of various catechins and used them for binding analysis (Fig. 2). The structure-function relationship of catechins and DNA oligomers indicated the significance of the branching structure, consisting of galloyl and catechol groups (see the putative molecular models of the tertiary structures in Fig. 2, right column). To confirm the usefulness of the branching structure, a mixture of EC and GA was tested, but no association was observed (Fig. 2, f and l). This suggests an insufficient interaction when the two chemical groups are separated but strengthened the importance of these two groups when linked by covalent bond. Although the exact binding site and the mode of interaction between catechins and DNA have not been resolved yet, we assume that the branching structure of EGCG is attached to some parts of DNA molecule. All the results strongly encouraged us to pursue further experiments with DNA oligomers and EGCG using CSI-MS analysis. Multiple EGCG-binding Sites in DNA Oligomers Determined by CSI-MS Analysis—Mass spectrometry can show the exact molecular ratio of binding molecules. CSI-MS is a direct analysis method that promotes electrolytic dissociation forming the molecular ion in solution at low temperature (27Yamaguchi K. J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 38: 473-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 28Sakamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This method has the advantage of detecting extremely labile complexes of biological molecules without causing decomposition. For the experiments, 50 μm DNA oligomers, such as single-stranded 18 mers of poly(dA), poly(dT), poly(dG), poly(dC), poly(dA·dT), and poly(dG·dC) were mixed with 0.1 mm EGCG. For example, the molecular weights of poly(dT) 18 mer and EGCG are 5,414 and 458, respectively. In the CSI-MS analysis, the molecular weights are presented as numbers divided by the charge numbers. Various peaks of poly(dT) 18 mer and the bound form, DNA + EGCG, appear in Fig. 3. As an example, peaks of [DNA]4+ and [DNA + 2EGCG]4+ were output in the m/z ranges of 1350.3 and 1579.0, respectively. The number 4 represents the charge number of molecules in the ionization in this case; when the difference between the two values is multiplied by four, resulting in 915, the value corresponds to the molecular weight of two molecules of EGCG, which is 916. These results indicate that two molecules of EGCG directly associated with DNA. Other peaks were also calculated and identified as shown in Fig. 3. Specifically, three kinds of bound forms, (DNA + EGCG), (DNA + 2EGCG), and (DNA + 3EGCG), were observed, showing that at least three molecules of EGCG bind to poly(dT) 18 mer and suggesting that multiple binding sites for EGCG are present in DNA oligomer (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of the interaction of EGCG with various DNA and RNA oligomers DNA and RNA are synthesized oligomers. The binding of EGCG to dG and G oligomers was not determined because these oligomers rarely ionized in CSI mass spectrometry. ND, not determined.DNARNASequenceNumber of bound EGCGSequenceNumber of bound EGCGdA × 181A × 183dT × 183U × 182dG × 18NDG × 18NDdC × 181C × 181dA·dT × 91AU × 91dGC × 9NDGC × 9ND Open table in a new tab To study the nucleotide specificity of DNA oligomer for EGCG binding, the next experiments were conducted with 18 mers of poly(dA), poly(dG), and poly(dC) and 9 mers of poly(dA·dT) and poly(dG·dC). The results are summarized in Table 1. Whereas poly(dT) oligomers bound to three molecules of EGCG, poly(dA), poly(dC), and poly(dA·dT) showed weak binding to at least one molecule of EGCG, which corresponds to the results of the Biacore assay. No interaction between poly(dG) 18 mer and EGCG was detected, probably due to difficulty of ionization in the assay conditions. All the results in CSI-MS analysis showed that EGCG binds to ssDNA oligomers. The question of why three molecules of catechin, but not more, bind to the 18 mers will be discussed in the next part. Interaction Between ssRNA Oligomers and EGCG Determined by CSI-MS Analysis—Based on evidence that ssDNA oligomers directly bind to EGCG, we next tested the binding of ssRNA oligomers by CSI-MS analysis. For this experiment, 0.5 mm 18 mers of poly(A), poly(U), poly(G), and poly(C) and 18 mers of poly(AU) and poly(GC) and 0.1 mm EGCG were mixed. Fig. 4 shows three bound forms of EGCG, (RNA + EGCG), (RNA + 2EGCG), and (RNA + 3EGCG), suggesting that poly(A) 18 mer binds to at least three molecules of EGCG (Table 1). In addition, the 18 mers of poly(AU) bound to one molecule of EGCG, indicating that poly(A), poly(U), and poly(AU) also bind to EGCG. However, the interaction between poly(G) and EGCG was not clearly observed, similar to the interaction between poly(dG) and EGCG. This suggests that oligomers of poly(G) and poly(dG) do not readily ionize under these assay conditions. Because EGCG binds to both ssDNA and ssRNA oligomers, we assume that the 2′-hydroxyl group of ribose does not influence the interaction with EGCG. Interaction between dsDNA Oligomers and EGCG, Determined by CSI-MS Analysis and Biacore Assay—It is necessary to study the interaction between dsDNA and EGCG more precisely, because DNA exists as a double strand in the genome. As in the case of ssDNA, we conducted two different assays for this subject. Initially, various lengths of double-stranded AG·CT oligomers (from 6 to 14 base pairs) were mixed with EGCG under identical conditions. Fig. 5 shows that one or two molecules of EGCG bound to all double-stranded AG·CT oligomers without any relation to nucleotide length.FIGURE 5Direct binding of EGCG to double-stranded AG·CT oligomers determined by CSI-MS analysis. Various lengths of dsDNA were used for the binding experiments. 14 base pairs oligo(dA·dG)7-(dC·dT)7 (A); 12 base pairs oligo(dA·dG)6-(dC·dT)6 (B); 10 base pairs oligo(dA·dG)5-(dC·dT)5 (C); 8 base pairs oligo(dA·dG)4-(dC·dT)4 (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the binding mode of EGCG and dsDNA, the assay was conducted at high (48 °C) and low temperatures (28 °C), using six-base oligomer dsDNAs (Fig. 6). As Fig. 6A shows, dsDNA oligomers were detected only as EGCG-bound forms at high temperature, although at low temperature both the free and EGCG-bound forms were present. At the high temperature this length of oligomer dsDNA normally melts into ssDNA. These data suggest that EGCG protects dsDNA oligomers from dsDNA melting to ssDNA. In the Biacore assay, we detected the association of EGCG with the annealed 20-mer DNA (Fig. 7a), but no association with other catechins was found (Fig. 7, b-d). Judging from these different experiments, we conclude that EGCG also binds to dsDNA. However, the other catechins did not, which indicates that one hydroxyl group of the trihydroxyphenyl group in EGCG is essential for binding to dsDNA. The galloyl group is also essential for binding to both ssDNA and dsDNA. The association-dissociation curve is different in the experiments between EGCG-ssDNA and EGCG-dsDNA, and the difference probably reflects the binding mode of EGCG to each DNA. Based on numerous reports, the interaction of EGCG with various proteins and lipids is now widely accepted. Catechins affect reactions associated with DNA, and in those cases EGCG is thought to interact with enzymes on DNA molecules (20Fang M.Z. Wang Y. Ai N. Hou Z. Sun Y. Lu H. Welsh W. Yang C.S.

This is the first experiment demonstrating a direct interaction between catechin and polynucleotides, and so, this report shows a new molecular mechanism of action for green tea catechins. We previously reported that duplicate 3H-EGCG administrations at 6-h intervals enhanced incorporation of 3H-EGCG 4 to 9 times in most organs compared with a single administration. Because this enhancement showed that EGCG accumulates in cells, we named it the “Fujiki-Suganuma Effect” (29Suganuma M. Okabe S. Oniyama M. Tada Y. Ito H. Fujiki H. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 1771-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 30Fujiki H. Suganuma M. J. Environ. Sci. Health C. Environ. Carcinog. Ecotoxicol. Rev. 2005; 23: 3-30PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is not clear yet which molecules promote EGCG accumulation in cells, the results of the current experiment allow us to assume that both DNA and RNA molecules can act as biological reservoirs for EGCG. In most experiments in cell lines treated with EGCG, the concentrations of EGCG are relatively higher than those of the usual active compounds, but we think such concentrations are significant in vivo: EGCG and green tea catechins accumulate in the whole body by consumption of green tea throughout the day. It is of interest to note why more than three molecules of catechin were not found on the 18 mers, and there are at least two possible explanations. One is the limitation in the sensitivity of mass spectrometry; the complex of ssDNA with more than three molecules of EGCG would be broken upon ionization of CSI, and a peak of the complex of ssDNA with more than three molecules of EGCG would be covered by the background peaks. Another possibility is that the binding surface is limited because of the tertiary structure of ssDNA, which influences the interaction. This problem can be resolved by NMR or x-ray crystallography. Recently, administration of green tea was reported to alter the mutation profile of p53 (31Kramata P. Lu Y.P. Lou Y.R. Cohen J.L. Olcha M. Liu S. Conney A.H. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and our findings here on the binding of catechins to DNA support this change in the mutation profile of DNA. Catechin inhibits the activities of various proteins attached to DNA, such as DNA polymerase, cAMP-response element-binding protein, DNA methyltransferase, and DNA topoisomerase (21Okabe S.

Catechins induce apoptosis in cells and sometimes cause DNA damage (21Okabe S. Fujimoto N. Sueoka N. Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Biol. Pharm.

However, this might be triggered by the direct binding of catechins to DNA. Judging from our findings, the mechanisms of anti-cancer and anti-aging activities of catechins are intensified through the binding of catechins to DNA and RNA. We thank Dr. Marsha R.

https://openalex.org/W2017592299,"Lateral DNA transfer--the movement of genetic traits between bacteria--has a profound impact on genomic evolution and speciation. The efficiency with which bacteria incorporate genetic information reflects their capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Integron integrases are proteins that mediate site-specific DNA recombination between a proximal primary site (attI) and a secondary target site (attC) found within mobile gene cassettes encoding resistance or virulence factors. The lack of sequence conservation among attC sites has led to the hypothesis that a sequence-independent structural recognition determinant must exist within attC. Here we report the crystal structure of an integron integrase bound to an attC substrate. The structure shows that DNA target site recognition and high-order synaptic assembly are not dependent on canonical DNA but on the position of two flipped-out bases that interact in cis and in trans with the integrase. These extrahelical bases, one of which is required for recombination in vivo, originate from folding of the bottom strand of attC owing to its imperfect internal dyad symmetry. The mechanism reported here supports a new paradigm for how sequence-degenerate single-stranded genetic material is recognized and exchanged between bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2054631447,"Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates an intracellular signal transduction program termed the unfolded protein response (UPR). In mammalian cells, the UPR is signaled in part through dimerization of ER membrane-localized IRE1α to activate its protein kinase and endoribonuclease activities. Activated IRE1α cleaves XBP1 mRNA at two sites to initiate an unconventional splicing reaction. The 5′ and 3′ fragments are subsequently joined by an RNA ligase activity, thereby removing a 26-base intron. This splicing reaction creates a translational frameshift to produce a functional XBP1 transcription factor. However, the cellular location and physiological processes required for splicing of XBP1 mRNA are not well characterized. To study these processes, XBP1 mRNAs were engineered in which translation of enhanced green fluorescence protein or luciferase required splicing of the XBP1 intron. Using cell lines that continuously or transiently express these reporter constructs, we show that cytoplasmic unspliced XBP1 mRNA is efficiently spliced by activated IRE1α and requires ongoing cellular transcription but not active translation. The XBP1 intron was effectively removed from RNA substrates transcribed from T7 RNA polymerase or delivered directly to the cytoplasm by RNA transfection, thus indicating that the splicing reaction does not require nuclear processing of the RNA substrate. Analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions demonstrated that XBP1 mRNA splicing occurs in the cytoplasm. Moreover, an artificial Fv-IRE1αΔN was engineered that was able to splice XBP1 mRNA upon chemical-induced dimerization. These findings demonstrate that IRE1α dimerization is sufficient to activate XBP1 mRNA splicing in the absence of the UPR. We propose that XBP1 mRNA cytoplasmic splicing provides a novel mechanism to rapidly induce translation of a transcription factor in response to a specific stimulus.

Given the importance of ER function for normal cellular function, it is not surprising that the ER affects a diverse number of cellular processes such as gene expression (at the transcriptional and translational levels), cell cycle control, intracellular signaling, and programmed cell death.

These genes encode functions that assist protein folding and secretion, facilitate degradation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen, or induce cell-death pathways. The initial characterization of the UPR was performed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P.

Cell. 1993; 74: 743-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). A genetic screen revealed that three genes are required for signal transduction from the ER to activate gene transcription in the nucleus. The first, IRE1, encodes a type 1 transmembrane Ser/Thr protein kinase that also has a site-specific endoribonuclease (RNase) activity. The second, HAC1, encodes a basic leucine zipper transcriptional activator for UPR target genes (19Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 20Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Finally, the product of RLG1 (tRNA ligase) joins the 5′ and 3′ ends of HAC1 mRNA that are produced through cleavage by Ire1p (21Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 22Sidrauski C. Walter P. Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). IRE1, the most proximal component of the UPR pathway, has three functional domains (17Cox J.S. Shamu C.E. Walter P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 18Mori K. Ma W. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18181-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain resides in the ER lumen and senses the accumulation of unfolded proteins. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen induces dimerization of the IRE1 luminal domain that activates trans-autophosphorylation via the cytoplasmic kinase domain. The activation of the kinase domain then stimulates the site-specific carboxyl-terminal RNase activity (23Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18181-18187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Shamu C.E. Walter P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3028-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In yeast, the only known substrate for the site-specific RNase activity of Ire1p is HAC1 mRNA (19Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 20Mori K. Kawahara T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T.

Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). HAC1 mRNA cleavage by Ire1p initiates an unconventional splicing reaction that is required for efficient translation and accumulation of Hac1p. Unspliced HAC1 mRNA is constitutively transcribed, but the RNA is not translated due to long-range base pairing interactions between the HAC1 5′-untranslated region and the intron (26Ruegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P. Cell. 2001; 107: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Upon removal of the intron, HAC1 mRNA is efficiently translated. The splicing of HAC1 mRNA changes the open reading frame of HAC1 so the carboxyl terminus is replaced by a short transcriptional activation domain (27Mori K. Ogawa N. Kawahara T. Yanagi H. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4660-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although the UPR was first described in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (4Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), higher eukaryotic cells have also maintained the essential and unique properties of IRE1 signaling. However, higher eukaryotes possess additional sensors and control mechanisms to mediate more diverse responses upon activation of the UPR. Three transmembrane proteins, IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, serve as proximal sensors that regulate components acting to attenuate translation, up-regulate the capacity of the ER to fold newly synthesized proteins, and degrade unfolded or misfolded proteins (2Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 3Mori K.

There are two homologues of yeast Ire1p, referred to as IRE1α and IRE1β, in both the human and murine genomes. IRE1α is expressed in most cells and tissues (28Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), where IRE1β expression is restricted to intestinal epithelial cells (29Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Both IRE1 proteins respond to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, undergo kinase activation and, thereby, trigger their RNase activities. Each IRE1 protein cleaves its own mRNA (30Tirasophon W. Lee K. Callaghan B. Welihinda A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), 28 S rRNA (31Iwawaki T. Hosoda A. Okuda T. Kamigori Y. Nomura-Furuwatari C. Kimata Y. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and the mRNA encoding the basic leucine zipper transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) (32Calfon M. Zeng H.

Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2982) Google Scholar). Upon activation of the UPR, unconventional splicing initiated by IRE1α removes a 26-nucleotide intron from unspliced mammalian XBP1 mRNA (encoding 267 amino acids), to induce a translational frameshift producing a fusion protein encoded from two evolutionarily conserved open reading frames. The translation product from spliced mammalian XBP1 mRNA is a potent transcriptional activator of 371 amino acids that comprises the original amino-terminal DNA binding domain plus an additional transactivation domain in the carboxyl terminus. This IRE1-mediated splicing mechanism is conserved through evolution as mammalian IRE1 recognizes and cleaves yeast HAC1 mRNA (28Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). In yeast, the splicing mechanism used by Ire1p is similar to pre-tRNA splicing (35Gonzalez T.N. Sidrauski C. Dorfler S. Walter P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3119-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 36Abelson J. Trotta C.R. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12685-12688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Activated Ire1p cleaves the 5′ and 3′ exon-intron junctions in HAC1 mRNA to generate 5′-OH and 2′,3′-cyclic PO4 ends. tRNA ligase (RLG1/TRL1) joins both exons (21Sidrauski C. Cox J.S. Walter P. Cell. 1996; 87: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The ligase leaves a 2′-phosphate derived from the splice junction on the 5′-end of the joined junction (35Gonzalez T.N. Sidrauski C. Dorfler S. Walter P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3119-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This 2′-phosphate is removed by phosphatase Tpt1p (37McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in a reaction that requires NAD+ as a phosphate acceptor to generate nicotinamide and ADP-ribose 1′,2′-cyclic phosphate (38Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Zillmann M. Kierzek R. Michaud N. LaReau R.D. Turner D.H. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1993; 261: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The presence of RNA ligases with similar activities has been demonstrated in wheat germ, Chlamydomonas, and mammalian cells (39Zillmann M. Gorovsky M.A. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mammals also have an additional ligase activity that incorporates the junction phosphate into the spliced mRNA (40Laski F.A. Fire A.Z. RajBhandary U.L. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11974-11980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a NAD+-dependent 2′-phosphatase is conserved in bacteria, yeast, plants, and mammals (37McCraith S.M. Phizicky E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 41Spinelli S.L. Malik H.S. Consaul S.A. Phizicky E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14136-14141Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the identity of the XBP1 mRNA ligase remains unknown, the mechanism of IRE1-mediated RNA splicing is likely conserved in all eukaryotes. To elucidate the mechanism of UPR signaling, it is essential to identify where and how the IRE1α-mediated splicing reaction occurs in the cell. In yeast, it is now believed that pre-tRNA splicing occurs not in the nucleus (42Winicov I. Button J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 43Bertrand E. Houser-Scott F. Kendall A. Singer R.H. Engelke D.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) but in the cytoplasm because the tRNA splicing RNase that catalyzes intron removal from tRNA precursors is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (44Yoshihisa T. Yunoki-Esaki K. Ohshima C. Tanaka N. Endo T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This unexpected cytoplasmic localization of a key RNA splicing enzyme explains several previously puzzling observations, such as why unspliced pre-tRNAs accumulate in nuclei of yeast cells defective in tRNA nuclear export upon mutation of the Ran transport system (e.g. RNA1) or the tRNA export receptor LOS1 (45Hopper A.K. Phizicky E.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 162-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 46Phizicky E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11127-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 47Dahlberg J. Lund E. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 292-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Even though it was reported that tRNA ligase Rlg1p is localized to the nuclear pore complex in yeast (48Clark M.W. Abelson J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), more recent reports show there is a functional pool of tRNA ligase activity in the cytoplasm (26Ruegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P. Cell. 2001; 107: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition, a carboxyl GFP-tagged ligase (NAD+-dependent 2′-phospho-transferase, TPT1) that catalyzes the third step of pre-tRNA splicing, removal of the residual 2′-phosphate (49Culver G.M. McCraith S.M. Consaul S.A. Stanford D.R. Phizicky E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13203-13210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), is distributed throughout the cytoplasm (50Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3306) Google Scholar). Finally, in yeast, HAC1 mRNA splicing can occur on polyribosomes but does not require polysomal association. The cytoplasmic pool of HAC1 mRNA can be spliced independently of transcription (26Ruegsegger U. Leber J.H. Walter P. Cell. 2001; 107: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown where and how efficient splicing of XBP1 mRNA occurs in UPR-activated mammalian cells. Membrane fractionation experiments show that the majority of endogenous IRE1α protein is localized to the inner leaflet of the nuclear envelope (28Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 51Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). In this case, the kinase/RNase domain is exposed to the nucleoplasm and could participate in XBP1 mRNA splicing as part of the nuclear export pathway. In this report, we studied the requirements for transcription and translation for XBP1 splicing and the potential for XBP1 splicing to occur in the cytoplasm using versatile reporter systems for XBP1 splicing. Through the use of four different approaches, we show that the cytoplasmic pool of XBP1 mRNA is an efficient substrate for the splicing reaction. Efficient XBP1 splicing requires ongoing transcription; however, once the IRE1α RNase is activated the reaction does not require mRNA translation or ER stress. Plasmid Construction—pED-mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP contains 1-618 nt from the unspliced form of the murine XBP (51Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) cDNA sequence, thereby having a deletion of 70 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus. The XBP1 cDNA is followed by a destabilized enhanced green fluorescence protein (d2EGFP) with a COOH-terminal PEST sequence (BD Biosciences), the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), and a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) coding region. pED-mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP was constructed by inserting a fragment from pcDNA3-mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP into the expression vector, pEDΔC previously described (52Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To construct pcDNA3-mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP, the SalI fragment containing d2EGFP from pd2EGFP (BD Biosciences) was treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, NotI restriction endonuclease, and then inserted into pcDNA3-XBP1-u (51Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) treated with EcoRV and NotI. pED-mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP was then constructed by inserting the AflII-Klenow-XbaI DNA fragment from pcDNA3-mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP into the vector pEDΔC treated with SalI-Klenow-XbaI. pRL-IXFL contains Renilla luciferase, the EMCV IRES, mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC (437-576 nt from the unspliced form of murine XBP (51Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) cDNA sequence), and firefly luciferase without the ATG initiation codon. The pRL-XFL vector has a similar structure as pRL-IXFL, but both the EMCV IRES sequence and the ATG initiation codon of mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC are not included (see Fig. 3B). cDNA of mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC (437-576 nt) was isolated from pcDNA3-mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP by PCR with two primers: 5′-TTTCCTCCATGGACTACAAAGACGACGACGACAAGCCTGACGAGGTTCCAGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCCTGATATCTGGGAAGATGTTCTGGGG-3′. Both the EMCV IRES fragment from pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) treated with NheI and NcoI, and the amplified mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC (437-576 nt) cDNA fragment treated with NcoI and EcoRV were inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) digested with NheI and EcoRV to produce the construct pIX. The cDNA of mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC (437-576 nt) was isolated from pcDNA3-mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP by PCR with two primers: 5′-TTTCCTGGATCCGACTACAAAGACGACGACGACAAGCCTGACGAGGTTCCAGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCCTGATATCTGGGAAGATGTTCTGGGG-3′. cDNA of firefly luciferase was amplified from pGL3-Pro (Promega) by PCR with two primers: 5′-TTTCCTGATATCACGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCCTTCTAGAATTACACGGCGATCTTTCC-3′. Both the amplified mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC (437-576 nt) cDNA fragment treated with BamHI and EcoRV, and the amplified firefly luciferase fragment treated with EcoRV and XbaI were inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) digested with BamHI and XbaI to produce the construct pXFL-1. The clones were confirmed by sequencing. pIXFL was constructed by inserting the firefly luciferase cDNA fragment from pXFL-1 treated with EcoRV and XbaI into the pIX vector treated with EcoRV and XbaI. pXFL-2 was constructed by inserting the mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC (437-576 nt)-firefly luciferase cDNA fragment of pXFL-1 treated with BamHI and XbaI into pIX vector treated with BamHI and XbaI. To construct pRL-IXFL, the IRES-mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC (437-576 nt)-firefly luciferase cDNA fragment from pIXFL treated with NheI and XbaI was inserted into pRL-CMV (Promega) treated with NheI and XbaI. To construct pRL-XFL, the mXBP1 ΔN/ΔC (437-576 nt)-firefly luciferase cDNA fragment from pXFL-2 treated with NheI and XbaI was inserted into pRL-CMV (Promega) treated with NheI and XbaI.FIGURE 3IRE1α-dependent splicing of mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP mRNA does not require translation. A, CHO/mXBP1ΔC(un)-d2EGFP cells were treated with Tg and cycloheximide (CHX). Total RNA samples were analyzed by RT-PCR using a primer set flanking the intron in the mXBP1ΔC(un/s)-d2EGFP mRNA. PCR products represent hybrid (H), unspliced (Un), and spliced (S) species. B, schematic diagrams of the expected dicistronic reporter mRNAs, before and after splicing of the 26-nt intron in the XBP1 mRNA region, produced from transfected pRL-IXFL and pRL-XFL plasmids. From pRL-IXFL transcripts, Renilla luciferase translation is directed by cap-dependent ribosome scanning. The translation of mXBP1ΔN/ΔC(un) (before UPR activation) and mXBP1ΔN/ΔC(s)-firefly luciferase (after UPR activation) are directed by IRES-dependent internal initiation. Although Renilla luciferase is continuously translated from pRL-XFL, mXBP1ΔN/ΔC(un) (before UPR activation) and mXBP1ΔN/ΔC(s)-firefly luciferase (after UPR activation) proteins are not produced due to the absence of the IRES. C and D, DHFR-deficient CHO cells were transfected with dicistronic plasmids. At 31 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with fresh medium with or without Tm (10 μg/ml) for 7 h and then either total RNA was isolated for RT-PCR analysis, or cell lysates were harvested and stored at -80 °C for dual luciferase assay. D, Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase activities were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the relative ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity in each cell lysates was calculated. E, wild-type and Ire1α/MEFs were nucleofected with the indicated plasmid DNAs (pRL-IXFL reporter plasmid and pED-hIRE1α-Flag/pEDΔC). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with Tm (10 μg/ml) for 8 h and then the cell lysates were prepared for luciferase activity assay.

The pSP64 poly(A)-mXBP1ΔC(un/s)-EGFP vector contains the murine XBP1ΔC (1-618 nt, unspliced form)/(1-593 nt, spliced form) cDNA sequences followed by EGFP and 30 “T” nucleotides under control of the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter. The pTM1-mXBP1ΔC(un/s)-EGFP vector contains the EMCV IRES followed by the mXBP1ΔC (1-618 nt, unspliced form)/(1-593 nt, spliced form) cDNA sequence and EGFP under the control of T7 RNA polymerase promoter. To construct pCMV-mXBP1ΔC(un/s)-EGFP, the mXBP1ΔC-un/s fragments from pcDNA3-XBP1-u/s treated with EcoRV and HindIII were inserted into pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences) treated with SalI-Klenow-HindIII. pSP64 poly(A)-mXBP1ΔC(un/s)-EGFP vectors were then constructed by inserting the DNA fragments from pCMV-mXBP1ΔC(un/s)-EGFP treated with NotI-Klenow-HindIII into the pSP64 poly(A) vector treated with SmaI and HindIII. pTM1-mXBP1ΔC(un/s)-EGFP vectors were then constructed by inserting the DNA fragments from pCMV-mXBP1ΔC(un/s)-EGFP treated with HindIII-NotI-Klenow into the vector pTM1 treated with StuI-NcoI-Klenow. To generate the Fv-IRE1α fusion protein, the portion of the mIRE1α cDNA encoding both kinase and RNase domain (amino acids 468-977) was fused to one modified FK506 binding domain (Fv1E) from plasmid pC4-Fv1E (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). The resultant vector pFv-IREΔN produces a cytosolic Fv-IREΔN-HA protein. The plasmid pC4-Fv1E was treated with SpeI and then ligated to mIRE1αΔN cDNA treated with SpeI. The mIRE1αΔN cDNA was isolated from pcDNA3.1-mIRE1α (54Miyoshi K. Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Taniguchi M. Mori Y. Hitomi J. Yui D. Manabe T. Gomi F. Yoneda T. Tohyama M. Brain Res. Mol.

To express nuclear- or membrane-localized Fv-IREΔN proteins, plasmids pNLS-Fv and pMyr-Fv were generated.

These include the extrinsic pathway via triggering of death receptors and the intrinsic pathway via DNA damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. In this study we investigated the effect of catalase and CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) overexpression on apoptosis induced by UVB exposure at room temperature or 4 °C on normal human keratinocytes. Irradiation at low temperature reduced UV-induced apoptosis by 40% in normal keratinocytes independently of any change in p53 and with a decrease in caspase-8 activation. Catalase overexpression decreased apoptosis by 40% with a reduction of caspase-9 activation accompanied by a decrease in p53. Keeping cells at low temperature and catalase overexpression had additive effects. CuZn-SOD overexpression had no significant effect on UVB-induced apoptosis. UVB induced an increase in ROS levels at two distinct stages: immediately following irradiation and around 3 h after irradiation. Catalase overexpression inhibited only the late increase in ROS levels. We conclude that catalase overexpression has a protective role against UVB irradiation by preventing DNA damage mediated by the late ROS increase.

We conclude that catalase overexpression has a protective role against UVB irradiation by preventing DNA damage mediated by the late ROS increase. One of the major effects of ultraviolet irradiation, especially in the UVB wavelength range, is the induction of apoptosis, which is characterized by morphological changes such as chromatin condensation, fragmentation of the nucleus, contraction of cytoplasmic volume, and emission of apoptotic bodies containing intact organelles. There are two apoptotic pathways by which caspase activation is triggered. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by the trimerization of cell membrane death receptors followed by the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) 2The abbreviations used are: DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CAT, catalase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; PI, propidium iodide; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CM-H2DCF, 6-chloromethyl-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CAT, catalase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; PI, propidium iodide; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CM-H2DCF, 6-chloromethyl-2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. through recruitment of the adapter molecule FADD (Fas-associated death domain) and procaspase-8. Activation of this initiator caspase by an autocatalytic cleavage in DISC promotes the subsequent procaspase activation cascade (1Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J.

The intrinsic pathway is triggered by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm following death signals. Procaspase-9 activation occurs in the apoptosome, which is formed by association of cytosolic cytochrome c, Apaf-1, dATP, and procaspase-9 (4Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). Activation of these initiator caspases (caspase-8 and -9) via either pathway activates a group of effector caspases such as caspase-3, which cleave a variety of cellular death substrates (such as protein kinase Cδ), leading finally to apoptosis (3Okada H. Mak T.W. Nat. Rev. 2004; 4: 592-603Crossref Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 5Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev.

UVB-induced apoptosis is a highly complex process involving the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, but it is unclear how these pathways are interrelated. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that UVB is able to activate directly cell surface receptors such as CD95/Fas by inducing receptor clustering, without the need for specific ligands (7Schwarz A.

Reduction of UVB-induced apoptosis through inhibition of receptor clustering by keeping cells at low temperature (4–10 °C) during UVB irradiation or prevention of DISC formation by expressing a dominant negative FADD supports this notion (11Kulms D.

Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). While UVB is known to be an inducer of ROS formation (16Masaki H. Atsumi T. Sakurai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 17: 474-479Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Peus D. Vasa R.A. Beyerle A. Meves A. Krautmacher C. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest.

Symp. 1995; 61: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the source of this ROS production is not precisely known. It has been shown that UVB can induce the production of superoxide anion radical (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which could subsequently be converted to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (·OH) via the Fenton (Fe2++H2O2→Fe3++·OH+−OH) and Haber-Weiss (O2·¯+H2O2→O2+·OH+−OH) reactions (19Matés J.M. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). To neutralize these ROS, living cells have acquired various defense systems including non-enzymatic (α-tocopherol, vitamin C) and enzymatic antioxidants. In particular, O2− is converted to less reactive H2O2 and O2 by superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme present in three forms in humans, namely a cytosolic CuZn-SOD, a mitochondrial Mn-SOD and an extracellular one (EC-SOD). H2O2 is converted to H2O and O2 either by catalase (CAT) located in peroxisomes or glutathione peroxidase located in mitochondria and also in the cytoplasm (19Matés J.M. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that an increase in antioxidant defense systems can reduce the deleterious effects of UV-induced ROS. The protective effects of non-enzymatic antioxidants or radical scavengers on UVB-induced damage have been reported (20Pelle E. Hung X. Mammone T. Marenus K. Maes D. Frenkek K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 177-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Maalouf S. El-Sabban M. Drawiche N. Gali-Muhtasib H. Mol.

B Biol. 2003; 72: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a reduction in UVB-induced apoptosis in SV40-transformed human keratinocytes overexpressing CuZn-SOD has been documented (23Follenzi A. Ailles L.E. Bakovic S. Geuna M. Naldini L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Taken together, the evidence to date suggests that DNA damage, death receptor activation, and ROS formation all contribute to UVB-induced apoptosis in different ways (24Kulms D. Zeise E. Pöppelmann B. Schwarz T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5844-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Despite rapid progress in understanding apoptosis, the role of ROS production in cell death and its relationships with other apoptotic events are still unclear. In the present study using UVB irradiation of normal human keratinocytes sustainably overexpressing the lentivirus-mediated catalase and/or CuZn-SOD enzymes at room temperature or at 4 °C, we further investigated the role of UVB-induced ROS in keratinocyte apoptosis. Source of Keratinocytes and Irradiation Procedure—Keratinocytes were isolated from normal human skin in patients undergoing plastic surgery. Briefly, fresh skin fragments were immediately cut into 5 × 5-mm pieces and treated with trypsin-EDTA for 3 h at 37°C or overnight at 4 °C to separate epidermis from dermis. Keratinocytes were seeded at a concentration of 105 cells per cm2 in MCDB153 medium, which included hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), and bovine pituitary extract (70 μg/ml) (all from Sigma). The medium was changed three times a week. When the cultures reached 70–80% confluence, the cells were detached with 10% trypsin-EDTA and then resuspended in MCDB153 medium. UVB irradiation was delivered with a Biotronic device (Vilber Lourmat, Marne la Vallée, France) equipped with a dosimeter in which the UVB lamp emitted a continuous spectrum between 280 and 380 nm with a major peak at 312 nm, as already described (25Cario-André M. Briganti S. Picardo M. Nikaido O. Gall Y. Ginestar J. Taieb A. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2002; 68: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For irradiation at 4 °C, the cells grown in monolayers were kept at 4 °C for 30 min, rinsed in cold PBS, and irradiated in a cold tank. For irradiation at room temperature, cells were rinsed in PBS at 37 °C and irradiated at room temperature. Control cells were subjected to the identical procedure but without exposure to UV. Viability Testing—Keratinocyte survival rate following irradiation was measured by the trypan blue exclusion test. Cells were grown to 70% confluence and irradiated as described above. At different times after irradiation, cells were detached with 10% trypsin-EDTA and then resuspended in PBS. The resuspended cells were diluted 1:1 in trypan blue solution. Cell viability was expressed as the percentage trypan blue excluded cells versus total cells. Construction and Production of Lentiviral Vectors—The pRRL.SIN. PPT.PGK.MCS.WPRE and the pRRL.SIN.PPT.PGK.EGFP.WPRE vectors, hereafter termed TPW and TPEW, were a generous gift from D. Trono (Université de Genève, Genève, Switzerland) (26Cudre-Mauroux C. Occhiodoro T. Konig S. Salmon P. Bernheim L. Trono D. Hum. Gene Ther. 2003; 14: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The different vectors (TPCATW and TPCuZnSODW, see Fig. 1A) were constructed by inserting catalase (CAT) and CuZn-SOD cDNAs into the multiple cloning site of the TPW vector. Expression of EGFP, CAT, and CuZn-SOD was driven by the human phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Lentiviral particles were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells as described previously (27Géronimi F. Richard E. Redonnet-Vernhet I. Lamrissi-Garcia I. Lalanne M. Ged C. Moreau-Gaudry F. de Verneuil H. Stem Cells. 2003; 21: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The following plasmids were used: a packaging plasmid (pCMVΔ8.91), a vesicular somatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) envelope plasmid pMD.G, and a transducing vector (TPW, TPEW, TPCATW, TPCuZnSODW). Using a calcium phosphate transfection technique, 10 μg of pCMVΔ8.91, 4 μg of pMD.G, and 10 μg of transducing vector were used per 10-cm diameter Petri dish. After 48 h, the viral supernatant was harvested, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 4 h, and frozen in aliquots. To determine the titer of each viral supernatant, serial dilutions were used for transduction of 293T cells. Following transduction, EGFP expression was measured directly by cytofluorimetric analysis (FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences). Typical titers after concentration for lentiviral vectors were between 2 × 108 and 2 × 109 infectious particles/ml. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of p24 were used to determine the concentration of viral p24 protein in the different viral supernatants. Titration was done by comparing the p24 concentration of the different supernatants and the specific titers of EGFP. Transduction of Keratinocytes—5 × 105 cells were plated in T25 flasks and incubated for 24 h in complete medium. Prior to infection, medium was removed and cells were infected with viral supernatants for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 8 μg/ml protamine sulfate. After 5 days, the percentage of EGFP-positive cells was analyzed by cytofluorimetry. Determination of Catalase and SOD Activities—The cells were sonicated in 0.1 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) for two 30-s bursts. After 10 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g, aliquots of the obtained supernatant were stored at –80 °C. Total protein concentration was measured by the BCA kit reagent (Pierce, Bezons, France). SOD was assayed by using the SOD Assay Kit-WST (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). Catalase was measured by Amplex Red Catalase Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France). Standard curves for the enzymatic activities of SOD and catalase were drawn by using purified enzyme preparations. Enzyme-specific activities were expressed as units/mg of protein. One unit of catalase activity was defined as 1 μ mol of H2O2 consumed per min. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that inhibits 50% of the WST-1 formazan per minute. Apoptosis, Necrosis, and DNA Fragmentation Analysis—For apoptosis and necrosis measurements, keratinocytes were incubated for 16 h after irradiation with 5 μmol/liter FITC-VAD-FMK (Promega), which binds to activated caspases, for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C. To assess plasma membrane permeability, 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI, Sigma) was added, and cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. For DNA fragmentation analysis, cells were resuspended in hypotonic staining buffer (50 μg/ml PI, 100 mg/ml RNase, 3.8 mm sodium citrate, and 0.3% Triton X-100) in the dark at 4 °C for 30 min and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells with DNA content less than the G1 amount of untreated cells were considered apoptotic. Quantification of Proteins by Western Blotting—To determine activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and accumulation of total p53 and serine 15-phosphorylated p53, cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, Triton X-100, 1% v/v protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min. After 10 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g, aliquots of the supernatant were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the BCA reagent kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 1.2 V/cm2 for 1 h 20 min. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature on a shaker, then were incubated at 4 °C overnight with 1:1000 dilution of the anti-caspase-3, -8, and -9 monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Tebu-Bio, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) or anti-human p53 and serine 15-phosphorylated p53 (Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-catalase (Rockland, Tebu-Bio) or anti-CuZn-SOD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu-Bio). The blots were washed with TBS-T (3 × 10 min) and incubated at room temperature with 1:10,000 dilution of anti-immunoglobin horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Vector Laboratories, Biovalley S.A, Marne la Vallée, France) for 1 h. The chemiluminescence ECL reagent was used to develop the blots after washing the membrane three times for 10 min with TBS-T and twice with TBS alone. Measurement of Intracellular ROS—The intracellular production of ROS was assayed using the CM-H2DCF-DA probe (Molecular Probes). Briefly, after addition of CM-H2DCF-DA (5 μm), the cells were incubated for 15 min in the dark at 37 °C. CM-H2DCF is oxidized by ROS to the highly fluorescent CM-DCF compound. After two washes with PBS, the cells were detached by trypsin-EDTA and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Ten-thousand individual data points were collected for each sample. To study ROS production by fluorescence microscopy, keratinocytes grown on glass coverslips in 3.5-cm wells were loaded with CM-H2DCF-DA as mentioned above. After two washes in PBS, cells were observed and photographed with a fluorescence microscope. Statistics—Student's t test was applied for statistical evaluation and a p value of <0.05 (* on Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) was considered significant. Results are presented as means ± S.D.FIGURE 4Measurement of DNA fragmentation. 16 h after UVB irradiation at 4 °C or room temperature, catalase- or CuZn-SOD-transduced keratinocytes and non-transduced keratinocytes were stained with PI.

The percentage of EGFP-positive cells was determined by cytofluorimetry 5 days post-transduction and was between 85 and 95% (Fig. 1B). The increase in the amount of catalase and/or CuZn-SOD proteins following transduction was assayed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Corresponding enzyme activities were measured after 5 days of culture (Fig. 1D). In the cells transduced by catalase or CuZn-SOD, the activity of each enzyme was much greater than in the non-transduced cells: 7.1-fold for catalase and 8-fold for CuZn-SOD. In the cells co-transduced with the catalase- and the CuZn-SOD-expressing vectors, both enzyme activities were increased (7.3-fold for catalase and 7.5-fold for CuZn-SOD). Transduction of cells by catalase-expressing vector did not affect SOD activity or vice versa. Keratinocytes Irradiated at 4 °C Are Less Susceptible to UVB-induced Apoptosis Compared with Cells Irradiated at Room Temperature, and Catalase Overexpession Reduces This Susceptibility in Both Conditions—Initially, the trypan blue exclusion assay was performed to evaluate viability of keratinocytes following irradiation. As shown in Fig. 2, the viability of keratinocytes decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The viability of irradiated keratinocytes was 78 ± 10% compared with nonirradiated controls 24 h after irradiation at the dose of 200 mJ·cm–2. This dose was selected for further experiments. Keratinocytes undergoing apoptosis following UVB irradiation were characterized by using FITC-VAD-FMK, which binds to activated caspases, and PI as an indicator of plasma membrane permeability. In Fig. 3A, the FITC-VAD-FMK- and PI-negative cells correspond to intact cells, FITC-VAD-FMK-positive PI-negative cells are apoptotic cells and the FITC-VAD-FMK- and PI-positive cells correspond to late apoptotic/necrotic cells. The percentage of apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic cells following UVB irradiation is shown in Fig. 3B. The percentage of apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic cells in keratinocytes irradiated at 4 °C was lower than the percentage found in keratinocytes irradiated at room temperature. For keratinocytes overexpressing catalase, there was a marked reduction of apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic cells in both conditions compared with the corresponding controls. This result was specific for the catalase enzyme and was not found with CuZn-SOD overexpression. The same results were found by measuring DNA fragmentation using flow cytometry (Fig. 4): the percentage of cells with a DNA content less than the G1 amount (sub-G1 DNA) after irradiation at 4 °C was lower than the percentage found following irradiation at room temperature. Again, catalase (but not CuZn-SOD) overexpression had a protective effect in both conditions. Catalase Overexpression Decreases Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 Activation and Also Reduces p53 and Serine 15-phosphorylated p53 Accumulation in UVB-irradiated Keratinocytes—UVB-induced apoptosis is a complex process in which extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are involved. The additive effect of death receptor clustering inhibition (by keeping the cells at 4 °C) and of ROS formation prevention (by catalase overexpression) on apoptosis suggests that UVB irradiation acts by two independent mechanisms. We thus investigated caspase-8, -9, and -3 activation 16 h after UVB irradiation at 4 °C and room temperature. As shown in Fig. 5, in cells irradiated at 4 °C, there was a clear decrease in activation of caspase-8 and -3 as compared with cells irradiated at room temperature. Caspase-9 activation was similar in both conditions. Cells overexpressing catalase, irradiated at 4 °C or room temperature, showed a 30% reduction in caspase-9 and -3 and a 9% decrease in caspase-8 activation compared with corresponding non-transduced keratinocytes. These data indicate that keeping cells at low temperature reduces UVB-induced apoptosis by inhibition of caspase-8 activation, whereas catalase overexpression reduces apoptosis mostly by inhibition of caspase-9 activation and slightly by reduction of caspase-8 activation. To investigate whether ROS-induced DNA damage is involved in the induction of apoptosis following UVB irradiation, total p53 and serine 15-phosphorylated p53 proteins were assessed (Fig. 5, A, E, and F). Following UVB irradiation, accumulation of p53 protein was not affected by keeping cells at low temperature during irradiation but was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing catalase. These data indicate that UVB-induced ROS participate in apoptosis by DNA damage formation and consequently p53 induction. ROS Level Increases in Two Distinct Stages following UVB Irradiation, while Catalase Overexpression Prevents the Second Increase—To examine the effects of UVB-induced ROS on apoptosis in more detail, a kinetic analysis of intracellular ROS formation was performed. As shown in Fig. 6A, UVB irradiation induced ROS production at two different time intervals. The initial increase in ROS levels took place at the time of irradiation and declined rapidly in a time-dependent manner, reaching the base-line level around 1 h post-UVB. The second increase took place around 3 h after irradiation and persisted for 6 h. Kinetic analysis of ROS production by fluorescence microscopy confirmed this result (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, ROS levels at the time of irradiation were higher in cells irradiated at low temperature than in cells irradiated at room temperature (Fig. 6A) but the second peak was similar. Intracellular ROS levels were then measured in catalase- and CuZn-SOD-transduced keratinocytes (Fig. 7). Overexpression of catalase and CuZn-SOD led to a significant decrease in endogenous ROS level in non-irradiated conditions at both 4 °C (data not shown) and room temperature. Following irradiation at 4 °C (data not shown) or room temperature, catalase overexpression completely prevented the late increase in ROS levels (after 3 h), but it did not abolish the first peak (at the time of irradiation). In contrast, CuZn-SOD overexpression had no significant effect on the ROS level following irradiation. Recent studies on UV-induced apoptosis have shown that DNA damage, death receptor activation, and ROS formation participate independently in the formation of apoptotic cells (24Kulms D. Zeise E. Pöppelmann B. Schwarz T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5844-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Murphy G. Young A.R. Wulf H.C. Kulms D. Schwarz T. Exp.

The present study focused on the respective roles of catalase and CuZn-SOD in the protection of keratinocytes against UVB-induced apoptosis. Keeping human keratinocytes at low temperature decreased UVB-induced apoptosis by reducing caspase-8 activation, independently of any change in p53. It has been shown that exposure of HeLa cells and HaCat cells to UVB at low temperature prevents UV-induced clustering of death receptors and that this inhibition is associated with a reduction in apoptosis (8Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 12Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with zIETD, an inhibitor of caspase-8, led to the same results (24Kulms D. Zeise E. Pöppelmann B. Schwarz T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5844-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Aragane et al. (12Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Pöppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) suggested that death receptor aggregation may be independent of p53, since they obtained similar findings with p53-mutated (HaCat) and p53 wild-type (SCL-1) cells. We observed a reduction in UVB-induced apoptosis in catalase-transduced keratinocytes compared with non-transduced or CuZn-SOD-transduced cells and found that this protective effect of catalase is mainly due to a reduction in caspase-9 activation and partially to a reduction in caspase-8 activation and that it is accompanied by a decrease in p53 accumulation. It has been reported that decreased UVB-induced apoptosis due to radical scavengers (such as pyrrolidene dithiocarbamate or N-acetylcysteine) is accompanied by a reduction in cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm (24Kulms D. Zeise E. Pöppelmann B. Schwarz T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5844-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that occurs upstream of caspase-9 activation. To explain why catalase has a protective effect against UVB irradiation but not CuZn-SOD, we hypothesized that CuZn-SOD overexpression lowered superoxide anion levels but led to a deleterious excess in intracellular H2O2, which cannot be quenched by endogenous catalase. The tumor suppressor protein p53, which functions as a latent, short lived transcription factor, accumulates following various stresses, including oxidative stress, DNA-damaging agent, and UV irradiation (30Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 31Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 accumulation in response to ROS exposure facilitates the repair of ROS-induced DNA damage (33Achanta G. Huang P. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6233-6239Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduction in p53 accumulation upon catalase overexpression suggests that the protective effect of catalase against UVB-induced apoptosis takes place through a reduction in ROS-induced DNA damage. Stabilization and functional activation of p53 occurs in response to DNA damage via complex mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is phosphorylation of p53 at N- and C-terminal residues, especially at serine 15, by which interaction of the protein with its negative regulator MDM2 is abolished (30Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 34Steegenga W.T. Vandereb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the reduction in serine 15-phosphorylated p53 accumulation reflects the decreased DNA damage noted in irradiated keratinocytes overexpressing catalase (compared with non-transduced cells). UVB-induced apoptosis is a protective mechanism, since it eliminates cells with damaged DNA. Therefore, inhibition of UVB-induced cell death may enhance the carcinogenic risk, unless it is associated with an increase in removal of DNA damage. According to our results, the prevention of UVB-induced apoptosis by catalase overexpression is accompanied by a reduction in DNA damage and does not seem to promote the survival of cells with damaged DNA. Measurement of intracellular ROS demonstrated that UVB irradiation induced ROS production at two distinct stages. Two phases of ROS production were also reported in a model of apoptosis induced by glutamate in the HT22 cell line (35Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and in apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation in the IM-9 cell line (36Chen Q. Chai Y.C. Mazumder S. Jiang C. Macklis R.M. Chisolm G.M. Almasan A. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the initial increase in ROS levels detected immediately after irradiation, declined very rapidly (within 1 h). This finding is consistent with observations reported by Wang et al. (30Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) demonstrating that ROS production in irradiated immortalized keratinocytes decreased in a time-dependent manner and was no longer significantly different from controls at 90 min post-UVB. ROS can be generated by mitochondria via enzyme complexes during normal processes of oxidative phosphorylation. Numerous cytosolic enzymes including cyclooxygenase, nitric oxide synthase, xanthine oxidase, and the plasma membrane-bound NADPH oxidase can also generate ROS. Although the source of ROS production following irradiation is not definitely known, several studies have suggested that UVB irradiation induces an immediate increase in intracellular ROS via the activation of NADPH oxidase activity (37Wang H. Kochevar I.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 890-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 38Beak S.M. Lee Y.S. Kim J.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our results using catalase and CuZn-SOD overexpression are consistent with this mechanism. In keratinocytes overexpressing catalase, activation of NADPH oxidase causes an increase in superoxide anion (detected using CM-H2DCF), which cannot be quenched by catalase. In the case of overexpression of CuZn-SOD, superoxide anion is rapidly converted to H2O2, which can also be detected using the CM-H2DCF probe. Pretreatment of keratinocytes with an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium) prior to irradiation abolished the initial increase in ROS levels (data not shown), thus confirming this hypothesis. The source of the second increase in ROS levels remains to be determined, but the reduction in apoptosis, accompanied by a decrease in caspase-9 activation, suggests that mitochondria could be the main source of this ROS generation. The reduction in apoptosis when the late increase in ROS levels is prevented in keratinocytes overexpressing catalase suggests that this second peak of ROS production has a major role in ROS-mediated UVB-induced apoptosis. This finding is consistent with the results of Chen et al. (36Chen Q. Chai Y.C. Mazumder S. Jiang C. Macklis R.M. Chisolm G.M. Almasan A. Cell Death. Differ. 2003; 10: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the late ROS increase following ionizing radiation is associated with increased mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, collapse of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, and cytochrome c release. After addition of H2O2 to cultured keratinocytes just before irradiation (data not shown), we found that a mild increase in ROS level at the time of irradiation did not increase UVB-induced apoptosis. This result suggests that an increase in ROS levels at the time of irradiation has no effect on apoptosis. This finding is consistent with the results of Kulms et al. (24Kulms D. Zeise E. Pöppelmann B. Schwarz T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5844-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) demonstrating that addition of a ROS scavenger (pyrrolidene dithiocarbamate) up to 1 h after UVB exposure has a maximal reducing effect on UVB-induced apoptosis. The role of the first increase in ROS levels remains unclear, but recent data suggest that ROS can also function as a second messenger to induce signal transduction. The mode of action of ROS may involve direct interaction with specific receptors and/or redox activation of members of signaling pathways such as protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and transcription factors (39Michiels C. Minet E. Mottet D. Raes M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 40Hensley K. Robinson K.A. Gabbita S.P. Salsman S. Floyd R.A. Free Radic. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 11: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), which in turn can regulate cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell death. In conclusion, this study is the first to show that UVB irradiation induces an increase in ROS levels at two different time intervals and that the second (but not the first) increase in ROS production has a major role in UVB-induced apoptosis. These findings further support the concept of a reinforcement of natural antioxidant photoprotective defenses to prevent severe sunburn and probably skin cancer. Catalase overexpression was one of the two potential enzymatic photoprotectors tested and performs better than SOD in this respect."
https://openalex.org/W2049490068,"Stress-inducible HSP27 protects cells from death through various mechanisms. We have recently demonstrated that HSP27 can also enhance the degradation of some proteins through the proteasomal pathway. Here, we show that one of these proteins is the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1. The ubiquitination and degradation of this protein that favors progression through the cell cycle was previously shown to involve either a Skp2-dependent mechanism,i.e., at the S-/G2-transition, or a KPC (Kip1 ubiquitination-promoting complex)-dependent mechanism, i.e.,at the G0/G1 transition. In this work, we demonstrate that, in response to serum depletion, p27Kip1 cellular content first increases then progressively decreases as cells begin to die. In this stressful condition, HSP27favors p27Kip1 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. A similar observation was made in response to stress induced by the NO donor glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). HSP27-mediated ubiquitination ofp27Kip1 does not require its phosphorylation on Thr187 or Ser-10, nor does it depend on the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase E3 complex. It facilitates the G1/S transition,which suggests that, in stressful conditions, HSP27might render quiescent cells competent to re-enter the cell cycle."

PCC 7002 and all other cyanobacteria that synthesize phycocyanin have a gene, cpcT, that is paralogous to cpeT, a gene of unknown function affecting phycoerythrin synthesis in Fremyella diplosiphon. A cpcT null mutant contains 40% less phycocyanin than wild type and produces smaller phycobilisomes with red-shifted absorbance and fluorescence emission maxima. Phycocyanin from the cpcT mutant has an absorbance maximum at 634 nm compared with 626 nm for the wild type. The phycocyanin β-subunit from the cpcT mutant has slightly smaller apparent molecular weight on SDS-PAGE. Purified phycocyanins from the cpcT mutant and wild type were cleaved with formic acid, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. No phycocyanobilin chromophore was bound to the peptide containing Cys-153 derived from the phycocyanin β-subunit of the cpcT mutant. Recombinant CpcT was used to perform in vitro bilin addition assays with apophycocyanin (CpcA/CpcB) and phycocyanobilin. Depending on the source of phycocyanobilin, reaction products with CpcT had absorbance maxima between 597 and 603 nm as compared with 638 nm for the control reactions, in which mesobiliverdin becomes covalently bound. After trypsin digestion and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, the CpcT reaction product produced one major phycocyanobilin-containing peptide. This peptide had a retention time identical to that of the tryptic peptide that includes phycocyanobilin-bound, cysteine 153 of wild-type phycocyanin. The results from characterization of the cpcT mutant as well as the in vitro biochemical assays demonstrate that CpcT is a new phycocyanobilin lyase that specifically attaches phycocyanobilin to Cys-153 of the phycocyanin β-subunit."

However, the detailed signaling mechanisms mediated by flagellin/TLR5 engagement are not clear. Here we dissected the biochemical mechanism by which TLR5 engagement mediates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation in colonic epithelial cells. We demonstrate that silencing TLR5 expression in nontransformed human colonic epithelial cells blocks flagellin-induced PI3K activation, indicating specific activation of PI3K by flagellin/TLR5 engagement. Moreover, we determine that TLR5 recruits the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to its cytoplasmic TIR domain in response to flagellin. However, the Src homology binding “YXXM” motif in the cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR5 is not involved in p85 recruitment, implying that TLR5 indirectly recruits p85.

TLRs are composed of an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain recognizing its specific agonists and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain responsible for mediating downstream signaling that plays a critical role in TLRs-associated innate immunity and proinflammatory responses (3Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Among at least 11 members of the TLR family characterized to date, TLR5 is a specific receptor for flagellin from both commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut and highly expressed in colonic epithelial cells (4Rhee S.H.

Previously, we showed that TLR5 engagement by bacterial flagellin mediates MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6-dependent signaling resulting in the activation of transcription factor NFκB and AP-1 and leading to up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression such as IL-8 and MIP3α in nontransformed human colonic epithelial cells, NCM460 (4Rhee S.H.

More recently, we also characterized the pathophysiological role of flagellin in an experimental colitis model using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) (5Rhee S.H. Im E. Riegler M. Kokkotou E. O'Brien M. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13610-13615Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). According to our recent results, only injured, not intact colonic mucosa is highly vulnerable to intracolonic flagellin, causing proinflammatory gene expression and histologically evident colonic inflammation. These data strongly indicate that bacterial flagellin in the gut participates in the development and progress of colonic inflammation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphoinositides at position 3 of the inositol ring, leading to activation of the well characterized serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (6Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). Class 1 PI3Ks are composed of a p85 regulatory subunit interacting with an upstream signaling molecule, generally a membrane receptor, and a p110 catalytic subunit responsible for their enzymatic activity (6Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). This class of PI3Ks can be activated by various receptor-mediated extracellular stimuli, including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, IL-1R, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (7Arbibe L. Mira J.P. Teusch N.

The human gut harbors a large collection of commensal microbes, releasing various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (2Akira S. Curr. Opin.

Townsend C.M. Jr. Evers B.M. Gut. 2003; 52: 1472-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) recently showed that PI3K activation is essential for intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo by inducing cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, the up-regulation of PI3K has been suggested to cause a hyperproliferative epithelium (15Ferrand A. Bertrand C. Portolan G. Cui G. Carlson J. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Dufresne M. Wang T.C. Seva C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2770-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed, increased PI3K activity was observed in a majority of colon cancers (16Barrett K.E. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1543-1546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Therefore, inappropriate TLR engagement probably results in an aberrant PI3K activation leading to a hyperproliferative epithelium. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which TLR5 activates PI3K have not been studied. In this study, we demonstrate that in nontransformed human colonic epithelial cells, the adaptor molecule MyD88 binds to TLR5 in response to flagellin, and MyD88 recruits the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, implying that MyD88 plays a bridging role between TLR5 and the p85 regulatory subunit. These results provide a molecular mechanism whereby TLR5 engagement by bacterial flagellin leads to activation of PI3K in human colonic epithelial cells.

To generate TLR5 (Y798F)-HA, we performed the first PCR using TLR5 WT-HA as template and primers F-1 harboring Y798F substitution and R-2. Then, by using the first PCR product as reverse primer and F-2 primer, we performed the second PCR with TLR5 WT as a template. The second PCR product was inserted into XbaI and BamHI sites in the pUNO-TLR5-HA construct, resulting in the TLR5 (Y798F)-HA construct. To generate TLR5 (Y815F)-HA and TLR5 (Y798F/Y815F)-HA, the first PCR was done with primers F-3 containing the Y815F mutation and R-1 and TLR5 WT-HA as a template. The second PCR was performed with the first PCR product and F-2 as primers, and TLR5 WT-HA or TLR5 (Y798F)-HA was used as a template. The PCR product from the second PCR was inserted into XbaI and BamHI sites in the pUNO-TLR5-HA construct, giving rise to TLR5 (Y815F)-HA and TLR5 (Y798F/Y815F)-HA constructs, respectively.

The primer F-2 and the first PCR product were used for the second PCR with TLR5 WT-HA to generate TLR5 (Y691F)-HA. PCR was again performed with primers R-1 and F-5 possessing Y693F/Y696F mutations and a template TLR5 (Y691F)-HA. The PCR product was used as primers along with F-2 and TLR5 (Y691F)-HA as a template.

Slides were washed with PBS and blocked with normal goat serum (1%) plus 1% free bovine serum albumin (1%) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Slides were then incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (1:50 dilution) against FOXO1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in bovine serum albumin (1%), PBS. Samples were then washed with PBS and incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200) for 1 h. The slides were then rinsed and mounted with DAPI mounting solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioskop-2 microscope. Generating TLR5 or MyD88 Silenced Cells—The silencing vector expressing siRNA targeting the human TLR5 or MyD88 were obtained from InvivoGen (San Diego) (19Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). NCM460 or HEK293 cells were transfected with the silencing vector and an empty control vector. Stably transfected cells were isolated in selection media containing Zeocin. Silencing of the target molecule was confirmed in several isolated colonies. Immunoblotting Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The equal amount of total protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies was performed as described previously (4Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25179-25188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Assay—Total cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer as described above. Equal amounts of total protein were mixed with a primary antibody or control IgG and incubated at 4 °C for 4–5 h. The protein-A or -G beads (Pierce) were then added and incubated overnight. The precipitants were washed three times with lysis buffer and fractionated on SDS-PAGE, followed by the immunoblotting procedure described above. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were plated in 6-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) and transfected with the appropriate plasmid DNA, including a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (HSP70-β-gal) as an internal control, using SuperFect transfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after transfection, cells were stimulated with flagellin (100 ng/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), IL-1 (50 ng/ml), or tumor necrosis factor-α (50 ng/ml) for 6 h, and the relative luciferase activity was determined by normalization with β-galactosidase activity as described previously (4Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25179-25188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The total amount of plasmid DNA was kept consistent by adding the empty vector for each transfection. All assays were performed in triplicate, and a single representative experiment is shown. Data are expressed as mean values ± S.E. IL-8 and MIP3α Measurement—An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the level of human IL-8 and MIP3α using the appropriate kits from BIOSOURCE and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively, by following the manufacturer's instructions. All assays were performed in triplicate, and data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Human Cytokine Array—The human cytokine array 5.1 was purchased from Ray Biotech (Norcross, GA). Membranes immobilized with various capture antibodies against 79 different cytokines were used, as we described previously (4Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25179-25188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Infection of Adenoviruses—The recombinant adenoviruses, Adeno-p85-DN and control Adeno-lacZ, were generous gifts from Dr. Masato Kasuga, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine (Japan) (20Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For infection, NCM460 cells (2.0 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were cultivated for a day and incubated with the adenoviruses at the same multiplicity of infection (plaque-forming units per cell) in culture media for 6 h at 37 °C. The virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium and cultivated for 1 day. Cells were stimulated with flagellin (100 ng/ml) overnight, and IL-8 was measured in the culture media. The expression of p85-DN was also confirmed by immunoblotting analysis in the cell lysates. Bacterial Flagellin Stimulation Activates PI3K in Human Nontransformed Colonocytes—We showed recently (5Rhee S.H. Im E. Riegler M. Kokkotou E. O'Brien M. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13610-13615Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) that the disrupted colonic mucosa is sensitive to the proinflammatory responses of bacterial flagellin. We also showed in compromised colonic mucosa that bacterial flagellin is able to induce in vivo activation of MEK1/2, an important modulator of flagellin-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression (4Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25179-25188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Rhee S.H. Im E. Riegler M. Kokkotou E. O'Brien M. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13610-13615Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this context, we used the experimental DSS-induced colitis model as described in our recent publication (5Rhee S.H. Im E. Riegler M. Kokkotou E. O'Brien M. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13610-13615Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) to investigate if intracolonic exposure of bacterial flagellin in injured colonic mucosa is able to induce PI3K activation. To test this, LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ mice were given a low dose of DSS (2.5%) in their drinking water for the duration of the experiment. Four days after DSS administration, flagellin (0.8–1.0 μg/mice) was intracolonically administered daily for 7 days, and then total protein extracts from colonic tissues were prepared from all mouse groups, as described previously (5Rhee S.H. Im E. Riegler M. Kokkotou E. O'Brien M. Pothoulakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13610-13615Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PI3K activation by bacterial flagellin was investigated by evaluating Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation that is a well characterized downstream molecular event of PI3K. As shown in Fig. 1A, flagellin exposed to the disintegrated colon because of DSS administration resulted in PI3K activation evaluated by Akt phosphorylation, whereas flagellin exposure failed to induce PI3K activation in intact colon. These data indicate that intracolonic flagellin is capable of activating PI3K only in compromised colonic mucosa. However, the specific cell type in which PI3K is activated by bacterial flagellin is not evident. Smythies et al. (21Smythies L.E. Sellers M. Clements R.H. Mosteller-Barnum M. Meng G. Benjamin W.H. Orenstein J.M. Smith P.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) showed that human intestinal macrophages are anergic to various inflammatory stimuli, including LPS. In addition, TLR5, a specific receptor for bacterial flagellin, is highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells such as the adenocarcinoma cell lines HT29 and T84, as well as in nontransformed human NCM460 colonocytes, as we described previously (4Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25179-25188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated if flagellin/TLR5 engagement induces PI3K activation in NCM460 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, flagellin/TLR5 engagement transiently phosphorylates Akt within 10 min, and this effect is evident for up to 40 min after stimulation. Flagellin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation is blocked by the PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 1C), indicating that Akt phosphorylation is mediated by PI3K activated in response to flagellin and suggesting that Akt phosphorylation can be used as a readout for PI3K activation in NCM460 cells. Moreover, because activation of Akt results in the phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor Foxo1, followed by the inhibition of translocation of Foxo1 to the nucleus (22Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar), another readout of PI3K activation is the expected localization of Foxo1 that should be expelled from the nucleus by PI3K activation. Thus, we examined if flagellin stimulation to NCM460 cells inhibits FOXO1 translocation to the nucleus by immunofluorescence staining with an antibody recognizing FOXO1. As shown in Fig. 1D, control cells show the presence of FOXO1 (in red) at the nucleus (counterstained by DAPI, in blue). In contrast, in cells stimulated with flagellin FOXO1 is localized outside the nuclei (Fig. 1D). The merged image of FOXO1 and DAPI nuclei counterstaining confirmed that FOXO1 is re-localized to the cytoplasmic region following flagellin exposure (Fig. 1D). Together, these data demonstrate that flagellin/TLR5 engagement induces PI3K activation in nontransformed human colonocytes. Flagellin-stimulated PI3K Activation Is TLR5-specific—Although flagellin is a specific ligand for TLR5 and our flagellin preparation had minimal LPS contamination (<1 pg/μg LPS content as determined by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Assay), we performed additional experiments to confirm the “TLR5 specificity” of our flagellin preparation using a TLR5 silencing approach. TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells were generated by stably transfecting a TLR5 siRNA-expressing vector into NCM460 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblotting analysis verified that TLR5 expression is substantially reduced in TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2A). We next verified whether NFκB activation is indeed knocked down in TLR5-silenced cell in response to flagellin. To address this, because NFκB activation is a canonical outcome of TLR engagement, TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells were transiently transfected with an NFκB-luciferase reporter plasmid followed by measuring NFκB reporter activity in response to flagellin. As shown in Fig. 2B, TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells were not responsive to flagellin stimulation, but they responded to IL-1 that utilizes a conserved molecular signaling pathway downstream of the TLR5 and IL-1 receptor, implying the specific inhibition of TLR5-mediated signaling at the receptor level (1O'Neill L.A. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 687-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, NCM460 cells transfected with control vector were responsive to flagellin, as measured by NFκB reporter activity (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, because flagellin stimulation of NCM460 cells leads to IL-8 production (4Rhee S.H. Keates A.C. Moyer M.P. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25179-25188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), knockdown of TLR5 expression should inhibit flagellin-induced IL-8 production in TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells. To test this, we treated TLR5-silenced and control NCM460 cells with flagellin overnight and measured the level of IL-8 protein production in cell supernatants by using ELISA. We found that flagellin-induced IL-8 production was blocked in TLR5-silenced cells, whereas control cells produced large amounts of IL-8 in response to flagellin (Fig. 2C). In contrast, TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells had increased IL-8 production in response to IL-1 (Fig. 2C), indicating that TLR5 expression is selectively silenced in NCM460 cells. Next, we stimulated TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells with flagellin and examined PI3K activation by immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 2D, flagellin exposure stimulated Akt phosphorylation only in control, but not in TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells. Flagellin stimulation also failed to change the localization of FOXO1 in TLR5-silenced NCM460 cells (data not shown). Together, these data clearly indicate that PI3K activation is a specific outcome achieved from TLR5 engagement in response to flagellin in nontransformed human colonocytes. TLR5 Associates with p85 Regulatory Subunit of PI3K, as Mediated by Its Cytoplasmic TIR Domain—Because TLR2 and TLR3 have been associated with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K (7Arbibe L. Mira J.P.

Sen G.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether engagement of TLR5 by flagellin recruits the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K in NCM460 cells. To study this, total cell lysates from NCM460 cells stimulated with flagellin, as indicated in Fig. 3A, were co-immunoprecipitated with an antibody against p85. The immunoprecipitant was next fractionated in SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an antibody against TLR5. As shown in Fig. 3A, the co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that TLR5 associates with p85 in response to flagellin in nontransformed colonic epithelial cells. Moreover, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with an HA-tagged TLR5 wild type (TLR5 WT-HA) or an HA-tagged TLR5 (ΔTIR) (cytoplasmic TIR domain deleted TLR5, TLR5 (ΔTIR)-HA) construct along with a FLAG-tagged p85 (p85-FLAG) construct as indicated in Fig. 3B. Two days after transfection, total cell lysates were prepared and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody followed by immunoblot analysis with HA antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3B, TLR5 was able to co-immunoprecipitate with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, whereas TLR5 without the cytoplasmic TIR domain failed to associate with p85, implying that the cytoplasmic TIR domain of TLR5 mediates the association of TLR5 with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. The SH2 Domain Binding Motif (YXXM) in the Cytoplasmic TIR Domain of TLR5 Is Not Involved in Recruiting the p85 Subunit of PI3K to TLR5—PI3K is a heterodimer composed of a p85 regulatory and a p110 catalytic subunit. There are two SH2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2) in the p85 regulatory subunit that allow direct binding to the “YXXM” motif present in membrane-bound proteins, such as TLR2, IL-1 receptor, or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (7Arbibe L.

https://openalex.org/W2033497490,"Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of the catecholamines dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline. In response to short term stimuli TH activity is primarily controlled by phosphorylation of serine 40. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of serine 19 in TH can indirectly activate TH via a hierarchical mechanism by increasing the rate of phosphorylation of serine 40. Here we show that phosphorylation of serine 31 in rat TH increases the rate of serine 40 phosphorylation 9-fold in vitro. Phosphorylation of serine 31 in intact bovine chromaffin cells potentiated the forskolin-induced increase in serine 40 phosphorylation and TH activity more than 2-fold. Humans are unique in that they contain four TH isoforms but to date no significant differences have been shown in the regulation of these isoforms. Phosphorylation of the human TH isoform 1 at serine 31 by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) also produced a 9-fold increase in the rate of phosphorylation of serine 40, whereas little effect was seen in the TH isoforms 3 and 4. ERK did not phosphorylate human TH isoform 2. The effect of serine 19 phosphorylation on serine 40 (44 in TH2) phosphorylation is stronger in TH2 than in TH1. Thus hierarchical phosphorylation provides a mechanism whereby the two major human TH isoforms (1 and 2) can be differentially regulated with only isoform 1 responding to the ERK pathway, whereas isoform 2 is more sensitive to calcium-mediated events.

Biochem. 1999; 68: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Short term regulation of TH is accomplished by dynamic changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme (2Kumer S.C. Vrana K.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 3Dunkley P.R. Bobrovskaya L. Graham M.E. Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although four serine residues have been shown to be phosphorylated in TH, only three of these serine residues (Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40) are regulated in vivo (4Haycock J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11682-11691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most important mechanism of TH activation is phosphorylation of Ser40, which decreases the feedback inhibition by the catecholamines (5Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ribeiro P. Wang Y. Citron B.A. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phosphorylation of dopamine bound TH at Ser40 by protein kinase A (PKA) can activate TH by up to 20-fold (5Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The direct effect of Ser19 and Ser31 phosphorylation on TH activation is much more modest. Phosphorylation of Ser19 by calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) will only increase TH activity in the presence of the 14-3-3 protein (8Yamauchi T. Nakata H. Fujisawa H. J. Biol.

The phosphorylation of Ser31 by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) produces less than a 2-fold increase in TH activity, primarily by decreasing the affinity of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (11Haycock J.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54487-54493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Humans have four TH protein isoforms, whereas anthropoids have two, and other mammalian species only have one (15Haycock J.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TH is encoded by a single gene, and the multiple isoforms are because of multiple mRNAs generated by alternative splicing of the single gene (16Grima B. Lamouroux C. Boni C. Julien J.-F. Javoy-Agid F. Mallet J. Nature. 1987; 326: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 17O'Malley K.L. Anhalt M.J. Martin B.M. Kelsoe J.R. Winfield S.L. Ginns E.I.

The other human TH isoforms hTH2, hTH3, and hTH4 have inserts that lead to the expression of proteins containing 4, 27, and 31 (4 + 27) amino acids inserted immediately N-terminal to Ser31 in the hTH1 isoform. The hTH1 and hTH2 isoforms are the most prominent forms in human tissue samples and human cell lines (15Haycock J.W. J.

Analysis of recombinant forms of the four human isoforms indicate that their steady state kinetic parameters are comparable among the non-phosphorylated forms and among the phosphorylated forms (12Sutherland C.

Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As there is little direct effect of Ser19 and Ser31 phosphorylation on TH activity we have been exploring the possibility that phosphorylation of these sites may indirectly effect TH activation by hierarchical phosphorylation (3Dunkley P.R. Bobrovskaya L. Graham M.E. Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). That is, phosphorylation of Ser19 and Ser31 could alter the rate of Ser40 phosphorylation and therefore TH activation. We have shown that phosphorylation of Ser19 increases the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40 in TH 3-fold, whereas Ser40 phosphorylation has no effect on the rate of Ser19 phosphorylation (24Bevilaqua L.R. Graham M.E. Dunkley P.R. Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40411-40416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore the phosphorylation of Ser19 increases the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40 in a hierarchical manner. This result has been confirmed both qualitatively and quantitatively by others using a different methodology (10Toska K. Kleppe R. Armstrong C.G. Morrice N.A. Cohen P. Haavik J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have further shown that Ser19 phosphorylation can potentiate Ser40 phosphorylation and TH activation in intact cells (25Bobrovskaya L. Dunkley P.R. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this report we have investigated whether Ser31 phosphorylation could also alter the rate of Ser40 phosphorylation. The results in this report show that Ser31 phosphorylation has a major effect on the rate of Ser40 phosphorylation and TH activation in intact cells and in vitro. These results also provide, for the first time, a mechanism by which the four human TH isoforms can be differentially regulated by hierarchical phosphorylation.

The hTH2 Ser35 phosphopeptide (GQSPPR) was synthesized by AUSPEP (Australia). Tissue culture reagents were from Sigma and were of analytical or tissue culture grade. Forskolin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide before use. Appropriate solvent controls were performed for every condition. Expression and Purification of TH and ERK and Purification of CaMKII–rTH was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to previously described procedures (5Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications as described (24Bevilaqua L.R. Graham M.E. Dunkley P.R. Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40411-40416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The recombinant rTH is not phosphorylated and does not contain bound catecholamine. The TH mutants were generated using the QuikChange site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The hTH2 and hTH4 isoforms were generated from the hTH1 and hTH3 isoforms, respectively, using the conditions described (23Sura G.R. Daubner S.C. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The introduction of the mutation and the absence of other mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The S19A mutations were further confirmed by the absence of Ser19 phosphorylation using the Ser(P)19-specific antibody after phosphorylation with CaMKII. ERK2 was expressed from the plasmid NPT7–5His-ERK2-R4F and purified essentially as described (26Khokhlatchev A. Xu S.C. English J. Wu P.Q. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) except that elution from the nickel-charged chelating-Superose column was with an imidazole gradient (0–400 mm). CaMKII was purified from whole brain by calmodulin-Sepharose chromatography (27Rostas J.A. Seccombe M. Weinberger R.P. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All of the recombinant DNA experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, Australia. Determination of TH Activity and the Incorporation of Radioactivity into TH–The phosphorylation reactions for TH were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 μm ATP, 12.5 mm MgCl2 except for CaMKII, which were performed at 1 mm ATP. To obtain dopamine-bound TH, the TH was initially incubated in a buffer containing 75 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 75 mm GSH, 15 μm dopamine for 20 min at 20 °C. Phosphorylation reactions were performed in the same buffer but with the addition of 100 μm ATP and 12.5 mm MgCl2. TH activity was determined using the tritiated water release assay of Reinhard et al. (28Reinhard J.F. Smith G.K. Nichol C.A. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). After dopamine binding and phosphorylation of TH, the TH was purified over a heparin-Sepharose column. The TH activity was then measured in a buffer containing 25 μm tyrosine, 60 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.006% β-mercaptoethanol, 36 μg/ml catalase, 500 μm BH4 at 25 °C for 8 min. For the analysis of incorporation of radioactivity into TH, [γ-32P]ATP was included in the phosphorylation reactions. The phosphorylation reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 4% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1% dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The TH bands were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue-R250, the gel section containing TH was cut out, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (Wallac 1410, Pharmacia). TH Site Analysis–After TH was phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described above the samples were applied to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose as described by Jarvie and Dunkley (29Jarvie P.E. Dunkley P.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 41: 239-259PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose filter was then subject to Ponceau staining. The TH band was cut out of the nitrocellulose, and the TH was eluted from the nitrocellulose by trypsin digestion. The HPLC analysis of the resultant phosphopeptides was performed as described previously (30Bobrovskaya L. Cheah T.B. Bunn S.J. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the CaMKII rate experiments TH was precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and then once with acetone; the TH was then digested with trypsin and then directly injected onto the HPLC column. Measurement of Site-specific TH Phosphorylation, TH Activity, Ser40 Kinase Activity and the Stoichiometry of Ser31 Phosphorylation in Bovine Adrenal Chromaffin Cell Extracts–Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells (BACCs) were prepared as described (31Livett B.G. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1103-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) with modifications (32Bunn S.J. Sim A.T. Herd L.M. Austin L.M. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1370-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). BACCs were plated and treated as described (25Bobrovskaya L. Dunkley P.R. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) except that cells were initially treated with 100 nm AngII for 30 min rather than anisomycin. Site-specific TH phosphorylation, TH activity, and Ser40 kinase activity in BACC extracts were measured as described (25Bobrovskaya L. Dunkley P.R. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For measurement of the stoichiometry of Ser31 phosphorylation in BACCs, recombinant rat TH was maximally phosphorylated at Ser31 by incubation with ERK and was used as a calibration standard. A stoichiometry of 0.45 was assumed for the ERK-phosphorylated TH, as this was the average stoichiometry determined in a number of experiments. The stoichiometry of Ser31 phosphorylation in untreated BACCs was determined as described for Ser19 and Ser40 phosphorylation (25Bobrovskaya L. Dunkley P.R. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis–For multiple comparisons statistical significance was assessed by the Tukey's test for multiple comparisons, protected by a one-way analysis of variance. Student's t test was used for pairwise comparisons. The Effect of Ser31 Phosphorylation on the Forskolin-induced Increase in Ser40 Phosphorylation and TH Activity in Intact Cells—To examine the effect of Ser31 phosphorylation on Ser40 phosphorylation in intact cells we needed to establish conditions in which BACCs could be stimulated to independently increase the level of Ser31 or Ser40 phosphorylation without increasing Ser19 phosphorylation. The data in Fig. 1A show that when BACCs were incubated with AngII for 30 min, the level of Ser31 phosphorylation increased 3–4-fold with respect control, whereas Ser40 phosphorylation and Ser19 to phosphorylation did not change compared with the control (p > 0.05). An incubation of BACCs with forskolin for 4 min increased only Ser40 phosphorylation. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation of Ser31 was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A value for Ser31 stoichiometry in untreated chromaffin cells of 0.04 ± 0.003 (mean ± S.E., n = 8) was obtained. This indicates that the stoichiometry of Ser31 phosphorylation after AngII treatment would be between 0.12 and 0.16. When the BACCs were treated first with AngII and then forskolin, the change in the levels of phosphorylation of Ser19 and Ser31 were the same as when the cells were individually treated with AngII or forskolin. This suggests that the effects of AngII and forskolin on BACCs are independent of each other. In contrast to this result, the increase in the level of Ser40 phosphorylation in cells treated with AngII plus forskolin was almost 2-fold greater than the increase in Ser40 phosphorylation in cells treated with forskolin alone. This difference was significant (p < 0.001). The effect of AngII and forskolin on TH activity is also shown in Fig. 1A. The treatment of cells with AngII produced no significant increase in TH activity when compared with the activity in untreated cells (p > 0.05). The addition of forskolin increased TH activity in BACCs ∼2-fold. In cells treated with forskolin plus AngII, the increase of TH activity over control was 2.2-fold greater than that in cells treated with forskolin alone. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The data shown above suggest that phosphorylation of Ser31 mediated by AngII can potentiate the forskolin-induced increase in Ser40 phosphorylation. If this were true then AngII should not increase the Ser40 phosphorylating activity in forskolin-treated cells. The level of TH Ser40 kinase activity in extracts of cells was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” using exogenous TH as a substrate. The cells were treated with AngII, forskolin, or both forskolin and AngII. The data in Fig. 1B show the results from a phosphopeptide analysis of TH under the conditions used for the Ser40 kinase assay after treatment with AngII and forskolin. The results show a single radioactive peak with an elution position similar to that obtained for the Ser(P)40 tryptic peptide in our system (33Bobrovskaya L. Odell A. Leal R.B. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This indicates that essentially only the Ser40 is phosphorylated. The very low stoichiometry of Ser19 and Ser31 under these conditions would mean that we would not expect any potentiation of exogenous TH Ser40 phosphorylation because of Ser19 or Ser31 phosphorylation in the Ser40 kinase assay and so would be measuring the true Ser40 kinase activity. The results in Fig. 1B show that treatment of cells with forskolin produced ∼17-fold increase in Ser40 kinase activity in the cell extracts. When extracts of cells treated with AngII and forskolin were analyzed for Ser40 kinase activity, the activity was not significantly different from that in extracts of cells treated with forskolin alone (p > 0.05). Therefore the phosphorylation of Ser31 mediated by AngII must be potentiating the forskolin-induced increase in TH Ser40 phosphorylation. Stoichiometry and Site Analysis of the Phosphorylation of rTH by ERK and PKA–The data shown above indicated that phosphorylation of Ser31 could increase the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40 and activation of TH in intact cells. To understand the mechanism of this we examined the effect of Ser31 phosphorylation on Ser40 phosphorylation and TH activation in vitro. In these experiments ERK was used to phosphorylate Ser31. To phosphorylate Ser31 in rTH, recombinant ERK was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The specificity of ERK phosphorylation of rTH was determined. rTH was maximally phosphorylated with ERK. The ERK-phosphorylated rTH was then subjected to tryptic digestion, and the resulting labeled phosphopeptides were analyzed using HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results in Fig. 2, panel E show a major peak eluting at ∼20 min and three minor peaks. Taking into account the elution position of the Ser(P)40 peptide (PKA-phosphorylated rTH; see Fig. 2, panel P) the elution position of the major peak was consistent with that previously determined for the Ser(P)31 peptide from rat TH (11Haycock J.W. Ahn N.G. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Essentially identical results were obtained with the ERK phosphorylation of dopamine-bound rTH (Fig. 2 panel DE). Previous results have shown that ERK could also phosphorylate Ser8 in rTH but only at a low level (11Haycock J.W. Ahn N.G. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). More recent results suggested that ERK could phosphorylate Ser8 at a rate ∼9-fold less than Ser31 (34Royo M. Daubner S.C. Fitzpatrick P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), so it was possible that under the conditions used to maximally phosphorylate Ser31 there may have been significant phosphorylation of Ser8. The elution position of the smallest of the three minor peaks was consistent with that previously defined to be the elution position of the Ser(P)8 peptide in rTH (11Haycock J.W. Ahn N.G. Cobb M.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2365-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To confirm this, ERK was used to phosphorylate a S8A mutant of rTH. As can be seen in Fig. 2, panel E (S8A), the middle peak of the three minor peaks disappears in the S8A mutant, confirming that this peak is in fact the Ser(P)8 peptide. The very low level of Ser8 phosphorylation suggested that it was unlikely to have any significant impact on Ser40 phosphorylation and so wild-type rTH was used in all subsequent experiments. The nature of the two other minor peaks is unclear. Once rTH was maximally phosphorylated by ERK, the subsequent addition of PKA only resulted in phosphorylation of Ser40 in dopamine-free (Fig. 2 panel EP) or dopamine-bound (Fig. 2, panel DEP) TH. Analysis of the Effect of Ser31 Phosphorylation on Ser40 Phosphorylation and TH Activity in rTH–We first determined whether the effect of Ser31 phosphorylation on TH in intact cells was because of Ser31 phosphorylation increasing the ability of PKA to phosphorylate Ser40 and activate dopamine-bound rTH. The results in Fig. 3A show that addition of dopamine inhibited rTH activity ∼40-fold (D). Phosphorylation of Ser31 by ERK did not significantly activate dopamine-bound rTH (Fig. 3A, DE). The addition of very high levels of PKA was able to fully reactivate the dopamine-bound rTH (DP150). The addition of a lower concentration of PKA was able to partially reactivate rTH (Fig. 3A, DP). Prior phosphorylation of Ser31 by ERK had no effect on the ability of this lower PKA concentration to reactivate rTH (DEP is not significantly different from DP). The effect of Ser31 phosphorylation on Ser40 phosphorylation in dopamine-bound TH was examined directly (Fig. 3B). Again, prior phosphorylation of Ser31 did not alter the PKA-mediated increase in the phosphorylation of Ser40 in dopamine-bound TH (DEP is not significantly different from DP). The results show that phosphorylation of Ser31 could not increase the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40 nor increase the activation of dopamine-bound rTH by PKA. We therefore determined whether the potentiation of TH activation by Ser31 phosphorylation in intact cells could be because of Ser31 phosphorylation increasing the ability of PKA to phosphorylate Ser40 in dopamine-free TH. As there is only a very small effect on rTH activity by Ser40 phosphorylation in dopamine-free TH and as Ser31 phosphorylation produces only a small change in rTH activity, we examined Ser40 phosphorylation directly. The effect of Ser31 phosphorylation on the initial rate of Ser40 phosphorylation by PKA in dopamine-free rTH was determined, and the results are presented in Fig. 3C. The data show that the rate of Ser40 phosphorylation by PKA for Ser31 phosphorylated rTH (Fig. 3C, EP) is 9-fold greater than that for rTH not phosphorylated at Ser31 (P). In contrast, prior phosphorylation of Ser40 did not alter the rate of phosphorylation of Ser31 by ERK (not shown), indicating that the effect of the phosphorylation of Ser31 is hierarchical. Stoichiometry and Site Analysis of the Phosphorylation of the Human TH Isoforms by ERK and CaMKII–The sequence comparison of the human TH isoforms is shown in Fig. 4A. It can be seen that the human TH isoforms differ in sequence only around the Ser31 site in hTH1. This suggested that the human TH isoforms may differ with respect to the effect of hierarchical phosphorylation via Ser31 (or its equivalent) phosphorylation. The four human isoforms were expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The phosphorylation of the isoforms by ERK was examined. hTH1 was phosphorylated to a maximum stoichiometry of 0.5, whereas hTH3 and hTH4 could be phosphorylated to a maximum stoichiometry of 1.0, but there was very little phosphorylation of hTH2 by ERK (not shown). These results are consistent with that determined previously (12Sutherland C. Alterio J. Campbell D.G. Le Bourdellès B. Mallet J. Haavik J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The site analysis of hTH1 phosphorylated by ERK and CaMKII is shown in Fig. 4B. The relative positions of the peaks found for the Ser31, Ser19, and Ser40 tryptic phosphopeptides are consistent with those determined previously (12Sutherland C. Alterio J. Campbell D.G. Le Bourdellès B. Mallet J. Haavik J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When hTH1 was phosphorylated by ERK, there was also a small peak that eluted at 20 min. This peak was also found when hTH2 was phosphorylated by ERK, which would suggest that this peak is because of the phosphorylation of a protein in the ERK preparation rather than hTH1. hTH2 contains an additional four amino acids inserted N-terminal to Ser31 in hTH1. There is no information in the literature on the elution position of the hTH2 tryptic Ser35 phosphopeptide (GQSPPR). The hTH2 tryptic Ser35 phosphopeptide was therefore synthesized, and as can be seen in Fig. 4B this peptide elutes very early under the conditions used. As expected, when hTH2 was phosphorylated by ERK the major peak found in hTH1 was no longer found (Fig. 4B, hTH2 ERK). Rather, in addition to the same small peak found in hTH1 that eluted at around 20 min, there was an additional minor peak that eluted very early. This early eluting peak was not found when hTH1 was phosphorylated by ERK, which suggests that it is derived from the phosphorylation of hTH2. This “peak” appeared to be two to three unresolved peaks. These peaks consistently eluted at least 2 min later than the synthesized hTH2 tryptic Ser35 phosphopeptide and so this suggests that ERK cannot phosphorylate hTH2 at Ser35 but may be phosphorylating another site(s) at very low levels. When hTH2 was phosphorylated by CaMKII (Fig. 4B, hTH2 CaMKII), the result was essentially the same as that for hTH1 phosphorylated by CaMKII (Fig. 4B, hTH1 CaMKII). This was surprising as it has been claimed that the Ser35 site in hTH2 can be phosphorylated by CaMKII (22Le Bourdellès B. Horellou P. Le Caer J.-P. Denèfle P. Latta M. Haavik J. Guibert B. Mayaux J.-F. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17124-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could find no evidence for the phosphorylation of an hTH2 tryptic Ser35 phosphopeptide by CaMKII with mobility similar to that of the synthesized Ser35 phosphopeptide. This result is consistent with previous work where attempts to demonstrate the phosphorylation of hTH2 Ser35 in intact human neuroblastoma cells (prelabeled with 32Pi, treated with veratridine, forskolin, or phorbol ester, immunoprecipitated with isoform-specific antibodies, trypsinized, and analyzed by HPLC with radiochemical detection) indicated, rather, that hTH2 Ser35 was essentially not phosphorylated under any of the conditions. 3J. W. Haycock, unpublished observations. Effect of ERK Phosphorylation on the Human TH Isoforms–We examined the effect of ERK phosphorylation on the rate of activation of the dopamine-bound human TH isoforms by PKA. The data is shown in Fig. 5A. All four isoforms showed similar levels of inhibition by dopamine. Addition of low concentrations of PKA produced partial reactivation of each isoform (Fig. 5, DP). In all four isoforms, prior phosphorylation by ERK (Fig. 5, DEP) had no effect on the PKA-mediated activation as, in each case, DEP was not significantly different from DP. We next investigated whether Ser31 phosphorylation could potentiate Ser40 phosphorylation in dopamine-free human TH isoforms. The results in Fig. 5B show that the effect seen in hTH1 was essentially the same as that for rTH in that Ser31 phosphorylation by ERK increased the rate of Ser40 phosphorylation by PKA ∼9-fold. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser58 in hTH3 by ERK increased the rate of Ser67 phosphorylation by PKA only ∼1.7-fold. In the hTH4 isoform, Ser62 phosphorylation by ERK did not alter the rate of Ser71 phosphorylation by PKA. The Ser35 residue in hTH2 could not be significantly phosphorylated by ERK or CaMKII and so for this isoform of TH the equivalent potentiation could not occur. Determination of the Role of Ser19 Phosphorylation in the Phosphorylation of Ser40 in hTH1 and Ser44 in hTH2–When the phosphorylation of hTH1 and hTH2 was examined by site analysis we consistently found that when hTH1 and hTH2 were phosphorylated by CaMKII, the ratio of Ser44 to Ser19 phosphorylation in hTH2 was higher than the ratio of Ser40 to Ser19 phosphorylation in hTH1 (see Fig. 4B). This raised the possibility that the 4-amino-acid insert in hTH2 was either directly altering the rate of phosphorylation of Ser44 or altering the effect of Ser19 phosphorylation on the rate of Ser44 phosphorylation. We therefore examined the of rate of phosphorylation Ser19, Ser40, and Ser44 in the two isoforms by CaMKII. This was done by quantitating the radioactivity incorporated into Ser19, Ser40, and Ser44 by site-analysis as described in methods. The results in Fig. 6A show that when hTH1 and hTH2 are maximally phosphorylated by addition of high levels of CaMKII and incubation for 300 s, the incorporation of radioactivity into Ser19, Ser40, and Ser44 was, as expected, the same. As the amount of radioactivity incorporated into hTH1 and hTH2 was the same, the data were directly comparable. The results show that the rate of phosphorylation of Ser19 was the same in hTH1 and hTH2. In contrast the rate of phosphorylation of Ser44 in hTH2 was increased by 150% when compared with the rate of phosphorylation of Ser44 in hTH1. To examine whether this was because of the effect of Ser19 phosphorylation or because of the 4-amino-acid insert in hTH2 directly effecting CaMKII phosphorylation of Ser44, we prepared mutants of hTH1 and hTH2 where Ser19 was converted to alanine so Ser19 could not be phosphorylated. We compared the rates of phosphorylation by CaMKII of Ser40 in S19A hTH1 with that of Ser44 in S19A hTH2. The results in Fig. 6B show that CaMKII could phosphorylate Ser44 in hTH2 faster than Ser40 in hTH1 in the absence of Ser19 phosphorylation, but the effect was small, with there being only a 30% increase. This direct effect (30% increase) can only contribute in a minor way to the effect seen in the presence of Ser19 phosphorylation (150% increase). We therefore believe that it is the phosphorylation of Ser19 that is primarily responsible for the increased rate of Ser44 phosphorylation in hTH2. The rate of phosphorylation of Ser40 in hTH1 by PKA (which does not phosphorylate Ser19) was the same as the rate of phosphorylation of Ser44 in hTH2 by PKA (Fig. 6C). Thus the presence of the 4-amino-acid insert in hTH2 does not affect the rate at which PKA phosphorylates Ser44 compared with the rate at which PKA phosphorylates Ser40 in hTH1. Previously we have shown that phosphorylation of Ser19 in TH can potentiate the phosphorylation of Ser40 in vitro (24Bevilaqua L.R. Graham M.E. Dunkley P.R. Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40411-40416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and potentiate the phosphorylation of Ser40 and lead to TH activation in situ (25Bobrovskaya L. Dunkley P.R. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The data reported here extends this work by showing that the phosphorylation of Ser31 can also increase the rate of Ser40 phosphorylation and TH activation both in vitro and in situ. The phosphorylation of Ser40 had no effect on the rate of phosphorylation of either Ser19 or Ser31. Therefore the effect of phosphorylation of Ser19 and Ser31 is hierarchical in nature. In light of the very modest effect that phosphorylation of Ser19 or Ser31 have on TH activity we would suggest that the main role of the phosphorylation of these sites is to potentiate the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40. Phosphorylation of Ser31 increased the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40 in dopamine-free TH but did not have any effect on the PKA activation of dopamine-bound TH. This is the same as the situation with Ser19 where Ser19 phosphorylation increased the rate of Ser40 phosphorylation in dopamine-free TH (24Bevilaqua L.R. Graham M.E. Dunkley P.R. Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40411-40416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) but had no effect on the PKA activation of dopamine-bound TH. 4J. Daniel, P. Dunkley, and P. Dickson, unpublished observations. The phosphorylation of Ser40 in dopamine-free TH has very little effect on TH activity (5Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and so the question arises as to how Ser31 (or Ser19) phosphorylation produces the potentiation of TH activation that we have found in intact cells. In response to a stimulus Ser40 phosphorylation in TH increases in the first 2–3 min. Clearly, phosphorylation of Ser19 or Ser31 does not effect the initial activation of catecholamine-bound TH. If there is continued stimulation the level of Ser40, phosphorylation remains relatively stable (35Haycock J.W. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This means that after the initial activation phase there is an equilibrium phase where the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40 must equal the rate of dephosphorylation of Ser40 in order that the level of phosphorylation of Ser40 in the cell remains constant. This equilibrium phase is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 7. In the absence of Ser31 phosphorylation, the level of Ser40 phosphorylation will reach a stable point when the rate of phosphorylation equals the rate of dephosphorylation (Fig. 7, dotted line). Phosphorylation of Ser31 will increase the rate of phosphorylation of Ser40 in catecholamine-free TH. This will have the effect of altering the equilibrium to favor the phosphorylated form and so the level of Ser40 phosphorylation will increase. Ultimately a new equilibrium will be established but it will be at higher level of Ser40 phosphorylation than in the absence of Ser31 phosphorylation (Fig. 7, solid line). Therefore we believe that the role of Ser31 (and Ser19) phosphorylation in catecholamine-free TH is to increase the rate of rephosphorylation of Ser40 in TH after it has been dephosphorylated (but before dopamine is rebound). This will have the effect of increasing Ser40 phosphorylation in intact cells and, in particular, reducing the possibility of the catecholamine binding to the dephosphorylated TH and reinhibiting TH. This work also provides a major insight into the way the human TH isoforms are regulated. Previous work has failed to identify any significant differences in the activity or regulation of the four human TH isoforms (12Sutherland C. Alterio J. Campbell D.G. Le Bourdellès B. Mallet J. Haavik J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21Haavik J. Le Bourdelles B. Martinez A. Flatmark T. Mallet J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22Le Bourdellès B. Horellou P. Le Caer J.-P. Denèfle P. Latta M. Haavik J. Guibert B. Mayaux J.-F. Mallet J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17124-17130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sura G.R. Daubner S.C. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The fact that the only sequence difference among the four isoforms is around Ser31 in hTH1 suggests that the effect of Ser31 (or its equivalent) phosphorylation in increasing Ser40 (or its equivalent) phosphorylation may be different in different isoforms. This was in fact the case with the strong potentiation via Ser31 phosphorylation being only found in the hTH1 isoform. The other major human TH isoform hTH2 showed stronger potentiation via Ser19 phosphorylation than hTH1. How would these differences between the two major TH isoforms impact on the regulation of TH in cells? When cells are stimulated either via depolarization or receptor-mediated mechanisms the level of phosphorylation of Ser19 increases rapidly and thereafter starts to decrease (3Dunkley P.R. Bobrovskaya L. Graham M.E. Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In contrast, the level of Ser31 phosphorylation only increases after extended stimulation of the cell (3Dunkley P.R. Bobrovskaya L. Graham M.E. Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This means that in response to short term stimuli, hTH2 will be activated to a greater extent than hTH1 because of the stronger potentiation via Ser19 phosphorylation. When cells are stimulated for a longer period of time, the ERK pathway is activated. Activation of the ERK pathway will strongly potentiate the activation of hTH1 but will have no effect on hTH2. Therefore hTH1 and hTH2 can be differentially activated depending on the length of the stimulus involved. Hierarchical phosphorylation via Ser31 may also provide a mechanism by which hTH1, or the TH in other mammalian species that are homologous to hTH1, may be differentially activated in different tissues. We have shown here that in unstimulated adrenal chromaffin cells the stoichiometry of Ser31 phosphorylation is very low with only 4% of TH phosphorylated at Ser31. This is similar to the results from unstimulated adrenal-derived PC12 cells where only 7% of TH molecules are phosphorylated at Ser31 (36Salvatore M.F. Garcia-Espana A. Goldstein M. Deutch A.Y. Haycock J.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, the basal level of Ser31 phosphorylation was much higher in the brain with as much as 32% of TH phosphorylated at Ser31 in the striatum (36Salvatore M.F. Garcia-Espana A. Goldstein M. Deutch A.Y. Haycock J.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This would mean that in response to short term stimuli the high stoichiometry of Ser31 phosphorylation the striatum would lead to strong potentiation of hTH1 activation, whereas this would not occur in adrenal cells where the stoichiometry of Ser31 phosphorylation is very low. For many years it was thought that ERK was the only kinase that could phosphorylate Ser31 in TH. The recent discovery that Ser31 can also be phosphorylated by CDK5 (14Moy L.Y. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54487-54493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Kansy J.W. Daubner S.C. Nishi A. Sotogaku N. Lloyd M.D. Nguyen C. Lu L. Haycock J.W. Hope B.T. Fitzpatrick P.F. Bibb J.A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) means that this potentiation of activation of hTH1 can be modulated by at least two different pathways and so could provide the basis of quite complex regulation of hTH1. In summary we have shown the Ser31 phosphorylation can strongly potentiate Ser40 phosphorylation and TH activation. This has also provided for the first time a mechanism by which the different human TH isoforms are differentially regulated. We thank Melissa Musicka for technical assistance.

Feeding rats a diet containing n-3 PUFA or WY14643 suppressed hepatic mRNA(L-PK) but did not suppress hepatic ChREBP or HNF-4alpha nuclear abundance. Hepatic MLX nuclear abundance, however, was suppressed by n-3 PUFA but not WY14643. In rat primary hepatocytes, glucose-stimulated accumulation of mRNA(LPK) and L-PK promoter activity correlated with increased ChREBP nuclear abundance. This treatment also increased L-PK promoter occupancy by RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II), acetylated histone H3 (Ac-H3), and acetylated histone H4 (Ac-H4) but did not significantly impact L-PK promoter occupancy by ChREBP or HNF-4alpha. Inhibition of L-PK promoter activity by n-3 PUFA correlated with suppressed RNA pol II, Ac-H3, and Ac-H4 occupancy on the L-PK promoter. Although n-3 PUFA transiently suppressed ChREBP and MLX nuclear abundance, this treatment did not impact ChREBP-LPK promoter interaction. HNF4alpha-LPK promoter interaction was transiently suppressed by n-3 PUFA. Inhibition of L-PK promoter activity by WY14643 correlated with a transient decline in ChREBP nuclear abundance and decreased Ac-H4 interaction with the L-PK promoter. WY14643, however, had no impact on MLX nuclear abundance or HNF4alpha-LPK promoter interaction. Although overexpressed ChREBP or HNF-4alpha did not relieve n-3 PUFA suppression of L-PK gene expression, overexpressed MLX fully abrogated n-3 PUFA suppression of L-PK promoter activity and mRNA(L-PK) abundance. Overexpressed ChREBP, but not MLX, relieved the WY14643 inhibition of L-PK. In conclusion, n-3 PUFA and WY14643/PPARalpha target different transcription factors to control L-PK gene transcription. MLX, the heterodimer partner for ChREBP, has emerged as a novel target for n-3 PUFA regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2032163139,"The ability of glucocorticoids (GCs) to regulate cell proliferation plays an important role in their therapeutic use. The canonical Wnt pathway, which promotes the proliferation of many cancers and differentiated tissues, is an emerging target for the actions of GCs, albeit existing links between these signaling pathways are indirect. By screening known Wnt target genes for their ability to respond differently to GCs in cells whose proliferation is either positively or negatively regulated by GCs, we identified c-myc, c-jun, and cyclin D1, which encode rate-limiting factors for G1 progression of the cell cycle. Here we show that in U2OS/GR cells, which are growth-arrested by GCs, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) represses cyclin D1 via Tcf-β-catenin, the transcriptional effector of the canonical Wnt pathway. We demonstrate that GR can bind β-catenin in vitro, suggesting that GC and Wnt signaling pathways are linked directly through their effectors. Down-regulation of β-catenin by RNA interference impeded the expression of cyclin D1 but not of c-myc or c-jun and had no significant effect on the proliferation of U2OS/GR cells. Although these results revealed that β-catenin and cyclin D1 are not essential for the regulation of U2OS/GR cell proliferation, considering the importance of the Wnt pathway for proliferation and differentiation of other cells, the repression of Tcf-β-catenin activity by GR could open new possibilities for tissue-selective GC therapies.

Glucocorticoids and other steroid hormones regulate survival, differentiation, and proliferation of a large variety of cells. Due to their ability to suppress the immune system and induce cell cycle arrest, GCs 2The abbreviations used are: GC, glucocorticoid; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; SR, steroid hormone receptor; NR, nuclear receptor; DBD, DNA binding domain; LBD, ligand binding domain; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; AR, androgen receptor; ER, estrogen receptor; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DEX, dexamethasone; CORT, corticosterone; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; aa, amino acid(s); CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. are commonly used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer. Whereas the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by GCs in cancer cells is therapeutically desirable, a similar action of GCs in bones induces osteoporosis, which represents a major complication of long term GC therapy (1Saag K.G. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. N. Am. 2003; 32: 135-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The ability to uncouple the beneficial from the unwanted effects of GCs requires an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which GCs regulate cell proliferation. The cellular response to GCs is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which belongs to the steroid hormone receptor (SR) subgroup of nuclear receptors (NR) (2Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). NRs have a characteristic modular structure and contain at least two highly conserved domains, a central DNA binding domain (DBD) and a carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). These receptors can act as hormone-regulated transcription factors and, upon binding to hormone response elements, associate with transcriptional coregulators, which modify or remodel chromatin or interact with the basal transcriptional machinery (3Barrett T.J. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1998; 30: 185-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to binding hormone response elements directly, GR also interacts with other transcription factors (e.g. AP1 and NFκB), which usually results in transcriptional repression (5Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Besides their role in regulating gene expression, SRs modulate the activity of other signaling pathways by interacting with cytoplasmic signaling proteins such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (6Cheskis B.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although only a few such examples have been well characterized, it is likely that both nuclear and nonnuclear activities of SRs contribute to the physiological response of cells to hormone. The classical Wnt signaling pathway has been emerging as a target of both the nuclear and the nonnuclear activities of SRs (7Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. Coetzee G.A. Nelson C.C. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 898-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Wnt is a locally secreted lipid-modified signaling protein that plays crucial roles in body patterning and organogenesis during development (8Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). The Wnt pathway also regulates the proliferation of differentiated cell types, such as osteoblasts, which form the bone mass (9Westendorf J.J. Kahler R.A. Schroeder T.M. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 341: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and osteoporosis. The key effector of the classical Wnt pathway is β-catenin (10Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt, the cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin are kept low by the action of the glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which phosphorylates free β-catenin and marks it for proteasomal destruction (11Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Activation of Wnt signaling inhibits GSK-3β activity, leading to accumulation and nuclear import of β-catenin. Nuclear β-catenin interacts with members of the Tcf/Lef (T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor) family and activates the expression of Wnt target genes (12Hecht A. Kemler R. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Connections between Wnt and steroid hormone signaling have, to date, been best characterized for the androgen receptor (AR), which in the presence of androgens binds β-catenin and transports it into the nucleus (13Pawlowski J.E.

Although among the SRs only AR promotes nuclear import of β-catenin (13Pawlowski J.E. Ertel J.R. Allen M.P. Xu M. Butler C. Wilson E.M. Wierman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20702-20710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the estrogen receptor (ER) has also been found to interact with β-catenin, both physically and functionally (21Kouzmenko A.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40255-40258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast to AR and ER, evidence linking GR to Wnt signaling is thus far indirect. In Con8 rat mammary epithelial cells, GCs interfere with Ras and tumor necrosis factor-α signaling, resulting in increased expression of β-catenin and translocation of β-catenin from the nucleus to the plasma membrane (22Guan Y. Rubenstein N.M. Failor K.L. Woo P.L. Firestone G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 214-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In osteoblasts, GCs induce the expression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (23Ohnaka K. Tanabe M. Kawate H. Nawata H. Takayanagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 329: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and the Tcf-β-catenin corepressor HDAC1 (24Smith E. Frenkel B. J. Biol.

Cell proliferation and progression through the different phases of the cell cycle depends on the activation and inhibition of cyclin-dependent protein kinases by cyclins and inhibitory proteins (26Murray T.A.H. The Cell Cycle. 1993; (Oxford University Press, New York)Google Scholar). Two checkpoints at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries of the cell cycle enable growth factors and other intra- or extracellular cues to control the cell cycle. Cells that are arrested by GCs often have lower RNA and protein levels of D-type cyclins and of growth factor-activated transcription factors that are rate-limiting for progression through G1 phase, including c-Myc and c-Jun (25Smith E.

The goal of the present study was to investigate whether Wnt-dependent activation and GR-mediated repression of cell cycle regulator genes are functionally coupled. Here we demonstrate that GR represses the expression of cyclin D1 in human U2OS/GR osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting the activity of Tcf-β-catenin without changing the levels or nuclear localization of β-catenin. GR binds β-catenin in vitro, indicating that GC and Wnt pathways communicate directly through their effectors. Cell Lines—Monkey CV1 kidney fibroblasts (American Tissues and Clones Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) and 5% fetal bovine serum. Construction and maintenance of the human U2OS osteosarcoma cells expressing rat GR (U2OS/GR) are described in Ref. 27Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3181-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar. As shown previously, GR is expressed in this cell line at physiological levels (∼50,000 receptors/cell) (27Rogatsky I.

RNA Interference—β-Catenin siRNA (identification number 42816; Ambion) and nonsilencing control siRNA (catalog number 1022076; Qiagen) were transfected into U2OS/GR cells to a final concentration of 10 nm, using the HiPerFect Transfection Reagent (5 μl/ml culture; Qiagen). Transfected cells were incubated for at least 16 h before incubation with hormone (see figure legends to Figs. 2 and 5). Isolation of total RNA and quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described above.FIGURE 5Effect of hormone and β-catenin RNA interference on cyclin D1 and c-myc expression and on U2OS/GR cell proliferation.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by immunoblotting. Separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins was evaluated by analyzing the fractions for the presence of the mitochondrial CVd (complex V subunit d) using a CVd-specific antibody (gift from Dr. R. Capaldi, University of Oregon). Protein Expression Analysis—Cells (∼1–10 × 106) were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm EDTA, collected by centrifugation (600 × g, 2 min, 4 °C), and disrupted by five freeze-thaw cycles in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein quantification assay. Proteins (7–100 μg of total protein/lane, as indicated) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride, and probed with antibodies to β-catenin (SC7963(E-5); Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), GR (ab2768(BUGR2); Abcam), cyclin D1 (SC20044(DCS-6); Santa Cruz Biotechnology), actin (A2066; Sigma), or complex V d subunit (R.

All buffers contained phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using ∼5 μg of either polyclonal anti-β-catenin (C2206; Sigma) or IgG (SC-2027; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNAs were resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer and analyzed by quantitative PCR, using specific primers against promoter sequences of cyclin D1 (forward, 5′-GCTCCCATTCTCTGCCGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGAGCGTGCGGACTCTG-3′) and the heat shock protein 70 (forward, 5′-CGTTTTATAAGTCGTCACGGAGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCCCTGGAATATTCCCGAC-3′). A promoter fragment of the ribosomal protein Rpl19 (forward, 5′-ATGTATCACAGCCTGTACCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCTTGGTCTCTTCCTCCTTG-3′) served as an internal standard. Transcription Assays Using Luciferase Reporters—The mammalian expression system and luciferase reporter plasmids pcDNA3 β-catenin S37A, TOPFLASH, and cyclin D1 luciferase reporters were kindly provided by Drs. Byers (Georgetown University Medical Center) and McCormick (University of California, San Francisco). The mammalian β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (p6Rβ-gal) has been published (42Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For expression in mammalian cells, GR and variants (LBD, aa 537–795 of rat GR; DBD/LBD, aa 407–795; ΔAF1, deletion of aa 108–317) were PCR-amplified and cloned into a modified pSG5 vector (Stratagene) as described in Ref. 43Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar. The GR mutant E773R was generated by QuikChange PCR. For transient transfections, 70,000 CV1 cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with 800 ng of total plasmid DNA containing 24 ng of p6Rβ-gal, 100–200 ng of luciferase reporter, and 10–100 ng of GR, β-catenin, or corresponding “empty” expression vectors using Lipofectamine/Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). About 6 h later, transfected CV1 cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 20–24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% stripped fetal bovine serum and between 10–9 and 10–7 m concentrations of corticosterone (CORT; Sigma), DEX, or RU486 (Sigma), as indicated. Cells were harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer (BioVision), lysed by freeze-thawing, and assayed for luciferase (6–10 μl of lysate) and β-galactosidase activity (20 μl of lysate) as described in Ref. 44Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar. The β-galactosidase activity was used to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. Protein Expression and Purification—The construction of the GR expression plasmids has been described above. 35S-Labeled rat GR and derivatives were expressed using the TNT in vitro expression kit (Promega). In vitro synthesis of GR was performed in the presence of 10 μm CORT or ethanol (vehicle). β-Catenin glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were constructed by cloning PCR-amplified β-catenin fragments (aa 1–781, 90–781, 356–781, 443–781, 1–356, and 150–356 of human β-catenin) into a pGEX4T1 derivative that contains a previously engineered C-terminal His6 tag. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21DE3 at 37 °C for 3 h (GST-β-catenin 1–781 and 356–781), at 16 °C for 6 h (GST-β-catenin 1–356 and 150–356), or at 13 °C for 9 h (GST-β-catenin 90–781 and 443–781). Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A650 = 0.7–0.9. Cell pellets were resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin)), incubated with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (10 min, 0 °C), and lysed by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The filtered supernatants were loaded on Talon resin (Clontech) that had been equilibrated with sonication buffer containing 6 mm imidazole. After washing with several column volumes of the same buffer, proteins were eluted with an imidazole gradient (6–300 mm). Eluted proteins were pooled, and protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay. Resultant GST fusion proteins were 90–95% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining. GST Pull-down Assays—Talon-purified GST fusion proteins (2–4 μm final concentration) bound to glutathione-agarose beads (40% final concentration) were incubated with 2.5 μl of 35S-labeled receptors (1–10 nm final concentration) and 10 μm CORT, RU486 or vehicle in 50 μl of binding buffer (150 mm KOAc, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (listed above) at 4 °C for 2 h under rotation. Beads were collected by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C) and washed five times with 200 μl of binding buffer at 4 °C before proteins were eluted by boiling in 20 μl of SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fraction of bound receptor was quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Cell Count and Flow Cytometry Analysis—U2OS/GR cells (6–9 × 106) were transfected with either control orβ-catenin siRNA and incubated for 24 h. Untransfected and transfected cells (1.0 × 105 each) were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured in the presence of 10 nm DEX or ethanol vehicle for 1–4 days. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, stained with trypan blue, and counted using a hemocytometer. To assess cell cycle distribution, untransfected and transfected cells were seeded into 10-cm plates and cultured in the presence of 10 nm DEX or ethanol vehicle for 2 or 4 days. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, resuspended in PBS (2.0 × 106 cells/ml) containing 1% fetal bovine serum, fixed by adding 10 ml of 80% cold ethanol (–20 °C) per 1 ml of cell suspension under continuous mixing, and nutated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum in a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml. DNA was stained by adding a 4× propidium iodide solution and RNase A to a final concentration of 50 and 100 μg/ml, respectively. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, nuclear emitted fluorescence was measured in 30,000 total events/sample, using a BD LSRII FACScan flow cytometer with Diva software (488-nm excitation, 610/20 band pass with 545 LP, fluorescence threshold, sample rate 200–300 events/s). The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by ModFit analysis on ungated samples. Identification of GC-regulated Wnt Target Genes—Human U2OS/GR osteosarcoma cells are well characterized with respect to GC target genes previously identified by microarray analysis (39Rogatsky I. Wang J.C. Derynck M.K. Nonaka D.F. Khodabakhsh D.B. Haqq C.M. Darimont B.D. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13845-13850Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Using the results of these microarray studies and a database of 84 genes that are directly controlled by Tcf-β-catenin (available on the World Wide Web at www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/pathways/targets.html), we identified 20 Wnt target genes that are expressed in U2OS/GR cells. Genes in this group are involved in cell cycle regulation or signaling (c-myc, c-jun, fra1, cyclin D1, id2, FGF 18, VEGF-C, follistatin, MMP7, axin 2, dickkopf 1, and frizzled 7), cell adhesion (claudin 1, connexin 43, E-cadherin, fibronectin, and Nr-CAM), and transcriptional regulation (PPARδ, pitx 2, and engrailed 2). By analyzing the response of these genes to GCs, we found that the expression of most of these genes did not significantly change upon a short term (2-h) exposure to DEX in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 1A). Only two genes (engrailed 2 and frizzled 7) were up-regulated, and four genes (c-myc, c-jun, fra1, and cyclin D1) were down-regulated by more than 30% in the presence of DEX (Fig. 1, A and B). To identify genes that might be involved in the GC-dependent regulation of cell proliferation, we also analyzed the expression of these Wnt target genes in human A549 lung carcinoma cells, which were included as a control group in the U2OS/GR microarray studies (39Rogatsky I. Wang J.C. Derynck M.K. Nonaka D.F. Khodabakhsh D.B. Haqq C.M. Darimont B.D. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1988579430,"Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is a bifunctional NADH oxidase involved in mitochondrial respiration and caspase-independent apoptosis. Three alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of AIF have been identified previously: AIF, AIF-exB, and AIFsh. Here, we report the cloning and the biochemical characterization of a new isoform named AIF short 2 (AIFsh2). AIFsh2 transcript includes a previously unknown exon placed between exons 9 and 10 of AIF. The resulting AIFsh2 protein, which localizes in mitochondria, corresponds to the oxidoreductase domain of AIF. In this way, AIFsh2 exhibits similar NADH oxidase activity to AIF and generates reactive oxygen species. Like AIF, AIFsh2 is released from mitochondria to cytosol after an apoptotic insult in a calpain or cathepsin-dependent manner. However, in contrast to AIF, AIFsh2 does not induce nuclear apoptosis. Thus, it seems that the reactive oxygen species produced by the oxidoreductase domain of AIF/AIFsh2 are not important for AIF-dependent nuclear apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrate that the AIFsh2 mRNA is absent in normal brain tissue, whereas it is expressed in neuroblastoma-derived cells, suggesting a different regulation in normal and transformed cells from the brain lineage. Together, our results reveal that AIF yields an original and independent genetic regulation of the two AIF functions. This is an important issue to understand the physiological role of this protein.

In addition, blockage of the AIF signal transduction pathway seems to be implicated in the chemoresistance of non-small cell lung carcinomas (20Gallego M.A. Joseph B. Hemstrom T.H. Tamiji S.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8233-8240PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, in human colon cancer cells, AIF suppresses chemical stress-induced apoptosis and maintains the transformed state of tumor cells (22Urbano A. Lakshmanan U. Choo P.H. Kwan J.C. Ng P.Y. Guo K. Dhakshinamoorthy S. Porter A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2815-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, AIF is a bifunctional protein with a vital role, via its redox activity in mitochondria, and a lethal role, via its translocation to the nucleus. AIF comprises 16 exons and locates on chromosome X, region q25–26, and A6 in humans and mice, respectively (23Daugas E. Nochy D. Ravagnan L. Loeffler M. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). AIF is expressed as a precursor of 67 kDa. This form is addressed and compartmentalized in mitochondria by two-mitochondrial localization sequences (MLS) located in the N-terminal prodomain. Once in mitochondria, the full-length AIF is processed and the prodomain removed, yielding a mature form of ∼57 kDa (1Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). This form comprises three structural domains: FAD-binding domain, NADH-binding domain, and the C-terminal domain (2Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. Penninger J. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The first two domains compose the oxidoreductase part of AIF, which confers an electron transfer activity to the protein (4Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G. Penninger J.M. Peleato M.L. Kroemer G. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16391-16398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of AIF seems to be the pro-apoptotic domain (24Delettre C. Yuste V.J. Moubarak R.S. Bras M. Lesbordes-Brion J.C. Petres S. Bellalou J. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6413-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One splice variant of AIF, AIF-exB, was reported soon after the initial description of AIF (25Loeffler M. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Metivier D. Nieminen A.L. Brothers G. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This variant contained an alternative exon 2b instead of the original exon 2. Although the function of this alternatively spliced variant is not yet deciphered, it is established that the alternative exon 2b usage does not affect AIF-exB mitochondrial import and function (25Loeffler M. Daugas E. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Metivier D. Nieminen A.L. Brothers G. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). More recently, our group identified a third AIF isoform, AIFsh (24Delettre C. Yuste V.J. Moubarak R.S. Bras M. Lesbordes-Brion J.C. Petres S. Bellalou J. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6413-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This isoform results from an alternate transcriptional start site located at intron 9 of AIF. As a result, AIFsh lacks the AIF N-terminal oxidoreductase domain. Intriguingly, AIFsh, which is a cytosolic protein, provokes the same effects as AIF: chromatin condensation and large-scale (50 kb) DNA fragmentation (24Delettre C. Yuste V.J. Moubarak R.S. Bras M.

Therefore, it seems that the oxidoreductase part of AIF is not necessary for the induction of cell death. However, some work suggest that, through the production of reactive oxygen species, the oxidoreductase portion of AIF could play an additional role in caspase-independent apoptosis (4Miramar M.D. Costantini P.

In the present article, we report the identification of a novel exon in AIF, which generates two new AIF mRNA transcripts in human (AIFsh2 and AIFsh3) and one in mouse (mAIFsh2). Through biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology approaches, we localized the AIFsh2 resulting protein in mitochondria from mouse liver or human HeLa cells. In contrast, these same approaches failed to detect the AIFsh3 protein. In addition, we explored the expression pattern of AIFsh2 and its biochemical properties and showed that this novel AIF isoform, which is absent in normal brain tissue, exhibited NADH oxidase but no nuclear proapoptotic activity. Together with our previous results (24Delettre C. Yuste V.J. Moubarak R.S. Bras M. Lesbordes-Brion J.C. Petres S. Bellalou J. Susin S.A. J. Biol.

For the 5′-RACE, the first round of PCR amplification was done using the adaptor primer 1 and reverse primer HCR1 (5′-CCTCGGTGCTCAAGTTCATTTGTAACGC-3′). The nested PCR was done with the nested primer adaptor primer 2 and HAIFshR (5′-CATAAGTGCTTTGCAACCTCTGAATAGGA-3′). For the 3′-RACE PCR the product was amplified using the adaptor primer 1 and the forward primer: I9F (5′-GCGTTACAAATGAACTTGAGCACCGAGG-3′). ARN Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA from human tissues was from Stratagene. RNAs from human cancer cell lines and mouse kidney were purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). For reverse transcription, 1 μg of total RNA was mixed with 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 150 ng of random primers (Promega). As a control, reverse transcription was performed without reverse transcriptase. Human AIFsh and AIFsh2 isoforms were amplified simultaneously using the primers I9F (5′-GCGTTACAAATGAACTTGAGCACCGAGG-3′) and R4 (5′-CACCAACTGTGGGCAAACTACT-3′). Human AIFsh3 was amplified using primers sh3F1 (5′-AGAGGAACCGGCTCCCAGGCCTA-3′) and HCR1 (5′-CCTCGGTGCTCAAGTTCATTTGTAACGC-3′). GAPDH was amplified using primers GAPDHF (5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′) and GAPDHR (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′). Mouse AIFsh2 isoform was amplified using primers mAIFsh2F (5′-GCCGAAATGTTCCGGTGTGGA-3′) and mAIFsh2R (5′-GCAAGACAGCCTTAATGGCTACGCTTCT-3′). In a set of experiments, PCR products were quantified using the Fluor-S MultiImager from Bio-Rad. For RNAi experiments AIF was amplified using primers HE7F (5′-GTACAGCTGGATGTGAGAGACAAC-3′) and R4 (5′-CACCAACTGTGGGCAAACTACT-3′), AIFsh was amplified using the specific primers I9F2 (5′-TCATGCCCACTGTCCTGTAAGT-3′) and R4 (5′-CACCAACTGTGGGCAAACTACT-3′), and AIFsh2 was amplified using the specific primers Hsh2F (5′-TCATGCCCACTGTCCTCTCGAGCCTT-3′) and R4 (5′-CACCAACTGTGGGCAAACTACT-3′). The conditions used for the PCR were 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles for GAPDH, 35 cycles for AIF, and 40 cycles for AIFsh, AIFsh2, and AIFsh3 of 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. All PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel. Vector Constructions—Mammalian expression vectors for AIF, AIFsh2, and AIFsh3 were carried out by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA fragments and subsequently cloned into cytomegalovirus promoter-based vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pEGFP-N1 (Stratagene), or C-terminal p3xFLAG (Sigma). Final constructs are referred to as pcDNA3-AIFsh2, pcDNA3-AIFsh3, pEGFP-AIF, pEGFP-AIFsh2, or p3xFLAG-AIFsh2. Empty vectors were used as controls. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Cell Death Induction—HeLa cells were cultured in complete culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, Invitrogen). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HeLa cells were seeded at a concentration of 2 × 105 into 6-well plates. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers protocol. 16 h after pcDNA3-AIFsh2, pcDNA3-AIFsh3, or pcDNA3-empty vector transfection, AIFsh2 and AIFsh3 protein expression was assessed by immunobloting. For RNAi assays, HeLa cells were transfected with specific siRNA double-stranded oligonucleotides designed against human AIF (I = 5′-GCAGAAAGGCTCGAGCCTT-3′), human AIFsh (II = 5′-GAATGTTTCATGGCAACTA-3′), human AIFsh2 (III = 5′-GGCAGAAAGGATATATGAA-3′), or a common siRNA against human AIF, AIFsh, and AIFsh2 (IV = 5′-GCATGCTTCTACGATATAA-3′). As a control, we used an irrelevant siRNA oligonucleotide (Co. = 5′-GCGATAAGTCGTGTCTTAC-3′). 48 h after the indicated transfection of HeLa cells, AIF, AIFsh, or AIFsh2 mRNA expression was assessed by RT-PCR as described above. In these RNAi transfections we used Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) instead Lipofectamine 2000. Apoptosis was induced by treatment of HeLa cells for 8 h with staurosporine (STS) (1 μm, Sigma), etoposide (50 μm, Sigma), camptothecin (5 μm, Sigma), thapsigargin (10 μm, Sigma), TNF/CHX (25 ng/ml + 2 μg/ml, Sigma), and β-lapachone (20 μm, Sigma). Mitochondrial Purification, HeLa Cell Fractionation, and Assessment of AIF/AIFsh2 Release—Mitochondria from HeLa cells or mouse liver were isolated as previously described (9Yuste V.J. Moubarak R.S. Delettre C. Bras M. Sancho P. Robert N. d'Alayer J. Susin S.A. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, and 5 mm EGTA. Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay® method. 300 μg of mitochondria were left untreated, treated with Atractyloside (5 mm), or pretreated for 15 min at 4 °C with the broad cysteine protease inhibitor leupeptin (10 μm, Sigma), the cathepsin inhibitor Z-FA-fmk (10 μm, Sigma), or the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (10 μm, Calbiochem) before addition of atractyloside. The mixture was incubated for 35 min at 25 °C and centrifuged (30 min, 4 °C, 13,400 × g) to obtain a mitochondrial pellet (P) or supernatant containing proteins released from mitochondria (SN). Supernatants were further re-clarified (90 min, 4 °C, 100,000 × g) to produce a soluble fraction. In pcDNA3-AIFsh3 overexpression assays, the cytosolic purification was performed with 2 × 106 HeLa cells. Cells left untreated or treated with STS, etoposide, camptothecin, thapsigargin, TNF/CHX, or β-lapachone were resuspended in buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.2), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.025% digitonin, and kept on ice for 5 min. Cells were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C) and the supernatant was retained as the cytosolic fraction. Protein content was quantified by the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay® method. Immunofluorescence—For viewing the localization of pEGFP-AIF, pEGFP-AIFsh2, and pEGFP-N1, transfected HeLa cells seeded on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and stained with Mitotracker Red® (20 nm, Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were mounted and red (mitochondrial) and green (GFP) fluorescence was observed in a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope and analyzed using Nikon ACT-1 software. Recombinant Proteins—N-terminal His-tagged AIF, AIFsh, and AIFsh2 human recombinant proteins were produced from a Novagen pET28b expression vector, purified from Escherichia coli extracts on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity matrix and stored in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol until use. Reconstitution of AIFsh2 and Redox Activity—AIF, AIFsh, and AIFsh2 were reconstituted with FAD following the protocol described by Miramar et al. (4Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M.

In situ detection of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction on native-PAGE was done using the reaction mixture described elsewhere (27Lopez-Huertas E. Corpas F.J. Sandalio L.M. Del Rio L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were loaded onto a 8% native-PAGE. The gel was incubated 60 min in the dark with 2 mm NBT solution. Then, 1 mm NADH was added to reduce NBT and the reaction was stopped with water after the appearance of the blue band. NAD(P)H oxidase activity of AIFsh2 was performed following procedures described previously (4Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G. Penninger J.M. Peleato M.L. Kroemer G. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16391-16398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Briefly, NAD(P)H oxidase activity was measured at 25 °C in a total volume of 0.5 ml containing 0.25 mm NAD(P)H in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of AIFsh2 and was followed by decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. NBT reduction and superoxide formed in the reaction of AIFsh2 with oxygen were quantified as described (4Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G. Penninger J.M.

Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblot analysis, 5μg of purified mitochondria or 20 μg of total or cytosolic cell extract were subjected to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), which was blocked and probed with an anti-AIF N-terminal (1/1,000, N-19, Sta Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-AIF C-terminal (1/10,000, epitope being aa 593–613, Sigma), or an anti-FLAG antibody (1/100,000, Sigma) and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase (1/10,000, Sigma). In transient transfection essays, AIFsh3 was detected with a N-terminal anti-AIF antibody designed against an AIF peptide (1/5000, amino acids 186–216). As substrates for immunodetection, we used the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell-free System—For the study of chromatin condensation, nuclei from HeLa cells were purified as described by Susin et al. (28Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In standard conditions, nuclei (103 nuclei/μl) were cultured in the presence of AIF, AIFsh, or AIFsh2 for 90 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei presenting chromatin with a translucid aspect were considered apoptotic. Alternatively, nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml) followed by cytofluorometric analysis (28Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M.

Identification of a Novel Exon in the Human AIF Gene, Which Results in Two Novel AIF Isoforms: AIFsh2 and AIFsh3—Recently, by 3′- and 5′-RACE, we have identified a new AIF transcript that results from an alternate transcriptional start site located in intron 9 of AIF (24Delettre C. Yuste V.J. Moubarak R.S. Bras M. Lesbordes-Brion J.C. Petres S. Bellalou J. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6413-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This new transcript encoded for a new protein called AIFsh (24Delettre C. Yuste V.J. Moubarak R.S. Bras M. Lesbordes-Brion J.C. Petres S. Bellalou J. Susin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6413-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By a similar 3′- and 5′-RACE approach, we identified here two new AIF cDNA species in a human kidney cDNA Marathon library: AIF short 2 (AIFsh2) and AIF short 3 (AIFsh3). AIFsh2 and AIFsh3 differed from the three previously described AIF forms, AIF, AIF-exB, and AIFsh (1Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar, 24Delettre C.

Kroemer G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), by alternative usage of a new exon of 203 bp: exon 9b (Fig. 1, A and B). This new exon was located in intron 9 of AIF, between exons 9 and 10 (nucleotides 28309–28511 of AIF, GenBank™ accesion number NT_011786, Gene ID 9131). Analysis of the flanking genomic sequences of exon 9b showed that it contained a consensus for splicing signals (29Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In AIFsh2, exon 9b encoded for only two amino acids (Asp and Ile), which are followed by a stop codon (Fig. 2). The resulting 324 amino acid protein did not contain the AIF C-terminal domain (Figs. 1A and 2A). The AIFsh3 transcript included exon 9b but lacked AIF exon 2 (Fig. 1A). Here, the absence of exon 2 provoked a change in the open reading frame that generates a stop codon. As a result, the translation initiation site for AIFsh3 was located in exon 3 of AIF (Fig. 1A). The resulting putative AIFsh3 protein (237 amino acids) lacked both the mitochondrial localization sequences and the C-terminal domain of AIF (Figs. 1A and 2A). We next searched for a mouse ortholog of AIFsh2 and AIFsh3. An in silico analysis of the mouse AIF nucleotide sequence failed to detect an equivalent of exon 9b. Although, a RT-PCR assessment, performed between exon 1 and intron 9 (see “Experimental Procedures”), led us to amplify an mRNA transcript (mouse AIFsh2, mAIFsh2) containing the murine ortholog sequence for exon 9b. This exon encoded three amino acids (Cys, Glu, and Tyr), which were followed by a stop codon suppressing the C-terminal domain of mouse AIF (Fig. 2B). The resulting mAIFsh2 protein contained 324 amino acids (Fig. 2B). A similar approach failed to detect the AIFsh3 mouse ortholog. Altogether, our findings design a new map for AIF. Indeed, this gene includes a new exon, exon 9b, and codes for, at least, five different transcripts in human: AIF, AIF-exB, AIFsh, AIFsh2, and AIFsh3. In mice, the AIFsh3 mRNA is absent. AIFsh2 Localizes in Mouse and Human Mitochondria—We next focused on the detection of the AIFsh2 and AIFsh3 mRNA resulting proteins. In this way, given that AIF is confined in mitochondria (1Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N.

Mutations in the human homolog of MeaB, MMAA, lead to methylmalonic aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism that can be fatal. To obtain insights into the function of this recently discovered protein, we have characterized the entropic and enthalpic contributions to ΔGassoc″ for complexation of MeaB (in the presence and absence of nucleotides) with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (in the presence and absence of cofactor). The dissociation constant for binding of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and MeaB ranges from 34 ± 4 to 524 ± 66 nm, depending on the combination of nucleotide and mutase form. Holomutase binds MeaB 15-fold more tightly when the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GMPPNP, is bound versus GDP. In contrast, the apomutase binds MeaB with similar affinity in the presence of either nucleotide. Our studies reveal that a large structural rearrangement accompanies interaction between these proteins and buries between ∼4000 and 8600Å2 of surface area, depending on the combination of ligands in the active sites of the two proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MeaB binds GTP and GDP with similar affinity (Kd of 7.3 ± 1.9 and 6.2 ± 0.7 μm, respectively at 20 °C) and has low intrinsic GTPase activity (∼0.04 min–1 at 37 °C), which is stimulated ∼100-fold by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. These studies provide insights into the energetics of interaction between the radical enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and MeaB, which are discussed.

These studies provide insights into the energetics of interaction between the radical enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and MeaB, which are discussed. In recent years a number of auxiliary P-loop GTPases that function as chaperones in the assembly of metal cofactors in target enzymes have been described (1Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Their GTPase activity was initially inferred from sequence analysis that revealed the presence of signature motifs associated with this superfamily (2Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) and include a Walker A or P-loop and Walker B motifs, an aspartate residue involved in Mg2+ binding, and a GTP-binding (N/T)KXD sequence. Members of this family include UreG, which is involved in the assembly of the nickel-based metallocenter in urease (3Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although many of these proteins have since been demonstrated to possess low GTPase activity, their precise function in the assembly of their respective metalloprotein targets remains to be resolved. The most recently described member of this subfamily of GTPases is MeaB, which is strongly associated in bacterial operons with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (8Bobik T.A. Rasche M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37194-37198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a B12-dependent isomerase that catalyzes the rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (9Banerjee R.

An ortholog of MeaB, MMAA, is found in humans and is the locus of mutations associated with the cblA class of inborn errors of cobalamin disorders that leads to methylmalonic aciduria (11Dobson C.M. Wai T. Leclerc D. Wilson A. Wu X. Dore C. Hudson T. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15554-15559Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Shevell M.I. Rosenblatt D.S. Can. J. Neurol. Sci. 1992; 19: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In humans, the cblA gene product and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase are localized in the mitochondrion. Based on the similarity between cblA and the Escherichia coli argK gene that encodes a lysine/ornithine/arginine transporter, it was proposed that cblA could be involved in the mitochondrial translocation of B12 (11Dobson C.M. Wai T. Leclerc D. Wilson A. Wu X. Dore C. Hudson T. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15554-15559Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, a recent study on MeaB from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 suggests that it may be involved in protecting methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a radical enzyme, from inactivation (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A second mitochondrial protein that plays an auxiliary role for the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase-catalyzed reaction is adenosyltransferase, the locus of the cblB class of genetic defects (13Dobson C.M. Wai T. Leclerc D. Kadir H. Narang M. Lerner-Ellis J.P. Hudson T.J. Rosenblatt D.S. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Leal N.A. Park S.D. Kima P.E. Bobik T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9227-9234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Adenosyltransferase catalyzes the synthesis of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), 2The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; GMPPNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. 2The abbreviations used are: AdoCbl, adenosylcobalamin; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; GMPPNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; MCM, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. the active cofactor form utilized by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. It has been postulated that adenosyltransferase is a dual function protein that serves as an enzyme to synthesize AdoCbl and an escort, which delivers it to the mutase (15Yamanishi M. Vlasie M. Banerjee R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 304-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is speculated that MMAA (or MeaB) may gate the transfer of AdoCbl from adenosyltransferase to the mutase in a GTP-dependent manner (Fig. 1). 3Banerjee, R. (2006) Chem. Biol. 1, 149–159. 3Banerjee, R. (2006) Chem. Biol. 1, 149–159. The fusion of MeaB and mutase in a single polypeptide in some organisms (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggests that these two proteins influence each other's catalytic activities. However, the energetics of the interaction between these proteins and the modulation of kinetics in the complex are unknown but are needed to test and refine the current working model. Clearly the functional elucidation of a highly conserved auxiliary protein for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase that is the locus of disease-causing mutations in humans is an important problem that merits attention. In addition, it is likely that insights into the function of any one of the members of the subfamily of P-loop GTPases that plays an auxiliary role in the function of a target metalloenzyme are likely to shed light on the mechanism of action of the others. In this study, we have characterized the thermodynamic parameters associated with the interaction of MeaB and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from M. extorquens AM1 and demonstrate that the interaction of the two proteins leads to a substantial structural reorganization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the low intrinsic GTPase activity of MeaB is stimulated ∼100-fold by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, and the identity of the nucleotide as well as the presence or absence of the B12 cofactor modulate the affinity between the two proteins. AdoCbl, GTP, GMPPNP, GDP, cGMP, GMP, AMPPNP, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Methylmalonic acid was purchased from Fluka. [14C]CH3-malonyl-CoA (56 Ci/mol) was purchased from New England Nuclear. All other chemicals were reagent grade and were used without further purification. The plasmid vectors pKN13 and pET21d:meaB, containing respectively the M. extorquens AM1 methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and meaB genes, were generous gifts from Mary E. Lidstrom (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was freshly transformed with pKN13 or pET21d:meaB plasmids, and this mixture was used directly to inoculate Luria Bertani medium (100 μl of transformed cells/liter of culture) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were grown overnight (∼12 h) at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for MeaB or 23 °C for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and grown for an additional 6–8 h. The proteins were purified as described (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Purified MeaB was concentrated, exchanged into 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol (buffer B), and stored at –80 °C. For methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, after the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, fractions of interest were pooled, concentrated, and exchanged into 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The protein solution was then applied to a 5 × 7.5 cm monoQ column (131 POROS HQ/H) equilibrated at a flow rate of 10 ml/min with buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl). The column was then washed at the same flow rate with 100 ml of buffer A and eluted with a 500-ml gradient from 50 to 250 mm KCl in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 over 50 min at the same flow rate. The purified MCM was concentrated, exchanged into 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To determine the oligomeric state of MeaB, ∼0.1–0.2 mg of the enzyme was loaded on a 2 × 70-cm Sephacryl 200 column in buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml min–1. The column was calibrated using gel filtration standards from Bio-Rad. These experiments were performed on a DynaPro apparatus (Protein Solutions) equipped with a temperature-controlled microsampler and the Dynamics V6 software. A solution of MeaB (1 mg/ml) in buffer B to which 1 mm GTP or GDP was added as desired, was centrifuged at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm for 30 min and then filtered through a 0.02-μm Anotop 10 filter (Whatman). The solution was then loaded into a quartz cell, and the measurements were performed at 15 °C using 10 sample acquisitions/experiment. To analyze complex formation between MeaB and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, 16 μg of apoenzyme was mixed with 10 μg of MeaB either alone or in the presence of (i) 50 μm AdoCbl or (ii) 50 μm AdoCbl and 1 mm methylmalonyl-CoA at 20 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol. After a 10-min incubation, the mixtures were analyzed by PAGE under nondenaturing condition in a 4 –15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) over ∼10 h at 4 °C. The same experiment was repeated in the presence of 1 mm GDP, GTP or GMPPNP, and no difference was observed in the stoichiometry of complex formation. The kinetic parameters for the GTPase activity of MeaB (10 μm) were determined in the presence of various concentrations of GTP (50–5000 μm) at 37°C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol. For each GTP concentration, aliquots were taken at intervals (5–120 min), treated with 1 n trichloroacetic acid (10% v/v), centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.02-μm Anotop 10 filter (Whatman) to remove the precipitated protein. The nucleotides were analyzed by reversed phase chromatography (250 × 4.6 mm Luna C18, 5μ; Phenomenex) eluted isocratically with 4.5% acetonitrile in 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, 75 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. The eluant was monitored at 254 nm. Under these conditions, GDP and GTP eluted at ∼8.7 and 15.0 min, respectively. Control experiments were performed where MeaB was omitted from the reaction mixture. The velocity of GTP hydrolysis was estimated for each concentration of GTP by fitting the data to a single exponential function. The kcat values obtained from this analysis were then plotted against the concentration of GTP, and the kinetic parameters, Km and kcat (under Vmax conditions) were obtained by a Michaelis-Menten analysis of the data set. To determine whether MeaB had ATPase activity, a parallel experiment was performed in which GTP was replaced by 5 mm ATP and analyzed as described above. The effect of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (apo- or holo-form) on the GTPase activity of MeaB was analyzed by incubating the complex (containing 10 μm of each protein) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol with 5 mm GTP at 37 °C. At intervals of 2–30 min, aliquots were removed and analyzed as previously described. All of the calorimetric binding experiments were performed using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (1.44-ml cell volume) (Microcal, Inc., Northampton, MA), equipped with a ThermoVac sample degasser and a 300-μl syringe. Prior to performing the titrations, stock solutions of proteins and ligand were filtered through 0.22-μm polyvinylidene difluoride syringe filters (Millipore) and degassed for 10 min. In all experiments, the ligand was added to the protein in the sample cell. The heats of binding were corrected for the heat of ligand dilution by subtraction of the average heat associated with multiple injections of ligand following saturation of the binding sites. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, and the data were analyzed using Microcal ORIGIN software. Binding of Ligands to MeaB—MeaB (10–100 μm) was titrated with twenty-nine 10-μl aliquots of a 125–1250 μm solution of GDP or GMPPNP in buffer B at temperatures ranging from 5 to 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. To circumvent problems with the GTPase activity of MeaB, the nonhydrolyzable analog GMPPNP was employed, and we made the assumption that it bound with affinity similar to that of GTP. The same experiments were repeated with buffer B lacking KCl to assess the importance of electrostatic interactions for effector binding. The calorimetric signals were integrated, and the data were analyzed with Microcal ORIGIN software using a single-site binding model to determine the equilibrium association constant, KA, and the binding enthalpy, ΔH°. The Gibbs free energy of binding, ΔG°, and the entropic contribution to the binding free energy, –TΔS°, were calculated using Equations 1 and 2. ΔGo=−RTlnKA(Eq. 1) ΔGo=ΔHo−TΔSo(Eq. 2) No heat release was observed when GMP, cGMP, or ATP was added to MeaB. Effect of Methylmalony-CoA Mutase on Binding of Effectors by MeaB—The binding of nucleotides to the complex of apo- or holo-mutase with MeaB (1:1) containing 8–14 μm of each protein in buffer B was titrated as described above. Thermodynamics of Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase·MeaB Complex Formation—In all experiments, 45–180 μm methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (apoenzyme or holoenzyme) was added to 4–15 μm MeaB in the sample cell. GDP or GMPPNP (500 μm) was added both in the syringe and in the cell. Complex formation was titrated in buffer B as described above. The extent of structural rearrangement that occurs during complex formation was estimated as described previously (17Myszka D.G. Sweet R.W. Hensley P. Brigham-Burke M. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Doyle M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9026-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The binding heat capacity change, ΔCassoco, a measure of the hydrophobic surface buried during complex formation, was determined by performing the binding experiments at temperatures ranging from 5 to 20 °C ± 0.1 °C. The binding enthalpy change observed at each temperature was then plotted versus temperature, and the data were fitted to a linear function; the slope yielded the value of ΔCassoco. Nonpolar (ΔAnp) and polar (ΔAp) surface areas (Å2) buried upon complex formation were calculated from the empirical relationships described in Equations 3 and 4, ΔCassoco=0.45 ΔAnp−0.26 ΔAp(Eq. 3) ΔH60o=−8.44 ΔAnp+31.4 ΔAp(Eq. 4) where ΔH60o is the binding enthalpy change at 60 °C. The number of residues that become ordered during binding, Rth, was calculated using Equation 5, which describes the net entropy change ΔSassoco, which is equal to zero at the characteristic temperature TS. ΔSassoco=0=ΔSHEo(TS)+ΔSrto+ΔSothero(Eq. 5) The terms contributing to ΔSassoco are the solvation entropy or hydrophobic effect (ΔSHEo(TS)=1.35 ΔCassoco ln (TS/386)), an unfavorable entropic term resulting from loss of rotational and translational degrees of freedom for proteins upon binding (ΔSrto =–50 entropy units (cal/(mol·K) for binary protein-protein interactions) and ΔSothero, which is related to Rth because Rth = ΔSothero/–5.6 e.u.

A. 2000; 97: 9026-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Purification and Properties of MeaB and Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase—Recombinant MeaB containing a C-terminal His tag was obtained using an expression system developed in the Lidstrom laboratory (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that yielded ∼15 mg of highly pure protein/liter of culture. A single band with a molecular mass of ∼37 kDa was observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), which corresponds to the predicted mass of the polypeptide of 35 kDa. Size exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Sephacryl 200 column yielded an estimated molecular mass of ∼76 ± 6 kDa, consistent with it being a homodimer. Because MeaB has been previously reported to be a monomer (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), dynamic light scattering was used as an additional probe of the oligomerization state of the protein. In the presence of GTP or GDP, >97% of the samples displays a radius of 3.6 nm with an estimated molecular mass of ∼67 kDa (n = at least 13 for each experiment; data not shown). Interestingly, in the absence of nucleotides, >99% of the protein displays a radius of 4.4 nm with an estimated molecular mass of 110 kDa (n = 19). Thus, nucleotide binding elicits a conformational change that decreases the radius of MeaB, suggesting a more compact structure for the binary complex. The dynamic light scattering data are consistent with MeaB existing as a dimer in solution. Prior studies from this laboratory have focused on the recombinant Propionibacterium shermanii methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. To avoid the use of interacting proteins from different sources, recombinant M. extorquens AM1 methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was purified using an expression system developed in the Lidstrom laboratory (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The M. extorquens methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is a heterodimer with subunit molecular masses of 78 and 64 kDa, respectively. Highly pure mutase (136 mg) was isolated from a 6-liter culture (Fig. 2A) and had a specific activity of 54 μmol succinyl-CoA formed/min/mg of protein at 37 °C. This is ∼40-fold higher than previously reported (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and similar to the activity measured in our laboratory for the P. shermanii mutase (18Vlasie M.D. Banerjee R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 5431-5436Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Padovani D. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Complex Formation Between MeaB and Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase—MeaB forms a stable complex with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase that can be resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel. As reported previously (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), two bands corresponding to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase were observed on a native gel (Fig. 2B). Complex formation was monitored in the presence of GMPPNP at an increasing molar ratio of MeaB:methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and was found to saturate at a ratio of ∼1:1. This is consistent with the association of one dimer (or two monomers) of MeaB per heterodimer of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. The addition of 5 mm GTP had no effect on the binding stoichiometry (not shown). Characterization of Nucleotide Binding to MeaB—The thermodynamic parameters associated with binding of nucleotides to MeaB were assessed by ITC at two ionic strengths (Table 1). The binding of GMP-PNP to MeaB is apparently independent of the presence or absence of 300 mm KCl in contrast to GDP, which binds ∼5-fold more tightly in the absence of KCl. Binding of GDP to MeaB is enthalpically driven, whereas both entropic and enthaplic changes contribute favorably to binding of the GTP analog, with entropic factors dominating in the presence of salt. The data were fitted with a binding stoichiometry of one GMPPNP (or GDP) per dimer of MeaB, suggesting half of sites activity. The addition of either GMP, cGMP, or AMPPNP did not result in measurable heat release.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for binding of nucleotides to MeaBNucleotideKClKdΔH°TΔS°ΔG°mmμmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molGMPPNP05.6 ± 0.4-5.1 ± 0.71.9 ± 0.3-7.1 ± 0.43007.3 ± 0.6-0.11 ± 0.026.7 ± 0.3-6.5 ± 0.3GDP01.3 ± 0.1-13.6 ± 0.5-5.7 ± 0.4-7.9 ± 0.23006.2 ± 0.7-9.2 ± 0.4-2.2 ± 0.2-7.0 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab Energetics of Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase and MeaB Complex Formation—Binding of both apo- and holo-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to nucleotide-bound MeaB was evaluated by ITC (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The thermodynamic parameters for binding of apomutase to MeaB·GDP or MeaB·GMPPNP are similar and enthalpically driven, whereas the entropy of association is unfavorable for both complexes. The temperature dependence of ΔH° (Fig. 3B) showed a linear relationship and yielded values for the binding heat capacity change, ΔC°, of –1255 and –704 cal/(mol·K) for the MeaB·GMPPNP and MeaB·GDP complexes, respectively. Based on the empirical relationships (described under “Experimental Procedures”), between ΔC° and the polar and nonpolar surface areas that are buried upon binding, it is estimated that ∼8600 Å2 are buried when apomutase binds to the MeaB·GMPPNP complex versus ∼5360 Å2 in the MeaB·GDP complex. These correspond to 80 and 49 residues becoming ordered in the protein·protein complexes that have GMPPNP or GDP bound to MeaB, respectively.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for binding of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase to MeaB·nucleotide complexesMCMMeaBΔH°TΔS°ΔG°KdΔC°-Ap-AnpRthnucleotidekcal/molkcal/molkcal/molnmcal/(mol·K)Å2Å2Apo-formGMPPNP-24.1 ± 0.5-15.0 ± 0.8-9.2 ± 0.3155 ± 24-12553684491780GDP-22.4 ± 0.6-13.0 ± 0.7-9.4 ± 0.2110 ± 21-7042403295549Holo-formGMPPNP-33.0 ± 1.1-23.0 ± 1.0-10.0 ± 0.134 ± 4-8653186376371GDP-27.2 ± 1.2-18.8 ± 1.2-8.5 ± 0.2524 ± 66-4161940204635 Open table in a new tab The energetics of binding of holomutase to MeaB revealed interesting preferences. Binding of holomutase to MeaB·GMPPNP is 4.6-fold tighter than of apomutase and is driven by a substantial decrease in the enthalpy of association (Table 2). The change in the binding heat capacity for formation of the holomutase·MeaB·GMPPNP and holomutase·MeaB·GDP complexes are –865 and –416 cal/(mol·K), respectively, and correspond to ∼6950 and ∼4000 Å2 of surface area becoming buried. From the experimental enthalpy of association, it is estimated that 71 and 35 residues become ordered as holomutase binds to MeaB·GMPPNP and MeaB·GDP, respectively. Binding of holomutase to MeaB containing GDP instead of GMPPNP is less favorable by a factor of 15. This change in the dissociation constant is largely governed by a smaller decrease in ΔH°. Effect of Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase on Binding of Nucleotides to MeaB—Having characterized the effect of nucleotide-bound MeaB on association with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, we next examined the effect of the mutase on binding of nucleotides by MeaB (Fig. 3C and Table 3). The addition of apomutase decreased the Kd for GDP and GMPPNP binding to MeaB by factors of 6.5 and 51, respectively. The presence of holomutase has essentially no effect on the affinity of MeaB for GDP and decreased the Kd for GMPPNP by ∼8-fold.TABLE 3Effect of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase on the energetics of nucleotide binding to MeaB at 20 °CMCMNucleotidesKdΔH°TΔS°ΔG°μmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molNoneGDP1.3 ± 0.1-13.6 ± 0.5-5.7 ± 0.4-7.9 ± 0.2GMPPNP5.6 ± 0.4-5.1 ± 0.7+1.9 ± 0.3-7.1 ± 0.4Apo-formGDP0.2 ± 0.01-20.8 ± 0.6-11.8 ± 0.7-9.0 ± 0.1GMPPNP0.11 ± 0.01-8.4 ± 0.2+1.0 ± 0.1-9.4 ± 0.1Holo-formGDP0.91 ± 0.07-18.0 ± 0.2-9.9 ± 0.2-8.1 ± 0.2GMPPNP0.73 ± 0.01-16.0 ± 0.7+7.7 ± 0.7-8.2 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Effect of Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase on the GTPase Activity of MeaB—As predicted for a P-loop protein with an aspartate in the magnesium binding site, MeaB binds and hydrolyzes GTP, although the kinetics of this reaction have not been reported (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The kinetics of GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by MeaB was characterized by examining the time-dependent increase in GDP at various initial concentrations of GTP (Fig. 4). A Michaelis-Menten analysis of the data yielded the following parameters: Km (GTP) = 150 ± 20 μm and kcat = 0.039 ± 0.003 min–1 at 37 °C. The addition of apo-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase stimulated the GTPase activity of MeaB 108-fold to 4.2 ± 0.2 min–1 (Fig. 5). The addition of holo-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase increased the GTPase activity of MeaB by 123-fold, corresponding to k = 4.8 ± 0.2 min–1 cat (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Effect of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase on the GTPase activity of MeaB. The reactions were performed by incubating 10 μm apo- or holo-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (circle), MeaB (triangle), apo-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase·MeaB (square), or holo-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase·MeaB (diamond) with 5 mm GTP in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol at 37 °C and monitoring the time-dependent increase in GDP formation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The GTPase activities of MeaB alone, in complex with apo- or holo-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase were 0.039 ± 0.003, 4.2 ± 0.2, and 4.8 ± 0.2 min–1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a prototype of the family of G-protein cofactor chaperones, we have chosen to characterize MeaB and its target protein, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, from M. extorquens AM1. The predicted molecular mass of the polypeptide is ∼35 kDa, and it has been reported to exist in solution as a monomer (7Korotkova N. Lidstrom M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13652-13658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering studies revealed that MeaB is a dimer and thus resembles homologs, viz. UreG (4Zambelli B. Stola M. Musiani F. De Vriendt K. Samyn B. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Turano P. Dikiy A. Bryant D.A. Ciurli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4684-4695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), HypB (20Mehta N. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and CooC (6Jeon W.B. Cheng J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38602-38609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which are reported to be homodimers. MeaB forms a stable complex with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which can be separated on a native gel. A binding stoichiometry of ∼1:1 for dimeric MeaB·heterodimeric methylmalonyl-CoA mutase was seen when formation of the complex was titrated with increasing concentrations of MeaB·GMPPNP (Fig. 2). The differential effects of GDP versus GMPPNP and apo- versus holomutase on the thermodynamics of interaction with MeaB were revealed by titration calorimetry (Tables 1, 2, 3). MeaB exhibits similar affinities for GMPPNP, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP and GDP (Kd of 7.3 ± 0.6 and 6.2 ± 0.7 μm, respectively, in the presence of 300 mm KCl at 20 °C) and thus belongs to the subclass of GTPases characterized by low nucleotide affinity (21Uthaiah R.C. Praefcke G.J. Howard J.C. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29336-29343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Other examples of GTPases that are similarly non-discriminatory in their binding preference for GTP versus GDP include members of a family of interferon-inducible GTPases, viz. Mx and hGBP1. The presence of the mutase enhances the affinity for the nucleotides with the strongest effect being observed for GMPPNP binding to the apomutase (51-fold increase) or to the holomutase (8-fold increase) (Table 3). The dissociation constant for binding of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and MeaB ranges from 34 to 524 nm at 20 °C depending on the combination of nucleotide and the form of mutase employed (Table 2). Interestingly, although holomutase exhibits a 15-fold higher affinity for the GMPPNP-bound form of MeaB versus the GDP-bound form, the apomutase does not show a similar preference, binding both forms with comparable affinity. The extent of structural reorganization that accompanies complex formation can be assessed from relationships that correlate binding and folding energetics with structure (22Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 23Freire E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The ΔC° values yield estimates of the surface area that becomes buried during complex formation. Binding of apo- and holo-mutase to a complex of MeaB·GMPPNP is estimated to bury 8600 and 5360 Å2 of surface area, respectively. Although a three-dimensional structure of the complex of these two proteins is not available, based on the magnitudes of the surface areas that are predicted to become buried, they are unlikely to be restricted to the interface. Structural rearrangements distal to the protein-protein interface are also predicted from a similar analysis for the interaction between the CD4 receptor and gp120, the external envelope glycoprotein of the HIV (17Myszka D.G. Sweet R.W. Hensley P. Brigham-Burke M. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Doyle M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9026-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Indeed, because the magnitudes of the nonpolar surfaces that become buried in site specific complexation of macromolecules is often too large to be ascribed to “rigid body association,” it has been postulated that they reflect conformational changes that are coupled to binding (24Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Ha J.H. Spolar R.S. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 801-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The presence of a fully conserved P-loop motif in MeaB predicts that it has GTPase activity. MeaB has modest intrinsic GTPase activity (kcat of ∼0.04 min–1 at 37 °C), which is comparable with that of UreG (0.04 min–1 (4Zambelli B. Stola M. Musiani F. De Vriendt K. Samyn B. Devreese B.

Chem. 2005; 280: 4684-4695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)) and slightly lower than of HypB (∼0.17 min–1 (5Fu C. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) and CooC (0.23 min–1 (6Jeon W.B. Cheng J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38602-38609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). The presence of apo- or holo-mutase has a significant effect, enhancing the GTPase activity by 2 orders of magnitude. These results suggest that the mutase functions as a mild GAP (guanine nucleotide-activating protein) and that in its presence, MeaB would accumulate in the GDP-bound state, which has a lower affinity for the MeaB·mutase complex (Scheme 1). A variety of processes in nature are regulated by guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that act as molecular switches that toggle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. A conserved G-domain fold is common to members of this superfamily and harbors the essential motifs for the switch (16Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). A homology model of MeaB was generated using the coordinates for the crystal structure for the signal sequence-binding protein from Thermus aquaticus (Fig. 6). The predicted structure has a core α/β G domain comprised of parallel β-strands surrounded by α-helices. An N-terminal Walker A motif contains a GXXGXGK(S/T) sequence that is predicted to function in positioning the triphosphate moiety of the bound nucleotide. The Walker B motif contains a conserved aspartate at its N-terminal end that may play a structural role, and the (N/T)KXD sequence confers specificity for guanine (2Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal regions of MeaB appear to be organized into discrete modules in the modeled structure, and one or both could be involved in interactions with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and/or dimer formation. In summary, elucidation of the thermodynamics of interaction between MeaB with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase provides insights into their modulation by nucleotides, which in turn affects the intrinsic GTPase activity of MeaB as shown in Scheme 1. MeaB binds GMPPNP ∼4-fold more tightly than GDP, although this difference disappears when the titrations are conducted in the presence of 300 mm KCl (Table 1), which is likely to be more physiologically relevant. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase binds to the MeaB·GTP complex and stimulates the GTPase activity of MeaB by a factor of ∼100. The resulting MeaB·GDP form has a 15-fold lower affinity for the mutase. In contrast, apomutase does not discriminate between the GDP- and GMPPNP-bound forms of MeaB in terms of binding affinity. These data suggest that the enhanced GTPase activity in the MeaB·mutase complex could be harnessed in the auxiliary role that MeaB plays in the mutase-catalyzed reaction in the cell and as shown in the model in Fig. 1. We gratefully acknowledge the generous gifts of the expression constructs for MeaB and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from Mary Lidstrom (University of Washington)."
https://openalex.org/W2021934976,"After the completion of a draft human genome sequence1, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium has proceeded to finish2 and annotate each of the 24 chromosomes comprising the human genome. Here we describe the sequencing and analysis of human chromosome 3, one of the largest human chromosomes. Chromosome 3 comprises just four contigs, one of which currently represents the longest unbroken stretch of finished DNA sequence known so far. The chromosome is remarkable in having the lowest rate of segmental duplication in the genome. It also includes a chemokine receptor gene cluster as well as numerous loci involved in multiple human cancers such as the gene encoding FHIT, which contains the most common constitutive fragile site in the genome, FRA3B3. Using genomic sequence from chimpanzee and rhesus macaque, we were able to characterize the breakpoints defining a large pericentric inversion that occurred some time after the split of Homininae from Ponginae, and propose an evolutionary history of the inversion."
https://openalex.org/W2076304369,"ADAMTS1 is an extracellular metalloproteinase known to participate in a variety of biological processes that includes inflammation, angiogenesis, and development of the urogenital system. Many of its functions rely on its catalytic activity, which thus far has been limited to the cleavage of the matrix proteoglycans aggrecan and versican. However, it is likely that other substrates exist. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the Kunitz-type inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), as a binding partner of ADAMTS1. The interaction was confirmed by several biochemical and cell-based assays. In addition, our studies revealed alterations in the pattern of TFPI-2-secreted isoforms and in its extracellular location caused by the specific action of ADAMTS1. Interestingly, we found that TFPI-2 is a novel substrate of ADAMTS1. The cleavage removes a protease-sensitive C-terminal region in TFPI-2, altering its binding properties. The proposed role of TFPI-2 as a maintenance factor of extracellular remodeling suggests the indirect function of ADAMTS1 as an additional homeostatic player by its ability to alter the extracellular location of TFPI-2 and, therefore, to disrupt the remodeling machinery, a phenomenon directly associated to pathologies such as atherosclerosis and tumor progression.

The extracellular milieu has been recognized as a dynamic scenario that directly influences proliferation, survival, migration, and biosynthetic activities of cells. The constituents of this extracellular environment include growth factors, chemokines, cell surface proteins, and an extensive list of matrix components with structural and signaling properties. Matrix proteases and their respective inhibitors are also important components of the extracellular milieu with the added value that these molecules modify, degrade, or inflict functional alterations to most of the components previously listed (1Handsley M.M. Edwards D.R. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 115: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In fact, modification of extracellular components by processing and/or proteolysis is a frequent event during morphogenesis and tissue repair and, in an altered manner, during the progression of various pathological conditions (2Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family of proteases includes a group of 19 secreted enzymes with a more restricted spectrum of catalytic activities than the well known matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain; ADAMTS, a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I motifs; ECM, extracellular matrix; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TFPI-2, tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor 2; TSR, thrombospondin type I repeat; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; pAb, polyclonal antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay. 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain; ADAMTS, a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type I motifs; ECM, extracellular matrix; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TFPI-2, tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor 2; TSR, thrombospondin type I repeat; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; pAb, polyclonal antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay.

The enzyme is known to have catalytic activity toward matrix proteoglycans, particularly versican and aggrecan (8Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C.

Mechanistically, it is not evident that the outcomes of the gene-deletion studies can be linked with the catalytic profile known for this enzyme. Thus, it is possible that either other domains contribute to the spectrum of biological functions and/or that additional biologically relevant substrates are yet to be identified. The modular structure of ADAMTS1 allows for a multiplicity of protein-protein interactions that are likely to affect its biological actions. Here, we have exploited the yeast two-hybrid system to identify potential interacting proteins. The screen resulted in the identification of tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) as a binding partner for ADAMTS1. TFPI-2 was first identified as a serine proteinase inhibitor containing Kunitz domains (10Sprecher C.A. Kisiel W. Mathewes S. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 11Miyagi Y. Koshikawa N. Yasumitsu H. Miyagi E. Hirahara F. Aoki I. Misugi K. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Its inhibitory abilities have been demonstrated toward tissue factor (TF)-Factor VIIa complex, trypsin, plasmin, and kallikrein (12Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Consequently, this inhibitor affects the plasmin- and trypsin-mediated activation of matrix metalloproteinases proMMP-1 and proMMP-3 (13Rao C.N. Mohanam S. Puppala A. Rao J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, direct inhibition of MMP1, -2, -9, and -13 activities have been reported (14Herman M.P. Sukhova G.K. Kisiel W. Foster D. Kehry M.R. Libby P. Schonbeck U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). TFPI-2 is secreted by several cell types, including endothelial cells (15Rao C.N. Gomez D.E. Woodley D.T. Thorgeirsson U.P. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1995; 317: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), keratinocytes (17Rao C.N. Peavey C.L. Liu Y.Y. Lapiere J.C. Woodley D.T. J. Investig.

Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Placenta. 1998; 19: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Its preferential association to the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been documented (19Liu Y.

Biophys. 1999; 370: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and several reports suggest a pivotal role of TFPI-2 in the maintenance and regulation of ECM remodeling. In fact, altered levels of TFPI-2 have been associated with pathological conditions, such as atherosclerosis (14Herman M.P. Sukhova G.K. Kisiel W. Foster D. Kehry M.R. Libby P. Schonbeck U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and tumor growth, although its action in this second case appears paradoxical and dependent on the tumor model studied. For example, its expected inhibitory role was observed in models of glioma invasion (20Konduri S.D. Rao C.N. Chandrasekar N. Tasiou A. Mohanam S. Kin Y. Lakka S.S. Dinh D. Olivero W.C. Gujrati M. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Rao J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6938-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and fibrosarcoma growth and metastasis (21Chand H.S. Du X. Ma D. Inzunza H.D. Kamei S. Foster D. Brodie S. Kisiel W. Blood. 2004; 103: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, TFPI-2 exerts a pro-invasive effect on hepatocarcinoma (22Neaud V. Hisaka T.

In aggressive uveal melanoma, this molecule was found to be up-regulated when compared with poorly aggressive melanoma (23Ruf W. Seftor E.A. Petrovan R.J. Weiss R.M. Gruman L.M. Margaryan N.V. Seftor R.E. Miyagi Y. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5381-5389PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this latter study, TFPI-2 was implicated in processes of vasculogenic mimicry, an alternative pathway for tumor perfusion that is independent of angiogenesis (for review, see Ref. 24Folberg R. Maniotis A.J. APMIS. 2004; 112: 508-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study we confirmed the interaction between ADAMTS1 and TFPI-2 by several independent approaches. Moreover, our results indicate that the interaction regulates the extracellular distribution of TFPI-2 through the proteolytic processing at its C-terminal end. These effects were observed in both cell culture and tumor xenograft assays. Taken together, these findings suggest that ADAMTS1 is a regulator of TFPI-2 function by modulating its distribution within the extracellular microenvironment, implicating a role for ADAMTS1 in pathological processes that includes, but is not restricted to, tumor progression and atherosclerosis. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid System 2 (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer. A cDNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 540–666 of human ADAMTS1 was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pAS2–1 vector that was previously digested with NdeI and SalI. The resulting GAL-4BD-ADAMTS1540–666 chimera protein was used as bait to screen a human placenta MATCHMAKER cDNA library (Clontech). Both bait and library vectors were simultaneously introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae CG-1945, and double transformants were selected on synthetic minimal medium with dextrose but lacked tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. A total of ∼7 × 105 clones was screened. Putative positive colonies were re-streaked and tested for β-galactosidase activity using a filter assay. DNA fragments from positive colonies were amplified by PCR using the MATCHMAKER 5′- and 3′-AD LD-Insert Screening Amplimers and then sequenced. Expression Vectors—Bicistronic TFPI-2-green fluorescent protein expression vector was obtained as follows. pZem 229 plasmid (10Sprecher C.A. Kisiel W. Mathewes S. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) containing the TFPI-2 cDNA was digested with EcoRI and subsequently cloned into the EcoRI pIRES2-EGFP (BD Biosciences Clontech). To generate the TFPI-2-Myc expression vector (scheme in Fig. 1B), pZem229 was used as a template to amplify and create new restriction sites with the following oligonucleotides: TFPI-2 forward 5′-C AGA ATT CCC ATG GAC CCC GCT CGC-3′, TFPI-2 reverse 5′-CT TGG TAC CTG CTT CTT CCG AAT TTT C-3′ (EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites are in bold, and the starting ATG is underlined). The resulting PCR product was then cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) using the TOPO-TA cloning kit, and the TFPI-2 cDNA was obtained by subsequent digestion with EcoRI and KpnI. This fragment was inserted into KpnI/EcoRI pcDNA 3.1/Myc-His(–) B expression vector (Invitrogen). This construct contains a functional Myc-His epitope at the C-terminal end. The C-terminal-truncated TFPI-2 (ΔCTFPI-2-Myc) expression vector (scheme in Fig. 1B) was generated by amplification of pZem229 with the same forward primer noted above and the reverse primer 5′-CTT GGT ACC CTT TTT CAA AGC TTT TGC-3′. The same procedure described above was used to subclone this truncated form into KpnI/ EcoRI pcDNA 3.1/Myc-His(–) B expression vector (Invitrogen). Full-length human ADAMTS1, zinc-binding site mutant E385A-ADAMTS1, and ΔTSRs-ADAMTS1 (Met-Dis: 1–556) constructs have previously been described (9Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Westling J. Thai S.N.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatments—Mouse lung endothelial (LE) and 293T cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 under saturated humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), penicillin-streptomycin, l-glutamine, and plasmocin. Transient and stable transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's specification. pLSHL-Hygro vector (Invitrogen) was co-transfected in stable transfection experiments for further selection with hygromycin. Additional stable cell lines used in this study are 293T overexpressors of ADAMTS1 (26Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Milchanowski A.B. Dufour E.K. Leduc R. Iruela-Arispe M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33471-33479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and zinc-binding site mutant E385A-ADAMTS1 (9Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Westling J. Thai S.N. Luque A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Sandy J.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium from stable 293T cell lines was collected after 48 h of incubation in serum-free medium. For transient transfection experiments, cells were maintained for 24 h in 10% fetal calf serum and then switched to serum-free medium before collecting the conditioned medium and harvesting the cell lysates. Cell culture treatments are as follows: 5 μg/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Calbiochem), 1 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 6 μm protease inhibitor BB94 (a generous gift from Richard Kenagy, University of Washington, Seattle, WA), 5 milliunits/ml plasmin (Roche Applied Science), 1 units/ml thrombin (Sigma), and 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 20 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma). In all cases treatments were performed in serum-free media. For lung endothelial treatments, cultures were serum-deprived overnight before treatment with the indicated conditioned medium or recombinant proteins diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Conditioned medium was collected, and the cell layer was rinsed twice with PBS and harvested in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA). N-Glycosidase F Treatment—Conditioned medium was methanolprecipitated and re-suspended in 50 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA). Samples were incubated for 3 min at 100 °C, and then 0.1% Triton X-100 was added. Enzymatic incubation was performed at 37 °C for 20 h in the presence of 1 unit of N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science). In Vitro Digestion of TFPI-2—Conditioned medium from stable TFPI-2-Myc overexpressing 293T cells was purified under denaturing conditions (PBS, pH 8, 8 m urea) with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Bound protein was washed with PBS and equilibrated with reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 5 μg/ml heparin). Digestions were performed at 37 °C for 16 h. Then samples were concentrated with StrataClean resin (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot with Myc and TFPI-2 antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—Cell lysates or conditioned media were preabsorbed with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C in a rotation wheel. This material was then incubated with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was added for 1 h in the same condition. Finally, immunoprecipitates were pelleted, rinsed 3 times with RIPA/PBS (1:3), resuspended in loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The antibodies used were monoclonal anti-ADAMTS1-clone 3E4C6B4 (9Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Westling J. Thai S.N. Luque A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Sandy J.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Tumor Xenograft Assays—293T clones were trypsinized, washed twice, and re-suspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Nu/Nu Balb/c mice were subcutaneously injected in the right back with 5 × 106 cells/200 μl. Mice weight and tumor size were assessed every 3 days after cell injection. When the tumors reached 1.5 cm2, mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were removed for further analysis. Tumor volumes were calculated by the equation D × d2 × π/6, where D is the tumor diameter at its widest, and d is at its smallest (27Matar P. Rojo F. Cassia R. Moreno-Bueno G. Di Cosimo S.

Heparin Purification—The affinity of ADAMTS1 and TFPI-2 proteins to heparin has been previously reported (19Liu Y. Stack S.M. Lakka S.S. Khan A.J. Woodley D.T. Rao J.S. Rao C.N. Arch. Biochem.

Samples were incubated with pre-equilibrated heparin beads (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C under constant agitation. Heparin beads were then washed twice with 100 mm NaCl and twice more with PBS. Finally, samples were pelleted, resuspended in loading buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell layers and tumor samples were homogenized and lysed with RIPA buffer containing 1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell debris was discarded by centrifugation (20 min at 16,000 × g), and protein suspension was quantified using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). When needed cell lysates were precipitated with 3 volumes of methanol at –20 °C overnight. The precipitate was washed twice with acetone and left to dry at room temperature. Conditioned medium was concentrated with Strata-Clean resin. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE or Tricine-SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and incubated with the antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-TFPI-2 (28Iino M. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and anti-TFPI (29Werling R.W. Zacharski L.R. Kisiel W. Bajaj S.P. Memoli V.A. Rousseau S.M. Thromb.

After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase, signal was detected with the Super-Signal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Membranes were stripped as needed. Briefly, membranes were incubated with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed extensively. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Tumor samples were disrupted and homogenized in liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and quantified in a NanoDrop ND-100 apparatus (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with 0.5 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen) followed by specific amplification of TFPI-2 with the primers 5′-GGGCCCTACTTCTCCGTTAC (forward) and 5′-CACTGGTCGTCCACACTCAC (reverse). As an internal control, actin cDNA was amplified using the primers 5′-CCTGACCGAGCGTGGC TAC (forward) and 5′-GAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACG (reverse). Identification of TFPI-2 as an Interacting Protein of ADAMTS1—A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human placenta cDNA library was performed to identify ADAMTS1 interacting proteins. Given the multidomain structure of ADAMTS1 and the high probability of false positive clones, we decided to perform the screen using discrete modular domains of the coding region. A fragment of human ADAMTS1 containing the first thrombospondin type I repeat (TSR) and part of the cysteine-rich region (encoding amino acid residues 540–666) was used as bait (Fig. 1A). Among several positive clones identified, the sequencing of the clone F2, 3.3 included an insert that corresponded to the complete 3′-end (from nucleotide 258) of the human tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 cDNA (accession number NM_006528). This sequence encoded for the entire C-terminal TFPI-2 protein (from amino acid residue 62) that included the last two Kunitz inhibitory domains (Fig. 1A). Interaction of TFPI-2 and ADAMTS1 in a Cell Culture Model—To confirm the ADAMTS1/TFPI-2 interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies in a mammalian cell-based system. 293T cells that constitutively overexpressed ADAMTS1 were transiently transfected with a TFPI-2-Myc chimera construct (scheme in Fig. 1B) or a control vector. Conditioned medium from these cells was independently subjected to immunoprecipitation with Myc and ADAMTS1 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2A). Both α and β TFPI-2 isoforms were pulled down with the Myc antibody; the γ TFPI-2 isoform, however, was not adequately resolved. In addition, p87-ADAMTS1 was observed to co-immunoprecipitate with the Myc antibody in the presence of TFPI-2, suggesting a specific interaction between these two proteins. To avoid antibody cross-reactivity, Western blot analyses were done with rabbit and guinea pig polyclonal antibodies to detect TFPI-2 and ADAMTS1 proteins, respectively. When the ADAMTS1 monoclonal antibody that recognizes all the forms of the protease was used in immunoprecipitation experiments, we observed the co-precipitation of both α and β TFPI-2 isoforms; again, the γ TFPI-2 isoform was not identified (Fig. 2A). Also, in this experiment, the antibodies used for the final detection were different from the ones used to pull down the complexes. Further validation of the interaction was achieved on 293T parental cells previously treated with phorbol esters (PMA). This stimulus is known to induce the expression of TFPI-2 (30Iochmann S. Reverdiau-Moalic P. Hube F. Bardos P. Gruel Y. Thromb. Res. 2002; 105: 217-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and here we demonstrate that it also induces ADAMTS1 expression. For these assays conditioned medium from 293T cells that were either treated or not treated with PMA for 48 h was harvested and immunoprecipitated with the ADAMTS1 monoclonal antibody. As expected, the analysis of these complexes revealed the presence of both ADAMTS1 and TFPI-2 only when the cells were stimulated with PMA (Fig. 2B). TFPI-2 Is a Substrate of ADAMTS1—TFPI-2 is a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor that targets both serine proteases and matrix metalloproteases. Thus, we first speculated that TFPI-2 could function as an endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS1. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of TFPI-2 on aggrecan and syndecan-4 proteolytic assays, because these proteoglycans are known substrates for ADAMTS1 (9Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Westling J. Thai S.N. Luque A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Sandy J.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). 3J. C. Rodriguez-Manzaneque, D. Carpizo, M. C. Plaza-Calonge, A. X. Torres-Collado, S. N.-M. Thai, M. Simons, A. Horowitz, and M. L. Iruela-Arispe, submitted for publication. However, the presence of TFPI-2 did not alter the proteolytic activity of ADAMTS1 on these substrates (data not shown). We then considered the potential effect of ADAMTS1 on TFPI-2. Cells overexpressing the inhibitor were transfected with either wild-type ADAMTS1 or the catalytically inactive form (zinc-binding site mutant E385A-ADAMTS1 (9Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Westling J.

As seen in Fig. 3A, last three lanes, the presence of ADAMTS1 resulted in increased levels of TFPI-2 in the conditioned media together with an apparent shift in the pattern of secreted isoforms. In contrast, this effect was not observed on cells transfected with the catalytically inactive ADAMTS1. To better understand this process, we used two types of arrows to indicate the different states of TFPI-2 isoforms; the black arrow indicates the primary TFPI-2 products, and the white arrow corresponds to the forms originated in the presence of ADAMTS1. Stars next to the bands also denote the new forms. We evaluated TFPI-2 levels in the presence of heparin, known to release ECM-bound and cell surface-anchored TFPI-2 (19Liu Y. Stack S.M. Lakka S.S. Khan A.J. Woodley D.T. Rao J.S. Rao C.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the overall quantities of soluble TFPI-2 were equivalent under these conditions, the mentioned changes in the pattern of TFPI-2-secreted isoforms persisted in the presence of ADAMTS1 (Fig. 3A). When the cell layer compartment was analyzed, the α-isoform of TFPI-2 was found to be predominant (Fig. 3A). A slight decrease of this form was observed in the presence of ADAMTS1, but no evidence of additional products appeared, which is indicative of the extracellular nature of this event. According to these data, we further explored the possibility that these changes in TFPI-2 are due to proteolysis by ADAMTS1. It has been previously reported that differences between TFPI-2 isoforms are due to post-translational glycosylation events (31Rao C.N. Reddy P. Liu Y. O'Toole E. Reeder D. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To facilitate our evaluation, the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin was included in this analysis. Tunicamycin treatment resulted in the appearance of two main bands of TFPI-2 (Fig. 3B); that is, the highly glycosylated α isoform that appears more abundantly in normal c"
https://openalex.org/W2065400861,"LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) is a serine protein kinase that regulates the actin cytoskeleton by phosphorylation and inactivation of actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. LIMK1 activity is regulated by the Rho-GTPases via their serine/threonine kinase effectors Rho-kinase and p21-activated kinases 1 and 4 that phosphorylate LIMK1 on threonine 508 in its activation loop. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the pathway leading to the stability of LIMK1, a protein with a half-life of approximately 20 h. Because the half-life of kinase-dead LIMK1 is only 4 h, it is suggestive that trans- or auto-phosphorylation is responsible for the stabilization of LIMK1. Using known Hsp90 inhibitors, we have shown that the half-life of LIMK1 in cells depends on the presence of active Hsp90. Furthermore, endogenous LIMK1 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Hsp90 and this interaction promoted LIMK1 homodimer formation as seen by cross-linking experiments. Hsp90 binds LIMK1 via a recognition sequence within the LIMK1 kinase domain, homologous to that of ErbB-2. Mutation of a proline residue within this sequence to glutamic acid reduces its interaction with Hsp90, inhibits homodimer formation, and reduces its half-life to 4 h. These findings implicate Hsp90 in the stabilization of LIMK1 by promoting homodimer formation and transphosphorylation."

The widespread effects of GEF domains dictate the need for tight regulation of activity, which is underscored by the observation that deregulation of RhoGEFs is associated with cellular transformation and mental retardation (1Rossman K.L.

RhoGEFs often contain several domains that are involved in their localization, association with other proteins, and regulation of GEF activity.Approximately one-third (∼22) of the human RhoGEFs contain Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (see Fig. 1). The GEFs with SH3 domains can be grouped into three classes based on the number and arrangement of the domains: Group I, with SH3 domains located N-terminally to the DH and PH domains; Group II, with SH3 domains located C-terminally; and Group III, with multiple SH3 domains. Several pieces of data support the hypothesis that the SH3 domains regulate GEF activity. For example, the cellular transforming activity of Ost is inhibited by its SH3 domain (13Lorenzi M.V. Castagnino P. Chen Q. Hori Y. Miki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4742-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the first SH3 domain of Trio is necessary for GEF-mediated effects on neurite outgrowth (14Estrach S. Schmidt S.

Biol. 2002; 12: 307-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Regulation of RhoGEFs by SH3 domains could be through an inhibitory intramolecular SH3 domain/ligand association. Most SH3 domains bind to a consensus core Pro-X-X-Pro (PXXP) sequence, with higher affinity derived from additional specificity determinants (15Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol P.

Clearly, intramolecular SH3 domain/ligand interactions play in important role in the regulation of many proteins, but this has not yet been observed in RhoGEFs.Eight of the 22 RhoGEFs containing SH3 domains (αPIX, GEF6, βPIX, Q8IVY3, Q9Y2L3, intersectin-1, Trio, and Kalirin) (Fig. 1) also contain at least one consensus PXXP SH3 domain ligand-binding sequence between their GEF and SH3 domains. GEFs with SH3 domains preceding or following the DH-PH domains may be regulated by intramolecular SH3 domain/PXXP interactions.In this study, we examined the ability of intramolecular SH3 domain/PXXP interactions to contribute to the regulation of GEF activity. We solved the solution structure of the N-terminal SH3 domain of rat Kalirin and found that it contains novel binding site(s) for intramolecular PXXP sequences. Interaction of this SH3 domain with internal PXXP motifs induces an additional intramolecular association with its neighboring GEF domain, resulting in inhibition of GEF activity. An intermolecular interaction of the PXXP motif and SH3 domain with the SH3 domain of the adaptor protein Crk robustly inhibits GEF activity. Thus, the SH3 domain of Kalirin regulates GEF activity through both intra- and intermolecular SH3 domain interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSH3 Domain Purification and Structure Determination—15N- and 15N/13C-labeled Kalirin SH3 domains were prepared by overproducing the protein in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion, purifying the GST fusion protein using glutathione-Sepharose, and recovering the purified labeled SH3 domain proteins in the supernatant after cleavage of the GST-SH3 domain linkage engineered to contain a Pre-Scission protease cleavage site. The resulting protein consists of 12 N-terminal amino acids (GPLGSPGIPGST) from the pGEX-6P vector and Leu1637-Ser1706 of the rat Kalirin (Kal) N-terminal SH3 domain (referred to as Kal-SH3). All numbering is according to Kalirin-12a (AF232669) except where indicated. Labeled SH3 domain proteins were dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and were supplemented with D2O to 7.5%. Two- and three-dimensional spectra were recorded on Varian 500- and 600-MHz spectrometers at 25 °C using pulse sequences supplied by the manufacturer. Data were processed using NMRPipe, and peaks were assigned using XEASY (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Bi-omol.

Synthesized peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and amino acid sequences were confirmed by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. The peptide sequences for PKTP, PLSP, and PLPP are shown in Fig. 3. The sequences for AKTP (PIQLAKTPAKLRNNSK) and tPKTA (PIHIPKTAPAATRQKGR) each have a single Pro-to-Ala substitution in the PKTP sequence (bold-face). Peptides were dissolved in the same buffer as the SH3 domain. Chemical shift changes were calculated using the formula Δδ = (ΔδH + 0.17ΔδN)1/2 (38Ogura K. Nagata K. Horiuchi M. Ebisui E. Hasuda T.

Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) or by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. In some cases, initial reaction rates (with buffer background rates subtracted) are reported in a bar graph (n = 3) with standard deviations. Statistical analysis was performed using a non-parametric one-way analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls algorithm to determine significant differences or Student's one-tailed t test.Activation of Rac2 in HEK-293 cells transfected with Kalirin plasmids (cotransfected with pEBB-Crk1 in some experiments) was analyzed using a GST effector protein binding assay kit (Upstate Biosystems, Lake Placid, NY) (43Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). PCR analysis of cDNA from HEK-293 cells showed the presence of Rac2, but not Rac1. For Rac activation assays, cell supernatants prepared in MLB buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.3 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors (pH 7.5)) (44Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads containing immobilized Pak (p21-activated kinase) p21 binding domain (residues 67-150; 10.0 μg), and unbound protein was removed with three washes of MLB buffer.Far-Western SH3 Domain Array Analysis—Far-Western analysis was performed using extracts prepared from HEK-293 cells transfected with pEAK10-Kal8 and an array containing 38 different GST-SH3 domain proteins (referred to as GST-SH3) spotted at two different concentrations (version 1.00; Panomics, Fremont, CA). The array membrane was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline and 5% dehydrated milk for 30 min, washed, and incubated with cell extracts (800 μl) in 6.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.3 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Arrays were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 and then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, which recognizes the Myc tag at the N terminus of transfected Kal8. A control Western blot analysis showed that anti-Myc antibody recognized only the transfected protein (data not shown).Co-immunoprecipitation—For Kal8-Crk co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for Myc-Kal8 or Myc-Kal8(PKTA) and for Crk1 or Crk1(W170K). Cell lysates (10% (w/v)) were prepared in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Triton X-100 with a mixture of protease inhibitors (44Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Lysate (200 μg) was incubated with antiserum as indicated for 2 h with shaking and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove any insoluble material. Immune complexes were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 h and washed three times with buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.GST Pulldown Assay—GST pulldown experiments were used to analyze GEF1 binding to the SH3 domain, Crk binding to different fragments of Kal7 and Kal8, and Kal5 binding to Crk1. Each GST-Kalirin chimera was purified from E. coli BL21 or Rosetta (Novagen) using glutathione-Sepharose or glutathione-agarose as described previously (42May V. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6980-6990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins included amino acids 517-976 for spectrin repeats 4-7, Lys1274-Arg1575 for GEF1, Lys1274-Met1454 for the DH1 domain, Ser1453-Arg1575 for the PH1 domain, Thr1615-Val1644 for the Kal7 C terminus (AF230644) (45Penzes P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6395-6403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Ser1453-Ser1706 for the PH-linker-SH3 domain, and Leu1637-Ser1706 for the SH3 domain. To assess GEF binding to Kal-SH3, the His/Myc-tagged Kalirin GEF1 domain (referred to as Kal-GEF1) was prepared from transfected 293 cells using His·Bind affinity resin as described by the manufacturer. GST-SH3 (5 μg) or this domain preincubated with 0.5 mm PLSP, PKTP, PLPP, or AKTP peptide was incubated with Kal-GEF1 in MLB buffer for 1 h with shaking at 4 °C. Similar experiments were performed using purified Myc-Kal5 instead of Kal-GEF1. The affinity resin was washed three times with 500 μl of cold MLB buffer. To map the Crk-binding site in Kalirin, Crk1 was prepared as described for the GST-Kalirin chimera and incubated with thrombin to release Crk1 from GST; Crk1 protein was recovered from the supernatant. Individual GST-Kalirin fusion proteins (5 μg) were incubated with purified Crk1 (100 ng) in 900 μl of TMT buffer (20 mm NaTES, 10 mm mannitol, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4)) for 2 h with shaking at 4 °C. Protein complexes isolated with glutathione-Sepharose or glutathione-agarose were washed once with 500 μl of cold TMT buffer. For each experiment, proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis, and blots were also stained with Coomassie Blue R-250.RESULTSKal-SH3 Has a Structure Similar to That of Other SH3 Domains—DH proteins containing SH3 domains are a major subgroup of RhoGEFs. We determined the structure of Kal-SH3 by NMR spectroscopy as a basis for investigating the role of SH3 domains in regulating GEF activity. 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled SH3 domains were purified (Fig. 2A, arrow) and used to solve the structure. Sequential assignments were determined from HNCACB and HN(CO)CACB experiments. Assignments of side chain carbons and protons were determined using C(CO)NH and HC(CO)NH total correlated spectroscopy and HCCH COSY experiments. Long- and short-range distance constraints were determined from 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect-HSQC and 13C-edited HSQC-nuclear Overhauser effect spectra. Torsion angle restraints (ϕ and Ψ) were determined using TALOS, and ϕ angle restraints were validated using an HNHA experiment (37Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Restraints for χ1 angles were determined from an HNHB spectrum. Hydrogen exchange experiments were unsuccessful, so hydrogen bond restraints were included only for internal β sheet residues that showed strong backbone amide proton couplings. Structure calculations were performed using CYANA and further refined using X-PLOR with experimental distance and angle constraints as described (36Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 46Brunger A.T.

The structure has backbone and side chain root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations similar to or better than those of other SH3 domain structures determined by NMR (e.g. Protein Data Bank codes 1AON, 1AEY, 1ARK, 1AWW, and 1H3H). Superposition of the backbone for an ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures is shown as a stereo image in Fig. 2C. Kal-SH3 has a fold similar to those of other SH3 domains, with three pairs of antiparallel β strands connected by RT-Src, n-Src, and distal loops and a 310 helix (Fig. 2D). Alignment of the SH3 domain protein backbone with that of the representative Sem5 C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig. 2E) shows similar tertiary folds (r.m.s. deviation of 1.8 Å). A search for proteins with similar three-dimensional structures using DALI identified several SH3 domains, with α-spectrin (Protein Data Bank code 1TUD) and melanoma-derived growth regulatory protein (code 1I1J) producing the lowest r.m.s. deviations (2.0 Å) (47Holm L.F. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3552) Google Scholar). One of the most notable differences in the Kal-SH3 structure is reorganization of the loops. A cis-Pro peptide bond in the distal loop of Kal-SH3 (Fig. 2D, red arrow) was assigned on th"

Although CD40 has been extensively studied as a plasma membrane-associated growth factor receptor, we demonstrate here that CD40 is present not only in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm but also in the nucleus of normal and neoplastic B-lymphoid cells. Confocal microscopy showed that transfected CD40-green fluorescent fusion protein entered B-cell nuclei. The CD40 protein contains a nuclear localization signal sequence that, when mutated, blocks entry of CD40 into the nucleus through the classic karyopherins (importins-α/β) pathway. Nuclear fractionation studies revealed the presence of CD40 protein in the nucleoplasm fraction of activated B cells, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CD40 binds to and stimulates the BLyS/BAFF promoter, another TNF family member (TNFSF-13B) involved in cell survival in the B cell lineage. Like other nuclear growth factor receptors, CD40 appears to be a transcriptional regulator and is likely to play a larger and more complex role than previously demonstrated in regulating essential growth and survival pathways in B-lymphocytes.

The binding of CD40 to its cognate ligand, CD154 (CD40L), is required for initiating thymus-dependent humoral responses in the immune system (7Foy T.M. Shepherd D.M. Durie F.H. Aruffo A. Ledbetter J.A. Noelle R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Like other members of the TNF receptor superfamily, CD40 optimally signals as a dimeric or trimeric aggregate from its location in plasma membrane microdomains referred to as lipid rafts (8Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H. McWhirter S.M. Everdeen D.S. Alber T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10168-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Reyes-Moreno C. Girouard J.

The CD40 molecule can also bind HSP70 and the complement-associated regulatory protein C4BP (14Becker T. Hartl F.U. Wieland F. J.

Ligation and subsequent triggering of the CD40 plasma membrane receptor leads to a variety of immune and inflammatory responses (16Cheng G. Schoenberger S.P. Curr. Dir. Autoimmun. 2002; 5: 51-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major CD40 signaling pathway emanating from CD40 ligand cognate binding is the canonical pathway to the pivotally important transcription factor family NF-κB, a family of genes primarily mediating immune and inflammatory responses (17Berberich I. Shu G.L. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4357-4366PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Yoshimura L.C. Lo P. Terry N. Reid P.S. Ford R.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 37-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The canonical signaling pathway to NF-κB involves the binding of multiple TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), an important group of intracellular adaptor molecules that bind directly or indirectly to various members of the TNF receptor superfamily (19Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) and, in the case of CD40, form a macromolecular signaling complex called a signalosome (18Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Yoshimura L.C. Lo P. Terry N. Reid P.S. Ford R.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 37-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The CD40 signalosome pathway has been shown to be important in regulating cell proliferation involving the cell cycle and in modulating normal and neoplastic B-cell survival, primarily through the activation of bcl-2 family members (e.g. bcl-xl, bfl-1, etc.). Agents that selectively block this pathway have been shown to inhibit cell growth and induce cellular apoptosis (20Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Yoshimura L.C. Lo P. Ford R.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). A mechanism for both activities appears to be the down-regulation of constitutively activated NF-κB, a molecular signature characteristic of most aggressive B-cell lymphoma cells (21Gilmore T.D. Cancer Treat. Res. 2003; 115: 241-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas CD40 has been shown to be involved in most crucial B-cell functional activities after binding its cognate ligand CD154 in the plasma membrane, the findings reported here indicate that the CD40 receptor is also present in the nucleus of both normal and neoplastic human B cells. Although nuclear localization has not been previously reported for CD40 or other TNF receptor family members, these findings are not unprecedented, since an increasing number of other plasma membrane-associated growth factor receptors (e.g. EGF receptor and fibroblast growth factor receptor) (22Lin S.Y.

Downstream cytoplasmic proteins, such as NF-κB regulatory components, the IKKs (25Verma U.N. Yamamoto Y. Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3509-3515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (components of the CD40 signalosome), and particularly IKKα have also recently been shown to enter the nucleus and to bind to specific promoter regions in conjunction with CREB-binding protein, resulting in phosphorylation of histone H3 and the promotion of transcriptional activity (26Yamamoto Y.

Our identification of the BLyS/BAFF promoter as a molecular target for nuclear CD40 suggests an important interaction between these TNF/TNF receptor family members. BLyS (B lymphocyte stimulator), also known as BAFF (B cell activation factor, TNFSF-13), is another member of the TNF ligand family of type II transmembrane proteins (28Mackay F. Ambrose C.

Flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) (BD Biosciences) showed that the cells were 95-98% CD20-positive. Normal G0 peripheral blood B cells were activated by incubation for 24 h with anti-IgM (35 μg/ml; ICN, Aurora, OH) and soluble CD40 L (1 μg/ml; PeproTech EC, Rocky Hill, NJ).

Cell homogenates were adjusted to 1.4 m sucrose, layered between 0.5 ml of STM 2.1 and 1 ml of STM 0.8, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was collected as nuclei and suspended in 6 ml of TP buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.8 mg of heparin, 110 μg of DNase I), and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. After sedimenting the mixture at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the nucleoplasm (NP) and nuclear envelopes (NE/ER) were obtained from the supernatant and pellet, respectively. The interface between 1.4 and 0.8 m sucrose layers was diluted with STM 0.25 and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min to obtain the plasma membrane pellet (PM), and cytoplasm supernatant. Calreticulin and lamin-B1 were used as an endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear marker, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation—Polyclonal CD40 antibody (C20) was cross-linked to Dynabeads protein A (Dynal Biotech, Olso, Norway) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were precleared with IgG Dynabeads-protein A for 10 min and then incubated with CD40-Dynabeads overnight at 4 °C. CD40-immunoprecipitated complexes were washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% glucopyranoside, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were eluted by boiling in loading buffer and then processed for Western blot analysis. Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed on ice for 1 h in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (0.1% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4). Cells were dehydrated by two 5-min incubations in 50, 70, 95, and 100% dimethylformamide solutions in water (dimethylformamide/H2O). Cell pellets were incubated in dimethylformamide/lowicryl (1:1) for 30 min at room temperature. Sections (8 nm) were cut and mounted on 150-mesh copper grids, incubated with either primary or preimmune antibodies for 90 min, washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and labeled for 60 min with a secondary 6-nm gold-immunolabeled anti-rabbit antibody. Sections were washed with 2% uranyl acetate followed by 4% lead citrate and visualized using a JEM-1200EXII electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA). Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy protocol were performed according to the methods of Pham et al. (18Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Yoshimura L.C. Lo P. Terry N. Reid P.S. Ford R.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 37-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cells were visualized using an Olympus Fluoview PV 500 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). Images were captured using the ×60 objective with the appropriate filter sets. [35S]Methionine Metabolic Labeling—[35S]Methionine labeling CD40 experiments were conducted as described previously (36Hakkarainen T. Hemminki A. Pereboev A.V. Barker S.D. Asiedu C.K. Strong T.V. Kanerva A. Wahlfors J. Curiel D.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 619-624PubMed Google Scholar). MS cells were washed and preincubated in methionine-free medium for 60 min and labeled with [35S]methionine (50 mCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in complete medium containing 1 mg/ml of cold methionine for 0.5 and 2.5 h. Harvested cells were subfractionated into plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleoplasm fractions. Each fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-CD40 antibody (C-20) as described previously, and 35S-labeled CD40 protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The pCDNA3-CD40 plasmid was constructed by ligating CD40, generated from a PIRAT h-CD40 cDNA (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL), into pCDNA3 at the KpnI and ApaI sites. The pEGFP-CD40 plasmid was constructed by cloning the PCR product generated using the template pIRAT h-CD40 cDNA with the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TAAAGCTTGTTCGTCTGCCTCTGCAG and 5′-GGGCCCTCACTGTCTCTCCTG into pEGFP at the HindIII and ApaI sites. The pEGFP-CD40 mutant was constructed by substituting the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) region from KKVAKK mutated to TTVATT using the pEGFP-CD40 DNA template and the oligonucleotides 5′-CAAAAAGGTGGCCACAACCCAACC-3′ and 5′-CTTTATCACAACGGTGGCCACAACG-3′ according to the protocols for the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pGL4-basic BLyS-Luc reporter plasmid was constructed as described previously (37Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The pGL4-basic BLyS- (Mutant) Luc reporter plasmid was constructed by substituting TATT with GCGG on the CD40 putative binding site by using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit as described above. All expression vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. Transfection, Luciferase, and β-Galactosidase Assay and Real Time PCR Analysis—Transient transfection of cultured LBCL cells and normal B-lymphocytes was conducted using the nucleofector protocol from Amaxa Biosystems (Cologne, Germany). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays in transfected LBCL cells were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Luciferase activity values were normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by activity cotransfected with a β-galactosidase expression vector. Each sample in an experiment was repeated at least three times. Total RNA was isolated from transfected lymphoma cells (LBCL) using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Clontech). Real-time PCR analysis of BLyS mRNA was carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing TaqMan MGB probes and primers (Assay ID HS00198106_m1) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear protein extraction and EMSA were performed according to procedures described previously (20Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Yoshimura L.C. Lo P. Ford R.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing the predicted CD40-binding site sequence (CD40 response element (CD40-RE)) in the BLyS promoter (nucleotides -555 to -576) were synthesized for EMSA. The upper strand sequences of these oligonucleotides were as follows: CD40 wild type (WT), 5′-TAAAAATATATTCACTTATAT-3′; CD40 mutant, 5′-TAAAAATAGCGGCACTTATAT-3′. Oligonucleotides were labeled with γ-32P and incubated with nuclear extract for 15 min, and the extracts were electrophoresed on 4.5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels. Corresponding unlabeled WT or mutant oligonucleotides were used for competition experiments. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Nuclei isolated from 1% formaldehyde-fixed LBCL cells were sonicated for three 10-s intervals. After centrifugation, precleared supernatant was incubated overnight with CD40 antibody and then incubated for another 2 h with protein A-conjugated magnetic dynabeads (Dynal Biotech Inc.). After the immune complexes were washed six times with washing buffer, DNA was reverse cross-linked by incubation at 65 °C overnight, and the extracted DNA was used for cloning or as a template for PCRs. The BLyS promoter region was amplified to produce a 306-bp PCR product using the primers 5′-AGGCAAGGCTGATTCTCCTC-3′ and 5′-GGAAGTGGAAGTAAGTCCACTG-3′ located at -681 and -375, respectively. The primers 5′-AGCCTGGGTCTGGAGTTCTC-3′ (scrambled sequence), and 5′-ACTGCATTGCAGTCTGCTAT-3′ (BLyS promoter upstream sequence) were used as controls. PCR was performed using 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Cloning the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation DNA Fragment— The immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were cloned into PCR-Blunt II Topo vectors as described previously (38Fu L. Lin-Lee Y.C. Pham L.V. Tamayo A. Yoshimura L. Ford R.J. Blood. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA was heated at 68 °C for 5 min and repaired in buffer containing 1 mm dNTP and T4 DNA polymerase at 37 °C for 15 min. The DNA was dephosphorylated by calf intestine phosphatase and then cloned into PCR-Blunt II Topo vectors (Invitrogen). Each clone was subjected to DNA sequencing and subsequent Blast analysis to identify the DNA sequence from the National Institutes of Health Entrez Genome Project data base. Detection of CD40 in the Nucleus of LBCL Cells—We have previously identified a novel Signalosome structure involving the binding of ectopic CD40 ligand to CD40 receptor within cell membrane lipid rafts (18Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Yoshimura L.C. Lo P. Terry N. Reid P.S. Ford R.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 37-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that constitutively activates the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway and maintains lymphoma cell survival (20Pham L.V. Tamayo A.T. Yoshimura L.C. Lo P. Ford R.J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). While performing these experiments, using the polyclonal C20 (red) or monoclonal G28.5 (green) antibodies to CD40, we consistently observed that CD40 was present not only in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, as expected, but also present in the nucleus of aggressive lymphoma (LBCL) B cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, when the immunofluorescence-stained images in Fig. 1A (top left and top right) were overlaid, a yellow image was obtained, indicating that the CD40 proteins detected from both of these well defined antibodies co-localized in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus (Fig. 1A, bottom right). To verify this finding, we analyzed the distribution of CD40 using immunohistochemical staining of various human B-cell lymphoma cells. In addition to characteristic plasma membrane staining, we also detected CD40 expression in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in a representative LBCL cell line (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate the specificity of the C20 polyclonal CD40 antibody, we transfected a recombinant full-length CD40 into a LBCL cell line and then examined CD40 protein expression by Western blotting. The CD40-transfected LBCL cell lines showed a marked increase in CD40 protein expression (Fig. 1C). The CD40 protein could be competed out by a CD40 peptide, 3Y.-C. Lin-Lee, L. V. Pham, A. T. Tamayo, L. Fu, H.-J. Zhou, L. C. Yoshimura, G. L. Decker, and R. J. Ford, unpublished data. confirming that this antibody is specific for the CD40 protein. Since the G28.5 mouse monoclonal antibody was an original antibody that was used to identify CD40 (1Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4494-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we also used G28.5 to detect CD40 protein expression in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of LBCL cells (Fig. 1C). Since the HeLa cell line does not express CD40 protein and mRNA (36Hakkarainen T. Hemminki A. Pereboev A.V. Barker S.D. Asiedu C.K. Strong T.V. Kanerva A. Wahlfors J. Curiel D.T. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 619-624PubMed Google Scholar), 4Y. C. Lin-Lee and R. J. Ford, unpublished data. this cell line was used as a negative control for CD40 detection. No detectable CD40 protein was found in either the nucleus or the cytoplasm in HeLa cells analyzed by Western blot and confocal microscopy with the C-20 polyclonal CD40 antibody (Fig. 1, A and C). The C-20 polyclonal CD40 antibody showed specific CD40 binding with the highest binding affinity of multiple CD40 antibodies tested and was therefore chosen to conduct most experiments throughout this study. To further assess the distribution of CD40 in LBCL cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were fractionated and analyzed by Western blotting. CD40 was observed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of the LBCL cell lines MS and McA (Fig. 1D). In addition, transmission electron microscopy utilizing ultrastructural immunohistochemistry revealed multiple punctate, dispersed CD40 protein accumulations in the cell nucleus after indirect staining with secondary immunogold antibodies (Fig. 1E). Western blotting of subcellular fractions from LBCL cells confirmed that CD40 protein was differentially expressed in the PM, cytoplasm (C), NE/NR, and NP fractions (Fig. 1F). Detection of CD40 Protein in the Nuclei of Normal Human B Lymphocytes—To ascertain whether nuclear accumulation of CD40 protein occurs only in neoplastic B cells, we examined the distribution of CD40 in normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from quiescent (Go) B cells and in vitro mitogen-activated B lymphocytes (anti-IgM, soluble CD154 (sCD154), or both) were analyzed by Western blotting for CD40. In quiescent B cells, CD40 proteins localized primarily in the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus. In mitogen-activated B cells, however, CD40 proteins were found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopic analysis confirmed that CD40 accumulated in the nucleus of normal B lymphocytes only upon mitogen activation (Fig. 2B). Cellular fractionation studies showed that CD40 protein levels were elevated in the PM and NE/ER fractions and clearly present in the cytoplasm (C) and NP fractions of activated B cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in quiescent Go B cells, CD40 was present predominantly in the plasma membrane, with only a minor presence in the nuclear envelope/ER but is essentially absent in NP. Distribution of Nascent the CD40 Protein in LBCL Cells—To examine the intracellular distribution and trafficking of newly synthesized CD40 protein in B-lymphoid cells, we immunoprecipitated CD40 protein from [35S]methionine metabolically labeled LBCL cells in vitro. Nascent 35S-labeled cytoplasmic CD40 protein was present very early (<0.5 h) postlabeling and remained at 0.5 h but decreased at 2.5 h after chasing with cold methionine. Plasma membrane CD40 proteins also appeared very early (<0.5 h) and gradually increased from 0.5 to 2.5 h postchase. Nuclear CD40 was detectable initially (<0.5 h) but increased to maximum at 0.5 h and remained at 2.5 h postchasing with cold methionine (Fig. 3A). Specificity control experiments showed that nuclear CD40 protein could also be competed out with a CD40 peptide (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that nascent CD40 proteins migrated intracellularly in LBCL cells from the cytoplasm/ER to the plasma membrane and subsequently to the cell nucleus within 2.5 h postchase in vitro. Identification of an NLS in CD40 Protein—To investigate CD40 protein trafficking and distribution in vivo, a CD40 cDNA was fused to the coding sequence of a GFP expression vector and transfected into LBCL cells. CD40 was then observed by confocal microscopy in both the nucleus and cytoplasm 24 h after transfection (Fig. 4A). Co-transfection of LBCL cells with CD40-GFP and the expression vectors pDsRed2-Nu (nuclear mark"
https://openalex.org/W1982450769,"Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is expressed in B-lymphocytes. Mutations in Btk cause X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans. However, the mechanism of activation and signaling of this enzyme has not been fully investigated. We have here shown that the peptidylprolyl <i>cis/trans</i> isomerase (PPIase) Pin1 is a negative regulator of Btk, controlling its expression level by reducing its half-life, whereas the catalytic activity of Btk was unaffected. The negative regulatory effect of Pin1 was observed both in cell lines and in Pin<sup>-/-</sup> mice and was found to be dependent on a functionally intact Btk. This may constitute a feedback loop for the regulation of Btk. The target region in Btk was localized to the pleckstrin homology domain suggesting that interphase phosphorylation of serine 115 (Ser-115) in Btk is required, whereas mitosis phosphorylation of serine 21 (Ser-21) is critical. Accordingly, Pin 1 was shown to associate with Btk through binding to Ser-21 and -115, respectively, both of which lie in a classical Pin1-binding pocket. Using a phosphomitotic antibody, it was found that Btk harbors a <i>bona fide</i> MPM2 epitope corresponding to a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue followed by a proline. Our results indicate that the peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1 interacts with Btk in a cell cycle-dependent manner, regulating the Btk expression level."
https://openalex.org/W2139635985,"The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the active component(s) of Ximenia americana plant material used to treat cancer in African traditional medicine. By a combination of preextraction, extraction, ion exchange and affinity chromatography, a mixture of two cytotoxic proteins was isolated. Using degenerated primers designed on the de novo sequence of two tryptic peptides from one of these proteins, a DNA fragment was amplified and the sequence obtained was used to determine the complete cDNA sequence by the RACE method. Sequence analysis and molecular modeling showed that the new protein, riproximin, belongs to the family of type II ribosome inactivating proteins. These results are in good agreement with the ability of riproximin to inhibit protein synthesis in a cell-free system, as well as with the cytotoxicity of riproximin, as demonstrated by its IC50 value of 0.5 pM in MCF7, 1.1 pM in HELA and 0.6 pM in CC531-lacZ cells. To assess the antineoplastic efficacy of the purified riproximin in vivo, the CC531-lacZ colorectal cancer rat metastasis model was used. Significant anticancer activity was found after administration of total dosages of 100 (perorally) and 10 (intraperitoneally) pmol riproximin/kg. These results suggest that riproximin has distinct potential for cancer treatment."

Site-directed mutagenesis has shown that these residues control position and S/R stereospecificity of oxygenation. Recombinant Mn-LO was expressed in Pichia pastoris, and its conserved Gly-316 residue was mutated to Ala, Ser, Val, and Thr. The G316A mutant was catalytically active. We compared the catalytic properties of Mn-LO and the G316A mutant with 17:3n-3, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, and 19:3n-3 as substrates. Increasing the fatty acid chain length from C17 to C19 shifted the oxygenation by Mn-LO from the n-6 toward the n-8 carbon. The G316A mutant increased the oxygenation at the n-8 carbon of 17:3n-3 and at the n-10 carbon of the C17 and C18 fatty acids (from 1–2% to 7–11%). The most striking effect of the G316A mutant was a 2-, 7-, and 15-fold increase in transformation of the n-6 hydroperoxides of 19:3n-3, 18:3n-3, and 17:3n-3, respectively, to keto fatty acids and epoxyalcohols. The n-3 double bond was essential. An experiment under an oxygen-18 atmosphere showed that both oxygen atoms were retained in the epoxyalcohols. (R)-Hydroperoxides at n-6 of C17:3, 18:3, and 19:3 were transformed 5 times faster than S stereoisomers. The G316A mutant converted (13R)-hydroperoxylinolenic acid to 13-ketolinolenic acid (with an apparent Km of 0.01 mm) and to epoxyalcohols (viz. erythro- and threo-11-hydroxy-(12R,13R)-epoxy-(9Z,15Z)-octadecadienoic acids and one of the corresponding cis-epoxides as major products). A reducing lipoxygenase inhibitor stimulated the hydroperoxide isomerase activity, whereas a suicide-type lipoxygenase inhibitor reduced this activity. The n-3 double bond also appeared to influence the anaerobic formation of epoxyalcohols by Mn-LO, since 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 yielded different profiles of epoxyalcohols. Our results suggest that the G316A mutant augmented the hydroperoxide isomerase activity by positioning the hydroperoxy group at the n-6 carbon of n-3 fatty acids closer to the reduced catalytic metal.

A. 2004; 101: 15579-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) observed that lipoxygenases, which form hydroperoxides with S chirality, have a conserved Ala residue (or, occasionally, a Ser residue), whereas human and mouse (12R)-LOXs and coral (8R)-LOX have a conserved Gly residue in the corresponding position (Table 1). Mutation of Ala to Gly of two (S)-lipoxygenases (human (15S)-LOX-2 and mouse (8S)-LOX) altered the chirality of oxygenation to R and also the position specificity to the other end of the (1Z,4Z)-pentadiene, whereas the Gly to Ala mutation of two (R)-lipoxygenases (human (12R)-LOX and coral (8R)-LOX) (Table 1) changed the position and chirality to S in the same fashion (38Coffa G. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15579-15584Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These results have now been extended to mutations of sLO-1 and murine (12R)-LOX (37Meruvu S. Walther M. Ivanov I. Hammarström S. Fürstenberger G. Krieg P. Reddanna P. Kuhn H. J. Biol.

The results could be explained by a model where the Gly and Ala residues change the substrate position relative to an oxygen access channel, leading to antarafacial oxygen insertion at either end of the (1Z,4Z)-pentadiene (40Knapp M.J. Seebeck F.P. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2931-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 41Coffa G. Schneider C. Brash A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This oxygen channel appears to be narrow, since Gly to Val mutations of murine and human (12R)-lipoxygenases and Ala to Val mutations of three (S)-lipoxygenases led to loss of enzymatic activity (37Meruvu S.

Whether Ala/Gly also affects the hydroperoxidase activity of eLOX3 (Table 1) has not yet been reported.TABLE 1The Coffa and Brash determinant (Ala/Gly) of S and R stereospecificity of six lipoxygenases and an alignment with Mn-LO and eLOX3PositionSequenceNameGenBank™ accession412INTLARELLIHuman (15S)-LOX-2U78294413INTLARELLVMouse (8S)-LOXAK028724538INALARQSLIsLO-1P08170437INSIGRAVLLHuman (12R)-LOXAF038461437INSIGRALLLMouse (12R)-LOXNP_033789447VNSVGIKALLCoral (8R)-LOXU59223311HPVMGVLNRLMn-LOAAK81882448VNTIARATLLeLOX3BC103508 Open table in a new tab Mn-LO differs from all iron lipoxygenases in one important aspect; Mn-LO catalyzes suprafacial oxygenation, whereas iron lipoxygenases have been repeatedly found to catalyze antarafacial oxygenation (2Hamberg M. Su C. Oliw E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13080-13088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An explanation of this phenomenon could be that the oxygen access channel to the reactive pentadiene differs between Mn-LO and other lipoxygenases. The amino acid sequence of Mn-LO can be aligned with 23–27% identity to plant and to mammalian S- and R-lipoxygenases, and the metal ligands are conserved (4Hörnsten L. Su C. Osbourn A.E. Hellman U. Oliw E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2690-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mn-LO also contains the conserved Gly-316 residue of (R)-lipoxygenases (Table 1). Mn-LO catalyzes R lipoxygenation, but the alignments do not suggest a higher degree of amino acid identity with (R)-lipoxygenases than with (S)-lipoxygenases. The preferred substrate of Mn-LO is α-linolenic acid, which is oxidized at the n-8 carbon to (11S)-HPOTrE and the n-6 carbon to (13R)-HPOTrE, and the latter accumulates as the end product (2Hamberg M. Su C. Oliw E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13080-13088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13072-13079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The oxygenation of the bis-allylic carbon and hydroperoxide migration from C-11 to C-13 constitute an unprecedented feature of this lipoxygenase. Whether chain shortening of 18:3n-3 to 17:3n-3 or chain elongation to 19:3n-3 affects the oxidations of the n-6 and n-8 carbons have not been investigated. Our first aim was to study the catalytic importance of Gly-316. We hypothesized that the different oxygenation mechanism and possible structural differences in oxygen access channels between Mn-LO and iron lipoxygenases might be revealed by mutation of Gly-316 to Ala, Val, Ser, and Thr residues, since these mutations of other (R)-lipoxygenases have been investigated (37Meruvu S.

Our second aim was to compare the oxygenation of 17:3n-3, 18:3n-3, 18:2n-6, and 19:3n-3 by Mn-LO and its mutants. We report that mutation of Gly-316 to Ala in Mn-LO changed the oxygenation of 17:3n-3 and 18:3n-3 essentially as predicted by Coffa and Brash (37Meruvu S. Walther M. Ivanov I. Hammarström S.

We found that the G316A mutation increased the hydroperoxide isomerase activity of (R)-hydroperoxides at the n-6 position of 19:3n-3, 18:3n-3, and 17:3n-3. As a mechanism, we propose that the G316A mutation shifts the position of the hydroperoxide group at the n-6 carbon closer to the reduced catalytic metal and that an n-3 double bond is essential to provide necessary structural rigidity by interaction with π -electrons (42Kuhn H. Saam J. Eibach S. Holzhutter H.G. Ivanov I. Walther M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the Gly/Ala residues at position 316 of Mn-LO control the position of the n-3 fatty acids in relation to the oxygen insertion channel and the distance of the hydroperoxide group at n-6 to the catalytic metal.

The fatty acids were dissolved in ethanol and stored in stock solutions (50–100 mm) at –20 °C. Fresh solutions (50–100 μm) of the fatty acids in 0.1 m NaBO3 buffer (pH 9.0) were prepared daily. (11S)- and (13R)-hydroperoxides of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 and (R)-hydroperoxides at n-6 of 17:3n-3 and 19:3n-3 were prepared by biosynthesis using Mn-LO as described (3Oliw E.H. Cristea M. Hamberg M.

Saponification was performed chemically (0.5 m KOH in 90% methanol; 70 °C, 1 h under argon) or biologically with rat blood plasma (allylic epoxyalcohols; 50 μg hydrolyzed with 80 μl of rat plasma, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (1:1); 90 min at 21 °C under argon). ETYA was from Hoffman-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland), BW A4C was from the Wellcome Foundation (Beckenham, UK), and nordihydroguaiaretic acid was provided by Dr. Hamberg (Karolinska Institutet).

PCR primers and HPLC-purified oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from CyberGene (Huddinge, Sweden) and TIB MolBiol (Berlin, Germany). Taq and Pfu polymerases and the QuikChange kit for site-directed mutagenesis were from Stratagene. Yeast extract, peptone from soybeans, most organic salts, and solvents (analytical grade or higher quality) were from Merck. Centrifugation filters (Amicon Ultra-15) and cartridges with octadecyl silica (SepPak/C18) were from Waters. Sequencing was performed by cycle sequencing using ABI Prism BigDye terminator from PerkinElmer Life Sciences at Uppsala Genomic Center (Rudbeck Laboratories, Uppsala University).

Chem. 1998; 273: 13072-13079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Expression and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Recombinant Mn-LO was expressed in P. pastoris and secreted into the growth medium (buffered minimal methanol) using an expression construct with the alcohol oxidase promotor (pPICZαA-Mn-LO-602) and with the native secretion signal replaced with the yeast secretion α-signal, as described (5Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of pPICZαA-Mn-LO-602 was performed with oligonucleotides of 42 nucleotides and Pfu polymerase as described (5Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The PCR mixture was treated with DpnI for 3 h, checked for amplification of the target plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis, and used to transform E. coli by electroporation. Plasmid DNA was isolated and sequenced. Pichia cells were transformed as described (5Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and recombinants were selected by Zeocin resistance (5Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from resistant colonies and screened for incorporation of the Mn-LO construct by PCR (forward, 5′-TGGATCTGACGTACACGCCCCTCGA; reverse, 5′-ATCCAGTTCTGTAGCTATAGTCG; annealing at 55 °C) with equipment as described (5Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We also confirmed by sequencing that the Pichia colonies used for expression contained the construct with the desired mutation. Enzyme Purification—Mn-LO was purified to homogeneity as described (5Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mn-LO G316A, G316S, G316V, and G316T were purified from the buffered minimal methanol medium (0.3–0.5 liters of Pichia cultures in baffled flasks). After 5–6 days of methanol induction, the A600 reached ∼15, and the cells were precipitated by centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 0.6 m, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 (10 m NaOH). After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose column (6Su C. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13072-13079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted with low salt buffer and concentrated to ∼1 ml by diafiltration. The expression of the recombinant proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE as described (5Cristea M. Engström Å. Su C. Hörnsten L. Oliw E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and identified by MALDI-TOF analyses of tryptic peptides, which were formed by in gel digestion (44Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assay—Lipoxygenase activity was monitored by UV spectroscopy (at 235 and 237 nm; 10-mm path length in cuvettes of 0.15, 0.5, or 2 ml) in 0.1 m sodium borate buffer (pH 9.0), usually with 50–100 μm fatty acid substrates and 2–15% enzyme solution (by volume). Products were analyzed after extractive isolation (SepPak/C18 or CH2Cl2) and in some experiments reduced with NaBH4, NaB2H4, or 1–10 μg of TPP (from 10 mg TPP/ml cyclohexane) before analysis. The transformation of 17:3n-3 and 19:3n-3 were compared with 18:3n-3 using the same concentrations of the substrates and the same amount of enzymes (Mn-LO and the G316A mutant as judged from their lipoxygenase activities with 18:3n-3 as a substrate). The hydroperoxide isomerase activity was monitored by following the conversion of (13R)-HPOTrE (1–100 μm) to 13-KOTrE by UV analysis at 280 nm in duplicate or triplicate, and the rate was determined from the linear part. Apparent Km was estimated by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Conversion of (S)- and (R)-hydroperoxides to keto compounds was assayed by UV spectroscopy (280 nm). Hydroperoxide isomerase activity was also monitored by the decline in UV absorbance at 237 nm. The lipoxygenase inhibitors were dissolved in ethanol and preincubated for 5 min with the enzyme before the reaction started by the addition of substrate. Oxygen-18 Experiment—The atmosphere over Mn-LO G316A (0.04 mg) in 6 ml of 0.1 m NaBO3 buffer was repeatedly evacuated with an oil pump and flushed with nitrogen. Oxygen-18 (100 ml) was introduced from a sealed ampule under reduced pressure. 18:3n-6 was added to 100 μm (in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m NaBO3 saturated with N2), and the reaction was terminated after 60 min with 2 ml of ethanol, diluted with 12 ml of water, and immediately extracted (SepPak/C18). Anaerobic Incubation—First, (13R)-HPODE and (13R)-HPOTrE were generated in situ. Recombinant Mn-LO (50 μg) in 5 ml of 0.1 m NaBO3 buffer, pH 9.0, was incubated under normal atmosphere with 100 μm 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 until complete conversion of substrate had occurred (UV analysis). The vessel was then sealed, and the atmosphere was repeatedly evacuated with an oil pump and flushed with argon. Under anaerobic conditions, we added 50 μg of Mn-LO (in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaBO3 buffer, pH 9.0) and 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 to a final concentration of 100 μm. The reaction proceeded for 1.5 h (21 °C). It was terminated by the addition of methanol and followed by extractive isolation (14Chang M.S. Boeglin W.E. Guengerich F.P. Brash A.R.

We describe here the identification and characterization of DdPDE4, the third class I enzyme of Dictyostelium. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts that DdPDE4 has a leader sequence, two transmembrane segments, and an extracellular catalytic domain that exhibits a high degree of homology with human cAMP-specific PDE8. Expression of the catalytic domain of DdPDE4 shows that the enzyme is a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase with a Km of 10 μm; cGMP is hydrolyzed at least 100-fold more slowly. The full-length protein is shown to be membrane-bound with catalytic activity exposed to the extracellular medium. Northern blots and activity measurements reveal that expression of DdPDE4 is low during single cell stages and increases at 9 h of starvation, corresponding with mound stage. A function during multicellular development is confirmed by the phenotype of ddpde4– knock-out strains, showing normal aggregation but impaired development from the mound stage on.

During different developmental stages of Dictyostelium discoideum the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP play a central role in diverse signal transduction processes. cAMP mediates chemotaxis during cell aggregation and controls gene expression during development. cGMP regulates cytoskeletal organization affecting shape, stability, and motility of single cells. The intracellular concentration of the second messengers cAMP and cGMP is determined by the combined action of production and removal. Production directly depends on the enzymatic activity of the adenylyl cyclases and guanylyl cyclases to form cAMP and cGMP, respectively. Removal of intracellular cAMP or cGMP depends on the activity of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) 3The abbreviations used are: PDE, phosphodiesterase; DTT, dithiothreitol; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine. that hydrolyze cAMP to form 5′-AMP and cGMP to form 5′-GMP and on the ability of D. discoideum cells to secrete cAMP. This extrusion mechanism is pivotal in the formation of extracellular cAMP waves that mediate chemotaxis during aggregation, mound formation, and slug movement. In D. discoideum three different adenylyl cyclases and two guanylyl cyclases have been identified (see Refs. 1.Saran S. Meima M.E. Alvarez-Curto E. Weening K.E. Rozen D.E. Schaap P. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and 2.Roelofs J. Van Haastert P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9167-9174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, five different phosphodiesterases have been reported and characterized in D. discoideum. These PDEs belong to two classes that exhibit distinct differences in the amino acid sequence of the putative catalytic domains, namely class I, which is ubiquitous in eukaryotes, and class II, which predominantly occurs in lower eukaryotes. PdsA (or DdPDE1) is a class II dual specificity PDE that degrades cAMP as well as cGMP and is exposed on the cell surface or secreted in the medium. It is the main PDE that degrades extracellular cAMP and thereby essential for shaping cAMP waves (3.Barra J. Barrand P. Blondelet M.H. Brachet P. Mol. Gen.

RegA (or DdPDE2) encodes a cAMP-specific class I PDE localized in the cytosol of the cell where it degrades intracellular cAMP. The knock-out cell strain regA– develops very small aggregates and shows defects in spore formation. Additionally RegA has been implicated in suppression of pseudopodium formation (14.Kim H.J.

DdPDE3 is a cGMP-specific class I PDE that consists of a catalytic domain without regulatory domains and is constitutively active. The pde3– null cell strain shows a moderate phenotype with increased basal levels of cGMP, revealing that the enzyme accounts for about 20% of total cGMP-PDE activity in unstimulated cells (23.Kuwayama H. Snippe H. Derks M. Roelofs J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DdPDE5 (also named GbpA or PDED) is characterized as a cGMP-stimulated cGMP-specific class II PDE. The pde5– cell strain exhibits a phenotype with strongly elevated levels of cGMP implying that it is the main intracellular cGMP PDE accounting for about 75% of the cGMP PDE activity. The biochemical phenotype of this pde5– null cell is similar to what is observed in the mutant NP368, a Streamer F cell strain (24.Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Snippe H. Bader S. Wind J. Van Haastert P.J.

Finally, DdPDE6 (GbpB or PDEE) is a dual specificity class II PDE that degrades intracellular cAMP and cGMP and accounts for only 5% of the total cGMP PDE activity (24.Bosgraaf L. Russcher H.

In searches of the then ongoing Dictyostelium genome sequencing project we identified a putative PDE that was named DdPDE4 for its order of initial recognition. DdPDE4 appears to be a class I phosphodiesterase with unusual properties. DdPDE4 is a transmembrane phosphodiesterase with its catalytic domain exposed to the extracellular medium. It degrades extracellular cAMP together with the class II enzyme DdPDE1. Cells lacking DdPDE4 are defective in development at the mound stage, which is also the stage of maximal expression of ddpde4. Identification and Reconstruction of the ddpde4 Gene—The Dictyostelium genome data base was screened for sequences potentially encoding type I phosphodiesterases. At the initial phase of the sequencing project we identified clone JAX4b25f06. The encoding DNA fragment was obtained by PCR with primer 99B245 (CATGCGAATTCGGGAAACTATTAGCCATTG) and primer 99B301 (CATGCGAATTCCGGTACCCGCAACTGATG) on genomic DNA. With this fragment as a probe a cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. R. H. Gomer) was screened. Clone pdek9 had the largest insert of 2150 base pairs but lacked the start of the open reading frame. The Dictyostelium data bases were searched with the pdek9 insert revealing that 400 base pairs of coding sequence were missing. The first 100 base pairs were obtained by PCR with primers 00B369 (ATCATGGATCCAAAATGATTATATATTATTTTTTAAT) and 00B368 (CTTAGGTCTGGTATACCAC) and the subsequent 300 base pairs with primers 00B367 (GTGGTATACCAGACCTAAG) and 00B345 (CGATTGGTGTATCAAGATC). These two fragments were combined using primers 00B369 and 00B345 to create the 400-base pair fragment. This way a BglII site was removed without destroying the amino acid sequence; this action was convenient for further cloning. Together with the pdek9 insert these 400 base pairs comprise the complete ddpde4 gene. The sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AY211984) and is confirmed by the now completed Dictyostelium genome (GenBank™ accession number DDB083560). Cluster Analysis—Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using the CLUSTAL W program (29.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55986) Google Scholar), followed by manual optimization. Distance matrices were constructed from the alignments with the PROTDIST program of the PHYLIP package, which uses the Dayhoff PAM 001 matrix for the calculation of evolutionary distances (Phylip 3.5, J. Felsenstein, 1993 (30.Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Phylogenetic trees were generated by using the FITCH program of the PHYLIP package, with 1000 bootstrap replications to assess the reliability of the nodes. Construction of the Overexpressor—A genomic DNA fragment of 1450 base pairs comprising the catalytic domain of DdPDE4 was amplified by PCR using the primers PDE4catF (ATCATGGATCCAAAATGCCAGAGATAACAGATCAAGG) and PDE4catR (CATCTAGAAACAACAATTAAATAATTTGATTG). Subsequently the BamHI-XbaI fragment was cloned into the BglII-SpeI site of the vector MB74-GFP (31.Veltman D.M. Roelofs J. Engel R. Visser A.J. Van Haastert P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 976-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the plasmid MB74-PDE4cat-GFP. Finally AX2 Dictyostelium cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid yielding many cells overexpressing amino acids 264–771 of DdPDE4 comprising the catalytic domain. We will refer to this overexpressor as DdPDE4catOE. To express the full-length protein, a DNA fragment was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using the primers PDE4F (GAGGATCCATGATTATATATTATTTTTTAAT) and PDE4catR. The BamHI-XbaI fragment was cloned in the BglII-SpeI site of the vector MB74-GFP (31.Veltman D.M. Roelofs J. Engel R. Visser A.J. Van Haastert P.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 976-983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the plasmid MB74-PDE4-GFP. DH1 Dictyostelium cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid yielding cells overexpressing the full-length PDE4 protein. We will refer to this overexpressor as DdPDE4OE. Culture and Incubation Conditions—AX2, AX3, knockout and overexpressor Dictyostelium strains were grown on HG5 medium (14.3 g/liter oxoid peptone, 7.15 g/liter yeast extract, 1.36 g/liter Na2HPO4·12H2O, 0.49 g/liter KH2PO4, 10.0 g/liter glucose) either on a 9-cm dish or in shaking culture at 22 °C. After transformation the knock-out and overexpressor cell lines were selected and grown on HG5 medium supplemented with blasticidine (10 μg/ml). Phosphodiesterase Assays—Dictyostelium cells were washed with PDE lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA) and resuspended at a density of 108 cells/ml in PDE lysis buffer supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose. The cells were lysed at 4 °C by passage through a 0.45-μm Nucleopore filter. The lysate was centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was used; the pellet was washed once with lysis buffer, resuspended in the original volume of lysis buffer, and used in the assays. PDE activity at the surface of intact cells was assayed using freshly washed cells resuspended in lysis buffer. The PDE assay mixture (final concentrations) contained PDE assay buffer (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm MnCl2), 10 nm [3H]cAMP, or 10 nm [3H]cGMP as substrate, unlabeled cAMP or cGMP as indicated, and 30 μl of lysate in a total volume of 100 μl. The assay mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and the reaction was terminated by boiling for 1 min. The product was dephosphorylated by calf intestine phosphatase (Roche Applied Science, 1 unit of enzyme in 50 μl of CIP buffer incubated for 1 h at 37 °C). Finally, 150 μl of Dowex AG1X2 was added to remove the remaining substrate. After 10 min of incubation under regular mixing, samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g, and the radioactivity in 200 μl of the supernatant was determined. Construction of Knock-outs—pdek9 was cloned into pBluescript SK+ with BamHI and XhoI. The Bsr gene (32.Sutoh K. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) was cloned into the HindIII site. The knock-out fragment was amplified by PCR using primer 00B254 (ATCATGGATCCAAAATGCCAGAGATAACAGATCAGG) and primer 00B260 (CACTTGTGACTCTATTTGACC). The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit by Qiagen (Westburg), and 20 μg was electroporated into Dictyostelium cells. Two knockout cell strains were obtained that showed the altered fragments of the ddpde4 gene with expected size on Southern blots. Aggregation Tests—Dictyostelium cells were grown on a 9-cm dish with HG-5 medium to an amount of 2 × 107 cells. Cells were collected, washed two times in PB (10 mm KH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.5) and suspended in 100 μl of PB. Subsequently cells were placed on non-nutrient agar plates (15.0 g/liter agar in PB). After 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 27 h of starvation, pictures were taken with an Olympus DP10 camera. DNA Sequence and Protein Topology—The Dictyostelium DNA data base was searched for sequences similar to two stretches of amino acids that are conserved in the catalytic domains of mammalian phosphodiesterases (23.Kuwayama H. Snippe H. Derks M. Roelofs J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences are HDyDHpGTtNqFIVntKSeLAlLYndESVMEnHH and DLSnpTKplplyRrwAELImeEFFxQGDkEKeMG. Capital letters represent amino acids that are identical in (almost) all phosphodiesterases, and lowercase letters represent amino acids that are conserved in the major part of the mammalian phosphodiesterases. With this method we identified a sequenced clone JAX4b25f06. The 665-base pair insert coded for part of a putative phosphodiesterase catalytic domain. This sequence was used to screen a cDNA library and to search further in the Dictyostelium genomic data base. Eventually we identified and assembled by reverse transcription-PCR the entire open reading frame of 2.6 kb (for detailed information, see “Experimental Procedures”). The start ATG is preceded by a long AT stretch. The ddpde4 gene has one intron of 100 base pairs at base pair position 603. The deduced amino acid sequence is 771 amino acids long and predicts a protein of 85 kDa (Fig. 1). As will be shown below, DdPDE4 encodes for a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase. According to the SMART topology program and TMpred, DdPDE4 is predicted to contain a signal sequence (amino acids 1–29), two transmembrane regions (amino acids 42–62 and 88–108), and the phosphodiesterase catalytic domain (309–688; Fig. 1A). Topology prediction programs strongly suggest that the signal sequence is cleaved and that the new N terminus is located at the outside of the cell. The short extracellular segment is followed by the two membrane-spanning segments with a short intracellular loop. Consequently, the catalytic domain of DdPDE4 is strongly predicted to be localized in the extracellular space (Fig. 1B), as will be demonstrated experimentally below. In addition to these topology-determining segments, DdPDE4 has a coiled coil region (117–145) and a region in front of the catalytic domain (146–255) that is homologous to a region found in mammalian HsPDE8. Amino Acid Sequence and Cluster Analysis of the Catalytic Domain—Eleven subfamilies of mammalian phosphodiesterases have been identified. Each subfamily has a variety of phosphodiesterase genes (A, B, C, etc.) that often display different splice variants. The sequence identity of the catalytic domains within members of a subfamily is ∼90%, whereas the sequence identity between subfamilies is 45%. We have used one member of each subfamily in the sequence analysis of DdPDE4. Fig. 2 shows an alignment of the catalytic domain of DdPDE4 with Dictyostelium RegA (or DdPDE2) (19.Shaulsky G.

Of the 40 amino acids that are identical or conserved in all the other depicted phosphodiesterases, DdPDE4 has 38 amino acids that are identical or conserved. The exceptions are substitutions of a tyrosine for a histidine at position 412 of the DdPDE4 amino acid sequence and a leucine for a tryptophan at position 679 (⇓ in Fig. 2). The two metal binding sites depicted in Fig. 2 are also conserved in DdPDE4 (* and + in Fig. 2). We identified previously two amino acids, an aspartic acid and an arginine, that are conserved in all cAMP-specific PDEs but not in cGMP-specific enzymes or enzymes with dual specificity (23.Kuwayama H. Snippe H. Derks M. Roelofs J. Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DdPDE4 contains this aspartic acid and arginine (bracket symbol in Fig. 2), suggesting that DdPDE4 belongs to the group of cAMP-specific enzymes, which is confirmed below in biochemical experiments. The DdPDE4 amino acid sequence directly N-terminal to the catalytic domain (named the precatalytic region; amino acids 146–255, Fig. 1A) shows homology to an amino acid sequence preceding the catalytic domain of PDE8 isoforms found in vertebrates (Fig. 3). Members of this PDE subfamily with a precatalytic region were also found in the insects Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera, and the worm Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 3). In vertebrate and insect PDE8 this precatalytic region is preceded by a PAS domain (43.Soderling S.H. Bayuga S.J. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) that is not present in worms and Dictyostelium DdPDE4. To further explore the relationship of DdPDE4 with other class I enzymes, we performed a cluster analysis of the catalytic domains as defined in Fig. 2 of DdPDE4, one member of each of the 11 subfamilies of mammalian enzymes and the three PDE8 isoforms of insects and worms. Two groups of phosphodiesterases can be distinguished based on the bootstrap values (Fig. 4), similar to what has been reported previously (47.Yuasa K. Kanoh Y. Okumura K. Omori K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One group harbors PDEs that are cGMP-specific or have a cAMP/cGMP dual specificity (HsPDE2A, HsPDE5A, BtPDE6A, HsPDE10A, and HsPDE11). The second group consists of cAMP-specific and dual specificity enzymes (HsPDE1A, HsPDE3A, HsPDE4A, HsPDE7A, HsPDE8A, and HsPDE1A). DdPDE4 belongs to this second group. The catalytic domains of PDEs from insects and worms are clearly PDE8 isoforms. Dictyostelium DdPDE4 is placed relatively close to this PDE8 subfamily. However, bootstrap values show that the node of DdPDE4 is not very reliable. The other Dictyostelium phosphodiesterases (DdPDE2 and DdPDE3) and HsPDE9A do not fall into one of these groups. Catalytic Activity and Localization of DdPDE4—The DdPDE4 catalytic domain (amino acids 264–771) was expressed in vegetative AX2 cells. We measured PDE activity in the cytosolic fraction of a cell lysate of these DdPDE4catOE cells and used PDE activity in lysates from the wild type AX2 cell strain as a control. The results in Fig. 5A show that the overexpressor DdPDE4catOE provides a 3-fold increase of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity compared with the control. There was no difference in cGMP PDE activity between DdPDE4catOE and the control, suggesting that DdPDE4 may be cAMP-specific. The increased cAMP hydrolysis of DdPDE4catOE cells compared with AX2 cells was observed only in the soluble fraction and not in the particulate fraction of a cell lysate (data not shown). Subsequently, the hydrolysis of [3H]cAMP in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled cAMP or cGMP was measured for both cell lines. We calculated the hydrolysis of [3H]cAMP in lysates form DdPDE4catOE cells after subtracting [3H]cAMP hydrolysis in lysates from AX2 cells, providing direct characterization of DdPDE4. The results in Fig. 5B show half-maximal inhibition of [3H]cAMP hydrolysis at 3–10 μm cAMP, whereas no inhibition was observed at 100 μm cGMP, indicating that DdPDE4 is at least 100-fold more specific for cAMP than for cGMP. The kinetic data for DdPDE4 were obtained from an Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig. 5C); linear regression analysis yields a slope of Km = 9.6 μm cAMP and an intercept at Vmax = 4200 pmol/min/mg. The absence of detectable cGMP hydrolysis above control levels suggests that the Km for cGMP is above 1 mm and that the Vmax below 100 pmol/min/mg. DdPDE4 activity can be inhibited by the general class I inhibitor IBMX, but rather high concentrations are requires (half-maximal inhibition at 300 mm IBMX; data not shown). DdPDE4 has a putative signal sequence and two transmembrane segments, predicting it to be a plasma membrane protein with the catalytic domain exposed to the outside of the cell. The topology of DdPDE4 was investigated by overexpressing the full-length protein in wild type cells, yielding strain DdPDE4OE. To determine the location of the catalytic domain of DdPDE4 at the outside or inside of the plasma membrane, we measured [3H]cAMP hydrolysis using intact cells and the particulate fraction of a cell lysate (Fig. 6). Wild-type cells contain on their surface the very active DdPDE1 (3000 fmol/min/107 cells) whose activity can be inhibited strongly with dithiothreitol (DTT) (48.Green A.A. Newell P.C. Cell. 1975; 6: 129-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Wild type cells possess a small residual activity in the presence of 5 mm DTT (29 fmol/min/107 cells). DdPDE4OE cells contain approximately the same amount of total PDE activity compared with control cells (2900 fmol/min/107 cells) but about 4-fold higher DTT-resistant [3H]cAMP hydrolysis activity than control cells. When the activity was measured with [3H]cGMP as substrate, very little activity was observed in control cells with DTT (18.1 ± 1.8 fmol/min/107 cells), which was not elevated in DdPDE4OE cells (17.7 ± 1.1 fmol/min/107 cells). This result confirms the cAMP-specificity of DdPDE4 and also indicates that cells are not leaky for the very active cytosolic cGMP-specific enzymes. Membranes isolated from wild type cells contain slightly less [3H]cAMP hydrolysis activity than intact cells, suggesting that little or no phosphodiesterase activity is exposed to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Similarly, PDE activity in membranes isolated from DdPDE4OE cells is slightly less than the PDE activity of intact DdPDE4OE cells. The results strongly suggest that the catalytic domain of DdPDE4 is exposed to the extracellular medium, confirming the topology programs predicting a signal sequence, two transmembrane regions, and extracellular N and C termini. Programs predict the cleavage of the signal sequence, for which we have no experimental evidence. Expression of mRNA—To investigate the expression level of ddpde4 at different time intervals during development, we isolated mRNA at 0–21 h after starvation on non-nutrient agar. A Northern blot was made with the isolated mRNAs, and it was probed with part of the catalytic domain of ddpde4 (see M&M). Fig. 7A shows a mRNA with an approximate size of 3 kb that is present in the wild type Dictyostelium strain AX3 predominantly at 9 h of starvation, during the mound stage. Expression is very low during growth and cell aggregation (up to 6 h), maximal during the mound stage, but ddpde4 remains expressed at significant levels during the other stages of multicellular development. To assay for DdPDE4 activity at different stages of development, we made use of the localizat"
https://openalex.org/W2018945542,"We used a yeast two-hybrid screening approach to identify novel interactors of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) that may offer insight into its mechanism of action and regulation. One clone obtained was that for CA150, a nuclear protein previously characterized as a transcriptional elongation factor. In this report, we show that CA150 is a widely expressed co-repressor of C/EBP proteins. Two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that CA150 interacts with C/EBPα. Overexpression of CA150 inhibited the transactivation produced by C/EBPα and was also able to reverse the enhancing effect of the co-activator p300 on C/EBPβ-mediated transactivation. Analysis of C/EBPα mutants indicated that CA150 interacts with C/EBPα primarily through a domain spanning amino acids 135–150. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that CA150 was present on a promoter that is repressed by C/EBPα but not present on a promoter that is activated by C/EBPα. Finally, we showed that in cells in which growth arrest had been induced by ectopic expression of C/EBPα, CA150 was able to release them from growth arrest. Interestingly, CA150 could not reverse the growth arrest produced by the minimal growth-arrest domain of C/EBPα (amino acids 175–217), suggesting that the effect of CA150 was directed at a region of C/EBPα outside of this minimal domain, consistent with our two-hybrid analysis. Taken together, these data indicate that CA150 is a co-repressor of C/EBP proteins and provides a possible mechanism for how C/EBPα can repress transcription of specific genes.

CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) 2The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; HNF6, hepatic nuclear factor 6; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase. are eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate a large number of genes. There are eight members in the C/EBP protein family, and the first two members that were identified, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, are the most extensively examined and characterized (1Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Although they are expressed in a variety of cell types, both family members are enriched in liver and have been demonstrated to regulate the expression of a number of genes that are associated with energy metabolism (2Roesler W.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). C/EBPα and -β have been generally observed to be activators of transcription. The transactivation domains of these proteins reside in the N terminus of each protein, and can function independently of the basic region-leucine zipper DNA-binding domain if linked to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (1Lekstrom-Himes J. Xanthopoulos K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28545-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). There appear to be several sub-domains within the transactivation domains that mediate transactivation (3Nerlov C. Ziff E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Nerlov C. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15130-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although the precise boundaries of these regions are difficult to determine from the available studies because they are assigned based on the arbitrary design of the mutants used. For C/EBPα, studies indicate that the majority of the transactivation potential lies within amino acid residues 1–150 (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas for C/EBPβ, the transactivation domain appears to lie within amino acid residues 1–108 (9Park E.A. Song S. Vinson C. Roesler W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 211-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to its transcriptional role, C/EBPα is also a strong inhibitor of cell proliferation. It inhibits proliferation of cultured cells when overexpressed, and it inhibits proliferation in newborn liver (10Timchenko N.A. Harris T.E. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7353-7361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in liver of adult animals (11Tan E.H. Hooi S.C. Laban M. Wong E. Ponniah S. Wee A. Wang N.-d. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10330-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). C/EBPα exerts its growth-arrest activity by several different mechanisms, depending on the tissue. In liver, C/EBPα binds Cdk 2 and prevents its interaction with cyclins (12Wang H. Iakova P. Wilde M. Welm A. Goode T. Roesler W.J. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In adipose, C/EBPα represses E2F-dependent transcription of several genes, including S phase and mitosis-specific genes (13Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Precisely how the transactivation domains of C/EBPs confer their effects onto the preinitiation complex is poorly understood. For C/EBPα, part of the basis for the constitutive activity of this domain may be explained by its ability to physically interact with the TATA-binding protein and with TFIIB (3Nerlov C. Ziff E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, the transactivation potential of this C/EBP isoform can be enhanced by CBP/p300 and Retinoblastoma protein (14Erickson R.L. Hemati N. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16348-16355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chen P. Riley D. Chen Y. Lee W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ, upon binding to a promoter, can recruit CBP/p300, which leads to enhanced transactivation (15Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Oelgeschlager M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Luscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, both C/EBPα and -β can recruit SWI/SNF, a chromatin remodeling complex, to gene promoters (18Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). C/EBPα specifically has been shown to enhance histone H3 acetylation by recruiting a co-regulator containing histone acetylase activity (19Zhang W.-H. Srihari R. Day R.N. Schaufele F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40373-40376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the evidence to date suggests that there are several mechanisms for C/EBP-dependent transactivation of gene promoters. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of a novel co-repressor for C/EBPs that was uncovered during a yeast two-hybrid screen. Not only is CA150 a transcriptional co-repressor, but it also inhibits the growth-arrest activity of C/EBPα. Materials—DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and Promega (Nepean, Ontario, Canada). Acetyl-[3H]CoA (10 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tissue culture supplies were from Invitrogen. HepG2 cells were acquired from American Type Culture Collection. Yeast media were from Difco (Detroit, MI), whereas the amino acids and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole were from Sigma-Aldrich. Biotinylated oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—A human liver cDNA MATCHMAKER library, containing 3 × 106 independent clones, and screening kit were purchased from Clontech-BD Biosciences. The transactivation domain of C/EBPα with three residues mutated (Y67A, F77A, and L78A) (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was cloned in-frame into the bait vector pGBT9, which resulted in the expression of a GAL4-C/EBPα bait protein. Approximately 12 × 106 clones were screened in yeast strain CG-1945 as per the supplier's instructions and were doubly selected based on their ability to grow in the absence of histidine/presence of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (through activation of the His3 reporter gene) and intensity of blue colony formation (through activation of the lacZ reporter gene). Selected clones were verified for the requirement for both bait and prey plasmids for reporter gene activation. The plasmids containing the prey cDNAs were isolated and the insert sequenced. Quantitative β-Galactosidase Assay—A quantitative β-galactosidase assay was performed as described in the manual provided with the Clontech MATCHMAKER kit, which can be used as an indirect assessment of the strength of interaction (20Felinski E.A. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11672-11678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast were transformed with either bait plasmid, prey plasmid, or both, and plated out onto the appropriate media. Pooled or individual colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of appropriate liquid media, and cultured overnight at 30 °C with shaking. 2 ml of this overnight culture were then used to inoculate 8 ml of YPD liquid media (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% dextrose), and further shaken at 30 °C for 4 h. Aliquots were removed, and cell extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Units are expressed in terms of the ΔA420 per minute per equivalent number of yeast cells. The data shown were obtained from screening of 6–10 colonies from at least two independent transformations. The C/EBPα bait protein used in this assay was the same as that used in the two-hybrid library screen described above. The various GAL4-C/EBPα mutants used to identify the interaction domain have been reported previously (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All of the deletion mutants that contained amino acid residues 67, 77, and 78 had these three residues mutated to alanines to reduce the background activity of the bait proteins, as described above. The C/EBPβ bait protein consisted of the transactivation domain of C/EBPβ (amino acids 1–108) linked to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, whereas the CREB bait contained the transactivation domain (amino acids 3–203) linked to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. The CA150 prey protein consisted of amino acid residues 89–480 of CA150 (representing the region contained in the clone pulled out in the yeast two-hybrid screen) fused to the GAL4 transactivation domain. mutCA150 contained amino acid residues 643–1098 of CA150, linked to the GAL4 transactivation domain. Mammalian Reporter Gene Experiments—Transfections were performed in HepG2 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (21Roesler W. Simard J. Graham J. McFie P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14276-15890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RSV-βgal was included in all transfections as a control for transfection efficiency.

(The GAL4-C/EBPα mutant N150 was previously termed N135; however, resequencing of this mutant indicated that its coding region contained residues 6–150.) Assays for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (CAT), β-galactosidase activity, and protein determination were performed as previously described (22Roesler W. McFie P. Puttick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3791-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Co-immunoprecipitation of C/EBPα and CA150 was performed using mouse liver nuclear extract prepared as described previously (28Wang G.-L. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1325-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 400 μg of nuclear extract was precleared with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °Cina total volume of 400 μl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The pre-cleared extract was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the specific antibody that had been pre-attached to Protein G-agarose beads. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with 1 ml of co-immunoprecipitation buffer. The pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (29Davies G. Khandelwal R. Roesler W. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), using Western Lightning™ chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to detect the antigen-antibody complexes. Anti-C/EBPα (14AA) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-CREB antibody (9192) was purchased from Cell Signaling, and anti-CA150 antibodies (BL456) were purchased from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from several mouse tissues as described previously (30Wang G.-L. Iakova P. Wilde M. Awad S. Timchenko N.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were homogenized in 5 volumes of buffer with a Dounce homogenizer, and the crude nuclear pellet was isolated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer containing a final concentration of 400 mm NaCl and placed on ice for 15 min. This mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant contained the soluble nuclear protein fraction. Growth Arrest Assay—Growth-arrest assays were performed in COS7 and HEK293 cells as previously described (30Wang G.-L. Iakova P. Wilde M. Awad S. Timchenko N.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with pAdTrack-C/EBPα, which expresses both green fluorescent protein and C/EBPα from distinct mRNAs. As indicated in the figure and corresponding legend, other experiments involved co-transfection with full-length CA150 or mutCA150, both expressed as hemagglutinin-tagged proteins using a vector described by King et al. (31King T.R. Fang Y. Mahon E.S. Anderson D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36450-36456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After 3 days, the number of green cells per colony (1, 2, or >2) as a percent of total green cells was assessed. Preliminary co-transfection experiments were performed to determine an optimal ratio of C/EBPα and CA150 under which the inhibitory effect of CA150 is maximal. The data shown were obtained by using a 1:4 ratio of C/EBPα to CA150 expression plasmids. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed with mouse liver tissues using the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif). Briefly, the chromatin solutions were sheared by enzymatic digestion according to the instruction manual. The size of DNA fragments produced averaged between 500 and 1000 bp in length. Antibodies against C/EBPα (14AA), CA150 (N19), and cdk2 (all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to each aliquot of precleared chromatin and incubated overnight. Protein G-agarose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After reversing the cross-links, DNA was isolated and used for PCR reactions with primers specific for PEPCK and HNF6 promoter regions that contain the C/EBPα binding sites (–204/–3 and –175/+140, respectively). The sequences of the primers for these promoters are as follows. PEPCK-C/EBP-F: 5′-GGCCTCCCAACATTCATTAAC-3′; PEPCK-C/EBP-R: 5′-GTAGCCCGCCCTCCTTGCTTTAA-3′. HNF6-C/EBP-F: 5′-GCTCGAGCTGGCGGGCGGCACAGGC-3′, HNF6-C/EBP-R: 5′-AGGAGTCCAGTCTTCACATCGGCTG-3′. As a control for the appropriate shearing of DNA, primers were designed for a region ∼3.4 kb upstream of the C/EBP site in the PEPCK promoter (–3429/–3081) and ∼1.5 kb upstream in the HNF6 promoter (–1579/–1210). The sequences of these primers are as shown below. PEPCK-Control-F: 5′-AACCAACTGGCCCTAACTCACAGA-3′, PEPCK-Control-R: 5′-GCTGCAGTCCAGCTAATGCAACAA-3′. HNF-Control-F: 5′-AGGCAGGCACTTGGGTTAAGAGAT-3′, HNF-Control-R: 5′-AGAGCCTTGTCTGCTTAGGTGCTT-3′. PCR mixtures were amplified for 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min, annealing temperature for primers (62 °C) for 5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. Then PCR mixtures were amplified for 34 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, annealing temperature for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis or by 4% PAGE. To search for co-regulators of C/EBPα, we employed a yeast two-hybrid approach to screen a human liver cDNA library. The “bait” used to screen the library was a fusion protein consisting of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a mutated transactivation domain of C/EBPα. This transactivation domain contained amino acids 6–217 of C/EBPα, with three amino acids (Tyr-67, Phe-77, and Leu-78) mutated to alanines. The three point mutations have been shown previously to abrogate the constitutive activity of the transactivation domain (3Nerlov C. Ziff E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), yet not significantly alter the integrity of the domain based on the observation that the protein kinase A-inducible activity of this mutant remains functional (5Roesler W.J. Park E.A. McFie P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14950-14957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The use of this mutant as the bait was necessary, because the wild-type C/EBPα transactivation domain displayed significant activity in yeast (data not shown) and thus gave a high background of reporter gene expression. Several potential interactors were obtained by this screen and sequenced, and one of these was a previously identified gene product called CA150 (32Sune C. Hayashi T. Liu Y. Lane W. Young R. Garcia-Blanco M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6029-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). CA150 was first characterized as a nuclear protein from HeLa cells that was associated with RNA polymerase II and involved in Tat-activated transcription of the human immunodeficiency viral promoter. It contains glutamine- and alanine-rich repeats that are characteristic of transcriptional regulators. CA150 has been shown to repress RNA polymerase II transcription, although in a specific fashion, because it doesn't repress transcription of all genes (24Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CA150-mediated repression of elongation requires a TATA box, and overexpression of the TATA-binding protein alleviates the repression, although there appears to be no direct physical interaction between the TATA-binding protein and CA150 (24Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4719-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CA150 has been shown to bind directly to the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The strength of the genetic interaction observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay between the transactivation domain of C/EBPα and CA150 was quantified and compared with that of two, well described interactors using a liquid β-galactosidase assay. This assay quantifies the amount of lacZ reporter gene activity in yeast that results from the bait and prey proteins interacting on a GAL4-driven promoter. As expected, the empty bait vector alone, expressing only the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, resulted in only a small amount of β-galactosidase expression (Fig. 1). Transformation of yeast with the CA150 prey vector (expressing the GAL4 transactivation domain fused to CA150), alone or in combination with the empty bait vector, also resulted in little activation of the lacZ reporter gene. When yeast were transformed with the mutant C/EBPα bait vector, some stimulation of β-galactosidase activity was observed, but this was not increased further with co-transformation with the empty prey vector. However, when the C/EBPα bait and CA150 prey vectors were co-transformed, a significant induction of lacZ reporter gene activity was observed, suggesting that an interaction between the C/EBPα and CA150 occurred (Fig. 1). Comparison of this interaction with that of the positive control TD1 and VA3 vectors, which express a p53 bait protein and large T-antigen prey protein, respectively, indicated that the degree of genetic interaction between C/EBPα and CA150 is relatively strong. One study examining the expression of CA150 suggested that the levels of mRNA were very low in liver (33Bohne J. Cole S. Sune C. Lindman B. Ko V. Vogt T. Garcia-Blanco M. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether it is expressed at significant levels in this tissue. To address this issue, nuclear extracts from several mouse tissues were prepared, and Western blots were performed to assess protein levels of CA150 and to compare them with the relative levels of CREB, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor. As shown in Fig. 2, CA150 protein levels in liver were easily detectable and were similar to those present in kidney, brain, and lung. Heart, skeletal muscle, and spleen showed low levels of CA150, however, an abundant protein of molecular mass ∼200 kDa was detected in muscle extracts. No CA150 was detected in cytosolic fractions, confirming that it localizes to nuclei (data not shown, see Fig. 9A). CREB showed a similar pattern of expression to CA150 except that spleen expression was abundant. Thus, CA150 appears to be widely expressed albeit at varying levels.FIGURE 9CA150 associates with a promoter that is repressed by C/EBPα. ChIP analysis was performed on mouse liver DNA. A, a Western blot was performed to identify the presence of CA150 in cytosolic (C) or nuclear (N) fractions (100 μg) of the mouse liver homogenates. The corresponding positions of the molecular weight markers are shown on the left. B, the results of ChIP analysis from two mouse livers (#1 and #2) are shown. The cross-linked DNA fragments were immunoprecipitated with either no antibody (No ab), or with anti-C/EBPα, -CA150, or -cdk2. The immunoprecipitated fragments were then subjected to PCR with primers directed against the C/EBP binding region of the PEPCK or HNF6 promoters, or with control primers directed at a region ∼1.5 kb upstream of each corresponding C/EBP site. The PCR signal from each input set of DNA samples is shown in the first lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to see if we could detect complexes between C/EBPα and CA150. Mouse liver nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies for C/EBPα, CREB, or with no antibodies, and assessed for the presence of CA150 in the immunoprecipitate. The efficacy of C/EBPα depletion of the nuclear extract was first assessed. As shown in Fig. 3A, addition of Protein G-agarose beads alone (Pre-cleared input), or co-immunoprecipitation with no antibody or CREB antibody, did not deplete the extract of C/EBPα. However, immunoprecipitation with anti-C/EBPα effectively depleted the extract. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed for the presence of CA150 (Fig. 3B). CA150 was detected only in the immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-C/EBPα. C/EBPβ shares some amino acid sequence similarity with C/EBPα, including sub-regions within the transactivation domain (3Nerlov C. Ziff E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4318-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Wilson H.L. McFie P.J. Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 181: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This suggested that CA150 might also interact with this isoform. This hypothesis was tested by quantitative yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 4). Transformation of yeast with the CA150 prey vector alone produced no stimulation of β-galactosidase activity. As expected, the C/EBPβ bait vector, expressing a fusion protein consisting of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the transactivation domain (amino acids 1–108) of C/EBPβ, stimulated the β-galactosidase reporter gene, indicating that this transactivation domain is active in yeast. When the CA150 prey and C/EBPβ bait vectors were co-transformed, a significant induction of reporter gene activity was observed, suggesting that the GAL4 transactivation domain on the CA150 prey protein was recruited to the reporter gene. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by the lack of activation of the reporter gene observed when a CREB bait vector and CA150 prey vector were co-transformed into yeast (Fig. 4). We next examined what effect CA150 had on the transactivation potential of C/EBPs, using transient transfection of reporter genes in HepG2 cells. Initially, we assessed the activity of CA150 on –68FX4 (22Roesler W. McFie P. Puttick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3791-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a chimeric promoter consisting of four copies of a region of the PEPCK promoter (–355/–200) that possesses three C/EBP binding sites, linked to a minimal promoter. Thus, it is a promoter that is highly sensitive to C/EBP-dependent transactivation. Overexpression of C/EBPα or C/EB"
