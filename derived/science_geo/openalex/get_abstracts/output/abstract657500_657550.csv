https://openalex.org/W3047796083,"A lockdown of people has been used as an efficient public health measure to fight against the exponential spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and allows the health system to manage the number of patients. The aim of this study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 0430818) was to evaluate the impact of both perceived stress aroused by Covid-19 and of emotions triggered by the lockdown situation on the individual experience of time. A large sample of the French population responded to a survey on their experience of the passage of time during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. The perceived stress resulting from Covid-19 and stress at work and home were also assessed, as were the emotions felt. The results showed that people have experienced a slowing down of time during the lockdown. This time experience was not explained by the levels of perceived stress or anxiety, although these were considerable, but rather by the increase in boredom and sadness felt in the lockdown situation. The increased anger and fear of death only explained a small part of variance in the time judgment. The conscious experience of time therefore reflected the psychological difficulties experienced during lockdown and was not related to their perceived level of stress or anxiety."

To gain a better understanding of coronavirus presence and diversity in wildlife at wildlife-human interfaces in three southern provinces in Viet Nam 2013–2014, we used consensus Polymerase Chain Reactions to detect coronavirus sequences. In comparison to previous studies, we observed high proportions of positive samples among field rats (34.0%, 239/702) destined for human consumption and insectivorous bats in guano farms (74.8%, 234/313) adjacent to human dwellings. Most notably among field rats, the odds of coronavirus RNA detection significantly increased along the supply chain from field rats sold by traders (reference group; 20.7% positivity, 39/188) by a factor of 2.2 for field rats sold in large markets (32.0%, 116/363) and 10.0 for field rats sold and served in restaurants (55.6%, 84/151). Coronaviruses were also detected in rodents on the majority of wildlife farms sampled (60.7%, 17/28). These coronaviruses were found in the Malayan porcupines (6.0%, 20/331) and bamboo rats (6.3%, 6/96) that are raised on wildlife farms for human consumption as food. We identified six known coronaviruses in bats and rodents, clustered in three Coronaviridae genera, including the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronaviruses. Our analysis also suggested either mixing of animal excreta in the environment or interspecies transmission of coronaviruses, as both bat and avian coronaviruses were detected in rodent feces on wildlife farms. The mixing of multiple coronaviruses, and their apparent amplification along the wildlife supply chain into restaurants, suggests maximal risk for end consumers and likely underpins the mechanisms of zoonotic spillover to people."
https://openalex.org/W3048558292,"Until recently the in utero environment of pregnant women was considered sterile. Recent high-sensitivity molecular techniques and high-throughput sequencing lead to some evidence for a low-biomass microbiome associated with the healthy placenta. Other studies failed to reveal evidence for a consistent presence of bacteria using either culture or molecular based techniques. Comparing conflicting “placental microbiome” studies is complicated by the use of varied and inconsistent protocols. Given this situation, we undertook an evaluation of the in utero environment sterility using several controlled methods, in the same study, to evaluate the presence or absence of bacteria and to explain contradictions present in the literature. Healthy pregnant women (n = 38) were recruited in three maternity wards. Placenta were collected after cesarean section with or without Alexis® and vaginal delivery births. For this study we sampled fetal membranes, umbilical cord and chorionic villi. Bacterial presence was analyzed using bacterial culture and qPCR on 34 fetal membranes, umbilical cord and chorionic villi samples. Shotgun metagenomics was performed on seven chorionic villi samples. We showed that the isolation of meaningful quantities of viable bacteria or bacterial DNA was possible only outside the placenta (fetal membranes and umbilical cords) highlighting the importance of sampling methods in studying the in utero environment. Bacterial communities described by metagenomics analysis were similar in chorionic villi samples and in negative controls and were dependent on the database chosen for the analysis. We conclude that the placenta does not harbor a specific, consistent and functional microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3048229172,"SARS-CoV-2 started causing infections in humans in late 2019 and has spread rapidly around the world. While the number of symptomatically infected and severely ill people is high and has overwhelmed the medical systems of many countries, there is mounting evidence that some of the rapid spread of this virus has been driven by asymptomatic infections. In this study, we use a compartmental mathematical model of a viral epidemic that includes asymptomatic infection to examine the role of asymptomatic individuals in the spread of the infection. We apply the model to epidemics in California, Florida, New York, and Texas, finding that asymptomatic infections far outnumber reported symptomatic infections at the peak of the epidemic in all four states. The model suggests that relaxing of social distancing measures too quickly could lead to a rapid rise in the number of cases, driven in part by asymptomatic infections."
https://openalex.org/W3048448346,"The American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, is a veterinary- and medically- significant tick species that is known to transmit several diseases to animal and human hosts. The spatial distribution of this species in North America is not well understood, however; and knowledge of likely changes to its future geographic distribution owing to ongoing climate change is needed for proper public health planning and messaging. Two recent studies have evaluated these topics for D. variabilis; however, less-rigorous modeling approaches in those studies may have led to erroneous predictions. We evaluated the present and future distribution of this species using a correlative maximum entropy approach, using publicly available occurrence information. Future potential distributions were predicted under two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios; RCP 4.5 for low-emissions and RCP 8.5 for high-emissions. Our results indicated a broader current distribution of this species in all directions relative to its currently known extent, and dramatic potential for westward and northward expansion of suitable areas under both climate change scenarios. Implications for disease ecology and public health are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3048874793,"Background Sepsis is the third most common cause of death among neonates, with about 225,000 newborns dying every year globally. Data concerning the microbial etiology of neonatal sepsis and antimicrobial resistance profiles of its causative agents are necessary to inform targeted and effective treatment and prevention strategies. Objective To determine the proportion of newborns with symptoms and signs of sepsis who had a positive blood culture, its bacterial etiology, the antimicrobial resistance patterns as well as the factors associated with culture-positivity and case fatality at Mulago national referral hospital in Uganda. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 359 neonates with symptoms and signs of sepsis who presented to the pediatric emergency care unit of Mulago national referral hospital from mid-January to end of December 2018. We performed blood culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and conducted polymerase chain reaction to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association between potential risk factors and culture-positive neonatal sepsis. Findings Of the 359 neonates recruited, 46 (12.8%; 95% CI 9.5%, 16.7%) had a positive blood culture. The predominant isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in 29 (63.0%), Escherichia coli in seven (15.2%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae in five (10.9%). Of the 46 pathogens, 73.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 23.9% to gentamicin and 8.7% to ceftriaxone. We isolated MRSA from the blood specimens of 19 (5.3%) of the 359 neonates, while 3 (0.8%) grew extended spectrum beta lactamase producers. The case fatality risk among neonates with neonatal sepsis was 9.5% (95% CI: 6.6%, 13.0%). Cesarean section delivery was strongly associated with culture-positive sepsis (adjusted odds ratio 3.45, 95% CI: 1.2, 10.1). Conclusion One in eight neonates with clinical signs of sepsis grew a likely causative bacterial pathogen. S. aureus was the main pathogen isolated and a third of these isolates were MRSA. A significant proportion of the isolated bacterial pathogens were resistant to the first and second line antibiotics used for the treatment of neonatal sepsis. There is need to revisit the current treatment guidelines for neonatal sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3048711201,"Background We conducted three studies to validate the Polish version of the BRS. Our objectives are as follows: first, to explore the dimensional structure of the scale and to determine the internal consistency (study 1: n = 1022); second, to determine the congruent and divergent validity of the BRS (study 2: n = 242); and third, to examine sensitivity of the BRS scale to detect high-risk population (study 3: n = 602). Methods To explore the dimensional structure of the scale, we tested a two-factor model with one factor for positively worded items and one factor for negatively worded items. To determine the congruent and divergent validity of the BRS, we analysed correlations among BRS and resilience, positive mental health, and with positive and negative religious coping. We used Student’s t-test to examine sensitivity of the BRS scale to detect a high-risk population. Results Based on the CFA, a bivariate model was confirmed for items positively and negatively formulated with a higher order factor, which indicates the homogeneity of the scale, similar to the analyses carried out for their language versions confirming this type of homogeneity of the scale. The internal compatibility assessment based on Cronbach’s Alpha and McDonald’s Omega is good (0.88). Our analyses intended to test convergent and divergent validity, and showed that the BRS results are significantly related to a questionnaire measuring similar constructions. Our validation studies also provided important diagnoses regarding BRS ""sensitivity"", indicating that groups with higher stress levels achieved lower BRS resilience results. Conclusion The results of our research indicate that the Polish version of the BRS should be considered to be a reliable and valid research tool. The Polish version of BRS is a reliable and accurate way of measuring resilience as the ability to bounce back from adversity and overcome various challenges or stressors. This scale may be used for both research and intervention purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3048894475,"In this paper, a novel, effective meta-heuristic, population-based Hybrid Firefly Particle Swarm Optimization (HFPSO) algorithm is applied to solve different non-linear and convex optimal power flow (OPF) problems. The HFPSO algorithm is a hybridization of the Firefly Optimization (FFO) and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique, to enhance the exploration, exploitation strategies, and to speed up the convergence rate. In this work, five objective functions of OPF problems are studied to prove the strength of the proposed method: total generation cost minimization, voltage profile improvement, voltage stability enhancement, the transmission lines active power loss reductions, and the transmission lines reactive power loss reductions. The particular fitness function is chosen as a single objective based on control parameters. The proposed HFPSO technique is coded using MATLAB software and its effectiveness is tested on the standard IEEE 30-bus test system. The obtained results of the proposed algorithm are compared to simulated results of the original Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method and the present state-of-the-art optimization techniques. The comparison of optimum solutions reveals that the recommended method can generate optimum, feasible, global solutions with fast convergence and can also deal with the challenges and complexities of various OPF problems."
https://openalex.org/W3048567036,"Postural control provides insight into health concerns such as fall risk but remains relatively untapped as a vital sign of health. One understudied aspect of postural control involves transient responses within center of pressure (CoP) data to events such as vision occlusion. Such responses are masked by common whole-trial analyses. We hypothesized that the transient behavior of postural control would yield unique and clinically-relevant information for quiet stance compared to traditionally calculated whole-trial CoP estimates. Three experiments were conducted to test different aspects of this central hypothesis. To test whether transient, epoch-based characteristics of CoP estimates provide different information than traditional whole-trial estimates, we investigated correlations between these estimates for a population of young adults performing three 60-second trials of quiet stance with eyes closed. Next, to test if transient behavior is a result of sensory reweighting after eye closure, we compared transient characteristics between eyes closed and eyes open conditions. Finally, to test if there was an effect of age on transient behavior, we compared transient characteristics during eyes closed stance between populations of young and older adults. Negligible correlations were found between transient characteristics and whole-trial estimates (p>0.08), demonstrating limited overlap in information between them. Additionally, transient behavior was exaggerated during eyes closed stance relative to eyes open (p<0.044). Lastly, we found that transient characteristics were able to distinguish between younger and older adults, supporting their clinical relevance (p<0.029). An epoch-based approach captured unique and potentially clinically-relevant postural control information compared to whole-trial estimates. While longer trials may improve the reliability of whole-trial estimates, including a complementary assessment of the initial transient characteristics may provide a more comprehensive characterization of postural control."
https://openalex.org/W3047647435,"The increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) worldwide indicates the urgent need to develop novel and effective treatment strategies. Betulinic acid (BA), a naturally occurring plant-derived pentacyclic triterpenoid, has an outstanding effect in improving metabolism. However, the pharmacological action and mechanism of BA in NAFLD remain unclear. Here, we show that BA-treated high-fat diet mice and methionine-choline deficient diet-fed mice are resistant to hepatic steatosis when compared with vehicle-treated mice. BA alleviates fatty acid synthesis, fibrosis, and inflammation and promotes fatty acid oxidation. Meanwhile, fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression and activity are markedly inhibited with BA treatment both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, BA inhibits FAS expression through transcriptional suppression of Yin Yang 1 (YY1), leading to retard hepatocytes triglyceride accumulation. Collectively, BA protects hepatocytes from abnormal lipid deposition in NAFLD through YY1/FAS pathway. Our findings establish a novel role of BA in representing a possible therapeutic strategy to reverse NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3047941153,"De novo assembly of sequence reads from next generation sequencing platforms is a common strategy for detecting presence and sequencing of viruses in biospecimens. Amplification artifacts and presence of several related viruses in the same specimen can lead to assembly of erroneous, chimeric sequences. We now report that such chimeras can also occur between viral and non-viral biological sequences incorrectly joined together which may cause erroneous detection of viruses, highlighting the importance of performing a chimera checking step in bioinformatics pipelines. Using Illumina NextSeq and metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed 80 consecutive non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) from 11 immunosuppressed patients together with 11 NMSCs from patients who had only developed 1 NMSC. We aligned high-quality reads against a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) database and found HPV sequences in 9/91 specimens. A previous bioinformatic analysis of the same crude sequencing data from some of these samples had found an additional 3 specimens to be HPV-positive after performing de novo assembly. The reason for the discrepancy was investigated and found to be mostly caused by chimeric sequences containing both viral and non-viral sequences. Non-viral sequences were present in these 3 samples. To avoid erroneous detection of HPV when performing sequencing, we thus developed a novel script to identify HPV chimeric sequences."
https://openalex.org/W3048391665,"A surveillance system for sales volumes of antimicrobial agents for veterinary use was established in Germany in 2011. Since then, pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers have been legally obliged to report annual volumes of veterinary antimicrobial products sold to veterinary practices or clinics located in Germany. The evaluation of sales volumes for eight consecutive years resulted in a considerable total decrease by 58% from 1706 tons to 722 tons. During the investigation period, two legally binding measures to control the risk of antimicrobial resistance resulting from the veterinary use of antimicrobials were introduced, a) the German treatment frequencies benchmarking in 2014 and b) the obligation to conduct susceptibility testing for the use of cephalosporins of the 3rd and 4th generation and of fluoroquinolones in 2018. Both had a marked impact on sales volumes. Nonetheless, the category of Critically Important Antimicrobials as defined by the World Health Organization kept accounting for the highest share on sales volumes in Germany in 2018 with 403 tons, despite an overall reduction by 53%. Sales surveillance is considered essential for data retrieval on a global scale and inter-country comparison. However, the usability of a surveillance system based on sales data for risk management of antimicrobial resistance has limitations. The German system does not include off-label use of antimicrobial products authorized for human medicine and does not allow for identification of areas of high risk according to animal species, farm and production types and indications for treatment. For further reduction and enhanced promotion of a prudent use of antimicrobials, targeted measures would be required that could only be deducted from use data collected at farm or veterinary practice level. A surveillance system based on use data is currently lacking in Germany but will be established according to Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products."
https://openalex.org/W3048417781,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor for mortality and it is also one of the major risk factors for other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of hypertension and its associated factors among adults residing in Arba Minch health and demographic surveillance site (HDSS), Southern Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017 on the estimated sample size of 3,368 adults at Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance site (HDSS). Data were collected using the WHO STEPS survey tools. Bivariate analysis was done to detect candidate variables at P-value less than 0.25 and entered into the final model to identify the independent predictors of hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension was 18.92% (95% CI: 17.63-20.28). The magnitude increase among respondents in the older age group [AOR 1.39 (95%CI: 1.05-1.84), 1.68 (95% CI: 1.26-2.23) and 2.67 (95%CI: 2.01-3.56) for age group 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64, respectively, compared to 25-34 years old group] and those with the higher wealth index [AOR 1.86 (95%CI: 1.33-2.59), 2.68 (95% CI: 1.91-3.75) and 2.97 (95%CI: 2.08-4.25) for 3rd quantile, 4th quantile and 5th quantile, respectively, compared to 1st quantile]. The odds of hypertension reduce among married participants (AOR 0.66, 95%CI: 0.51-0.85). Respondents with overweight (AOR 1.44, 95%CI: 1.02-2.02), khat chewing (AOR3.31, 95%CI: 1.94-5.64), low fruit and/or vegetable consumption (AOR 1.27, 95%CI: 1.05-1.53) and those who do not use coffee and tea (AOR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.03-2.24) had significantly higher likelihood of hypertension. Nearly one out of five participants have hypertension in this population. As hypertension is one of the silent killers, it is advisable to develop a system for enabling early detection and monitoring in the older age groups and overweight individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3048965387,"Background Animal models of brain recovery identify the first days after lesioning as a time of great flux in sensorimotor function and physiology. After rodent motor system lesioning, daily skill training in the less affected forelimb reduces skill acquisition in the more affected forelimb. We asked whether spontaneous human motor behaviors of the less affected upper extremity (UE) early after stroke resemble the animal training model, with the potential to suppress clinical recovery. Methods This prospective observational study used a convenience sample of patients (n = 25, mean 4.5 ±1.8) days after stroke with a wide severity range; Controls were hospitalized for non-neurological conditions (n = 12). Outcome measures were Accelerometry, Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UEFM), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Shoulder Abduction/ Finger Extension Test (SAFE), NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Results Accelerometry indicated total paretic UE movement was reduced compared to controls, primarily due to a 44% reduction of bilateral UE use. Unilateral paretic movement was unchanged. Thus, movement shifted early after stroke; bilateral use was reduced and unilateral use of the non-paretic UE was increased by 77%. Low correlations between movement time and motor performance prompted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealing a 2-component solution; motor performance tests load on one component (motor performance) whereas accelerometry-derived variables load on a second orthogonal component (quantity of movement). Conclusions Early after stroke, spontaneous overall UE movement is reduced, and movement shifts to unilateral use of the non-paretic UE. Two mechanisms that could influence motor recovery may already be in place 4.5 ± 1.8 days post stroke: (1) the overuse of the less affected UE, which could set the stage for learned non-use and (2) skill acquisition in the non-paretic limb that could impede recovery. Accurate UE motor assessment requires two independent constructs: motor performance and quantity of movement. These findings provide opportunities and measurement methods for studies to develop new behaviorally-based stroke recovery treatments that begin early after onset."
https://openalex.org/W3048902514,"Platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) are associated with increased thrombosis risk. The influence of PLA formation is especially important for cancer patients, since thrombosis accounts for approximately 10% of cancer-associated deaths. Our objective was to characterize and quantify PLAs in whole blood samples from lung cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers with the intent to analyze PLA formation in the context of lung cancer-associated thrombosis. Consenting lung cancer patients (57) and healthy volunteers (56) were enrolled at the Dana Cancer Center at the University of Toledo Health Science Campus. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Patient medical history was reviewed through electronic medical records. Most importantly, we found lung cancer patients to have higher percentages of platelet-T cell aggregates (PTCAs) than healthy volunteers among both CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations. Our findings demonstrate that characterization of PTCAs may have clinical utility in differentiating lung cancer patients from healthy volunteers and stratifying lung cancer patients by history of thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W3048892140,"Background Psychological distress in medical students is a global issue and poses a risk to their health, academic performance, and ability to care for patients as clinicians. There has been limited research on psychological distress levels in students prior to starting medicine and no direct comparison between undergraduate and graduate-entry students. Methods Psychological distress was assessed using the 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale in 168 undergraduate-entry and 84 graduate-entry medical students at two separated campuses of the same university in the orientation week prior to starting classes. Mean scores and severity proportions were compared between the two cohorts of students. Demographic data was also collected and compared to distress scores using subgroup analysis. Results The response rate for the study was 60.9%. The majority of undergraduate and graduate-entry medical students were within the normal limits for depression (67.2% versus 70.2%, p = 0.63), anxiety (56.5% versus 44.0%, p = 0.06), and stress scores (74.4% versus 64.2%, p = 0.10). There was no significant difference between severity groups except for severe stress (2.3% versus 9.5%, p = 0.01). The mean scores of the clinically distressed groups indicated moderate levels of depression, moderate anxiety, and moderate stress scores. There were no significant differences between undergraduate or graduate-entry students for depressive ( = 17.02 versus 15.76, p = 0.43), anxiety ( = 14.22 versus 13.28, p = 0.39), and stress scores ( = 20.83 versus 22.46, p = 0.24). Female gender and self-believed financial concerns were found be associated with higher levels stress in graduate entry students. Conclusions The majority of medical students enter medical school with normal levels of psychological distress. However, a large number of undergraduate and graduate-entry medical students have significant levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress levels, without a significant difference between undergraduate or graduate-entry students. There are several limitation of this study but the results suggest that education and intervention may be required to support students from the earliest weeks of medical school."
https://openalex.org/W3048453738,"With obesity having doubled in the last decade, hypertension is on the rise. In one-third of hypertensive patients the metabolic syndrome is present. This might be one factor for the increasing number of prescriptions for angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium-channel blockers besides a more favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) method for assessment of adherence based on cut-offs in inpatients and to compare it to an established urine drug screening in outpatients. A method for quantification of calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric analysis (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated. The method was applied to serum samples of 32 patients under supervised medication to establish cut-off values for adherence assessment based on dose-related concentrations (DRC, calculated from pharmacokinetic data). Furthermore, corresponding urine and blood samples of 42 outpatients without supervised medication were analysed and the results compared with regard to adherence assessment. All serum concentrations measured for amlodipine (n = 40), lercanidipine (n = 14), candesartan (n = 10), telmisartan (n = 4) and valsartan (n = 10) in inpatients were above the patient specific lower DRC confirming adherence. Of 42 outpatients the identification of analytes in urine as well as the quantification in serum exhibited differing results. According to urinalysis, adherence was demonstrated in only 87.0% of prescriptions, compared to 91.3% for serum analyses. Differences were observed for amlodipine, lercanidipine and candesartan which can be explained by a higher specificity of the serum analysis approach due to pharmacokinetics. The present study confirms that assessing adherence based on serum drug concentrations with individually calculated lower DRCs is more accurate than using qualitative urine analysis. In particular, drugs with low bioavailability, low renal excretion or high metabolism rate such as lercanidipine and candesartan may lead to underestimation of adherence via urine analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3048456364,"Studying the isotope variability in fast-growing human tissues (e.g., hair, nails) is a powerful tool to investigate human nutrition. However, interpreting the controls of this isotopic variability at the population scale is often challenging as multiple factors can superimpose on the isotopic signals of a current population. Here, we analyse carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur isotopes in hair from 590 Canadian resident volunteers along with demographics, dietary and geographic information about each participant. We use a series of machine-learning regressions to demonstrate that the isotopic values in Canadian residents’ hair are not only influenced by dietary choices but by geographic controls. First, we show that isotopic values in Canadian residents’ hair have a limited range of variability consistent with the homogenization of Canadian dietary habits (as in other industrialized countries). As expected, some of the isotopic variability within the population correlates with recorded individual dietary choices. More interestingly, some regional spatial patterns emerge from carbon and sulphur isotope variations. The high carbon isotope composition of the hair of eastern Canadians relative to that of western Canadians correlates with the dominance of corn in the eastern Canadian food-industry. The gradient of sulphur isotope composition in Canadian hair from coast to inland regions correlates with the increasing soil pH and decreasing deposition of marine-derived sulphate aerosols in local food systems. We conclude that part of the isotopic variability found in the hair of Canadian residents reflects the isotopic signature associated with specific environmental conditions and agricultural practices of regional food systems transmitted to humans through the high consumption rate of intra-provincial food in Canada. Our study also underscores the strong potential of sulphur isotopes as tracers of human and food provenance."
https://openalex.org/W3048386353,"Mountainous freeways with high bridge and tunnel ratios are a new type of road that rarely contain many special road sections formed by various structures. The crash characteristics of the road are still unclear, but it also provides conditions for studying how various road environments affect traffic. In view of the various structures and differences in the driving environments, a scenario-based discretization method for such a road was established. The traffic-influence areas of elementary and composite structures were proposed and defined. Actual data were analyzed to investigate the crash patterns in an entire freeway and in each special section through statistical and comparative research. The results demonstrate the applicability and validity of this method. The crash rates were found to be the highest in interchange and service areas, lower in ordinary sections, and the lowest in tunnels, being mostly attributed to collisions with fixtures. The crash severity on bridges and bridge groups was significantly higher than that on the other types of road sections, being mostly attributed to single-vehicle crashes. The annual average daily traffic and driving adaptability were found to be related to crashes. The findings shed some light on the road design and traffic management implications for strengthening the traffic safety of mountainous freeways."
https://openalex.org/W3048412132,"Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. Identification of reliable prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets is critical for improving patient outcome. Cancer in companion animals often strongly resembles human cancers and a comparative approach to identify prognostic markers can improve clinical care across species. Feline mammary tumors (FMT) serve as models for extremely aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in humans, with high rates of local and distant recurrence after resection. Despite the aggressive clinical behavior of most FMT, current prognostic indicators are insufficient for accurately predicting outcome, similar to human patients. Given significant heterogeneity of mammary tumors, there has been a recent focus on identification of universal tumor-permissive stromal features that can predict biologic behavior and provide therapeutic targets to improve outcome. As in human and canine patients, collagen signatures appear to play a key role in directing mammary tumor behavior in feline patients. We find that patients bearing FMTs with denser collagen, as well as longer, thicker and straighter fibers and less identifiable tumor-stromal boundaries had poorer outcomes, independent of the clinical variables grade and surgical margins. Most importantly, including the collagen parameters increased the predictive power of the clinical model. Thus, our data suggest that similarities with respect to the stromal microenvironment between species may allow this model to predict outcome and develop novel therapeutic targets within the tumor stroma that would benefit both veterinary and human patients with aggressive mammary tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3048539408,"Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) has been associated with abnormalities in hippocampal volumes, but these relationships have not been fully explored with respect to sub-regional volumes, nor in association with individual characteristics such as age, gender differences, drinking history, and memory. The present study examined the impact of those variables in relation to hippocampal subfield volumes in abstinent men and women with a history of AUD. Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 3 Tesla, we obtained brain images from 67 participants with AUD (31 women) and 64 nonalcoholic control (NC) participants (31 women). The average duration of the most recent period of sobriety for AUD participants was 7.1 years. We used Freesurfer 6.0 to segment the hippocampus into 12 regions. These were imputed into statistical models to examine the relationships of brain volume with AUD group, age, gender, memory, and drinking history. Interactions with gender and age were of particular interest. Compared to the NC group, the AUD group had approximately 5% smaller subiculum, CA1, molecular layer, and hippocampal tail regions. Age was negatively associated with volumes for the AUD group in the subiculum and the hippocampal tail, but no significant interactions with gender were identified. The relationships for delayed and immediate memory with hippocampal tail volume differed for AUD and NC groups: Higher scores on tests of immediate and delayed memory were associated with smaller volumes in the AUD group, but larger volumes in the NC group. Length of sobriety was associated with decreasing CA1 volume in women (0.19% per year) and increasing volume size in men (0.38% per year). The course of abstinence on CA1 volume differed for men and women, and the differential relationships of subfield volumes to age and memory could indicate a distinction in the impact of AUD on functions of the hippocampal tail. These findings confirm and extend evidence that AUD, age, gender, memory, and abstinence differentially impact volumes of component parts of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W3048552621,"It has been reported that Bach1-deficient mice show reduced tissue injuries in diverse disease models due to increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)that possesses an antioxidant function. In contrast, we found that Bach1 deficiency in mice exacerbated skeletal muscle injury induced by cardiotoxin. Inhibition of Bach1 expression in C2C12 myoblast cells using RNA interference resulted in reduced proliferation, myotube formation, and myogenin expression compared with control cells. While the expression of HO-1 was increased by Bach1 silencing in C2C12 cells, the reduced myotube formation was not rescued by HO-1 inhibition. Up-regulations of Smad2, Smad3 and FoxO1, known inhibitors of muscle cell differentiation, were observed in Bach1-deficient mice and Bach1-silenced C2C12 cells. Therefore, Bach1 may promote regeneration of muscle by increasing proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W3048654643,"We studied the correlation of synonymous codon usage (SCU) on gene expression levels under drought stress in rice. Sixty genes related to drought stress (with high, intermediate and low expression) were selected from rice meta-analysis data and various codon usage indices such as the effective number of codon usage (ENC), codon adaptation index (CAI) and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) were calculated. We found that in genes highly expressing under drought 1) GC content was higher, 2) ENC value was lower, 3) the preferred codons of some amino acids changed and 4) the RSCU ratio of GC-end codons relative to AT-end codons for 18 amino acids increased significantly compared with those in other genes. We introduce ARSCU as the Average ratio of RSCUs of GC-end codons to AT-end codons in each gene that could significantly separate high-expression genes under drought from low-expression genes. ARSCU is calculated using the program ARSCU-Calculator developed by our group to help predicting expression level of rice genes under drought. An index above ARSCU threshold is expected to indicate that the gene under study may belong to the “high expression group under drought”. This information may be applied for codon optimization of genes for rice genetic engineering. To validate these findings, we further used 60 other genes (randomly selected subset of 43233 genes studied for their response to drought stress). ARSCU value was able to predict the level of expression at 88.33% of the cases. Using third set of 60 genes selected amongst high expressing genes not related to drought, only 31.65% of the genes showed ARSCU value of higher than the set threshold. This indicates that the phenomenon we described in this report may be unique for drought related genes. To justify the observed correlation between CUB and high expressing genes under drought, possible role of tRNA post transcriptional modification and tRFs was hypothesized as possible underlying biological mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W3048510906,"Hemoglobin (Hb) is associated with cerebral oxygenation status owing to its important role of carrying oxygen to systemic tissues. However, data concerning the associations between Hb levels and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of hemodialysis (HD) patients is limited. We aimed to identify these associations to consider a target Hb level for renal anemia management. This study included 375 HD patients. Cerebral rSO2 before HD was monitored using the INVOS 5100c oxygen saturation monitor. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with natural logarithm (Ln)-HD duration (standardized coefficient: -0.36), mean blood pressure (standardized coefficient: 0.13), pH (standardized coefficient: -0.10), serum albumin (standardized coefficient: 0.14), presence of diabetes mellitus (standardized coefficient: -0.20), and Hb level (standardized coefficient: 0.29). Furthermore, a generalized linear model with restricted cubic spline function was used to investigate the non-linear association between cerebral rSO2 and Hb levels. In the multivariable analysis for the adjustment with Ln-HD duration, mean blood pressure, pH, serum albumin, and presence of diabetes mellitus, a linear relationship was demonstrated between the two variables (p for linearity = 0.79). Hb levels revealed the positive and significant association with cerebral rSO2 in this study. Moreover, the relationship between cerebral rSO2 and Hb level was proven to be linear. Therefore, the target Hb level in renal anemia management would be considered to be the upper limits for the appropriate management of renal anemia by previous guidelines and position statement from the viewpoint of maintaining cerebral oxygenation in HD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3048597528,"The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is an excellent small animal model for human respiratory viral infections such as human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). These respiratory viral infections, as well as other pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as asthma, are associated with lung mechanic disturbances. So far, the pathophysiological effects of viral infection and allergy on cotton rat lungs have not been measured, although this information might be an important tool to determine the efficacy of vaccine and drug candidates. To characterize pulmonary function in the cotton rat, we established forced oscillation technique in uninfected, RSV infected and HDM sensitized cotton rats, and characterized pulmonary inflammation, mucus production, pulmonary edema, and oxygenation. There was a gender difference after RSV infection, with females demonstrating airway hyper-responsiveness while males did not. Female cotton rats 2dpi had a mild increase in pulmonary edema (wet: dry weight ratios). At day 4 post infection, female cotton rats demonstrated mild pulmonary inflammation, no increase in mucus production or reduction in oxygenation. Pulmonary function was not significantly impaired after RSV infection. In contrast, cotton rats sensitized to HDM demonstrated airway hyper-responsiveness with a significant increase in pulmonary inflammation, increase in baseline tissue damping, and a decrease in baseline pulmonary compliance. In summary, we established baseline data for forced oscillation technique and other respiratory measures in the cotton rat and used it to analyze respiratory diseases in cotton rats."
https://openalex.org/W3048688654,"Background Since the long fluoroscopy time in primary PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) could be an indicator of delayed reperfusion, it should be important to recognize which types of lesions require longer fluoroscopy-time in primary PCI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of the long fluoroscopy-time with clinical factors in primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Methods A total of 539 patients who underwent primary PCI were divided into the conventional fluoroscopy-time group (Q1-Q4: n = 434) and the long fluoroscopy-time group (Q5: n = 105) according to the quintile of the total fluoroscopy time in primary PCI. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to find associations between clinical variables and the long fluoroscopy-time. Results In univariate logistic regression analysis, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hemodialysis, and previous CABG were significantly associated with the long fluoroscopy-time. In addition, complex lesion characteristics such as lesion length, lesion angle, tortuosity, and calcification were associated with the long fluoroscopy-time. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, lesion length [per 10 mm incremental: odds ratio (OR) 1.751, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.397–2.195, P<0.001], moderate-excessive tortuosity (vs. mild tortuosity: OR 4.006, 95% CI 1.498–10.715, P = 0.006), and moderate to severe calcification (vs. none-mild calcification: OR 1.865, 95% CI 1.107–3.140, P = 0.019) were significantly associated with the long fluoroscopy-time. Conclusions In primary PCI for STEMI, diffuse long lesion, tortuosity, and moderate-severe calcification were associated with the long fluoroscopy-time. These complex features require special attention to reduce reperfusion time in primary PCI."
https://openalex.org/W3048398221,"Setting Since August 2016, after the Ebola outbreak, the Guinean National Tuberculosis Programme and Damien Foundation implemented the shorter treatment regimen (STR) for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the three MDR-TB sites of Conakry. Previously, the longer regimen was used to treat MDR-TB. Objectives In a post-Ebola context, with a weakened health system, we describe the MDR-TB treatment uptake, patients characteristics, treatment outcomes and estimate the effect of using the longer versus STR on having a programmatically adverse outcome. Design This is a retrospective cohort study in RR-TB patients treated with either the longer regimen or STR. Results In Conakry, in 2016 and 2017, 131 and 219 patients were diagnosed with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB); and 108 and 163 started treatment, respectively. Of 271 patients who started treatment, 75 were treated with the longer regimen and 196 with the STR. Patients characteristics were similar regardless of the regimen except that the median age was higher among those treated with a longer regimen (30 years (IQR:24–38) versus 26 years (IQR:21–39) for the STR. Patients treated with a STR were more likely to obtain a programmatically favorable outcome (74.0% vs 58.7%, p = 0.01) as lost to follow up was higher among those treated with a longer regimen (20.0% vs 8.2%, p = 0.006). Patients on a longer regimen were more than 2 times more likely (aOR: 2.5; 95%CI:1.3,4.7) to have a programmatically adverse outcome as well as being 45 years or older (aOR: 2.8; 95%CI:1.3,6.2), HIV positive (aOR:3.3; 95%CI:1.6,6.6) and attendance at a clinic without NGO support (aOR:3.0; 95%:1.6,5.7). Conclusion In Guinea, patients treated with the STR were more likely to have a successful outcome than those treated with the longer MDR-TB treatment regimen. Lost to follow-up was higher in patients on the longer regimen. However, STR treatment outcomes were less good than those reported in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3048836049,"Background Dimensions of social location such as socioeconomic position or sex/gender are often associated with low response rates in epidemiological studies. We applied an intersectionality-informed approach to analyze non-response among population strata defined by combinations of multiple dimensions of social location and subjective health in a health survey in Germany. Methods We used data from the cross-sectional sample of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) conducted between 2008 and 2011. Information about non-responders was available from a mailed non-responder questionnaire. Intersectional strata were constructed by combining all categories of age, sex/gender, marital status, and level of education in scenario 1. Subjective health was additionally used to construct intersectional strata in scenario 2. We applied multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) to calculate measures of discriminatory accuracy, proportions of non-responders among intersectional strata, as well as stratum-specific total interaction effects (intersectional effects). Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to estimate multilevel logistic regression models. Results Data was available for 6,534 individuals of whom 36% were non-responders. In scenario 2, we found weak discriminatory accuracy (variance partition coefficient = 3.6%) of intersectional strata, while predicted proportions of non-response ranged from 20.6% (95% credible interval (CI) 17.0%-24.9%) to 57.5% (95% CI 48.8%-66.5%) among intersectional strata. No evidence for intersectional effects was found. These results did not differ substantially between scenarios 1 and 2. Conclusions MAIHDA revealed that proportions of non-response varied widely between intersectional strata. However, poor discriminatory accuracy of intersectional strata and no evidence for intersectional effects indicate that there is no justification to exclusively target specific intersectional strata in order to increase response, but that a combination of targeted and population-based measures might be appropriate to achieve more equal representation."
https://openalex.org/W3048450345,"The present study employed structured diagnostic interviews to assess the construct validity of the brief version of the Multidimensional Schizotypy Scale (MSS-B), which was developed to assess positive, negative, and disorganized dimensions of schizotypy. It was hypothesized that the MSS-B subscales would be associated with differential patterns of symptoms and impairment, comparable to findings for the full-length MSS. A total of 177 young adults completed structured diagnostic interviews assessing symptoms and impairment. As hypothesized, MSS-B positive schizotypy was significantly associated with interview ratings of positive (psychotic-like) symptoms, as well as schizotypal and paranoid personality disorder traits. MSS-B negative schizotypy was associated with interview ratings of negative symptoms, as well as schizoid, paranoid, and schizotypal traits. Furthermore, negative schizotypy predicted Cluster A personality disorder diagnoses. MSS-B disorganized schizotypy was associated with interview ratings of disorganized symptoms. All three schizotypy dimensions were associated with impaired functioning. This was the first study to evaluate the validity of the MSS-B using interview measures, and the pattern of findings for each MSS-B subscale was closely comparable to the findings for the full-length MSS. Contrary to our hypothesis, cannabis use was largely unassociated with psychotic-like symptoms and did not moderate the expression of the schizotypy dimensions. The MSS-B has good psychometric properties, high concordance with the full-length MSS, and good construct validity. Thus, it appears to be a promising brief alternative to traditional schizotypy measures."

However, the application of this effect has not been prevalent in our daily lives. To work towards developing more practical use of the hue-heat effect, we conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to investigate the relationship between perceived temperature and illumination in a well-controlled experimental environment. The results showed that illumination had three types of effects to change our sense of coolness/warmness: creating, eliminating, and exchanging effects. Furthermore, we confirmed the existence of two distinctive time courses for the three effects: creating effect started immediately, but the eliminating effect takes time. These findings provide us with a better understanding of the hue-heat effect and enable us to apply it in everyday life. Paired with the new technologies it can also help with energy conservation."

This article conducts a model-driven analysis of three plausible college-level responses to declining applications. It draws on systems theory to conceptualize a tuition-dependent college as a complex service system and to develop a system dynamics model that captures key causal interrelationships and multiple feedback effects between faculty, facilities, tuition revenue, financials, reputation, and outcomes. Simulations with the college model suggest that common solutions such as reducing faculty or adding campus facilities may improve the college's short-term financial position, but they are insufficient to ensure its long-term viability. This model contributes to the research literature on the economics of higher education, and model-driven academic management and strategy. It also provides useful implications and insights that can inform policy-makers and college leaders."
https://openalex.org/W3048812856,"Objectives This study aims to examine associations between spousal communication about contraception and ever use of modern contraception, overt modern contraceptive use (with husband’s knowledge), and covert modern contraceptive use (without husband’s knowledge) among adolescent wives and their husbands in Niger. Study design Cross-sectional data, from the Reaching Married Adolescents Study, were collected from randomly selected adolescent wives (ages 13–19 years) and their husbands from 48 randomly selected villages in rural Niger (N = 1,020 couples). Logistic regression models assessed associations of couples’ reports of spousal communication about contraception with wives’ reports of contraception (overall, overt, and covert). Results About one-fourth of adolescent wives and one-fifth of husbands reported spousal communication about contraception. Results showed couples’ reports of spousal communication about contraception were positively associated with ever use of modern contraception. Couples’ reports of spousal communication about contraception were negatively associated with covert modern contraceptive use compared to overt use. Wives’ reports of spousal communication were marginally associated with covert use compared to no use but husbands’ reports were not. Conclusion Among a sample of couples in Niger, spousal communication about contraception was positively associated with modern contraceptive use (compared to no use) and negatively with covert use (compared to overt use) but wives’ and husbands’ reports showed differential associations with covert use compared to no use. Since there is little understanding of couple communication surrounding covert contraceptive use decisions, research should focus on characterizing content and context of couple communication particularly in cases of disagreement over fertility decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3046119514,"Research on the songbird zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) has advanced our behavioral, hormonal, neuronal, and genetic understanding of vocal learning. However, little is known about the impact of typical experimental manipulations on the welfare of these birds. Here we explore whether the undirected singing rate can be used as an indicator of welfare. We tested this idea by performing a post hoc analysis of singing behavior in isolated male zebra finches subjected to interactive white noise, to surgery, or to tethering. We find that the latter two experimental manipulations transiently but reliably decreased singing rates. By contraposition, we infer that a high-sustained singing rate is suggestive of successful coping or improved welfare in these experiments. Our analysis across more than 300 days of song data suggests that a singing rate above a threshold of several hundred song motifs per day implies an absence of an acute stressor or a successful coping with stress. Because singing rate can be measured in a completely automatic fashion, its observation can help to reduce experimenter bias in welfare monitoring. Because singing rate measurements are non-invasive, we expect this study to contribute to the refinement of the current welfare monitoring tools in zebra finches."
https://openalex.org/W3048566946,"Introduced bird species can become invasive in agroecosystems and their management is inhibited if their origin and movements are not well understood. Stable isotope measurements of feathers can be used to infer molt origins and interstate movements in North America. We analyzed stable-hydrogen (δ2H), carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ 15N) isotope ratios in feathers to better understand the molt origin of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) collected at dairies and feedlots throughout the United States. Primary feathers were used from 596 adult and 90 juvenile starlings collected during winter at dairies and feedlots that experience starling damages in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. The best-fit model indicated that the combination of feather δ2H, δ13C and δ15N values best predicted the state where samples were collected and thus supported use of this approach for tracing molt origins in European starlings. Interestingly, molt origins of starlings collected at dairies and feedlots generally west of ˗90° longitude (i.e. 11 of 15 states west of the Mississippi River, including Wisconsin) were assigned to the collection state and/or the state adjacent to the collection state. In contrast, molt origins of starlings collected generally east of ˗90° longitude (four of five eastern states) were not assigned to the collection state and/or the state adjacent to the collection state. Among all starlings (N = 686), 23% were assigned to the collection state and 19% were assigned to the state adjacent to the collection state. Among all males (N = 489) and all females (N = 197), 23% and 26% were assigned to the collection state and 19% and 13% were assigned to the state adjacent to the collection state, respectively. We observed a greater proportion (88%) of juvenile starlings assigned to states other than their collection state (i.e. potentially a result of natal dispersal) than that proportion (76%) in adult starlings. This study included an unprecedented sample of feather isotopes from European starlings throughout the United States. As a novel contribution to the ecology and management of invasive and migratory passerines, we demonstrate how such feather isoscapes can be used to predict molt origin and, potentially, interstate movements of European starlings for subsequent ecological and management investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3048832401,"Deafness leads to brain modifications that are generally associated with a cross-modal activity of the auditory cortex, particularly for visual stimulations. In the present study, we explore the cortical processing of biological motion that conveyed either non-communicative (pantomimes) or communicative (emblems) information, in early-deaf and hearing individuals, using fMRI analyses. Behaviorally, deaf individuals showed an advantage in detecting communicative gestures relative to hearing individuals. Deaf individuals also showed significantly greater activation in the superior temporal cortex (including the planum temporale and primary auditory cortex) than hearing individuals. The activation levels in this region were correlated with deaf individuals’ response times. This study provides neural and behavioral evidence that cross-modal plasticity leads to functional advantages in the processing of biological motion following lifelong auditory deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W3048598087,"Paying for sex has often been associated with risky sexual behavior among heterosexual men, and men who pay for sex are considered as a bridging population for sexually transmitted infections. Consistent condom use during paid sex is essential for reducing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. In this study, we assessed the prevalence and predictors of consistent condom use among men who pay for sex in sub-Saharan Africa.We pooled data from 29 sub-Saharan African countries' Demographic and Health Surveys. A total of 3,353 men in sub-Saharan Africa who had paid for sex in the last 12 months preceding the surveys and had complete information on all the variables of interest were used in this study. The outcome variable for the study was consistent condom use for every paid sex in the last 12 months. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out. Results were presented as adjusted odds ratios with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was declared at p< 0.05.Overall, the prevalence of consistent condom use during paid sex in sub-Saharan Africa was 83.96% (CI = 80.35-87.56), ranging from 48.70% in Benin to 98% in Burkina Faso. Men aged 35-44 [AOR, 1.39 CI = 1.04-1.49], men in the richest wealth quintile [AOR, 1.96 CI = 1.30-3.00], men with secondary level of education [AOR, 1.69 CI = 1.17-2.44], and men in Burkina Faso [AOR = 67.59, CI = 8.72-523.9] had higher odds of consistent condom use during paid sex, compared to men aged 15-19, those in the poorest wealth quintile, those with no formal education, and men in Benin respectively. Conversely, Muslim men had lower odds [AOR = 0.71, CI = 0.53-0.95] of using condom consistently during paid sex, compared to Christian men.Empirical evidence from this study suggests that consistent condom use during paid sex encompasses complex social and demographic characteristics. The study also revealed that demographic characteristics such as age, wealth quintile, education, and religion were independently related to consistent condom use for paid sex among men. With sub-Saharan Africa having the highest sexual and reproductive health burden in the world, continuous application of evidence-based interventions (e.g., educational and entrepreneurial training) that account for behavioural and social vulnerabilities are required."
https://openalex.org/W3048599856,"Soccer is the most popular sport in the world and, since it is a contact sport, players are at risk for head injury, including concussion. Here, we proposed to investigate the association of heading and concussion with macroscopic brain structure among adult amateur soccer players. For this study, 375 amateur soccer players (median age 23 years) completed HeadCount-12m to estimate heading over the 12 months prior to MRI and lifetime concussion. T1-weighted 3D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) MRI was performed at 3 Tesla. Parcellation was performed using Freesurfer to extract regional gray and white matter volumes as well as regional cortical thickness and total intracranial volume. Regional cortical brain volumes were normalized by total intracranial volume. We categorized heading into quartiles and concussion as 0, 1 or 2 or more. Generalized linear regressions were used to test the association of heading or concussion with each brain morphometry metric, including age and sex, as covariates. Neither heading nor concussion were associated with reduced brain volume or cortical thickness. We observed that greater heading was associated with greater gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal area, which may reflect effects related to training."
https://openalex.org/W3048928626,"Background As the country with the largest aging population, China faces an enormous challenge with its elderly support and care. One of the proposed solutions is the development of volunteerism for elderly care. The Senior Care Volunteers Training Program (SCVTP) was initiated by the Red Cross Society of China with the purpose of training volunteers to care for community seniors. As one of the four pilot provinces, Jiangsu Province launched the program since 2017. Aims The present study was conducted to investigate the dropout rate of trained volunteer group leaders, the characteristics of the retained trained volunteer group leaders and the activities that their groups conducted. Additionally, the exploration of the factors influencing the SCVTP’s performance was listed as another aim. Methods A cross-sectional study was designed. The study used purposive sampling to select participants who meet the criteria from all the trained volunteer group leaders (n = 623). Demographic questionnaire, volunteer role identity (VRI) scale, attitude toward helping others (AHO) scale, team climate and atmosphere (TCA) scale, and volunteer program performance evaluation (VPPE) questionnaire were used to collect the data online. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the dropout rate and general characteristics of the retained volunteers and the activities. A multiple linear regression equation was developed to study the factors that influence program performance. Results In total, 307 questionnaires were valid in the study. About 67.9%, 53.7%, and 30.0% of the trained volunteer group leaders dropped out of the program in the year of 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The retained trained volunteer group leaders were more likely to be females (84.7%), those in excellent health (75.2%) and with a bachelor’s degree or above (87.6%). Less attention has been paid to frailty care (n = 76) than other volunteer caring activities (e.g., safe care: n = 277, diet care: n = 250, drug management care: n = 226). VRI (β = 0.118, p = 0.017), AHO (β = 0.134, p = 0.021), TCA (β = 0.459, p<0.001), and financial sustainability (β = 0.179, p<0.001) affected the SCVTP’s performance significantly (adjusted R2 = 0.356). Conclusion High rate of trained volunteer group leaders’ dropout should be brought to the policymaker’s attention. The characteristics of the retained trained volunteer group leaders provide a useful reference for the recruitment of trainees in the future. Frailty care may need more training by the volunteer service provider. In order to enhance program performance, a better team climate and atmosphere, financial sustainability, and volunteers with appropriate attitude and role identity are also necessary for the volunteer program."

Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) has anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects with oxidative stress. There is little understanding of H2 S signaling in developing airways. We hypothesized that the endogenous H2 S system is detrimentally influenced by O2 and conversely H2 S signaling pathways can be leveraged to attenuate deleterious effects of O2 . Using human fetal airway smooth muscle (fASM) cells, we investigated baseline expression of endogenous H2 S machinery, and effects of exogenous H2 S donors NaHS and GYY4137 in the context of moderate hyperoxia, with intracellular calcium regulation as a readout of contractility. Biochemical pathways for endogenous H2 S generation and catabolism are present in fASM, and are differentially sensitive to O2 toward overall reduction in H2 S levels. H2 S donors have downstream effects of reducing [Ca2+ ]i responses to bronchoconstrictor agonist via blunted plasma membrane Ca2+ influx: effects blocked by O2 . However, such detrimental O2 effects are targetable by exogenous H2 S donors such as NaHS and GYY4137.

To better predict these behaviors, we introduce the concept of job crafting self-efficacy (JCSE) and define it as an individual's beliefs about their capability to modify the demands and resources of their job to better fit their needs. This article describes the development and validation of a scale to measure JCSE. We conducted a qualitative study to design and four quantitative studies to test the psychometric properties of this scale among Polish and American employees in both paper-and-pencil and online versions. Three independent (N1 = 364; N2 = 432; N3 = 403) confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated a good fit to a 3-factor solution comprising JCSE beliefs about increasing (a) structural job resources, (b) social job resources, and (c) challenging job demands. The 9-item JCSE Scale had good internal consistency, high time stability, and good validity. It correlated positively with general self-efficacy. JCSE explained unique variance in job crafting behaviors over and above general self-efficacy, and was more important in predicting job crafting than contextual factors. We demonstrate the role of social cognitions in shaping job redesign behaviors and provide a useful tool to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions dedicated to empowering JCSE."

These complications, as well as the hyperinflammatory state of SCD, could affect serum albumin. Serum albumin has key roles in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic pathways and maintains vascular integrity. In SCD, these pathways modulate disease severity and clinical outcomes. We used three independent SCD adult cohorts to assess clinical predictors of serum albumin as well its association with mortality. In 2553 SCD adult participants, the frequency of low (<35 g/L) serum albumin was 5%. Older age and lower hemoglobin (P <0.001) were associated with lower serum albumin in all three cohorts. In age and hemoglobin adjusted analysis, higher liver enzymes (P <0.05) were associated with lower serum albumin. In two of the three cohorts, lower kidney function as measured by Glomerular Filtration Rate (P<0.001) was associated with lower serum albumin. Lower serum albumin predicted higher risk of tricuspid regurgitation velocity ≥ 2.5 m/s (OR = 1.1 per g/L, P ≤0.01). In all three cohorts, patients with low serum albumin had higher mortality (adjusted HR ≥2.9, P ≤0.003). This study confirms the role of serum albumin as a biomarker of disease severity and prognosis in patients with SCD. Albumin as a biomarker and possible mediator of SCD severity should be studied further."
https://openalex.org/W3048778307,"Resettlement, as a major imperial policy in the Inca empire, appears to have been a widespread mechanism for labor mobilization and the dismantling of rebellions. While multiple ethnohistorical references exist regarding resettlement in the central Andes, the extent of this policy in the imperial provinces is still unknown, especially in cases of economic intensification that might have required more labor force. The δ18O isotope is a good proxy for human mobility when comparing the childhood isotopic signature in the teeth enamel and the local water signature at the place of death. If applied to the study of an archaeological sequence, we can observe the expansion or reduction of a population's displacement within a territory, if they received foreigners, and in general, how their social interaction and networks changed over time. In a marginal provincial setting of the Inca empire, such as Copiapó valley in Chile, the study of δ18O isotope can enable us to observe if the alleged economic intensification in metallurgical production implied the massive arrival of foreign populations. Significantly, the Late Horizon does not evidence a great change in terms of mobility, compared to previous periods in Copiapó valley. Thus, the isotopic evidence can more clearly illuminate the social and political dynamics of an imperial provincial setting, where economic activities demanded by the Inca state were mainly carried out by the local labor force."

Despite the cross-linking effects of formalin, its impact on nucleic acid quality and concentration, amplification, and sequencing are not well described. While fresh-frozen tissue is optimal for working with nucleic acids, FFPE samples have been shown to be conducive for molecular studies. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is one technology which allows for collection of specific regions or cell populations from fresh or preserved specimens with pathological alterations, pathogens, or parasites. In this study, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) liver was preserved in three different fixatives, including 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), Z-Fix® (ZF), and PAXgene® (PG) for four time periods (24 hr, 48 hr, seven days, and 14 days). Controls consisted of pieces of liver preserved in RNALater® or 95% ethanol. Smallmouth bass were chosen as they are an economically important sportfish and have been utilized as indicators of exposure to endocrine disruptors and other environmental stressors. Small liver sections were cut out with laser microdissection and DNA and RNA were purified and analyzed for nucleic acid concentration and quality. Sanger sequencing and the NanoString nCounter® technology were used to assess the suitability of these samples in downstream molecular techniques. The results revealed that of the formalin fixatives, NBF samples fixed for 24 and 48 hr were superior to ZF samples for both Sanger sequencing and the Nanostring nCounter®. The non-formalin PAXgene® samples were equally successful and they showed greater stability in nucleic acid quality and concentration over longer fixation times. This study demonstrated that small quantities of preserved tissue from smallmouth bass can be utilized in downstream molecular techniques; however, future studies will need to optimize the methods presented here for different tissue types, fish species, and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3048469994,"This study aimed to explore the profiles of emotion regulation strategies among unemployed people, and to examine the association of latent profiles with demographics and psychiatric symptoms. The study included 136 men (42.8%) and 182 women (57.2%). The average age of the participants was 35.84 years (SD = 26.83). Latent profile analysis was used to determine emotion regulation strategy profiles. Associated factors of profile membership were identified with multinomial logistic regression. The four-profile model (low adaptive emotion regulation class, low negative emotion regulation/moderate positive regulation class, high negative emotion regulation/support-seeking class, adaptive emotion regulation class) was selected as the best solution. As a result of examining the probability of being classified into each class according to emotional difficulties, the lower the level of anxiety and somatization, the higher the probability of belonging to the class 2 adaptive emotion regulation class (n = 56, 18%). The higher the depression, the higher the probability of being classified into class 4 (n = 65, 20%) using a lot of negative emotion regulation strategies. The results of this study indicate that unemployed people can be classified into various subgroups according to their emotion regulation strategies. Also, the probability of being classified into each subgroup was different based on the types of emotional difficulties such as depression, anxiety, and somatization. Through the results of this study, it is possible to understand the relationship between the psychiatric symptoms of unemployed people and emotion regulation strategies and to suggest methods for promoting effective emotion regulation strategies among this population group."
https://openalex.org/W3048491978,"Background Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been used as a safe alternative treatment for refractory musculoskeletal diseases, such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy and gluteal tendinopathy, and various forms of fibromatosis including palmar or penile fibromatosis. However, there is limited published data for clinical and sonographic features of plantar fibromatosis after ESWT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcome of ESWT in ultrasonography-confirmed plantar fibromatosis and ultrasonographic changes of plantar fibroma after ESWT. Methods Medical charts of 26 patients (30 feet) with plantar fibromatosis confirmed by ultrasonography were reviewed. Finally, a total of 10 feet who underwent ESWT for “Poor” or “Fair” grade of Roles-Maudsley Score (RMS) and symptoms persisted for >6 months were included in this study. Short-term follow-up was conducted one week after ESWT and long-term follow-up time averaged 34.0 months. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and RMS were collected for the evaluation of clinical features. Follow-up ultrasonography was conducted at long-term follow-up and changes of plantar fibroma was assessed. A greater than 50% reduction in the NRS and achievement of a “good” or “excellent” grade in the RMS were regarded as treatment success. Additionally, medical charts of 144 patients (168 feet) with plantar fasciitis confirmed by ultrasonography were reviewed and subsequently, 42 feet who underwent ESWT with the same protocol were included for the comparison of clinical features. Results In plantar fibromatosis, baseline NRS (6.2 ± 1.3) and RMS (3.5 ± 0.5) were significantly improved at short-term follow-up (NRS, 1.8 ± 1.0; RMS, 2.0 ± 0.8, P < .001, respectively) and long-term follow-up (NRS, 0.6 ± 1.1; RMS, 1.4 ± 0.8, P < .001, respectively). Treatment success was recorded in seven feet (70.0%) at short-term follow-up and 8 feet (80%) at long-term follow-up, which is comparable to that of the plantar fasciitis group (28 feet, 66.7%; 35 feet, 83.3%, respectively). In long-term follow-up ultrasonography, mean fibroma thickness was reduced from 4.4±1.0 to 2.6±0.8 mm (P = .003); however, length and width were not significantly changed. There were no serious adverse effects. Conclusion While these are preliminary findings, and must be confirmed in a randomized placebo control study, ESWT can have a beneficial long-term effect on pain relief and functional outcomes in painful plantar fibromatosis. However, ESWT is unlikely to affect the ultrasonographic morphology of plantar fibroma, with the exception of reducing the thickness. Level of evidence Level III, retrospective cohort study."
https://openalex.org/W3048839875,"Objectives Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) has gained interest as an intervention to reduce spasticity and pain, and improve quality of life and mobility in children with cerebral palsy mainly affecting the legs (diplegia). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of SDR in England. Methods Cost-effectiveness was quantified with respect to Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) and the pain dimension of the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life questionnaire for Children (CPQOL-Child). Data on outcomes following SDR over two years were drawn from a national evaluation in England which included 137 children, mean age 6.6 years at surgery. The incremental impact of SDR on GMFM-66 was determined through comparison with data from a historic Canadian cohort not undergoing SDR. Another single centre provided data on hospital care over ten years for 15 children undergoing SDR at a mean age of 7.0 years, and a comparable cohort managed without SDR. The incremental impact of SDR on pain was determined using a before and after comparison using data from the national evaluation. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. Incremental costs of SDR were determined as the difference in costs over 5 years for the patients undergoing SDR and those managed without SDR. Uncertainty was quantified using bootstrapping and reported as the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Results In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for SDR are £1,382 and £903 with respect to a unit improvement in GMFM-66 and the pain dimension of CPQOL-Child, respectively. Inclusion of data to 10 years indicates SDR is cheaper than management without SDR. Incremental costs and ICERs for SDR rose in sensitivity analysis applying an alternative regression model to cost data. Conclusions Data on outcomes from a large observational study of SDR and long-term cost data on children who did and did not receive SDR indicates SDR is cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W3048620390,"The deformation law for axisymmetric deformation during the drawing of a core filled tube (CORFT) has been studied. However, the results of such studies could not be used in the flat rolling process of the CORFT, which is a plan deformation condition. In this paper, the inner core material and outer steel tube were successively analyzed based on the slab method during the flat rolling process (plan deformation) of the CORFT, and equations for wall thickness, core density, and roll force have been developed. The theoretical results solved by the developed equations were compared with the experimental results, revealing adequate accuracy for engineering requirements. The influences of rolling parameters on the roll force and the ultimate value of the relative density of the core material were studied, and the limiting condition for a larger roll force or higher value for relative density was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W3048968764,"When voluntarily describing their past or future, older adults typically show a reduction in episodic specificity (e.g., including fewer details reflecting a specific event, time and/or place). However, aging has less impact on other types of tasks that place minimal demands on strategic retrieval such as spontaneous thoughts. In the current study, we investigated age-related differences in the episodic specificity of spontaneous thoughts using experimenter-based coding of thought descriptions. Additionally, we tested whether an episodic specificity induction, which increases episodic detail during deliberate retrieval of events in young and older adults, has the same effect under spontaneous retrieval. Twenty-four younger and 24 healthy older adults performed two counterbalanced sessions including a video, the episodic specificity or control induction, and a vigilance task. In the episodic specificity induction, participants recalled the details of the video while in the control they solved math exercises. The impact of this manipulation on the episodic specificity of spontaneous thoughts was assessed in the subsequent vigilance task, in which participants were randomly stopped to describe their thoughts and classify them as deliberate/spontaneous. We found no differences in episodic specificity between age groups in spontaneous thoughts, supporting the prediction that automatic retrieval attenuates the episodic specificity decrease in aging. The lack of age differences was present regardless of the induction, showing no interactions. For the induction, we also found no main effect, indicating that automatic retrieval bypasses event construction and accesses pre-stored events. Overall, our evidence suggests that spontaneous retrieval is a promising strategy to support episodic specificity in aging."
https://openalex.org/W3048817870,"Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) function in the response of insects to abiotic stress; however, their role in response to biotic stress has been under-investigated. Mythimna separata, the oriental armyworm, is polyphenetic and exhibits gregarious and solitary phases in response to high and low population density, respectively. In this study, three genes were identified encoding sHsps, namely MsHsp19.7, MsHsp19.8 and MsHsp21.4, and expression levels in solitary and gregarious M. separata were compared. The deduced protein sequences of the three MsHsps had molecular weights of 19.7, 19.8 and 21.4 kDa, respectively, and contained a conserved α-crystalline domain. Real-time PCR analyses revealed that the three sHsps were transcribed in all developmental stages and were dramatically up-regulated at the 6th larval stage in gregarious individuals. Expression of the three MsHsps was variable in different tissues of 6th instar larvae, but exhibited consistent up- and down-regulation in the hindgut and Malpighian tubules of gregarious individuals, respectively. In addition, MsHsp19.7 and MsHsp19.8 were significantly induced when solitary forms were subjected to crowding for 36 h, but all three MsHsps were down-regulated when gregarious forms were isolated. Our findings suggest that population density functions as a stress factor and impacts MsHsps expression in M. separata."
