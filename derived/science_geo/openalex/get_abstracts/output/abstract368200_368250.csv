https://openalex.org/W2116054786,"Persistent DNA damage activation and oncogene-induced senescence stimulate secretion of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which is mediated by the damage-response pathway including ATM, NBS1 and CHK2. Tumours with an activated DNA damage response show elevated IL-6 and invasiveness. Cellular senescence suppresses cancer by stably arresting the proliferation of damaged cells1. Paradoxically, senescent cells also secrete factors that alter tissue microenvironments2. The pathways regulating this secretion are unknown. We show that damaged human cells develop persistent chromatin lesions bearing hallmarks of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which initiate increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Cytokine secretion occurred only after establishment of persistent DNA damage signalling, usually associated with senescence, not after transient DNA damage responses (DDRs). Initiation and maintenance of this cytokine response required the DDR proteins ATM, NBS1 and CHK2, but not the cell-cycle arrest enforcers p53 and pRb. ATM was also essential for IL-6 secretion during oncogene-induced senescence and by damaged cells that bypass senescence. Furthermore, DDR activity and IL-6 were elevated in human cancers, and ATM-depletion suppressed the ability of senescent cells to stimulate IL-6-dependent cancer cell invasiveness. Thus, in addition to orchestrating cell-cycle checkpoints and DNA repair, a new and important role of the DDR is to allow damaged cells to communicate their compromised state to the surrounding tissue."

The telomeric repeats are maintained by telomerase, which solves the end replication problem. We report that the TTAGGG repeat arrays of mammalian telomeres pose a challenge to the DNA replication machinery, giving rise to replication-dependent defects that resemble those of aphidicolin-induced common fragile sites. Gene deletion experiments showed that efficient duplication of telomeres requires the shelterin component TRF1. Without TRF1, telomeres activate the ATR kinase in S phase and show a fragile-site phenotype in metaphase. Single-molecule analysis of replicating telomeres showed that TRF1 promotes efficient replication of TTAGGG repeats and prevents fork stalling. Two helicases implicated in the removal of G4 DNA structures, BLM and RTEL1, were required to repress the fragile-telomere phenotype. These results identify a second telomere replication problem that is solved by the shelterin component TRF1."
https://openalex.org/W1989804575,"Most inducible transcriptional programs consist of primary and secondary response genes (PRGs and SRGs) that differ in their kinetics of expression and in their requirements for new protein synthesis and chromatin remodeling. Here we show that many PRGs, in contrast to SRGs, have preassembled RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and positive histone modifications at their promoters in the basal state. Pol II at PRGs generates low levels of full-length unspliced transcripts but fails to make mature, protein-coding transcripts in the absence of stimulation. Induction of PRGs is controlled at the level of transcriptional elongation and mRNA processing, through the signal-dependent recruitment of P-TEFb. P-TEFb is in turn recruited by the bromodomain-containing protein Brd4, which detects H4K5/8/12Ac inducibly acquired at PRG promoters. Our findings suggest that the permissive structure of PRGs both stipulates their unique regulation in the basal state by corepressor complexes and enables their rapid induction in multiple cell types."

The transcriptional repressor SNAIL1 and the downstream effector of TGF-β SMAD3/4 cooperate to repress gene expression during TGF-β-mediated EMT. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is essential for organogenesis and is triggered during carcinoma progression to an invasive state1. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) cooperates with signalling pathways, such as Ras and Wnt, to induce EMT2,3,4,5, but the molecular mechanisms are not clear. Here, we report that SMAD3 and SMAD4 interact and form a complex with SNAIL1, a transcriptional repressor and promoter of EMT6,7. The SNAIL1–SMAD3/4 complex was targeted to the gene promoters of CAR, a tight-junction protein, and E-cadherin during TGF-β-driven EMT in breast epithelial cells. SNAIL1 and SMAD3/4 acted as co-repressors of CAR, occludin, claudin-3 and E-cadherin promoters in transfected cells. Conversely, co-silencing of SNAIL1 and SMAD4 by siRNA inhibited repression of CAR and occludin during EMT. Moreover, loss of CAR and E-cadherin correlated with nuclear co-expression of SNAIL1 and SMAD3/4 in a mouse model of breast carcinoma and at the invasive fronts of human breast cancer. We propose that activation of a SNAIL1–SMAD3/4 transcriptional complex represents a mechanism of gene repression during EMT."
https://openalex.org/W2089430148,"We describe a broad mechanistic framework for the transcriptional induction of mammalian primary response genes by Toll-like receptors and other stimuli. One major class of primary response genes is characterized by CpG-island promoters, which facilitate promiscuous induction from constitutively active chromatin without a requirement for SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complexes. The low nucleosome occupancy at promoters in this class can be attributed to the assembly of CpG islands into unstable nucleosomes, which may lead to SWI/SNF independence. Another major class consists of non-CpG-island promoters that assemble into stable nucleosomes, resulting in SWI/SNF dependence and a requirement for transcription factors that promote selective nucleosome remodeling. Some stimuli, including serum and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, exhibit a strong bias toward activation of SWI/SNF-independent CpG-island genes. In contrast, interferon-beta is strongly biased toward SWI/SNF-dependent non-CpG-island genes. By activating a diverse set of transcription factors, Toll-like receptors induce both classes and others for an optimal response to microbial pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2062403533,"The transcriptional control of CNS myelin gene expression is poorly understood. Here we identify gene model 98, which we have named myelin gene regulatory factor (MRF), as a transcriptional regulator required for CNS myelination. Within the CNS, MRF is specifically expressed by postmitotic oligodendrocytes. MRF is a nuclear protein containing an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain homologous to a yeast transcription factor. Knockdown of MRF in oligodendrocytes by RNA interference prevents expression of most CNS myelin genes; conversely, overexpression of MRF within cultured oligodendrocyte progenitors or the chick spinal cord promotes expression of myelin genes. In mice lacking MRF within the oligodendrocyte lineage, premyelinating oligodendrocytes are generated but display severe deficits in myelin gene expression and fail to myelinate. These mice display severe neurological abnormalities and die because of seizures during the third postnatal week. These findings establish MRF as a critical transcriptional regulator essential for oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination.

These findings establish MRF as a critical transcriptional regulator essential for oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination. Myelination in vertebrates has evolved to insulate axons and promote rapid propagation of action potentials. Within the CNS, this function is carried out by oligodendrocytes (OLs). Developmentally, committed OL progenitor cells (OPCs) arise from stereotyped germinal regions of the CNS, proliferate, and migrate throughout the CNS before differentiating into postmitotic premyelinating OLs. These premyelinating OLs subsequently either upregulate myelin genes and ensheath adjacent axons or undergo apoptosis. Several transcription factors are required for the specification of OPCs or their subsequent differentiation into postmitotic OLs, such as Nkx2.2, Sox10, and the bHLH proteins Olig1/2.

More recently Yin Yang1 (YY1) has also been demonstrated to play an important role in oligodendrocyte differentiation (He et al., 2007He Y. Dupree J. Wang J. Sandoval J. Li J. Liu H. Shi Y. Nave K.A. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. The transcription factor Yin Yang 1 is essential for oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation.Neuron. 2007; 55: 217-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Few transcription factors function specifically at the postmitotic stage of the OL lineage, and those that do (e.g., Nkx6.2) (Southwood et al., 2004Southwood C. He C. Garbern J. Kamholz J. Arroyo E. Gow A. CNS myelin paranodes require Nkx6–2 homeoprotein transcriptional activity for normal structure.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11215-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), do not appear to be necessary for most aspects of myelination. It is thus unclear whether the known oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factors play a dual role in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, or instead are required only for oligodendrocyte differentiation, with other yet-to-be-identified transcription factors playing essential roles in inducing myelin gene expression and the transition to a myelinating OL. This situation contrasts with that of PNS myelination, where the transcription factor Krox-20 (expressed in myelinating Schwann cells) is both sufficient and necessary to induce myelin gene expression and myelination in these cells (Nagarajan et al., 2001Nagarajan R. Svaren J. Le N. Araki T. Watson M. Milbrandt J.

Schneider-Maunoury S. Levi G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Chennoufi A.B. Seitanidou T. Babinet C. Charnay P. Krox-20 controls myelination in the peripheral nervous system.Nature. 1994; 371: 796-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). As such, the nature of transcriptional control of the final stages of OL maturation including myelin gene expression remains unclear. In a recent study, we determined the transcriptomes of acutely isolated astrocytes, neurons, and OLs from the postnatal mouse forebrain (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B. Kaushal A. Foo L.C. Zamanian J.L. Christopherson K.S. Xing Y. Lubischer J.L. Krieg P.A. Krupenko S.A. et al.A transcriptome database for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes: a new resource for understanding brain development and function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). We identified gene model 98 as a gene expressed within the CNS only by postmitotic OLs. Here, we demonstrate that gene model 98, which we have named myelin gene regulatory factor (MRF), is necessary for the generation of mature myelin-gene-expressing OLs within the CNS. RNAi-mediated knockdown of MRF in cultured OPCs does not affect their exit from the cell cycle and downregulation of OPC markers, but markedly reduces the expression of the majority of myelin genes. Conversely, overexpression of MRF within cultured OPCs is sufficient to induce myelin gene expression, and it can promote myelin gene expression in the developing chick spinal cord. Moreover, we show that mice in which MRF function is disrupted within the OL lineage show severe dysmyelination. Although premyelinating OLs are generated in these mice, these premyelinating OLs fail to upregulate myelin gene expression and ensheath axons, and instead undergo apoptosis. These results establish MRF as a transcriptional regulator vital for the generation of myelinating OLs, with an analogous role in the CNS to that of Krox-20 in the PNS. We used an immunopanning/FACS cell purification approach combined with gene profiling in order to identify cell-type-specific genes within the mouse CNS (Cahoy et al., 2008Cahoy J.D. Emery B. Kaushal A. Foo L.C. Zamanian J.L. Christopherson K.S. Xing Y. Lubischer J.L. Krieg P.A. Krupenko S.A. et al.A transcriptome database for astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes: a new resource for understanding brain development and function.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). Among the genes displaying OL-specific expression was gene model 98. The Affymetrix probe set for this gene was absent in samples derived from astrocytes and neurons, present at very low levels in OPCs, but upregulated in newly differentiated (GC+, MOG−) and mature (MOG+) OLs (Figure 1A). Northern blotting confirmed that MRF was present in brain and OL samples as a ∼5.5 kb transcript, consistent with database predictions (Figure 1B). In situ hybridization showed that MRF displayed the same distribution as the established OL marker PLP, with expression largely confined to white matter tracts within the CNS (Figure 1C). The expression of MRF by myelinating cells was CNS specific, with no expression detected in the PNS (Figure S1 available online). Sequencing of cDNA derived from cultured mouse OLs predicted a protein of 1139 amino acids, with an overall identity of 88.6% to the human gene C11Orf9 (Figure S2). The protein contained a predicted DNA binding region homologous to the yeast transcription factor Ndt80 (Montano et al., 2002Montano S.P. Cote M.L. Fingerman I. Pierce M. Vershon A.K. Georgiadis M.M. Crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain from Ndt80, a transcriptional activator required for meiosis in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); within this region, MRF and C11Orf9 shared 100% sequence identity (Figure 1D). C11Orf9 has been postulated to be a transmembrane protein based on the presence of hydrophobic regions in the C-terminal region (Stohr et al., 2000Stohr H. Marquardt A. White K. Weber B.H. cDNA cloning and genomic structure of a novel gene (C11orf9) localized to chromosome 11q12→q13.1 which encodes a highly conserved, potential membrane-associated protein.Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 88: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In order to assess the subcellular localization of MRF, we expressed a myc-tagged version of the protein and probed with anti-myc; the fusion protein had a nuclear localization when expressed in both HEK cells (Figure 1E) and cultured OLs (data not shown). These data provide evidence that MRF is a nuclear protein displaying OL-specific expression within the CNS. In order to assess whether MRF displayed a developmental expression profile consistent with a role in myelination, we performed in situ hybridization on brain sections of mice at postnatal days 3 to 21. At P3, the expression of MRF was restricted to cells in the hindbrain and cerebellum, subsequently spreading rostrally throughout the white matter tracks over the first 2 weeks postnatal, mirroring the expression of PLP (Figure 1F). Dual fluorescent in situ hybridization for MRF and PLP revealed that within the cerebellum at early ages (P3 and P7), many MRF+ cells were either PLP− or only weakly PLP+ (arrowheads, Figure 1G). At later ages (P14 and P21), however, the two genes showed near 100% colocalization. This suggests that the expression of MRF may slightly precede that of myelin genes such as PLP within differentiating oligodendrocytes. Similarly, northern blots revealed that MRF transcript was absent in the P1 brain but steadily increased from P3 to P14, peaking in expression before PLP transcript (Figure S1). Within the embryonic spinal cord, a few MRF+ cells were detected by E17, in a pattern similar to PLP and MBP (Figure S1). These results confirmed that MRF has an expression pattern consistent with a potential role in myelination. To establish whether MRF may have a role in OL differentiation or myelin gene expression, we transfected cultured mouse OPCs with control nontargeting siRNA pool (siCont) or pooled siRNAs against MRF (siMRF). Knockdown of MRF was confirmed by northern blot and RT-PCR (Figure 2E and data not shown). siMRF-transfected OPCs displayed no obvious deficiencies when cultured in the presence of PDGF, which promotes the growth of progenitor cells (data not shown). When transfected OPCs were instead plated into media lacking PDGF and with T3 to induce their differentiation into OLs (Dugas et al., 2006Dugas J.C. Tai Y.C. Speed T.P. Ngai J. Barres B.A. Functional genomic analysis of oligodendrocyte differentiation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10967-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the siMRF-transfected cells showed both delayed and reduced levels of MBP expression relative to siCont-transfected cells and failed to express MOG even after 4 days of differentiation, by which time the majority of siCont-transfected cells expressed MOG (Figures 2A–2D). This failure of siMRF-transfected cells to express MBP and MOG was not due to a failure of differentiation per se or a diversion to an astrocyte fate; the siMRF-transfected cells still downregulated the OPC marker NG2, did not express the astrocyte marker GFAP, were positive for the OL marker GalC, and took on the multipolar morphology characteristic of OLs, albeit with far less extensive membrane sheets than siCont-transfected cells (Figure S3C). This effect was unlikely to be mediated by off-target siRNA effects, because it was observed with 2 of 4 independent nonoverlapping siRNA constructs targeting MRF (Figure S3E). Interestingly, after 2 days of differentiation, the MRF knockdown resulted in an increased apoptosis relative to siCont-transfected cells (Figure S3). Although mouse OLs have a limited viability in culture after differentiation with few cells surviving more than a week, the rate of apoptosis was accelerated in cells transfected with siMRF compared to siCont. Furthermore, siMRF-transfected cells showed decreased expression of other myelin genes CNP and PLP (Figure 2D). To further characterize the changes in gene expression resulting from inhibition of MRF expression, we performed GeneChip analysis between OL cultures differentiated for 2 days after transfection with siCont or siMRF and OPC cultures that served as a measure of baseline gene expression prior to differentiation. The GeneChip analysis confirmed that upon differentiation both siCont- and siMRF-transfected cultures completely downregulated OPC markers (e.g., NG2, PDGFRα, and Ki67) (Figure 2F). In addition, siMRF-transfected cultures failed to induce most myelin genes, with the expression of late phase genes such as MAG and MOBP being entirely blocked (the 50 most repressed genes by siMRF are listed in Table S1) relative to the siCont cultures. Most early OL genes such as MBP and PLP were also inhibited, though to a lesser extent, and pan-OL lineage genes such as Sox10, Olig1, and Olig2 were unaffected by the MRF knockdown (Figure 2G). Interestingly, when the genes repressed 4-fold or more by the MRF knockdown were compared to the genes induced during OL differentiation (between OPC and siCont samples), the majority of genes dependent on MRF expression were genes usually induced specifically in OLs during their differentiation (104 of 128 probe sets). MRF-regulated genes represented only a subset of genes that are normally induced during OL differentiation (104 of 793 probe sets), whereas the expression of other OL-specific genes such as Cldn11/OSP or cell cycle regulators was largely unaffected (Figure 2H). These findings indicate that MRF is required for the induction of most CNS myelin genes and many, albeit not all, OL-specific genes involved in oligodendrocyte maturation. We next asked whether the expression of MRF was sufficient to induce the expression of myelin genes. We transfected mouse OPCs with a GFP expression plasmid together with either a plasmid encoding MRF or an empty control vector and plated them in media containing PDGF to maintain their growth as OPCs. Cells transfected with the control vector (identified by GFP expression) remained NG2+, MBP/MOG− OPCs (Figure 3A). In contrast, MRF-transfected cells downregulated NG2, upregulated MBP and MOG, and acquired a flattened morphology (Figure S4). This effect was evident by 2 days posttransfection and was more pronounced at 5 days posttransfection, by which time approximately 80% of the MRF-transfected cells expressed MBP and MOG (Figures 3B and 3C). In this assay, the induction of MBP and MOG expression by MRF was considerably more pronounced than that seen with Sox10, a gene that promotes MBP expression and OL differentiation (Li et al., 2007Li H. Lu Y. Smith H.K. Richardson W.D. Olig1 and Sox10 interact synergistically to drive myelin basic protein transcription in oligodendrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14375-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Stolt et al., 2002Stolt C.C. Rehberg S. Ader M. Lommes P. Riethmacher D. Schachner M. Bartsch U. Wegner M. Terminal differentiation of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes depends on the transcription factor Sox10.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To assess whether forced expression of MRF could also induce myelin gene expression in vivo, we electroporated HH stage 12–14 chick spinal cords with either a GFP plasmid or GFP and MRF plasmids and analyzed the embryos 4 days later at HH stage 27–28, prior to the normal differentiation of OLs in the chick spinal cord (Zhou et al., 2001Zhou Q. Choi G. Anderson D.J. The bHLH transcription factor Olig2 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation in collaboration with Nkx2.2.Neuron. 2001; 31: 791-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Immunostaining revealed scattered MBP+ cells on the electroporated side of the spinal cord; such cells were never observed on the nonelectroporated side or in GFP-only electroporated controls (Figures 3D and 3E). Misexpression of MRF in the chick spinal cord induced MBP expression only in a small subset of GFP+ cells (ranging from 0% to 15.9% of GFP+ cells in various animals, median = 1.6%), a phenotype that was different to that seen in cultured mouse OPC, where forced MRF expression induced myelin gene expression in a high percentage of cells. Interestingly, a high percentage (31.7%) of neural-crest-derived cells that were electroporated with MRF (GFP+ and Sox10+ cells outside the spinal cord) ceased to migrate shortly after leaving the dorsal spinal cord and upregulated MBP expression (Figures 3F and 3G). MBP expression in GFP+ neural crest cells was never observed in GFP-only-electroporated embryos. These results suggested that these cells expressed transcription factors that in combination with MRF induced MBP expression. To investigate this possibility, we electroporated Sox10, a neural crest marker, or Sox10 and MRF in chick spinal cord and assayed MBP expression after 4 days. Sox10 electroporation induced a larger number of MBP+ cells compared to MRF electroporation (ranging from 9.3% to 61.9% of GFP+ cells in different animals, median = 14.9%). However, coelectroporation of MRF and Sox10 increased the number of MBP+ cells compared to Sox10 alone (ranging from 20.9% to 65.8% of GFP+ cells in different animals, median = 32.0%), but this difference was not statistically significant because of a high variability in MBP induction between animals. These results indicate that MRF is able to induce myelin gene expression in vivo as well as in cultured OPC cultures, but may cooperate with other transcription factors (e.g., Sox10) to promote myelination in vivo. To assess the role of MRF in mammalian CNS myelination, we generated an MRF allele where exon 8 was flanked by loxP sites (see Figure S5A for a description of the targeting vector). Exon 8 codes part of the predicted DNA binding region of MRF; as such, Cre-mediated excision of exon 8 was predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking the DNA binding region and subsequent C-terminal region of the protein resulting from a frame shift (Figure S5B). Initial experiments overexpressing this predicted postexcision protein in OPCs confirmed that it had no ability to induce myelin gene expression, unlike the full-length protein (data not shown). We crossed the MRF loxP-flanked exon 8 (MRFfl/fl) mice with an Olig2-Cre knockin mouse line (Schuller et al., 2008Schuller U. Heine V.M. Mao J. Kho A.T. Dillon A.K. Han Y.G. Huillard E. Sun T. Ligon A.H.

We confirmed successful deletion of MRF exon 8 by RT-PCR of cDNA samples from spinal cords and cultured OLs from MRF CKOs (Figure S9). MRF conditional knockout (CKO) mice (MRFfl/fl; Olig2wt/cre) were born at Mendelian frequencies and were not overtly distinguishable from control littermates (MRFwt/fl; Olig2wt/cre and MRFfl/fl; Olig2wt/wt) for the first 10 days of life. From P11, however, CKOs developed severe tremors and ataxia (Movie S1), subsequently also developing seizures and dying during the third postnatal week (Figure 4). Immunohistochemical analysis of the brains of CKO mice at P13 (Figure 4A) indicated that NeuN and GFAP staining appeared normal and that the gross CNS cytoarchitecture was not affected. In contrast, there was a severe loss of staining for MBP within the brain, with only occasional MBP+ oligodendrocytes seen within white matter tracts, compared to near-ubiquitous MBP staining in the white matter tracts of control mice. CKO spinal cords also showed a severe loss of MBP immunostaining (Figure 4B), although the spinal roots (myelinated by Schwann cells) still stained intensely for MBP. As with the brains, NeuN and GFAP staining were unaffected by the conditional deletion of MRF. Similarly, ChAT immunostaining indicated that the motor neuron population was intact in CKOs, indicating that disruption of the MRF gene does not directly affect motor neurons (MNs are derived from Olig2+ progenitors and should undergo Olig2-Cre-mediated recombination). At higher magnification, some faintly MBP+ cells with the morphology of premyelinating OLs could be seen in the brains and spinal cords (Figures S6 and S7), suggesting that the early stages of OL differentiation did occur in the absence of MRF expression. We confirmed loss of myelin protein expression in the CKO by western blot of P13 spinal cord lysates, which demonstrated substantially less MBP and CNP expression and a complete loss of MOG expression in CKOs relative to control genotypes (Figure 4C). Astrocyte and neuron proteins (GFAP and neurofilament, respectively) were not affected in the CKO. To confirm a loss of myelin proteins at other stages of development, we harvested brains from CKOs and controls from P7 (at which stage myelination in the brain is just beginning) to P17 (the latest the CKOs could be reliably studied, because of their death). The brains of control mice showed a substantial upregulation of the proteins MBP, CNP, and MOG during this time; at all time points, MBP and MOG were near undetectable in the CKOs (Figure 4D), although some MBP expression was seen at very long exposures (data not shown). Fluoromyelin staining within CNS white matter tracts of CKOs revealed a complete loss of myelination in CKO animals (Figure 4E). In contrast, peripheral nerves were equivalently myelinated in both CKOs and controls as expected, as shown by the fact that Schwann cells express neither MRF nor Olig2. We confirmed the loss of myelination by electron microscopy in the optic nerves of CKOs; whereas control optic nerves were actively myelinating by P13 with 50.7% ± 3.5% of axons having two or more myelin wraps, virtually no myelination was observed in the optic nerves of CKO littermates, and only 0.07 ± 0.07% of axons were ensheathed (p < 0.001, Figures 4F and 4G). Importantly, we saw an equivalent phenotype (tremors, seizures, loss of myelin gene expression/myelination and death in the third postnatal week) when we crossed MRFfl mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase behind the CNP promoter (Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003Lappe-Siefke C. Goebbels S. Gravel M. Nicksch E. Lee J. Braun P.E. Griffiths I.R. Nave K.A. Disruption of Cnp1 uncouples oligodendroglial functions in axonal support and myelination.Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), confirming that the CKO phenotype was not dependent on the Olig2 heterozygous background caused by insertion of the Cre gene (Figure S6). To determine which populations of the OL lineage were affected by the loss of MRF, we assessed the densities of OPCs and OLs in P13 CKO and control littermate optic nerve sections (Figure 5A). We found a ∼45% reduction in the density of Olig2+ nuclei within the optic nerves of CKOs relative to control littermates; this reduction was accounted for by the complete loss of CC1+ cells (a marker of postmitotic OLs) in CKO mice (Figures 5B, 5C, and 5E). In contrast, the density of Olig2+ and PDGFRα+ cells (OPCs) was only modestly reduced (18.7%) in CKOs relative to MRFfl/fl; Olig2wt/wt mice (t test p < 0.05, but not significantly different from MRFwt/fl; Olig2wt/cre controls; Figures 5D and 5E). Therefore, the OPC stage was minimally affected in CKOs, an observation supported also by normal NG2 staining. Similarly, the density of Olig2+ cells negative for both CC1 and PDGFRα (presumably Olig2-expressing astrocytes) was similar between genotypes (Figure 4E). Although MBP staining was nearly absent in the CKO optic nerves, a small number of weakly MBP+ cells were present, suggesting that at least some postmitotic OLs were generated in the CKO mice. The density of these faintly MBP+ cells (35 ± 4 cells/mm2) was only ∼4% of the density of mature OLs in the control mice, and they had the morphology of premyelinating OLs, with thin, nonmyelinating processes aligned with the axons. To assess whether myelin or mature OLs were present in the CKOs at earlier ages, we examined sagittal sections of the P7 CKO and control brains for MBP, CC1, and PDGFRα expression (Figure S7). The density of OPCs was equivalent in control and CKO mice in both areas studied at P7. Control littermates displayed a caudal to rostral gradient of myelination, with substantial MBP expression in the hindbrain and cerebellum and scattered MBP+ cells in the more rostral white matter tracts. In contrast, only scattered faintly MBP+ cells were seen in the CKOs and there was an almost complete absence of MBP or CC1+ cells in the hindbrain (p < 0.01). Control mice displayed a mix of premyelinating MBP+ OLs and myelinating OLs within the corpus callosum at P7 when myelination is proceeding (Figures S7E and S7F). In contrast, only premyelinating MBP+ but no myelinating OLs were observed in the corpus callosum of CKO mice, indicating that the absence of MRF expression caused a block in the transition from a premyelinating OL to a mature, myelinating OL. During development, approximately 50% of the postmitotic OLs generated in the CNS undergo apoptosis (Barres et al., 1992Barres B.A. Hart I.K. Coles H.S. Burne J.F. Voyvodic J.T. Richardson W.D.

Here, we identify BTBD12 as the human ortholog of the budding yeast DNA repair factor Slx4p and D. melanogaster MUS312. Human SLX4 forms a multiprotein complex with the ERCC4(XPF)-ERCC1, MUS81-EME1, and SLX1 endonucleases and also associates with MSH2/MSH3 mismatch repair complex, telomere binding complex TERF2(TRF2)-TERF2IP(RAP1), the protein kinase PLK1 and the uncharacterized protein C20orf94. Depletion of SLX4 causes sensitivity to mitomycin C and camptothecin and reduces the efficiency of DSB repair in vivo. SLX4 complexes cleave 3' flap, 5' flap, and replication fork structures; yet unlike other endonucleases associated with SLX4, the SLX1-SLX4 module promotes symmetrical cleavage of static and migrating Holliday junctions (HJs), identifying SLX1-SLX4 as a HJ resolvase. Thus, SLX4 assembles a modular toolkit for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and is critical for cellular responses to replication fork failure."

We propose that SLX4 acts as a docking platform for multiple structure-specific endonucleases. Maintenance of genome integrity depends on a rich variety of DNA repair and recombination mechanisms, many of which require cleavage of DNA secondary structures by structure-specific endonucleases.

Paradoxically, despite their pivotal contribution to genome maintenance, structure-specific endonucleases constitute a potential source of genome instability. Indeed, cutting DNA opens a window of opportunity for chromosome rearrangements, and it is likely that their action needs to be kept under tight control. In particular, coordination with upstream and downstream events of the repair mechanisms in which they are involved should ensure rapid processing of the appropriate substrate and restoration of the original chromosome structure. Despite their fundamental nature, the mechanisms that control structure-specific endonucleases remain poorly understood. Recent studies carried out in S. cerevisiae on the Slx1-Slx4 complex shed a new light on how this may be achieved in some cases (Flott et al., 2007Flott S. Alabert C. Toh G.W. Toth R. Sugawara N. Campbell D.G. Haber J.E. Pasero P. Rouse J. Phosphorylation of Slx4 by Mec1 and Tel1 regulates the single-strand annealing mode of DNA repair in budding yeast.Mol. Cell.

J. 2005; 391: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Slx1 and Slx4 were identified along with Mus81-Mms4Eme1 in a synthetic lethal screen with mutations that inactivate Sgs1, a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases (Mullen et al., 2001Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Requirement for three novel protein complexes in the absence of the Sgs1 DNA helicase.Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These helicases are thought to have an anti-recombinogenic function that unwinds and dissolves DNA secondary structures (Wu and Hickson, 2006Wu L. Hickson I.D. DNA helicases required for homologous recombination and repair of damaged replication forks.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 279-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Slx1 and Slx4 were subsequently shown to be catalytic and regulatory subunits, respectively, of a 5′ flap endonuclease (Coulon et al., 2004Coulon S. Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R.

Studies in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe revealed that Slx1-Slx4 plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci, which are made of tandem rDNA repeats (Coulon et al., 2004Coulon S. Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Russell P. Slx1-Slx4 are subunits of a structure-specific endonuclease that maintains ribosomal DNA in fission yeast.Mol. Biol.

Slx1-Slx4 was proposed to initiate DNA recombination by collapsing replication forks stalled at natural replication pause sites. Further investigations in budding yeast uncovered Slx1-independent activities of Slx4. The SLX4 gene interacts with genes involved in error-free DNA damage bypass, and Slx4 is required for resistance to DNA alkylation during S phase (Flott et al., 2007Flott S. Alabert C. Toh G.W. Toth R. Sugawara N. Campbell D.G. Haber J.E. Pasero P. Rouse J. Phosphorylation of Slx4 by Mec1 and Tel1 regulates the single-strand annealing mode of DNA repair in budding yeast.Mol. Cell.

SLX4 was also found in genome-wide screens for genes involved in the response to interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agents (Lee et al., 2005Lee W. St Onge R.P. Proctor M. Flaherty P. Jordan M.I. Arkin A.P. Davis R.W. Nislow C. Giaever G.

Another Slx4-binding protein is Rad1, which together with Rad10 forms the budding yeast XPF-ERCC1 ortholog. Slx4 is essential for the removal of 3′ flaps during HR repair by single-strand annealing (SSA) and is proposed to recruit, along with the recently identified Saw1 protein, Rad1-Rad10 to ongoing SSA events (Li et al., 2008Li F. Dong J. Pan X. Oum J.H. Boeke J.D. Lee S.E. Microarray-based genetic screen defines SAW1, a gene required for Rad1/Rad10-dependent processing of recombination intermediates.Mol.

Taken together, these studies suggest that Slx4 coordinates multiple DNA repair and recombination mechanisms in budding yeast. Surprisingly, although the Slx1 and Rad1-Rad10 partners of Slx4 are highly conserved from yeast to man, orthologs of Slx4 outside of the fungal kingdom have not been reported (Coulon et al., 2004Coulon S. Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Russell P. Slx1-Slx4 are subunits of a structure-specific endonuclease that maintains ribosomal DNA in fission yeast.Mol. Biol.

Requirement for three novel protein complexes in the absence of the Sgs1 DNA helicase.Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of the fungal Slx4 proteins show that it has undergone rapid evolutionary divergence. Here we describe the identification of Slx4 orthologs in metazoa and the characterization of the SLX4 family of proteins in eukaryotes. We present a biochemical characterization of the enzymatic function of the human SLX1-SLX4 complex. In addition to 5′ flap endonuclease activity, SLX1-SLX4 has a robust Holliday junction resolvase activity. Our data show that SLX1 and SLX4 repair endogenous DNA lesions and damage caused by the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Furthermore, SLX4 but not SLX1 is required for ICL repair. Finally, we show that SLX4 associates with XPF and MUS81, suggesting that it coordinates the activities of multiple structure-specific endonucleases. Whereas SLX1 is a highly conserved protein from yeast to man, with an N-terminal Uri nuclease domain (Aravind et al., 1999Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Conserved domains in DNA repair proteins and evolution of repair systems.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal PHD finger (Figure 1A), no SLX4 orthologs are known other than in fungi (Coulon et al., 2004Coulon S. Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Russell P. Slx1-Slx4 are subunits of a structure-specific endonuclease that maintains ribosomal DNA in fission yeast.Mol. Biol.

Requirement for three novel protein complexes in the absence of the Sgs1 DNA helicase.Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore undertook a PSI-BLAST search using the conserved C-terminal domain (CCD) of fungal Slx4 proteins. Two potentially relevant and related hits were Drosophila melanogaster MUS312 and vertebrate BTBD12 proteins. MUS312 is a MEI9XPF-binding partner essential for ICL repair and meiotic recombination (Yildiz et al., 2002Yildiz O. Majumder S. Kramer B. Sekelsky J.J. Drosophila MUS312 interacts with the nucleotide excision repair endonuclease MEI-9 to generate meiotic crossovers.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1503-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The first two properties are reminiscent of S. cerevisiae Slx4, suggesting that Slx4 and MUS312 may be orthologs. In support of this idea, we detected a strong yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction between MUS312 and D. melanogaster SLX1 (Figure 1B). This finding prompted a PSI-BLAST search using MUS312, whereby we once again detected similarities to vertebrate BTBD12 proteins. Human BTBD12 was identified in two large-scale screens for ATM/ATR targets (Matsuoka et al., 2007Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J. Bakalarski C.E. Zhao Z.

Chem. 2007; 282: 17330-17334Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) but is otherwise uncharacterized. Vertebrate BTBD12 proteins have large N-terminal extensions that are not found in fungal Slx4 proteins (Figure 1D). In addition to the BTB/POZ protein-protein interaction domain, these extensions have one or several C2HC zinc fingers related to the UBZ4 family of Ub-binding domains (Hofmann, 2009Hofmann K. Ubiquitin-binding domains and their role in the DNA damage response.DNA Repair (Amst). 2009; 8: 544-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). We also detected a conserved motif contained within a region required for the MUS312SLX4-MEI9XPF interaction (Yildiz et al., 2002Yildiz O. Majumder S. Kramer B. Sekelsky J.J. Drosophila MUS312 interacts with the nucleotide excision repair endonuclease MEI-9 to generate meiotic crossovers.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1503-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and we named this region MLR (MUS312/MEI9 interaction-like region) (Figure 1F). Interestingly, this conserved motif is absent in yeasts, although there is some sequence homology within the rest of the MLR between yeasts and metazoa (Figure S1 available online). We found that human BTBD12 has a Y2H interaction with human SLX1 (Figure 2A), suggesting that BTBD12 is indeed the human SLX4 ortholog. Hereafter we refer to BTBD12 as SLX4. Truncation analyses showed that only full-length SLX1 binds specifically to SLX4 (Figure 2A). The CCD of SLX4 is sufficient for its interaction with SLX1, indicating that the function of this domain is conserved throughout evolution (Figure 2B). Having established that human SLX4 and SLX1 interact in Y2H assays, we next investigated whether they exist in a complex in human cells. We found that transiently expressed FLAG-SLX1 coprecipitated with full-length SLX4 or the SLX4-4 N-terminal truncation fused to GFP (Figure 2C) and that SLX1 and SLX4 colocalized in the nucleus (Figure S2). To assess whether the MUS312SLX4-MEI9XPF and Slx4-Rad1XPF interaction is conserved in human cells, we probed for endogenous XPF in the FLAG-SLX1 immunoprecipitates. XPF readily coprecipitated with SLX1-SLX4 but not SLX1-SLX4-4 (Figure 2C), suggesting that XPF associates with the N-terminal domain of SLX4, which contains the MLR region (Figures 1D and 1F), but not with SLX1. ERCC1 also coprecipitated with SLX4 and not SLX4-4, indicating that SLX4 interacts with XPF-ERCC1 (Figure S3). Y2H assays showed that SLX4 interacts with XPF but not ERCC1, whereas neither subunit interacts with SLX1 (Figure 2D). Consistent with the immunoprecipitation results (Figure 2C), XPF did not associate with the SLX4-4 (684–1834) C-terminal fragment. However, it did associate with the SLX4-3 (1–1043) N-terminal fragment, which contains the MLR. Taken together, these data indicate that the SLX4-XPF interaction is direct, conserved from yeast to man, and that XPF binding involves the MLR domain. Yeast Slx1-Slx4 complexes are 5′ flap endonucleases (Coulon et al., 2004Coulon S. Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Russell P.

To assess whether the human complex has this activity, the SLX1-SLX4 eluates described in Figures 2C and S4 were incubated with a model DNA stem loop substrate (SL) (Figure 3A). This substrate allows detection of single-strand (ss) incisions in duplex DNA on the 5′ or 3′ side of a junction with ss DNA, as shown for the 3′ flap endonuclease activity of human XPF-ERCC1 (Sijbers et al., 1996Sijbers A.M. de Laat W.L.

Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Russell P. Slx1-Slx4 are subunits of a structure-specific endonuclease that maintains ribosomal DNA in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3A, human SLX1-SLX4 displayed a 5′ flap endonuclease activity, introducing a nick in the duplex DNA on the strand that runs from a 3′ double-strand (ds) to a 5′ ss configuration. Remarkably, the cutting patterns of human and fission yeast SLX1-SLX4 were essentially identical, occurring within 1 or 2 nucleotides from the ds/ss junction. In contrast, recombinant XPF-ERCC1 introduced cuts on the opposite strand of the junction. Although endogenous XPF and ERCC1 associated with overproduced SLX1-SLX4 (Figure 2C), no cleavage products indicative of XPF-ERCC1 were detected in reactions with immunoprecipitated human SLX1-SLX4 (Figure 3A). The XPF-ERCC1 activity may be overwhelmed by much more SLX1-SLX4 present in these assays (Figure S4). Cation titration experiments with human SLX1-SLX4 showed that Mn2+ is strongly favored over Mg2+, with optimum cutting at 0.5–1 mM Mn2+ (Figure 3B). This contrasted with the S. pombe complex that efficiently processed the SL in 0.5 mM Mn2+, as well as in 0.5–5 mM Mg2+ (Coulon et al., 2004Coulon S. Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Russell P. Slx1-Slx4 are subunits of a structure-specific endonuclease that maintains ribosomal DNA in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To confirm that the endonuclease activity we were monitoring was SLX1 dependent, we engineered two SLX1 mutants where one of two highly conserved charged residues in the nuclease domain, arginine 41 or glutamate 82, was mutated to alanine. The equivalent residues are essential for the nuclease activity of S. pombe Slx1 (Coulon et al., 2004Coulon S. Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Russell P. Slx1-Slx4 are subunits of a structure-specific endonuclease that maintains ribosomal DNA in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both mutations abolished the 5′ flap endonuclease activity of human SLX1-SLX4, confirming that the activity we detected in our FLAG-peptide eluates was SLX1 dependent. D. melanogaster MUS312SLX4 is essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis and was proposed to collaborate with MEI9 to resolve HJs (Yildiz et al., 2002Yildiz O. Majumder S. Kramer B. Sekelsky J.J. Drosophila MUS312 interacts with the nucleotide excision repair endonuclease MEI-9 to generate meiotic crossovers.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1503-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether human SLX1-SLX4 processes HJs in vitro. We used the model substrate X12 capable of spontaneous branch migration within its 12 bp core of homology (Rass and West, 2006Rass U. West S.C. Synthetic junctions as tools to identify and characterize Holliday junction resolvases.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 485-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The reactions shown in Figure 4A were carried out in parallel with the SL substrate reactions in Figure 3C, with identical conditions and amounts of substrate. In contrast to the partial digestion of the SL substrate, X12 was completely processed and converted into linear duplex products. This activity was SLX1 dependent, being abolished by the R41A and E82A mutations in the SLX1 nuclease domain (Figure 4A). Significant X12 processing was observed only when both SLX1 and SLX4 were coproduced in the cell but not with separately produced SLX1 and SLX4 proteins alone or combined (Figure S5). Human SLX1-SLX4 produced symmetric cleavage patterns within the region of homology on opposite strands (Figure 4B). SLX1-SLX4 also converted into linear duplex products a fixed intact or nicked X0 HJ lacking a central core of homology, as well as a model replication fork (RF), albeit less efficiently than the X12 structure (Figure S6). Dual incisions on opposite strands of the nonphysiological fixed X0 showed partial symmetry (Figure S7). We assessed the divalent cation requirements for processing of X12 and RF structures (Figure S8). Whereas SL cleavage was observed only in Mn2+, some X12 and RF processing occurred in Mg2+, but it was significantly less efficient than in Mn2+. Noteworthy, X12 remained a favored substrate in both Mg2+ and Mn2+. This prompted us to test whether Mn2+ may also help S. pombe Slx1-Slx4 to process a HJ into linear duplex products. No significant processing of X12 was seen in Mg2+, in agreement with our previous report (Coulon et al., 2004Coulon S. Gaillard P.H. Chahwan C. McDonald W.H. Yates J.R. Russell P. Slx1-Slx4 are subunits of a structure-specific endonuclease that maintains ribosomal DNA in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observed robust conversion of the HJ into linear duplex products in Mn2+ (Figure S9), suggesting that this is a common feature of SLX1-SLX4 in eukaryotes in general. To further characterize the HJ processing activity of human SLX1-SLX4, we compared its ability to resolve a χ structure with that of the canonical RusA bacterial HJ resolvase (Bolt and Lloyd, 2002Bolt E.L. Lloyd R.G. Substrate specificity of RusA resolvase reveals the DNA structures targeted by RuvAB and RecG in vivo.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This much larger HJ substrate more closely resembles HJs found in vivo with a large 300 bp core of homology and long duplex arms ranging from 0.45 to 2.15 kb. It was previously used to characterize the HJ-resolving activities of bacterial and phage resolvases (Sharples et al., 2004Sharples G.J. Curtis F.A. McGlynn P. Bolt E.L. Holliday junction binding and resolution by the Rap structure-specific endonuclease of phage lambda.J. Mol.

Effect of DNA topology on Holliday junction resolution by Escherichia coli RuvC and bacteriophage T7 endonuclease I.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Resolution of the χ structure yields two pairs of nicked duplex products following dual incisions on strands A and C or B and D (Figure 4C). Like RusA, SLX1-SLX4 efficiently resolved the χ structure into all four duplex products (Figure 4D). A bias toward dual incisions on strands B and D was observed for RusA in agreement with a previous report (Figure 4D) (Sharples et al., 2004Sharples G.J. Curtis F.A. McGlynn P. Bolt E.L. Holliday junction binding and resolution by the Rap structure-specific endonuclease of phage lambda.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, like RuvC (Zerbib et al., 1997Zerbib D. Colloms S.D. Sherratt D.J. West S.C.

Biol. 1997; 270: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), SLX1-SLX4 did not display any bias (Figure 4D). To gain insight into which part of SLX4 contributes to HJ resolution by SLX1, we coproduced C-terminal SLX4 fragments (Figure 2B) with full-length FLAG-SLX1 in HEK cells (Figure S10). Robust HJ resolution was observed even with the shortest C-terminal SLX4-7 fragment consisting of just the CCD domain of SLX4 (Figure 4E). These results indicated that the SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS (SAP) domain, which was proposed to be important in the substrate recognition and tethering of SLX1 to its substrate (Aravind and Koonin, 2000Aravind L.

https://openalex.org/W2133403209,"Negative feedback can serve many different cellular functions, including noise reduction in transcriptional networks and the creation of circadian oscillations. However, only one special type of negative feedback (""integral feedback"") ensures perfect adaptation, where steady-state output is independent of steady-state input. Here we quantitatively measure single-cell dynamics in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae hyperosmotic shock network, which regulates membrane turgor pressure. Importantly, we find that the nuclear enrichment of the MAP kinase Hog1 perfectly adapts to changes in external osmolarity, a feature robust to signaling fidelity and operating with very low noise. By monitoring multiple system quantities (e.g., cell volume, Hog1, glycerol) and using varied input waveforms (e.g., steps and ramps), we assess in a minimally invasive manner the network location of the mechanism responsible for perfect adaptation. We conclude that the system contains only one effective integrating mechanism, which requires Hog1 kinase activity and regulates glycerol synthesis but not leakage."
https://openalex.org/W2088180120,"Why are genes harmful when they are overexpressed? By testing possible causes of overexpression phenotypes in yeast, we identify intrinsic protein disorder as an important determinant of dosage sensitivity. Disordered regions are prone to make promiscuous molecular interactions when their concentration is increased, and we demonstrate that this is the likely cause of pathology when genes are overexpressed. We validate our findings in two animals, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. In mice and humans the same properties are strongly associated with dosage-sensitive oncogenes, such that mass-action-driven molecular interactions may be a frequent cause of cancer. Dosage-sensitive genes are tightly regulated at the transcriptional, RNA, and protein levels, which may serve to prevent harmful increases in protein concentration under physiological conditions. Mass-action-driven interaction promiscuity is a single theoretical framework that can be used to understand, predict, and possibly treat the effects of increased gene expression in evolution and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2071074768,"B cell follicles are specialized microenvironments that support events necessary for humoral immunity. After antigen encounter, activated B cells initially seek T-cell help at the follicle-T-zone boundary and then move to interfollicular and T-zone distal (outer) regions of the follicle. Subsequently, some cells move to the follicle centre, become germinal centre B cells and undergo antibody affinity maturation. Although germinal centres within follicles were described in 1885 (ref. 12), the molecular cues mediating segregation of B cells between the outer and centre follicle have remained undefined. Here we present a role for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, Epstein-Barr virus induced molecule-2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183), in this process. EBI2 is expressed in mature B cells and increases in expression early after activation, before being downregulated in germinal centre B cells. EBI2 deficiency in mice led to a reduction in the early antibody response to a T-dependent antigen. EBI2-deficient B cells failed to move to the outer follicle at day 2 of activation, and instead were found in the follicle centre, whereas EBI2 overexpression was sufficient to promote B cell localization to the outer follicle. In mixed bone marrow chimaeras, EBI2-deficient B cells phenocopied germinal centre B cells in preferentially localizing to the follicle centre. When downregulation of EBI2 in wild-type B cells was antagonized, participation in the germinal centre reaction was impaired. These studies identify an important role for EBI2 in promoting B cell localization in the outer follicle, and show that differential expression of this receptor helps position B cells appropriately for mounting T-dependent antibody responses."

https://openalex.org/W2076623191,"The actin cytoskleteon is essential for endocytosis in budding yeast but it is less significant in mammalian cells. Actin is shown to be required during plasma membrane invagination in yeast endocytosis due to the turgor pressure that is characteristic of yeast cells Key features of clathrin-mediated endocytosis have been conserved across evolution. However, endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is completely dependent on a functional actin cytoskeleton, whereas actin appears to be less critical in mammalian cell endocytosis. We reveal that the fundamental requirement for actin in the early stages of yeast endocytosis is to provide a strong framework to support the force generation needed to direct the invaginating plasma membrane into the cell against turgor pressure. By providing osmotic support, pressure differences across the plasma membrane were removed and this reduced the requirement for actin-bundling proteins in normal endocytosis. Conversely, increased turgor pressure in specific yeast mutants correlated with a decreased rate of endocytic patch invagination."
https://openalex.org/W2033328077,"Centromeres of higher eukaryotes are epigenetically maintained; however, the mechanism that underlies centromere inheritance is unknown. Centromere identity and inheritance require the assembly of nucleosomes containing the CenH3 histone variant in place of canonical H3. Although H3 nucleosomes wrap DNA in a left-handed manner and induce negative supercoils, we show here that CenH3 nucleosomes reconstituted from Drosophila histones induce positive supercoils. Furthermore, we show that CenH3 likewise induces positive supercoils in functional centromeres in vivo, using a budding yeast minichromosome system and temperature-sensitive mutations in kinetochore proteins. The right-handed wrapping of DNA around the histone core implied by positive supercoiling indicates that centromere nucleosomes are unlikely to be octameric and that the exposed surfaces holding the nucleosome together would be available for kinetochore protein recruitment. The mutual incompatibility of nucleosomes with opposite topologies could explain how centromeres are efficiently maintained as unique loci on chromosomes."

Bacterial growth rate is closely coupled to rRNA transcription, which in E. coli is regulated through DksA and (p)ppGpp. The mechanisms of rRNA transcriptional control in mycobacteria, which lack DksA, are undefined. Here we identify CarD as an essential mycobacterial protein that controls rRNA transcription. Loss of CarD is lethal for mycobacteria in culture and during infection of mice. CarD depletion leads to sensitivity to killing by oxidative stress, starvation, and DNA damage, accompanied by failure to reduce rRNA transcription. CarD can functionally replace DksA for stringent control of rRNA transcription, even though CarD associates with a different site on RNA polymerase.

These findings highlight a distinct molecular mechanism for regulating rRNA transcription in mycobacteria that is critical for M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. At least 30% of the world's population is infected with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which in some individuals will reactivate and cause an estimated 1.3 million deaths a year (WHO, 2009WHO. (2009). Global Tuberculosis Control. http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/2009/en/index.html.Google Scholar). This health crisis is exacerbated by the alarming emergence of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant strains. The development of new chemotherapeutic strategies is imperative, which requires insight into the pathways involved in M. tuberculosis infection, persistence, and drug resistance. During infection, mycobacteria and other intracellular bacterial pathogens withstand an arsenal of host-derived mutagens that can result in DNA strand breaks, point mutations, and chromosomal deletions (Boshoff et al., 2003Boshoff H.I.

It has become clear that (p)ppGpp is not the only factor that participates in stringent control. In E. coli, the DksA protein potentiates the effect of (p)ppGpp by directly binding the RNAP (Paul et al., 2004Paul B.J. Barker M.M. Ross W. Schneider D.A. Webb C. Foster J.W. Gourse R.L.

In a ΔdksA strain, rRNA transcription is insensitive to (p)ppGpp accumulation, thus leaving rRNA promoters unresponsive to changes in amino acid availability and growth rate (Paul et al., 2004Paul B.J.

Despite the intricate functional relationship between DksA and (p)ppGpp in E. coli, obvious DksA homologs are absent from most nonproteobacteria, whereas (p)ppGpp synthetases are broadly distributed, possibly indicating that other factors exist to control ribosomal biogenesis in these organisms. In this report, we identify carD as a widely distributed gene induced by DNA damage and starvation whose protein product binds the RNAP to control rRNA transcription in mycobacteria. CarD can complement an E. coli ΔdksA strain, but in contrast to E. coli DksA, CarD is required for mycobacterial viability under all conditions, both in culture and during all stages of mouse infection. Unlike DksA, CarD proteins interact with the N terminus of the RNAP β subunit, a binding site shared by transcription repair coupling factor (TRCF). These data establish CarD proteins as highly conserved and essential components of a previously unrecognized mechanism of stringent control in mycobacteria. To further understand the mycobacterial response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), we undertook a DNA microarray analysis of the transcriptional response of Mycobacterium smegmatis to DSB generated by the homing endonuclease I-SceI. The analysis compared two M. smegmatis strains: mgm181 and mgm182. Both strains are induced by anhydrotetracycline (ATc) treatment to express a hemagluttinin (HA) epitope-tagged I-SceI (Ehrt et al., 2005Ehrt S. Guo X.V. Hickey C.M. Ryou M. Monteleone M. Riley L.W.

One of the most highly upregulated genes in this comparison was previously uncharacterized carD (MSMEG_6077). On average, carD mRNA was upregulated 2.4-fold in bacteria undergoing chromosomal breakage (data not shown). The transcriptional induction of carD after I-SceI-generated DSB was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1A). To determine whether carD upregulation is a generalized response to genotoxins, we treated wild-type M. smegmatis cultures with double-strand DNA-damaging agents bleomycin and Ciprofloxacin, alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate (MMS), and the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We observed that carD transcript increased with all genotoxins tested except high doses of H202, with the most dramatic induction observed with Ciprofloxacin and 10 mM H2O2, which induced carD transcription 8-fold compared to untreated cells (Figure 1B). M. tuberculosis carD (Rv3583c) has also been identified as a transcriptionally upregulated gene in microarray experiments after exposure to the DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C, UV radiation, H2O2, and quinolone DNA gyrase inhibitors (Boshoff et al., 2003Boshoff H.I.

M. smegmatis CarD shares 98.1% and 95.7% identity with the proteins encoded by M. tuberculosis Rv3583c and M. leprae ML0320, respectively. CarD proteins are highly conserved in many eubacteria and are absent from archaebacteria and eukaryotes (Figure 1D; Table S1 available online; Cayuela et al., 2003Cayuela M.L. Elias-Arnanz M.

The only available information comes from work in Myxococcus xanthus and Stigmatella aurantiaca, which each express two related CarD proteins of differing length (Cayuela et al., 2003Cayuela M.L.

The shorter myxobacterial CarD protein is the same length as mycobacterial CarD and contains a conserved leucine zipper motif and N-terminal region of homology to the TRCF RNAP interaction domain (RID) but is otherwise uncharacterized (Figure 1D). The longer M. xanthus CarD protein is necessary for the activation of numerous pathways including starvation-triggered fruiting body formation (Cayuela et al., 2003Cayuela M.L. Elias-Arnanz M.

Similarily, we observed 20-fold induction of M. smegmatis carD transcription during early starvation in PBS (Figure 1C). Together, the microarray and qRT-PCR data demonstrate the upregulation of carD mRNA in response to a broad range of stresses. To further understand the cellular function of CarD, we undertook a genetic approach. Initial attempts to delete carD from the M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis chromosomes were unsuccessful, strongly suggesting that CarD is essential for viability. To confirm essentiality and study CarD further, we constructed strains that allow for conditional depletion of CarD under tetracycline control. CarD expression from the attB site allowed deletion of the endogenous carD gene, thus generating the M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis ΔcarD attb::tetcarD strains (Figures 2A and 2B). To obtain conditional knockdown of M. smegmatis CarD, ΔcarD attB::tetcarD was transformed with an episomal plasmid that directs the synthesis of TetR (Ehrt et al., 2005Ehrt S. Guo X.V. Hickey C.M. Ryou M. Monteleone M. Riley L.W. Schnappinger D. Controlling gene expression in mycobacteria with anhydrotetracycline and Tet repressor.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), a repressor that binds the operator of the tetracycline-regulated promoter in the absence of anhydrotetracycline (ATc), which generated the strain mgm1703. Mgm1703 grows well only in the presence of at least 10.0 ng/ml of ATc, thus confirming that CarD is essential for viability (Figures 2C and 2D). A control strain, mgm1701 survives independent of ATc (Figures 2C and 2D). Survival assays and quantitative RT-PCR after tetracycline withdrawal showed that declining carD transcript levels directly correlated with cell death (Figure 2E). Transformation of M. tuberculosis ΔcarD attb::tetcarD with a plasmid that expresses revTetR (Guo et al., 2007Guo X.V. Monteleone M. Klotzsche M. Kamionka A. Hillen W. Braunstein M. Ehrt S. Schnappinger D. Silencing Mycobacterium smegmatis by using tetracycline repressors.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4614-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), a repressor that binds the operator of the tetracycline-regulated promoter in the presence of ATc, generated the strain mgm1797 and abolished growth in 50 ng/ml ATc (Figure 2F). Mgm1797 also grew slowly in the absence of ATc, and western blot analysis demonstrated that low CarD protein levels in mgm1797 correlated with the slow growth of the strain (Figure 2G). These experiments demonstrate that CarD is essential for growth of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis in culture. Because carD transcription is upregulated during DNA damage and nutrient deprivation, we tested whether CarD was necessary for survival under these conditions. Mgm1703 and mgm1701 cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 into media with or without 50 ng/ml ATc for 13 hr before treating with varying concentrations of H2O2 and bleomycin for 1 hr or 10 μg/ml of Ciprofloxacin for 1 and 2 hr. Thirteen hours of depletion was chosen because at this point carD RNA levels were barely detectable, but 50% of the cells were still alive (Figure 2E). We found that mycobacterial cells lacking CarD were 50,000-fold more sensitive to 10 mM H2O2 and 30 times more sensitive to Ciprofloxacin treatment compared to control cells producing CarD (Figures 3A, 3B, 3D, and 3E). CarD depletion also caused a 10-fold reduction in M. smegmatis survival during starvation (Figure 3F) but had no effect on cell survival during bleomycin treatment (Figure 3C). These data show that M. smegmatis CarD is necessary for survival during oxidative stress, double-strand DNA breaks, and nutrient limitation and defines CarD as a novel mediator of mycobacterial responses to these conditions. The diverse stresses that activate CarD suggest that this protein is involved in a global regulatory response. To explore the transcriptional changes caused by CarD loss, we performed whole-genome transcriptional profiling on M. smegmatis cells depleted of CarD compared to CarD-replete cells. The microarray analysis revealed that during CarD depletion, 193 genes were upregulated >2-fold and 176 genes were downregulated >2-fold (Table S2). The most striking result from this analysis was that 22% of the genes upregulated greater than 2-fold after CarD depletion encoded components of the translation machinery and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. This included entire operons of ribosomal proteins and translation elongation and initiation factors (Figure 4A). qRT-PCR confirmed that CarD depletion leads to an upregulation of 16S rRNA and rpsH ribosomal protein transcripts in M. smegmatis (Figures 2E and 4B) and M. tuberculosis (Figures 2G and 4C). Together, the microarray and qRT-PCR experiments demonstrate that CarD depletion leads to transcriptional upregulation of stable RNAs and other components of the translation machinery. Relaxed bacterial strains are impaired for the stringent response and fail to downregulate rRNA and ribosomal protein transcription during starvation and other stresses (Alfoldi et al., 1962Alfoldi L.

Toxic effects of high levels of ppGpp in Escherichia coli are relieved by rpoB mutations.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2337-2344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CarD depletion in nutrient-rich media causes a transcriptional signature similar to the relaxed phenotype, but CarD also accumulates in response to a wide range of stresses (Figure 1), suggesting that CarD might be involved in stringent control. rRNA levels in wild-type M. smegmatis are repressed during starvation (∼2-fold) and H2O2 (∼4-fold) and Ciprofloxacin (∼1.2-fold) treatment (Figure 4D, green bars), responses that were abolished when CarD was depleted (Figure 4D, red bars). Direct comparison of rRNA levels during CarD depletion to those in control cells under each condition indicates that CarD-depleted cells accumulated 4.5-fold more rRNA than did wild-type cells during starvation, 8.5-fold more during oxidative stress, and 5.5-fold more during Ciprofloxacin treatment (Figure 4E). To confirm that the regulation of rRNA during oxidative and genotoxic stress was related to the same stringent control machinery as nutrient deprivation, we analyzed rRNA levels in an M. smegmatis ΔrelA strain. Loss of RelA, an enzyme responsible for production of (p)ppGpp (Avarbock et al., 1999Avarbock D. Salem J. Li L.S. Wang Z.M. Rubin H.

The stringent response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is required for long-term survival.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4889-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), abolished mycobacterial stringent control of rRNA during starvation, oxidative, and genotoxic stresses, which was reversed by expression of WT RelA (ΔrelA comp) (Figures 4D and 4E). Therefore, the stringent response is necessary for control of rRNA levels in mycobacteria under such conditions and defective during CarD depletion. Unlike CarD depletion, deletion of relA did not increase rRNA levels in untreated cells and did not render M. smegmatis more sensitive to oxidative or genotoxic stress (Figure 4E; Figure S1). These data demonstrate that CarD is necessary for the mycobacterial stringent response to starvation, oxidative, and genotoxic stresses as well as control of rRNA under normal growth conditions. To further delineate the role of CarD in stringent control, we examined the effect of CarD depletion on the accumulation of (p)ppGpp. In untreated cultures, there was no detectable (p)ppGpp in any strain, regardless of CarD levels (Figure 4F). In wild-type cells, starvation and H2O2 both caused dramatic upregulation of (p)ppGpp. In CarD-depleted cells, ppGpp still accumulated, although to a slightly lesser degree. The difference in (p)ppGpp between wild-type and CarD-depleted cells is unlikely to explain the rRNA transcription deregulation observed because ppGpp accumulation during CarD depletion should lead to a partial downregulation of rRNA rather than the induction of rRNA that we observe (Figure 4). These findings indicate that ppGpp is ineffective in inducing stringent control when CarD is absent. To test whether CarD regulates transcription via direct physical interactions with the RNAP, we engineered M. smegmatis ΔcarD attB::tetcarD-HA, which encodes a functional HA-tagged version of CarD at the attB site. Immunoprecipitation of whole-cell lysates with HA antibodies coprecipitated HA-CarD and the RNAP β subunit from the ΔcarD attB::tetcarD-HA lysate but not from the control lysate containing untagged CarD (Figure 5A). To more comprehensively survey CarD-interacting proteins in M. smegmatis, we analyzed the same eluates by SDS-PAGE and mass spectroscopy. The four major proteins detected were HA-CarD and the α, β, and β' subunits of RNAP (Figures 5B). No other proteins on the Coomassie blue-stained gel were present in the same stoichiometry as the RNAP subunits, suggesting that the interaction between CarD and the RNAP is direct. These findings conclusively demonstrate that CarD forms a complex with the RNAP. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments with HA antibodies in M. smegmatis ΔcarD attB::tetcarD-HA specifically precipitated the promoters regulating the rRNA operons or the rplN operon (encoding ribosomal proteins L14, L24, L5, and S14p/S29e) (Figure 5C), thus confirming that CarD is physically present on the RNAP complex at the rRNA and ribosomal protein loci. The N terminus of CarD proteins display amino acid sequence similarity to the TRCF RID (Figure 5D). TRCF, encoded by the mfd gene, revives backtracked elongating RNAPs, terminates transcription at repressor binding sites, and mediates the repair of lesions in the transcribed DNA strand by interacting with stalled transcription elongation complexes and recruiting nucleotide excision repair components to the site (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers A.L.

A recent study that analysed a large number of human cancer cell lines showed that miR-330 is a potential tumor-suppressor gene. However, the function and molecular mechanism of miR-330 in determining the aggressiveness of human prostate cancer has not been studied. Here, we show that miR-330 is significantly lower expressed in human prostate cancer cell lines than in nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cells. Bioinformatics analyses reveal a conserved target site for miR-330 in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of E2F1 at nucleotides 1018-1024. MiR-330 significantly suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter containing the E2F1-3'-UTR in the cells. This activity could be abolished with the transfection of anti-miR-330 or mutated E2F1-3'-UTR. In addition, the expression level of miR-330 and E2F1 was inversely correlated in cell lines and prostate cancer specimens. After overexpressing of miR-330 in PC-3 cells, cell growth was suppressed by reducing E2F1-mediated Akt phosphorylation and thereby inducing apoptosis. Collectively, this is the first study to show that E2F1 is negatively regulated by miR-330 and also show that miR-330 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through E2F1-mediated suppression of Akt phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2085494245,"Telomeres protect chromosome ends from fusion and degradation. In the absence of a specific telomere elongation mechanism, their DNA shortens progressively with every round of replication, leading to replicative senescence. Here, we show that telomerase-deficient cells bearing a single, very short telomere senesce earlier, demonstrating that the length of the shortest telomere is a major determinant of the onset of senescence. We further show that Mec1p-ATR specifically recognizes the single, very short telomere causing the accelerated senescence. Strikingly, before entering senescence, cells divide for several generations despite complete erosion of their shortened telomeres. This pre-senescence growth requires RAD52 (radiation sensitive) and MMS1 (methyl methane sulfonate sensitive), and there is no evidence for major inter-telomeric recombination. We propose that, in the absence of telomerase, a very short telomere is first maintained in a pre-signalling state by a RAD52-MMS1-dependent pathway and then switches to a signalling state leading to senescence through a Mec1p-dependent checkpoint."

https://openalex.org/W1993460435,"The Cdk4–pRb–E2F1 pathway is shown to have a role in insulin secretion in b cells by controlling the expression of a subunit of the K+ATP channel through E2F1 binding to its promoter. CDK4–pRB–E2F1 cell-cycle regulators are robustly expressed in non-proliferating β cells, suggesting that besides the control of β-cell number the CDK4–pRB–E2F1 pathway has a role in β-cell function. We show here that E2F1 directly regulates expression of Kir6.2, which is a key component of the KATP channel involved in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. We demonstrate, through chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis from tissues, that Kir6.2 expression is regulated at the promoter level by the CDK4–pRB–E2F1 pathway. Consistently, inhibition of CDK4, or genetic inactivation of E2F1, results in decreased expression of Kir6.2, impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in mice. Furthermore we show that rescue of Kir6.2 expression restores insulin secretion in E2f1−/− β cells. Finally, we demonstrate that CDK4 is activated by glucose through the insulin pathway, ultimately resulting in E2F1 activation and, consequently, increased expression of Kir6.2. In summary we provide evidence that the CDK4–pRB–E2F1 regulatory pathway is involved in glucose homeostasis, defining a new link between cell proliferation and metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1968671346,"Evasion of apoptosis can be caused by epigenetic silencing of caspase-8, a key component of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Loss of caspase-8 correlates with poor prognosis in medulloblastoma, which highlights the relevance of strategies to upregulate caspase-8 to break apoptosis resistance. Here, we develop a new combinatorial approach, that is treatment using histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) together with interferon (IFN)-gamma, to restore caspase-8 expression and to overcome resistance to the death-receptor ligand TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo. HDACI, for example, valproic acid (VA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and MS-275, cooperate with IFN-gamma to upregulate caspase-8 in cancer cells lacking caspase-8, thereby restoring sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Molecular studies show that VA promotes histone acetylation and acts in concert with IFN-gamma to stimulate caspase-8 promoter activity. The resulting increase in caspase-8 mRNA and protein expression leads to enhanced TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-8 at the death-inducing signaling complex, mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization and caspase-dependent cell death. Intriguingly, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of caspase-8 also abolishes the VA/IFN-gamma-mediated sensitization for TRAIL-induced apoptosis. It is important to note that VA and IFN-gamma restore caspase-8 expression and sensitivity to TRAIL in primary medulloblastoma samples and significantly potentiate TRAIL-mediated suppression of medulloblastoma growth in vivo. These findings provide the rationale for further (pre)clinical evaluation of VA and IFN-gamma to restore caspase-8 expression and apoptosis sensitivity in cancers with caspase-8 silencing and open new perspectives to overcome TRAIL resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1978118647,"The expression of NKX3.1, a transcriptional regulator and tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer, is downregulated during early stages of prostate tumorigenesis. However, little is known of the alterations in gene expression that occur as a result of this event. We combined laser capture microdissection and gene expression profiling to analyse the molecular consequences of Nkx3.1 loss during prostate cancer initiation using Nkx3.1-deficient mice. This analysis identified a cohort of genes (loss-of-Nkx3.1 signature) that are aberrantly overexpressed during loss-of-Nkx3.1-driven tumor initiation. We studied the expression of these genes in independent loss-of-Pten and c-myc overexpression prostate adenocarcinoma mouse models. Nkx3.1 expression is lost in prostate epithelial proliferation in both of these mouse models. However, Nkx3.1 loss is an early event of tumor development in the loss-of-Pten model, whereas it occurs at later stages in c-myc transgenic mice. A number of genes of the loss-of-Nkx3.1 signature, such as clusterin and quiescin Q6, are highly expressed in prostatic hyperplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions that also lack Nkx3.1 in the Pten-deficient prostate, but not in similar lesions in the c-myc transgenic model. Meta-analysis of multiple prostate cancer gene expression data sets, including those from loss-of-Nkx3.1, loss-of-Pten, c-myc overexpression and constitutively active Akt prostate cancer models, further confirmed that genes associated with the loss-of-Nkx3.1 signature integrate with PTEN–AKT signaling pathways, but do not overlap with molecular changes associated with the c-myc signaling pathway. In human prostate tissue samples, loss of NKX3.1 expression and corresponding clusterin overexpression are co-localized at sites of prostatic inflammatory atrophy, a possible very early stage of human prostate tumorigenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that the molecular consequences of NKX3.1 loss depend on the epithelial proliferative stage at which its expression is lost, and that alterations in the PTEN–AKT–NKX3.1 axis are important for prostate cancer initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2046610378,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a central role in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis because sequential cleavages by β- and γ-secretase lead to the generation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, a key constituent in the amyloid plaques present in brains of AD individuals.

However, these studies have relied on APP mutations within the Aβ sequence itself that may affect APP processing by interfering with secretase cleavages independent of dimerization. Therefore, the impact of APP dimerization on Aβ production remains unclear. To address this question, we compared the approach of constitutive cysteine-induced APP dimerization with a regulatable dimerization system that does not require the introduction of mutations within the Aβ sequence.

BACE1 cleavage releases the large ectodomain of APP while generating the membrane-anchored C-terminal APP fragment (CTF) of 99 amino acids (C99). Cleavage of β-CTF by γ-secretase leads to the secretion of Aβ peptides of various lengths and the release of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) into the cytosol (9Weidemann A. Eggert S.

The γ-secretase complex consists of at least four proteins: presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-I, and Pen-2 (12Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Presenilin is thought to be the catalytic subunit of the enzyme complex (13Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S.

Alternatively, APP can first be cleaved in the non-amyloidogenic pathway by α-secretase within the Aβ domain between Lys-16 and Leu-17 (14Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R.

APP and its two homologues, APLP1 and APLP2, can dimerize in a homotypic or heterotypic manner and, in so doing, promote intercellular adhesion (17Soba P. Eggert S. Wagner K. Zentgraf H. Siehl K.

In vivo interaction of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 was demonstrated by cross-linking studies from brain homogenates (18Bai Y. Markham K. Chen F. Weerasekera R. Watts J. Horne P. Wakutani Y. Bagshaw R.

To date at least four domains have been reported to promote APP dimerization; that is, the E1 domain containing the N-terminal growth factor-like domain and copper binding domain (17Soba P. Eggert S.

In the latter domain the dimerization appears to be mediated by the GXXXG motif near the luminal face of the transmembrane region (21Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 23Kienlen-Campard P. Tasiaux B. Van Hees J. Li M. Huysseune S. Sato T. Fei J.Z.

In addition to promoting cell adhesion, APP dimerization has been proposed to increase susceptibility to cell death (20Shaked G.M. Kummer M.P. Lu D.C. Galvan V. Bredesen D.E. Koo E.H. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1254-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 24Lu D.C. Shaked G.M. Masliah E. Bredesen D.E. Koo E.H. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly, by introducing cysteine mutations into the APP juxtamembrane region, it was shown that stable dimers through formation of these disulfide linkages result in significantly enhanced Aβ production (25Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the observation that stable Aβ dimers are found intracellularly in neurons and in vivo in brain (26Walsh D.M. Tseng B.P. Rydel R.E. Podlisny M.B. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results have led to the idea that APP dimerization can positively regulate Aβ production. However, other laboratories have not been able to confirm some of these observations using slightly different approaches (23Kienlen-Campard P. Tasiaux B. Van Hees J. Li M. Huysseune S. Sato T.

Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). To further address the question of how dimerization of APP affects cleavage by α-, β-, and γ-secretase, we chose to test this with a controlled dimerization system. Accordingly, we engineered a chimeric APP molecule by fusing a portion of the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) to the C terminus of APP such that the addition of the synthetic membrane-permeant bifunctional compound, AP20187, will induce dimerization of the APP-FKBP chimera in a controlled manner by binding to the FKBP domains. Using this system, efficient dimerization of APP up to 70% can be achieved in a time and concentration-dependent fashion. Our studies showed that controlled homodimerization of APP-FKBP leads to decreased total Aβ levels in transfected N2a cells. Homodimerization of the β-CTF/C99 fragment, the direct precursor of γ-secretase cleavage, showed comparable results. In addition, induced dimerization of APP did not lead to a modulation of different Aβ peptides as it was reported for GXXXG mutants within the transmembrane domain of APP (21Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). FKBP-tagged APP695 constructs were generated in a three-fragment ligation step. First, the 1054-bp EcoRI and XhoI 5′ fragment was released from APP695 pUAST (17Soba P. Eggert S. Wagner K. Zentgraf H. Siehl K. Kreger S. Löwer A. Langer A. Merdes G. Paro R. Masters C.L. Müller U. Kins S. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3624-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Second, an APP fragment from the 3′ end was generated by PCR from APP695 pUAST without a stop codon and appending an XbaI restriction site using the primer 5′-CGAGTTCCTACAACAGCAGCC-3′ and an antisense primer, 5′-GCGGTGTCTAGAGTTCTGCATCTGCTC-3′, and digested with XhoI and XbaI. These two fragments were ligated into the vector pC4F1 (with one FKBP domain) or pC4F2 (with two FKBP domains) (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) using the restriction sites EcoRI and XbaI. To generate FKBP-tagged SPA4CT constructs, a silent mutation was first introduced into SPA4CT DA pCEP4 (28Lichtenthaler S.F. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) at position Glu-22 (Aβ numbering) to remove the internal EcoRI site by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A PCR fragment of the entire SPA4CT DA open reading frame was subsequently generated, again without the stop codon and with an Xba1 site added to the 3′ end and an EcoRI site added to the 5′end, and ligated into vector pC4F1 (with one FKBP domain) and vector pC4F2 (with two FKBP domains). A control FKBP-tagged AICD construct starting at Val-50 (Aβ numbering) was generated with a methionine residue added as a start codon and ligated into pC4F1 (or pC4F2). To generate an APP695 CT HA construct without the FKBP fusion, the 3′-untranslated region of APP was amplified from APP695 wt NT HA pcDNA3.1 neo (17Soba P. Eggert S. Wagner K. Zentgraf H. Siehl K.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3624-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) with sense primer 5′-GTTTATAACTCGAGACCCCCGCCACAGC-3′, containing an XhoI site, and antisense primer, 5′-CCCGCGGCTCTAGATCTTAAAGCATATGTAAAG-3′, containing an XbaI site. The PCR product was digested with XhoI and XbaI restriction enzymes and subcloned into the same sites in the pcDNA3.1+ neo vector. Sense primer 5′-GTGGCCGAGGAGGAGATTCAGGA-3′, starting at position 1481 in the APP695 open reading frame and antisense primer, 5′-GCTGACCTCGAGTTATGCGTAGTCTGGTACGTCGTACGGATAGTTCTGCATCTGCTC-3′, containing the 3′ end of the APP695 open reading frame without a stop codon, the HA tag, and an XhoI restriction site, were used to amplify APP695 wt NT HA. The PCR product was digested with SacI and XhoI restriction enzymes. The EcoRI and SacI fragment from APP695 pUAST and the preceding SacI-XhoI 1736-bp PCR fragment were ligated into the EcoR1 and XhoI sites in the pcDNA3.1+ neo vector containing the 3′-untranslated region of APP. Subsequently, the L17C, K28C, K28S, and K28A mutations were introduced into the APP695 CT HA pcDNA3.1+ neo plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange). Mouse Neuroblastoma N2a cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. N2a cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The dimerizing ligand, AP20187 (Ariad Pharmaceuticals), was added 7 h after transfection and continued from 1 to 17 h. Monoclonal antibodies included HA.11 to detect the HA epitope tag (Covance), 82E1 against the free N terminus of Aβ (IBL, Minneapolis MN), B436 recognizing the N-terminal region of Aβ (29Vetrivel K.S.

The polyclonal sAPPβ antibody recognizes the ISEVKM sequence at the C terminus of wild type human sAPPβ (Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Antibody 6E10 was also used for detection of sAPPα, and β-secretase cleavage site-specific antibody 82E1 was also used for detection of the APPβ C-terminal fragment. The β-tubulin antibody E7-a1 was obtained from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration determined with a Micro BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein samples were separated on 8 or 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE or 12.5 or 15% Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To separate Aβ38, Aβ39, Aβ40, and Aβ42 species, media samples were immunoprecipitated with antibody B436 as above and separated on 10% Tris/Tricine gels containing 8 m urea (32Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10479) Google Scholar). Synthetic Aβ peptide standards (AnaSpec) were separated in parallel with the experimental samples. After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, the membranes were incubated with 82E1 monoclonal antibody which recognizes all full-length Aβ peptides starting at position 1. Blue native gel electrophoresis was performed according to a protocol modified from Schägger et al. (33Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). In brief, cells in one 10-cm cell culture dish were washed once and collected in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors) and then sheared by passing through a 27 × gauge needle 10 times. Postnuclear supernatant was collected after a low speed spin at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The membranes were pelleted after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and washed once with 200 μl of homogenization buffer, and the centrifugation was repeated once. The pellets containing the membranes were resuspended in 200 μl of homogenization buffer. 100 μg of protein were solubilized with Blue Native sample buffer (1.5 m amino caproic acid, 0.05 m Bis-Tris, 10% n-dodedecyl-β-d-maltoside, and protease inhibitor at pH 7.5). The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Blue Native loading buffer (5.0% Serva Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 and 1.0 m aminocaproic acid) was added to the supernatant. The samples were separated on 4–15% Tris-HCl gels (Criterion, Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C with Coomassie Blue containing cathode buffer (10× cathode buffer, pH 7.0, 0.5 m Tricine, 0.15 m Bis-Tris, 0.2% Coomassie Blue) and anode buffer (pH 7.0, 0.5 m Bis-Tris). The gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The following molecular weight standards were used: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), all from Sigma. N2a cells in six-well plates were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Overnight conditioned media were collected and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody B436 and anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads (American Qualex, San Clemente, CA). After 3 washes with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and 1 wash with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the beads were resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer plus dithiothreitol and separated by 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE. Aβ40 and Aβ42 species were quantified with sandwich ELISAs essentially as described (34Kukar T.L. Ladd T.B. Bann M.A. Fraering P.C. Narlawar R. Maharvi G.M. Healy B. Chapman R. Welzel A.T. Price R.W.

In brief, 100 μl of diluted media were analyzed on Immulon 4 HBX plates (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) that were coated before with 25 μg/ml concentrations of the capture antibody in phosphate-buffered saline. For Aβ40, Ab9 was the capture antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 13.1.1 (epitope Aβ-(35–40)) was the reporter antibody. For Aβ42, antibody 2.1.3 (epitope, Aβ-(35–42)) was the capture antibody, whereas horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Ab9 was the reporter antibody. The signal was developed with TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) solution and measured in an ELISA plate reader. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry of Aβ peptides was performed on a 4800 MALDI-TOF-TOF (Applied Biosystems/MDS-Sciex, Foster City, CA). Aβ peptides were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium with antibody B436 coupled to SeizeTM beads (Pierce). The immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads with 25% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 75% acetonitrile, and the resulting samples were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in methanol:acetonitrile:water (36:56:8) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and spotted on the MALDI target grid. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 3,500–5,000 Da in reflector positive mode at 10,000 shots/spectrum using single shot protection and delayed extraction times of 420 ns. The mass spectra are plotted as m/z versus relative intensity. Studies from Multhaup and co-workers (25Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have shown that artificial dimerization of APP by introducing cysteine residues within the Aβ domain increased Aβ production. K28C mutation (using Aβ numbering) showed 6–7-fold augmentation in Aβ secretion (25Scheuermann S. Hambsch B. Hesse L. Stumm J. Schmidt C. Beher D. Bayer T.A. Beyreuther K. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33923-33929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas the L17C mutation (21Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) showed unchanged Aβ40 levels but increased Aβ42 release, suggesting that dimers of APP facilitate Aβ generation. However, a recent study reported that a K28S mutation showed a marked (90%) reduction in Aβ production (35Ren Z. Schenk D. Basi G.S. Shapiro I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35350-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), possibly due to impairment in γ-secretase cleavage. As a result, we wish to first revisit these cysteine mutants as well as determine the effects of base substitutions at the lysine residue at position 28 (by Aβ numbering or position 624 by APP695 numbering). Accordingly, we examined APP processing and Aβ production in four different mutations: L17C, K28C, K28S, and K28A (Fig. 1A). All three mutations at Aβ28 (K28A, K28C, and K28S) resulted in a significant reduction in Aβ secretion. For K28A and K28S, the Aβ levels were essentially undetectable. The magnitude of reduction in Aβ production in the K28C mutation was slightly variable, depending on the Aβ antibody used for immunoprecipitations (supplemental Fig. 1). In parallel, there was a strong reduction in sAPPα secretion in the L17C mutant, indicating that impairment of α-secretase cleavage might have led to increased β-secretase cleavage, as seen in the concomitant rise in the level of β-CTF. Although there was a mild reduction in sAPPα and sAPPβ secretion in the K28C mutant, neither the K28A nor the K28S mutant showed any significant alterations in sAPPβ secretion. In addition, there was a substantial change in α-secretase processing for mutants K28S and K28A. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with those reported by Ren et al. (35Ren Z. Schenk D. Basi G.S. Shapiro I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 35350-35360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that substitutions of the basic lysine residue at position 28 by other hydrophilic (Cys or Ser) or hydrophobic (Ala) amino acids led to marked reduction in Aβ production, presumably by affecting γ-secretase cleavage. However, in view of the K28C results it appears that dimerized APP does not consistently augment Aβ generation, especially if the K28C substitution led to other perturbations in APP processing. In light of the above results, another approach to dimerize APP is needed to determine the impact of APP dimerization on Aβ production, especially one that minimizes secondary effects due to amino acid substitutions within the Aβ sequence. We used a regulated homodimerization system based on the human FKBP12 and a small bifunctional ligand, AP20187 (36Clackson T. Chem. Biol. Drug Design. 2006; 67: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We engineered a chimeric APP construct containing the full-length human APP cDNA fused to one or two FKBP domains and a HA epitope tag at the C terminus (Fig. 2A). AP20187, an analogue of rapamycin, is a membrane-permeable compound that induces rapid dimerization of the FKBP or, in this case, APP695-FKBP. Either one FKBP domain (APP F1) or two FKBP domains (APP F2) were fused to the C terminus of APP to enable APP dimerization. To analyze the impact of APP dimerization on γ-secretase processing directly, we also fused one or two FKBP domains to a C99 or β-CTF construct, SPA4CT, as above, and these are termed SPA4CT F1 and F2, respectively (Fig. 2B). SPA4CT mimics the C99 β C-terminal fragment generated after BACE1 cleavage and is a direct substrate of γ-secretase cleavage (28Lichtenthaler S.F. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To examine dimerization of these APP-FKBP chimeric constructs, APP695 F1 and APP695 F2 were transiently transfected into mouse N2a cells and treated overnight with AP20187. Blue Native PAGE showed that the majority of APP molecules were in the dimer form (about 70%), whereas the untreated control sample showed very little APP dimers (Fig. 2C). For comparison, both APP cysteine mutants (APP L17C and K28C) showed comparable levels of APP dimer formation using Blue Native PAGE (Fig. 3A). Dimerization of APP F2 was more efficient than APP F1 due to the additional FKBP domain with almost no APP monomer present (Fig. 2C). In addition, APP multimers, likely tetramers, were also detected. Of note, in the Blue Native gel system, the APP monomer migrated with a mobility of ∼300 kDa (Fig. 2C), whereas the APP dimer had a molecular mass of twice the monomer size (∼600 kDa). The apparent molecular mass of APP monomers and dimers in this gel system is in accordance with a recent publication by Sato et al. (37Sato T. Diehl T.S. Narayanan S. Funamoto S. Ihara Y.

https://openalex.org/W2121052315,"The mechanisms by which replicating influenza viruses decrease the expression and function of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) have not been elucidated. We show that expression of M2, a transmembrane influenza protein, decreases ENaC membrane levels and amiloride-sensitive currents in both Xenopus oocytes, injected with human α-, β-, and γ-ENaCs, and human airway cells (H441 and A549), which express native ENaCs. Deletion of a 10-aa region within the M2 C terminus prevented 70% of this effect. The M2 ENaC down-regulation occurred at normal pH and was prevented by MG-132, a proteasome and lysosome inhibitor. M2 had no effect on Liddle ENaCs, which have decreased affinity for Nedd4-2. H441 and A549 cells transfected with M2 showed higher levels of reactive oxygen species, as shown by the activation of redox-sensitive dyes. Pretreatment with glutathione ester, which increases intracellular reduced thiol concentrations, or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors prevented the deleterious effects of M2 on ENaCs. The data suggest that M2 protein increases steady-state concentrations of reactive oxygen intermediates that simulate PKC and decrease ENaCs by enhancing endocytosis and its subsequent destruction by the proteasome. These novel findings suggest a mechanism for the influenza-induced rhinorrhea and life-threatening alveolar edema in humans.—Lazrak, A., Iles, K. E., Liu, G. Noah, D. L., Noah, J. W., Matalon, S.

https://openalex.org/W2058088852,"Ca2+-calcineurin-NFAT signaling transmits signals to the nucleus from a wide variety of receptors and is required for developmental events as diverse as axon outgrowth, cardiac morphogenesis, lung morphogenesis, neural crest diversification, epithelial stem cell maintenance, and immune responses. The pathway appears to be particularly dedicated to vertebrate-specific morphogenic events, perhaps reflecting its first evolutionary appearance in vertebrates. Calcineurin-NFAT signaling is the target of the drugs cyclosporin A and FK506 and several viral immune modulators. In addition, its malfunction is implicated in Down’s syndrome, diabetes, and cardiac hypertrophy.

Receptors that induce the entry of Ca2+ into the cell resulting in the activation of calcineurin phosphatase are shown in the lower left. Ca2+ binds to the regulatory subunit of calcineurin as well as to calmodulin to activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin (Stemmer and Klee, 1994). The immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and cyclosporin A inhibit calcineurin by binding first to the abundant intracellular proteins, FKBP and cyclophilin, respectively. These protein complexes then bind to calcineurin, preventing substrate access (Liu et al., 1991). The specificity of these calcineurin inhibitors is due to the large composite surface arising from FKBP bound to FK506 (see inset structure) (Griffith et al., 1995) or cyclosporin A bound to cyclophilin. FK506 and cyclosporin A are highly specific probes of the NFAT signaling pathway in tissues where the concentration of calcineurin is less than the concentration of FKBP or cyclophilin (Graef et al., 2001). Calcineurin removes several phosphate residues from the N terminus of NFATc proteins, the Ca2+-calcineurin-sensitive subunits of NFAT transcription complexes. Removal of the phosphates exposes nuclear localization sequences in NFATc proteins leading to their rapid entry into the nucleus (Beals et al., 1997a). Once in the nucleus, the NFATc proteins assemble on DNA with partner proteins generically termed NFATn (lower right) that are often the endpoints of other signaling pathways (Crabtree and Olson, 2002). In most cases, NFAT-dependent transcription requires that the Ca2+ signaling be coincident with MAP kinase signaling, providing a mechanism for signal integration and coincidence detection.

The targets of NFAT signaling (panel, upper right) are largely cytokines, growth factors and their receptors, proteins involved in cell-cell interactions, as well as many microRNAs. Of particular importance are positive feedback loops initiated by direct binding of NFATc1 and NFATc4 to their promoters as well as the regulation of Ca2+ channels, such as the IP3 receptor, responsible for the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Genazzani et al., 1999). This positive feedback loop appears to be important in committing cells to specific fates. A negative feedback loop mediated by the NFAT-dependent activation of RCAN (DSCR1) gene expression appears to constrain the pathway (Arron et al., 2006).

NFATc proteins are actively removed from the nucleus by first priming with Dyrk1a or protein kinase A (PKA) followed by phosphorylation by GSK3 (Arron et al., 2006; Beals et al., 1997b; Gwack et al., 2006). The inhibition of GSK3 by AKT and PI3 kinase (PI3K) signaling increases the level of NFATc proteins in the nucleus and hence provides a second means of coincidence detection and signal integration. Many of the phenotypes of Down’s syndrome are thought to be due to the duplication of the DSCR and Dyrk1a genes on chromosome 21. Increased gene dosage both reduces NFATc import into the nucleus and also facilitates export leading to a reduction in NFATc function and compromised positive feedback (Arron et al., 2006)."
https://openalex.org/W2089222579,"Myeloma tumors are characterized by high expression of syndecan-1 (CD138), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan present on the myeloma cell surface and shed into the tumor microenvironment. High levels of shed syndecan-1 in the serum of patients are an indicator of poor prognosis, and numerous studies have implicated syndecan-1 in promoting the growth and progression of this cancer. In the present study we directly addressed the role of syndecan-1 in myeloma by stable knockdown of its expression using RNA interference. Knockdown cells that were negative for syndecan-1 expression became apoptotic and failed to grow in vitro. Knockdown cells expressing syndecan-1 at approximately 28% or approximately 14% of normal levels survived and grew well in vitro but formed fewer and much smaller subcutaneous tumors in mice compared with tumors formed by cells expressing normal levels of syndecan-1. When injected intravenously into mice (experimental metastasis model), knockdown cells formed very few metastases as compared with controls. This indicates that syndecan-1 may be required for the establishment of multi-focal metastasis, a hallmark of this cancer. One mechanism of syndecan-1 action occurs via stimulation of tumor angiogenesis because tumors formed by knockdown cells exhibited diminished levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and impaired development of blood vessels. Together, these data indicate that the effects of syndecan-1 on myeloma survival, growth, and dissemination are due, at least in part, to its positive regulation of tumor-host interactions that generate an environment capable of sustaining robust tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2024290067,"The detailed structures of prion disease-associated, partially protease-resistant forms of prion protein (e.g. PrPSc) are largely unknown. PrPSc appears to propagate itself by autocatalyzing the conformational conversion and oligomerization of normal prion protein (PrPC). One manifestation of PrPSc templating activity is its ability, in protein misfolding cyclic amplification reactions, to seed the conversion of recombinant prion protein (rPrP) into aggregates that more closely resemble PrPSc than spontaneously nucleated rPrP amyloids in terms of proteolytic fragmentation and infrared spectra. The absence of posttranslational modifications makes these rPrP aggregates more amenable to detailed structural analyses than bona fide PrPSc. Here, we compare the structures of PrPSc-seeded and spontaneously nucleated aggregates of hamster rPrP by using H/D exchange coupled with mass spectrometry. In spontaneously formed fibrils, very slow H/D exchange in region ∼163–223 represents a systematically H-bonded cross-β amyloid core structure. PrPSc-seeded aggregates have a subpopulation of molecules in which this core region extends N-terminally as far as to residue ∼145, and there is a significant degree of order within residues ∼117–133. The formation of tightly H-bonded structures by these more N-terminal residues may account partially for the generation of longer protease-resistant regions in the PrPSc-seeded rPrP aggregates; however, part of the added protease resistance is dependent on the presence of SDS during proteolysis, emphasizing the multifactorial influences on proteolytic fragmentation patterns.

All of these diseases appear to be intimately associated with conformational conversion of the normal host-encoded prion protein, termed PrPC, to a pathological isoform, PrPSc (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc.

According to the “protein-only” model, PrPSc itself represents the infectious prion agent (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PrPC is a monomeric glycophosphatidylinositol-linked glycoprotein that is highly protease-sensitive and soluble in nonionic detergents. High resolution NMR data show that the recombinant PrP (rPrP), a nonglycosylated model of PrPC, consists of a flexible N-terminal region and a folded C-terminal domain encompassing three α-helices and two short β-strands (11.Riek R.

Little specific structural information is available, however, for this isoform beyond low resolution biochemical and spectroscopic characterization. Thus, the structure of PrPSc conformer(s) associated with prion infectivity remains one of the best guarded mysteries, hindering efforts to understand the molecular basis of TSE diseases. Many efforts have been made over the years to recapitulate PrPSc formation and prion propagation in vitro. Early studies have shown that PrPC can be converted with remarkable species and strain specificities to a PrPSc-like conformation (as judged by PK resistance) simply by incubation with PrPSc from prion-infected animals (16.Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 17.Caughey B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The yields of these original cell-free conversion experiments were low, and no new infectivity could be attributed to the newly converted material (18.Hill A.F. Antoniou M. Collinge J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). An important more recent study showed that both PrPSc and TSE infectivity can be amplified indefinitely in crude brain homogenates using successive rounds of sonication and incubation (19.Castilla J. Saá P. Hetz C. Soto C. Cell. 2005; 121: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), a procedure called protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) (20.Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Similar amplification of the TSE infectivity was also accomplished by PMCA employing purified PrPC as a substrate, although only in the presence of polyanions such as RNA and copurified lipids (21.Deleault N.R. Harris B.T. Rees J.R. Supattapone S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9741-9746Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the quantities of infectious PrPSc generated by PMCA using purified brain-derived PrPC are very small, precluding most structural studies. In contrast to brain-derived PrPC, large scale purification can be readily accomplished for bacterially expressed rPrP, a form of PrP lacking glycosylation and the glycophosphatidylinositol anchor. The latter protein can spontaneously polymerize into amyloid fibrils, and much insight has been gained into mechanistic and structural aspects of this reaction (22.Baskakov I.V. Legname G.

However, although rPrP fibrils were shown to cause or accelerate a transmissible neurodegenerative disorder in transgenic mice overexpressing a PrPC variant encompassing residues 89–231, the infectivity titer of these “synthetic prions” was extremely low (29.Legname G.

Chesebro B. Jeffrey M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 177-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This low infectivity coincides with much shorter PK-resistant core of rPrP amyloid fibrils compared with brain-derived PrPSc (26.Lu X. Wintrode P.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 30.Bocharova O.V. Breydo L. Salnikov V.V. Gill A.C. Baskakov I.V. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1222-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), raising questions regarding the relationship between these fibrils and the authentic TSE agent. In this context, an important recent development was the finding that the PrPSc-seeded PMCA method can be extended to rPrP, yielding protease-resistant recombinant PrP aggregates (rPrPPMCA or rPrP-res(Sc)) (31.Atarashi R. Moore R.A. Sim V.L. Hughson A.G. Dorward D.W. Onwubiko H.A. Priola S.A. Caughey B. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These aggregates display a PK digestion pattern that is much more closely related to PrPSc than that of previously studied spontaneously formed rPrP fibrils, offering a potentially more relevant model for biochemical and biophysical studies. Here, we provide, for the first time, a direct insight into the structure of rPrPPMCA. H/D exchange data coupled with MS analysis (HXMS) allowed us to identify systematically H-bonded core region(s) of these aggregates, shedding a new light on the mechanisms underlying formation of PK-resistant structures. Recombinant Syrian hamster full-length prion protein (rShaPrP-(23–231)) and its fragment (rShaPrP-(90–231)) were expressed and purified as described previously (32.Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar); they were stored frozen in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4. In addition to the ShaPrP sequence, the proteins contain a 4-residue N-terminal extension (GSDP) and an extra C-terminal Ser residue. Spontaneously formed amyloid fibrils were prepared as described previously (24.Apetri A.C. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15880-15888Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26.Lu X. Wintrode P.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PrPSc-seeded PMCA of the recombinant Syrian hamster protein was performed essentially as described by Atarashi et al. (31.Atarashi R. Moore R.A. Sim V.L. Hughson A.G. Dorward D.W. Onwubiko H.A. Priola S.A. Caughey B. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Briefly, monomeric rShaPrP-(90–231) or rShaPrP-(23–231) was diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4. One hundred-microliter aliquots of this solution were placed in 0.2-ml tubes, and 100 ng of PK-treated PrPSc purified from 263K-infected hamster brain (33.Rubenstein R. Carp R.I. Ju W. Scalici C. Papini M. Rubenstein A. Kascsak R. Arch. Virol. 1994; 139: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was added as a seed. The mixture was then subjected to nine rounds of PMCA, each of them consisting of 18 cycles of 40-s sonication followed by a 1-h incubation (Misonix S3000 bath-type sonicator equipped with an adaptor for 96 PCR tubes). After each round, an aliquot of the amplified samples was taken and diluted 100-fold into PMCA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing monomeric protein (0.1 mg/ml) as a substrate. Before H/D exchange experiments, pepsin digestion fragments of the PrP were identified by a standard procedure involving separation on a C18 high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column coupled to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer, sequencing by tandem MS, and analysis using the SEQUEST search algorithm (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) and manual inspection. The identification was confirmed by exact mass measurements using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS (LTQ-ICR, ThermoFisher Scientific). Spontaneously formed rShaPrP amyloid fibrils and rShaPrP aggregates produced by PrPSc-seeded PMCA were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g; 10 min) and washed four or five times in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. To initiate deuterium labeling, pellets (∼50 μl) were resuspended in 1 ml of the buffer (10 mm phosphate, pH 7) prepared in D2O. After different times of incubation at room temperature, samples were collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min) and rapidly dissociated into rShaPrP monomers by adding an ice-cold solution of 7 m guanidine hydrochloride in an exchange quench buffer (0.1 m phosphate, pH 2.4) containing a reducing agent (0.1 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride)). After a 5-min incubation on ice, the samples were diluted 10 times with ice-cold 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O and digested for 5 min with agarose-immobilized pepsin (ThermoFisher Scientific) using 100 μl of the slurry/100 μl of protein solution (∼100 μg/ml). The peptic fragments were collected in a peptide microtrap, washed to remove salts, and eluted on a C18 HPLC column using a gradient of 2–35% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Peptides separated on the column were analyzed by a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer. The trap and the column were immersed in ice. Peptide masses were calculated from the centroid of the isotopic envelope using MagTran software, and the extent of deuterium incorporation at each time point was determined from the shift in mass of labeled peptides relative to unlabeled peptides. To correct for the 5% H2O present during the exchange-in and for deuterium back-exchange during proteolysis, HPLC separation, and MS analysis, control experiments were performed by using fully deuterated protein prepared by a 2-h incubation in 6.6 m guanidine deuterochloride in D2O/H2O (95:5, v/v) buffered with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. The extent of deuterium incorporation (corrected for back-exchange) was calculated as % D = (m(t) − m(0%))/(m(100%) − m(0%)) × 100, where % D is the relative amount of amide deuterium atoms incorporated in each peptic fragment, m(t) is the observed centroid mass of the peptide at time point t, m(0%) is the measured mass of an undeuterated reference sample, and m(100%) is the observed mass of a fully deuterated reference sample. Isotopic envelopes showing bimodal-like distribution were analyzed mathematically to estimate the fraction of deuterated species. To this end, the envelopes were fitted as a sum of Gaussian curves corresponding to each isotopic peak. Peaks with the best signal-to-noise ratio that do not overlap with the isotopic envelope for the fully protonated species were selected, and the areas of these peaks were divided by the areas of corresponding peaks in the mass spectrum of the fully deuterated peptide (normalized to the same area). rPrP aggregates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and, unless indicated differently, used directly for PK digestion analysis. In some experiments, samples were washed four or five times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in the same buffer with or without detergents employed in the PMCA buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100). Samples were then treated with PK (1 h, 37 °C, PK:rShaPrP ratio of 1:10, w/w). A fraction of PK-digested samples was used for Western blot analysis and another fraction for MS (after dissociation into monomers as described above). For Western blotting, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen), electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed using monoclonal 3F4 antibody (1:20,000) (34.Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or polyclonal anti-PrP antibody 78295 (1:5,000) (35.Kascsak R.J. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Rubenstein R. Carp R.I. Powers J.M. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1993; 80: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the PMCA procedure of Soto and coworkers (19.Castilla J. Saá P. Hetz C. Soto C. Cell. 2005; 121: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 20.Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) can be adapted to convert bacterially expressed recombinant Syrian hamster full-length prion protein to the PK-resistant form, with a 16–17-kDa PK-resistant fragment similar to that found in deglycosylated brain-derived PrPSc (31.Atarashi R. Moore R.A. Sim V.L. Hughson A.G. Dorward D.W. Onwubiko H.A. Priola S.A. Caughey B. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This conversion has been accomplished using a buffer containing a mixture of nonionic and acidic detergents (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS). Because, for technical reasons, certain aspects of structural studies involving mass spectrometric analysis are more practical using the N-terminally truncated rPrP-(90–231) fragment (see below), here we have adapted the PMCA protocol to rShaPrP-(90–231). Upon completion of the reaction, the product was treated with PK (PK:rPrP ratio of 1:10) and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, Western blots probed with 3F4 antibody (which recognizes the epitope at residues 109–112) revealed a single band with a molecular mass of ∼16 kDa (previously described as an ∼17 kDa band (31.Atarashi R. Moore R.A. Sim V.L. Hughson A.G. Dorward D.W. Onwubiko H.A. Priola S.A. Caughey B. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar)). However, when probed with silver staining (data not shown) or polyclonal anti-PrP antiserum 78295 (which recognizes both the N- and C-terminal epitopes), electrophoretic gels revealed additional PK-resistant fragments with molecular masses between ∼10 and 14 kDa (Fig. 1). Importantly, this electrophoretic profile for PMCA-converted rShaPrP-(90–231) is very similar to that of PMCA-converted full-length rShaPrP, indicating essentially identical PK-resistant fragments. The first step of HXMS analysis involves identification of peptic fragments that can be separated under the conditions of the rapid HPLC gradient required for hydrogen exchange experiments. Tandem MS experiments with peptic digest of rShaPrP-(90–231) allowed us to identify >60 fragments, 43 of which had a signal-to-noise ratio sufficient for reliable analysis of deuterium incorporation. The number of these fragments (covering ∼96% of the entire sequence with multiple overlaps in some regions) compares favorably with peptic coverage in the previous study with human rPrP-(90–231) (26.Lu X. Wintrode P.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This improvement is due largely to better MS instrumentation available for the present experiments and the use of resin-immobilized pepsin. Peptide mapping for rShaPrP-(23–231) identified the same fragments as in the case of rShaPrP-(90–231) for all peptides starting at and C-terminal to residue 117. However, no peptic fragments could be detected with a sufficient signal-to-noise-ratio within the entire 23–90 region, and the fragments starting in rShaPrP-(90–231) at residue 90 (Fig. 2) were now replaced by corresponding fragments starting at residue 23. Because of much longer peptic fragments, the precision and resolution of H/D exchange measurements for the ∼90–120 region in rShaPrP-(23–231) were much lower than those for the same region in rShaPrP-(90–231). Thus, the C-terminally truncated rShaPrP-(90–231) is better suited for HXMS studies of PrPSc-mimicking PrP aggregates. Although the focus of the present study is on structural properties of rShaPrPPMCA, an important point of reference for interpretation of H/D exchange data is relatively well characterized spontaneously formed recombinant prion protein amyloid fibrils, rPrPSp. The extent of deuterium incorporation for peptic fragments derived from rShaPrP-(90–231)Sp after different times of isotope exchange (5 min, 2 h, and 24 h) is summarized in Fig. 2A. All fragments corresponding to the N-terminal part of rShaPrP-(90–231) up to residue 161 were found to incorporate deuterium very rapidly (with essentially complete labeling within the first 5 min of the exchange experiment), clearly indicating the lack of any ordered structures within this part of amyloid fibrils. This contrasts sharply with strong protection against deuterium labeling for peptides derived from the C-terminal part of rShaPrP-(90–231)Sp. In particular, fragments corresponding to the entire 170–213 region appear to be especially highly protected, with less than ∼35% deuterium incorporation even after 24 h of exchange. A relatively high, although slightly lower, level of protection (less than ∼50% labeling within 24 h) is also observed for peptic fragments corresponding to residues 161/162–168, 161–174/175, and 218–224. As discussed in the previous study with human rPrP amyloid (26.Lu X. Wintrode P.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), this highly protected region represents systematically H-bonded cross-β structure, defining the “core” of amyloid fibrils. On the basis of the level of deuterium labeling for the flanking peptides 162–168 and 218–224, we estimate that both of them contain 1–2 unprotected residues. This would place the N- and C-terminal boundaries of the ordered core region at residues ∼163/164 and 222/223, respectively. This H-bonded core region determined herein for rShaPrP-(90–231)Sp is similar to that previously found for human rPrP amyloid fibrils (26.Lu X. Wintrode P.L. Surewicz W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The only significant difference is the N-terminal boundary, which for the latter protein appears to be at residue ∼169 (as indicated by very little protection for the peptic fragments within the 161–168 region). The “protection map” for peptic fragments derived from rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA (based on masses calculated from the overall centroids of the isotopic envelopes in mass spectra) is quite different from that for spontaneously formed rShaPrP-(90–231) amyloid fibrils (Fig. 2). The most notable of these differences is the apparent protection against deuterium incorporation for most peptic fragments corresponding to the 117–161 region in rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA, whereas in rShaPrP-(90–231)Sp, this entire region is highly accessible to deuterium labeling. Furthermore, inspection of mass spectra for peptic fragments derived from rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA indicates that some of them display at least two partially overlapping isotopic envelopes, indicating an apparently bimodal mass distribution. Spectra of this type are exemplified in Fig. 3 for peptides 120–133, 145–154, and 155–168. Importantly, there is no indication of such a bimodal mass distribution for any of the peptic fragments derived from rShaPrP-(90–231)Sp (Fig. 3). The bimodal mass distribution for some peptic fragments derived from rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA indicates the presence of two different species, one that incorporates deuterium very rapidly and one that is highly protected against H/D exchange. The presence of such two different populations was observed for all peptic fragments within residues 117–133 and 145–168. Thus, rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA contains at least two conformationally distinct populations of protein molecules: one in which the regions ∼117–133 and ∼145–168 are largely disordered (i.e"

Elevated autocrine fibroblast growth factors 2 (FGF-2) signaling promotes prostate cancer cell growth and survival. Expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) inhibits RAS transforming activity. LOX is secreted as 50 kDa pro-LOX protein and then undergoes extracellular proteolytic processing to form ∼30 kDa LOX enzyme and ∼18 kDa propeptide (LOX-PP). We have previously shown that LOX-PP inhibits breast cancer cell transformation and tumor formation, but mechanisms of action of LOX-PP have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that LOX expression is reduced in prostate cancer cell lines and that recombinant LOX-PP protein inhibits serum-stimulated DNA synthesis and MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways in DU 145 and PC-3 androgen-independent cell lines. In DU 145 cells, treatment with a pharmacologic FGF-receptor inhibitor or a neutralizing anti-FGFR1 antibody mimicked LOX-PP inhibition of serum-stimulated DNA synthesis. FGF-2-stimulated DNA synthesis, ERK1/2, AKT and FRS2α activation were found all to be inhibited by LOX-PP in DU 145 cells. LOX-PP reduced specific binding of FGF-2 to DU 145 cells, suggesting that LOX-PP targets FGF signaling at the receptor. Interestingly, PC-3 cells did not respond to FGF-2, consistent with previous reports. We conclude that LOX-PP inhibits proliferation of DU 145 cells by interfering with FGFR(s) binding and signaling, and that LOX-PP has other mechanisms of action in PC-3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006260464,"The development of pulmonary metastasis is the major cause of death in osteosarcoma, and its molecular basis is poorly understood. In this study, we show that β4 integrin is highly expressed in human osteosarcoma cell lines and tumor samples. Furthermore, highly metastatic MNNG-HOS cells have increased levels of β4 integrin. Suppression of β4 integrin expression by shRNA and disruption of β4 integrin function by transfection of dominant-negative β4 integrin was sufficient to revert this highly metastatic phenotype in the MNNG-HOS model without significantly affecting primary tumor growth. These findings suggest a role for β4 integrin expression in the metastatic phenotype in human osteosarcoma cells. In addition, we identified a previously uncharacterized interaction between β4 integrin and ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeletal linker protein that is implicated in the metastatic behavior of osteosarcoma. The β4 integrin–ezrin interaction appears to be critical for maintenance of β4 integrin expression. These data begin to integrate ezrin and β4 integrin expression into a model of action for the mechanism of osteosarcoma metastases."

This suggested GSNOR inhibition to be beneficial for the treatment of lung and cardiovascular diseases. We report here novel inhibitors of GSNOR that exclude GSNO from its binding site and preferentially inhibit GSNOR among the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) isozymes. Using the new inhibitors, we demonstrate that GSNOR actively regulates S-nitrosylation of proteins stemming from nitric-oxide synthase activity. Among the key cellular processes regulated by GSNOR are the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). All of the chemicals used in the experiments were purchased from Sigma. RAW 264.7 and A549 cells, DMEM, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from American Tissue and Cell Culture. Recombinant human GSNOR, ADH1B (β2-ADH), ADH4 (π-ADH), and ADH7 (σ-ADH) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in the Indiana University School of Medicine Protein Expression Core. Compounds C1–C3 were purchased from ChemDiv Inc. The screening for GSNOR inhibitors was performed using a library of 60,000 compounds from ChemDiv Inc. in the Chemical Genomics Core facility at Indiana University. Screening was conducted in 384-well plates and involved incubating GSNOR with 12.5 μm compound, 1 mm each NAD+ and octanol in 0.1 m sodium glycine, pH 10. Enzyme activity was determined by measuring the rate of production of NADH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Inhibition of GSNOR was calculated from the ratio of enzyme activity in the presence of compounds to that in no compound controls performed on the same plate. Following their identification from the high throughput screening, the GSNOR-inhibitory properties of the initial hits were confirmed at the pH 10 using octanol as the substrate and at pH 7.5 using GSNO as the substrate (see legend of Table 1 for details of the assay).TABLE 1Structures of GSNOR inhibitors Inhibition of the ADH1B (β2-ADH), ADH4 (π-ADH), and ADH7 (σ-ADH) was evaluated by determining the inhibitory effect of GSNOR inhibitors on the rate of oxidation of ethanol by each of these ADH isozymes. The assay mixture contained a saturating amount of NAD+ (1–2 mm) and ethanol at its Km concentration for each of the respective enzyme. All assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA and involved determining the rate of formation of NADH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Specific assay conditions for each isozyme are as follows. (a) Studies with ADH1B involved adding 3.5 μg of the enzyme to the assay mixture containing 2 mm NAD+, 1 mm ethanol, and the inhibitor. (b) Studies with ADH7 involved adding 0.5 μg of enzyme to the assay mixture containing 2 mm NAD+, 30 mm ethanol, and the inhibitor. (c) Studies with ADH4 involved adding 19.5 μg of the enzyme to the assay mixture containing 1 mm NAD+, 35 mm ethanol and the inhibitor. (d) Studies with GSNOR involved adding 0.1 μg of the enzyme to an assay mixture containing 15 μm NADH, 5 μm GSNO, and the inhibitor. Inhibition experiments with the GSNOR inhibitors were conducted at 25 °C in 3 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Five different concentrations of GSNO or NADH were used when they were the varied substrates and maintained at 10 and 15 μm, respectively, when present as the nonvaried substrate. A minimum of three inhibitor concentrations were used, and the rate of NADH and GSNO consumption was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The data were fit to the competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition models, and the model best fitting the data was chosen on the basis of F-statistics performed using the Graphpad Prism 4.0. Fluorescence studies were conducted in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at room temperature using a Fluoromax-2 fluorescence spectrometer (Instruments S.A., Inc., Edison, NJ). The equilibrium dissociation constant of GSNOR inhibitors was determined by measuring the changes in the fluorescence of GSNOR-bound NADH (λex = 350 nm; λem = 455 nm) upon the addition of inhibitor. During the experiment, increasing amounts of inhibitor were added to a solution containing 2 μm GSNOR and 1.7 μm NADH. The decrease in fluorescence at 455 nm with each addition of inhibitor was plotted against the final concentration of inhibitor, and the data were fitted to Equation 1 using nonlinear regression to obtain the dissociation constant of the inhibitor for GSNOR-NADH complex, ΔF=ΔFLt+Et+KD−Lt+Et+KD−4LTET2ET(Eq. 1) In Equation 1, ΔF is the change in the fluorescence at 455 nm upon the addition of inhibitor. ΔFM is the maximum fluorescence change that was obtained from curve fitting. [ET] and [LT] are the concentrations of GSNOR and inhibitor, respectively. KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the formation of GSNOR·NADH·inhibitor complex. The data were fitted using the Graphpad Prism 4.0. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. For the experiments, 1–2 × 106 cells were plated in 6-well plates with or without 33 μm compounds 16 h before the experiment. (Later experiments showed that pretreatment with compounds had no effect on the rate of accumulation of nitroso species inside the cells). On the day of the experiment, the medium was replaced with a fresh 3 ml of medium, and the cells were treated with compounds for a predetermined length of time. Following the incubation period, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off of the plate in 250 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 1 mm EDTA) and lysed by sonication using a microtip probe (three pulses of 30% duty cycle; 2 output control on a Branson Sonicator). The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 16,000 × g), and the cell lysate was analyzed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad dye-binding protein assay. The concentration of nitroso compounds in the cell lysate was determined using the triiodide-based chemiluminescence method (13.Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using a Sievers 280 nitric oxide analyzer. Briefly, cell lysates were treated with 15% (v/v) of a sulfanilamide solution (5% (w/v) in 0.2 m HCl) and kept at room temperature for 5 min to remove nitrite. The triiodide mixture was prepared fresh every day as described earlier (14.Zhang Y. Hogg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7891-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and kept at 60 °C in the reaction vessel. The concentration of nitroso species was derived from a standard curve generated using GSNO. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes using DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. On the day of the experiment, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium containing C3 (33 μm) alone or a mixture of C3 and l-NAME (1.1 mm), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for varied lengths of time. At indicated times, the cells were quenched, and the lysate was analyzed for S-nitrosothiol content by the biotin switch assay as described by Jaffrey et al. (15.Jaffrey S.R.

Med. 2008; 44: 1362-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (17.Zhang Y. Keszler A. Broniowska K.A. Hogg N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, free sulfydryls in ∼200 μg of cell lysate were blocked with 20 mm S-methyl methanethiosulfonate in 1 ml of HEN buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.1 mm Neocupronine) containing 2% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min. Free S-methyl methanethiosulfonate was removed by gel filtration spin columns, and the blocked proteins were labeled with 1 mm (N-(6-(biotinamido)hexyl)-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)-propionamide) (Pierce) in the presence or absence of 30 mm ascorbate and 2 μm CuCl for 3 h. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded in each lane, and the degree of biotinylation (and hence S-nitrosylation) determined using an anti-biotin antibody (Sigma). For the isolation of biotinylated proteins, equal amounts of biotinylated RAW cell extract were treated with streptavidin-agarose and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. The resin was extensively washed with a washing buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, containing 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% β-octyl glucoside) before eluting them using SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 500 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 40 °C for 2 h. The eluted proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were probed with IKKβ antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and immunodetected by chemiluminescence. A549/NfκB-luc cells (Panomics; Quantitative Biology) harboring a luciferase reporter under the control of six consensus NF-κB binding motifs were propagated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 and in DMEM with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. During the experiments, 105 cells were plated with 2 ml of medium and 100 μg/ml hygromycin in 12-well plates. Cells were treated with C3 for 4 h followed by TNFα (50 ng/ml) treatment for 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using a commercial kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase activity was measured using a manual luminometer, and the data were normalized to the total protein concentration determined using the BCA protein assay. A549 or RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in F-12k or DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, respectively. A549 (2 × 105) and RAW 264.7 (2.5 × 105) were plated in 35-mm plates, or 50,000 A549 cells were plated in 24-well plates on the day before the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the medium was replaced with fresh medium plus or minus varied concentrations of C3 for 4 h. In some experiments, the cells were also treated with MG132 (40 μm final) for 1 h. Following the pretreatments, the cells were treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 5 min for the analysis of phospho-IκBα, IκBα, phospho-IKKα/β, and IKKβ and for 6 h for analysis of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) before quenching them with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm NaF. Samples were vortexed, boiled for 5 min, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and loaded onto a 10% precast SDS- polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were probed overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was detected using a GE Healthcare ECL Plus chemiluminescence kit. Mice were anesthetized with diethyl ether. A thoracotomy was performed to expose thoracic and abdominal aorta. A 25-gauge syringe was inserted into the apex of the left ventricle and perfused free of blood with oxygenated Krebs Henseleit buffer. The right atrium was cut to provide an exit for blood. The aorta was removed and cleaned of fat and adventitia. The aorta was cut into 2-mm-long segments and mounted on a four-channel wire myograph (AD Instruments). Vessel rings were maintained in 10-ml organ baths with oxygenated PSS (95% O2 and 5% CO2) at 37 °C. Rings were allowed to equilibrate for 80 min with the buffer in each organ bath changed every 20 min. One gram of pretension was placed on each aortic ring (appropriate starting tension for optimal vasomotor function, as determined in previous experiments). An eight-channel octal bridge (Powerlab) and data acquisition software (Chart version 5.2.2) were used to record all force measurements. After equilibration for 80 min, 1 μm phenylephrine was added to each ring for submaximal contraction. After stabilization, either C3 or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was added to the rings, and the tone of the rings was determined. For the determination of SNP and C3 dose-response relationships, aortic rings were precontracted with 10−6m phenylephrine, and SNP or C3 was then added in increasing concentrations from 10−9 to 10−4m. The cytosolic fraction of RAW264.7 cells (20 μl) was mixed with 40 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 200 μm phosphocreatine, 100 μm cGMP) and, when necessary, supplied with 50 μm C3 and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were then supplied with 50 μm GSNO and incubated for an additional 10 min. At the end of incubation, 0.3 μg of purified sGC was added to the sample, which was transferred to 37 °C, and the cyclase reaction was initiated by 1 mm GTP/[α-32P]GTP. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by 0.5 ml of 150 mm zinc acetate, followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 200 mm sodium carbonate. The formed zinc carbonate pellet containing the bulk of unreacted GTP was precipitated by 10 min of centrifugation at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded on a 1-ml alumina oxide column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. cGMP was eluted from the column with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, collected, and quantified by a scintillation counter. A high throughput screening approach was used for identifying novel inhibitors of GSNOR. Screening for GSNOR inhibitors was performed in the presence of saturating and unsaturating concentrations of NAD+ and the alcohol substrate, octanol (18.Estonius M. Höög J.O. Danielsson O. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15080-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), to increase the probability of identifying compounds that bind only in the GSNO binding site of GSNOR. Three compounds (C1–C3), displaying high affinity and specificity for inhibiting GSNOR within the alcohol dehydrogenase family, were selected for further investigation (Tables 1 and S1). Each of the selected compounds obeyed Lipinski's rules (19.Lipinski C.A. Lombardo F. Dominy B.W. Feeney P.J. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 46: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8492) Google Scholar) for druglike properties and had 2-order of magnitude lower IC50 than the present GSNOR inhibitor, dodecanoic acid (20.Sanghani P.C. Stone C.L. Ray B.D. Pindel E.V. Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10720-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Dead end kinetic inhibition and fluorescence binding studies were performed to determine the mechanism by which C1–C3 inhibited GSNOR. As evident from Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S1, the inhibitors exhibit noncompetitive or uncompetitive inhibition against varied concentrations of GSNO or NADH. This suggested that neither of the substrates were able to completely prevent the compounds from binding to GSNOR. The inability of both of the substrates to overcome the inhibition completely is also consistent with C1–C3 binding to multiple enzyme complexes in the kinetic pathway (shown in Scheme 1). Inhibition by binding to a site outside the active site in GSNOR was unlikely, since the type of inhibition by the compounds against NADH and GSNOR would have been similar. An additional dead-end inhibition study involving dodecanoic acid as inhibitor against varied GSNO was performed to determine the type of complexes that an inhibitor binding in the substrate binding site (20.Sanghani P.C. Stone C.L. Ray B.D. Pindel E.V. Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10720-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 21.Sanghani P.C. Robinson H. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10778-10786Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) would form in the kinetic pathway of GSNO reduction. Dodecanoic acid was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor against varied concentrations of GSNO, although it binds into the GSNO binding site (Table 2). The noncompetitive inhibition of GSNOR by dodecanoic acid can be explained by its binding to GSNOR at more than one place in the kinetic pathway, one where it competes with GSNO to bind to the enzyme (steps 1 and 2 in Scheme 1) and one where GSNO does not normally bind in the kinetic pathway (step 3 in Scheme 1). The noncompetitive inhibition of GSNOR by C1–C3 against varied GSNO can also be explained by their forming such E·NADH·I (EAI in Scheme 1) and E·NAD+·I (EQI in Scheme 1) complexes. The uncompetitive inhibition by C1 and C3 and almost uncompetitive inhibition by C2 (although inhibition by C2 statistically fits the noncompetitive mechanism better, the Kis is 5-fold higher than Kii and has high S.E. values) against varied NADH can be explained by the compounds binding to the E·NADH complex in the nearly ordered kinetic mechanism of GSNOR and the high affinity of NADH (KD = 0.05 μm) for GSNOR (20.Sanghani P.C. Stone C.L. Ray B.D. Pindel E.V. Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10720-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both of these factors would make the contribution of E·I very small in the inhibition of the enzyme under the experimental conditions and make the inhibition uncompetitive. The mechanism by which C1–C3 inhibit GSNOR is similar to that by which the sulfoxide and amide compounds inhibit horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (22.Chadha V.K. Leidal K.G. Plapp B.V. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To summarize, the dead end kinetic inhibition studies are consistent with C1–C3 binding into the GSNO binding site and forming GSNOR·NADH·I (EAI in Scheme 1), GSNOR·NAD+·I (EQI), and GSNOR·I (EI) complexes.TABLE 2Mechanism of inhibition of GSNOR by GSNOR inhibitorsCompoundVaried substrateType of inhibitionKisKiiKDaKD is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the inhibitor for binding to the GSNOR·NADH complex, obtained by measuring the changes in the fluorescence of GSNOR-bound NADH with the addition of inhibitor (λex = 350 nm; λem = 455 nm).

Open table in a new tab Equilibrium binding studies were conducted to support the findings of the kinetic dead end inhibition studies. The addition of C3 to the GSNOR·NADH binary complex resulted in the quenching as well as blue shift in NADH emission (compare curves b and c in Fig. 1 A). This is consistent with the formation of the GSNOR·NADH·C3 ternary complex. A similar quenching of the fluorescence of the coenzyme dihydropyridine ring was observed when the amide inhibitors were added to the horse liver ADH·NADH complex (23.Sarma R.H. Woronick C.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fluorescence binding studies were also conducted in the presence of the alcohol substrate, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (12-HDDA), to determine if C3 was excluding the substrate from the GSNOR active site. The formation of GSNOR·NADH·12-hydroxydodecanoate abortive ternary complex was reported earlier (20.Sanghani P.C. Stone C.L. Ray B.D. Pindel E.V. Hurley T.D. Bosron W.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10720-10729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Binding of 12-HDDA to the GSNOR·NADH complex resulted in an increase in the fluorescence of NADH, as shown in Fig. 1B (compare curves b and c). The addition of C3 to the mixture resulted in a spectrum (Fig. 1B, curve d) that was consistent with the displacement of 12-HDDA out of the active site and formation of the GSNOR·NADH·C3 ternary complex (curve d has higher fluorescence than that in Fig. 1A, curve c, because not all of 12-HDDA has been displaced by C3). These fluorescence binding experiments suggest that C3 excludes only the alcohol/aldehyde substrate from the binding site of GSNOR. C1 and C2 also exhibited similar effects on NADH fluorescence in the presence or absence of 12-HDDA, indicating that they too, like C3, only exclude the alcohol substrate from the GSNOR active site (data not shown). The fluorescence change observed upon the formation of the GSNOR·NADH·inhibitor complex was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant of the inhibitors for the GSNOR·NADH complex (Fig. 1C). The equilibrium dissociation constants of C1–C3 were in the low micromolar range (Table 2), suggesting that the affinity for the GSNOR·NADH complex was sufficient for the compounds to be effective inside the cells. C1 and C3 had a significantly higher affinity for the GSNOR·NADH complex than C2, as evident from their 3–5-fold lower equilibrium dissociation constants. The ability of the newly discovered inhibitors to inhibit GSNOR inside the cells was tested using a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7 cells). RAW 264.7 cells were treated with inhibitors alone or in combination with GSNO. The accumulation of intracellular SNOs was determined as a function of time and inhibitor concentration (Fig. 2, A and B). Significantly higher amounts of SNOs accumulated in cells treated with both GSNO and the inhibitor than in those treated with GSNO alone (Fig. 2A). C1 and C3 appeared to be more effective than C2 in inhibiting GSNOR inside the cells, as evident from higher accumulation of SNOs (Fig. 2, A and B). These studies demonstrate that C1–C3 are able to inhibit intracellular GSNOR. The dependence of SNO accumulation on the concentration of compounds in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 2B) suggested that it was possible to regulate the extent of S-nitrosylation with the GSNOR inhibitors. An analysis of the molecular size of the nitrosylated species inside the treated cells showed that more than 95% of the nitrosylated species were greater than 5 kDa in size. Furthermore, 21–28% of the nitrosylated species in treated cells were resistant to mercury pretreatment, suggesting that N-nitrosothiolated proteins were also getting formed inside the cells. The effect of GSNOR inhibition on the nitrosylation of cellular proteins was also examined using the biotin switch assay technique developed by Jaffrey et al. (24.Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) with modifications by Wang et al. (16.Wang X. Kettenhofen N.J. Shiva S. Hogg N. Gladwin M.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44: 1362-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). C3 increased the nitrosylation of cellular proteins in RAW 264.7 cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). The effects of C3 on the nitrosylation of cellular proteins appeared to peak around 8 h before coming down. The accumulation of SNOs was less if cells were simultaneously treated with C3 and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, l-NAME (Fig. 2C). These data sug"

We show that TgCPL is the primary target of the compound morpholinurea-leucyl-homophenyl-vinyl sulfone phenyl (LHVS), which was previously shown to inhibit parasite invasion by blocking the release of invasion proteins from microneme secretory organelles. As shown by fluorescently labeled LHVS and TgCPL-specific antibodies, TgCPL is associated with a discrete vesicular structure in the apical region of extracellular parasites but is found in multiple puncta throughout the cytoplasm of intracellular replicating parasites. LHVS fails to label cells lacking TgCPL due to targeted disruption of the TgCPL gene in two different parasite strains.

We discuss possible roles for TgCPL as a protease involved in the degradation or limited proteolysis of parasite proteins involved in invasion. The recent completion of many genome-sequencing projects has allowed an unprecedented view of the complete set of proteases in biologically or medically important organisms (1Puente X.S. Sánchez L.M. Overall C.M. López-Otín C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Of the five mechanistically distinct catalytic types (serine, cysteine, aspartyl, metallo, and threonine), cysteine proteases are the second largest group. In particular, cysteine proteases of the C1 papain family of “lysosomal” cathepsins have garnered intense scrutiny because of their key roles in cancer, embryogenesis, heart disease, osteoporosis, immunity, and infectious diseases. Microbial cathepsins, particularly those expressed by parasites, have also attracted attention recently because of their potential as targets for treatment of helminthic and protozoal infections (2Rosenthal P.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 3McKerrow J.H. Caffrey C. Kelly B. Loke P. Sajid M. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2006; 1: 497-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects virtually all warm-blooded animals and approximately one-third of the human population worldwide. Although most Toxoplasma infections are benign, severe opportunistic disease is seen in immunodeficient or immunosuppressed individuals or congenitally infected babies. T. gondii is an obligate intracellular organism that uses an actin-myosin-based motility system to actively invade nucleated host cells (4Keeley A. Soldati D. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 528-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Carruthers V. Boothroyd J.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2007; 10: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The parasite secretes a variety of proteins during and after cell invasion that contribute to recognition of the host cell, formation of an adhesive “moving” junction, modulation of host signaling pathways and gene expression, and remodeling of the parasitophorous vacuole in preparation for parasite growth (6Zhou X.W.

Although it has been known for some time that many Toxoplasma secretory proteins are post-translationally modified by proteolysis before and/or after secretion, in most cases, the consequences of proteolysis or the specific protease involved are unclear. Analysis of the T. gondii genome indicates the existence of five genes encoding cathepsin proteases of the papain family, including three cathepsin C proteases (TgCPC1, TgCPC2, and TgCPC3), one cathepsin B (Toxopain-1 or TgCPB), and one cathepsin L (TgCPL). TgCPC1 and TgCPC2 are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole after parasite invasion and are proposed to function in nutrient acquisition (8Que X. Engel J.C. Ferguson D. Wunderlich A. Tomavo S. Reed S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4994-5003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TgCPC3 is not expressed in tachyzoites, a rapidly dividing form of the parasite that is most commonly studied in the laboratory. TgCPB is localized in club-shaped invasion organelles called rhoptries, where it may act as a maturase for rhoptry proteins involved in modulation of the host cell (9Que X. Ngo H. Lawton J. Gray M.

TgCPL is predicted to be a type II membrane protein, and a recent report by Reed and co-workers (10Huang R. Que X. Hirata K. Brinen L.S. Lee J.H. Hansell E. Engel J. Sajid M. Reed S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2009; 164: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed that it has enzymatic activity with a low pH optimum and that it occupies a membrane-bound structure in the apical region of extracellular parasites. This same study revealed that T. gondii expresses two endogenous inhibitors of cysteine proteases (TgICP1 and TgICP2), but their role in regulating parasite or host cysteine proteases remains to be determined. Similar inhibitors are expressed by other parasites, including Trypanosoma cruzi, that act on host proteases, and the crystal structure of an inhibitor (chagasin)-enzyme (human cathepsin L) complex was recently reported (11Ljunggren A. Redzynia I. Alvarez-Fernandez M. Abrahamson M. Mort J.S. Krupa J.C. Jaskolski M. Bujacz G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we screened a small library of cathepsin and proteasome inhibitors and identified two compounds that substantially impair Toxoplasma cell invasion (12Teo C.F. Zhou X.W. Bogyo M. Carruthers V.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

Further analysis revealed that LHVS blocks parasite attachment and gliding motility by impairing the release of proteins from a distinct set of apical secretory organelles called micronemes.

The PCR product was gel-purified using a Qiagen gel extraction kit, initially ligated into pGEM-T Easy Vector (pGEM-T/100TgCPL), and transformed into the DH5α Escherichia coli strain. Clones were sequenced in both directions and digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII. The complete cDNA encoding TgCPL was also amplified, cloned, sequenced, and deposited in GenBankTM (accession number DQ407191). For recombinant protein expression, the 100TgCPL cDNA was ligated into BamHI- and HindIII-digested pQE30 vector, which provided an in-frame His6 tag at the N terminus (Qiagen), thereby generating pQE30/100TgCPL. Competent E. coli M15[pRep4] cells (Qiagen) were transformed with pQE30/100TgCPL and grown at 37 °C in Terrific Broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin to A600 ∼0.6 when 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added before additional culturing for 5 h. Inclusion bodies were purified from the harvested cells and resuspended in denaturing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 8 m urea). Solubilized inclusion bodies were then incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), equilibrated with the same buffer, overnight at room temperature. The mixture was loaded into a column and washed with 20–30 column volumes of denaturing buffer, and denatured proform TgCPL was eluted with elution buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, pH 4.5). Elution fractions were pooled and concentrated ∼5-fold using a spin concentrator (Millipore) and dialyzed overnight back into denaturing buffer. The denatured protein was then reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 45 min at 37 °C and diluted to 20 μg/ml with ice-cold refolding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 250 mm l-arginine, 2 mm reduce glutathione, 1 mm oxidized glutathione). After incubation at 4 °C for 48 h with moderate stirring, proform recombinant TgCPL (rTgCPL) was concentrated ∼10-fold and dialyzed overnight into proform buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 900 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA). To activate the protease, proform rTgCPL was exchanged into activation buffer (100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 900 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA), followed by an increase of the dithiothreitol concentration to 5 mm and incubation at 37 °C for 4–5 h. The efficiency of maturation was monitored using SDS-PAGE. Autoactivated rTgCPL was then concentrated to 4.7 mg/ml, supplemented with 0.825 mm LHVS, and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −80 °C to await crystallization. A primary injection of rabbits with 200 μg of proform rTgCPL in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) was followed by four boosts of 200 μg each in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma) at 2-week intervals. A polyclonal mouse antiserum also was raised against proform rTgCPL by immunizing mice with a single injection of 25 μg of recombinant protein mixed with TiterMax Gold adjuvant (Cytex). Serum was collected 4 weeks postimmunization. RH strain tachyzoites, grown in human foreskin fibroblasts and Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, were filter-purified, washed with Dulbecco's minimal essential medium-glutamine-HEPES medium (Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES), and resuspended at 5 × 108 ml−1. Fifty μl of parasite suspension was added to each well of a round bottom microwell plate containing 0.5 μl of DMSO or 20 μm BODIPY-LHVS (BO-LHVS) in DMSO. After labeling for 30 min in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator, the plate was cooled on ice and centrifuged 5 min at 4 °C. Forty-five μl of supernatant was removed, and parasites were lysed in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and placed in a 100 °C water bath for 5 min. Samples were vortexed vigorously, microcentrifuged to remove insoluble material, and resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were imaged on a Typhoon Trio PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and quantified using ImageQuant software. For activity-based protein profiling of rTgCPL, BO-LHVS (4 μm, 400 nm, 40 nm, 4 nm, or 400 pm) was incubated with 400 nm active enzyme or heat-inactivated (90 °C, 5 min) enzyme at 37 °C for 30 min. Additionally, rTgCPL (4 μm, 400 nm, 40 nm, 4 nm, or 400 pm) was incubated with 400 nm BO-LHVS at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were resolved and imaged as described above. Genomic flanking sequences of the TgCPL gene were obtained from the Toxoplasma gondii data base (ToxoDB (39Gajria B. Bahl A. Brestelli J. Dommer J. Fischer S. Gao X. Heiges M. Iodice J. Kissinger J.C. Mackey A.J. Pinney D.F. Roos D.S. Stoeckert Jr., C.J. Wang H. Brunk B.P.

Primers 3′dhfr-ts.PacI.5′TgCat.L.F, 3′TgCatL.1749411.F, 5′HXG.NsiI.3′TgCatL.R, and 5′TgCatL.1756165.R (supplemental Table S1) were used to amplify ∼1.5 kb of the 5′- and 3′-sequence flanking the gene. The flanks were amplified to have overlap on one end with the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) selectable marker cassette, and similarly, the DHFR-TS marker cassette was amplified to contain TgCPL sequences on the ends. RH genomic DNA was used as template for amplifying the 5′- and 3′-flanks, and pDHFR-TSc plasmid (13Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) was used as template for amplifying the DHFR-TS selectable marker. A fusion PCR product was then amplified using primers, and the three individual 5′, 3′, and DHFR-TS fragments as templates. The TgCPL knock-out construct (13 μg) was electroporated into RH and Ku80 tachyzoites using conditions described previously (14Brydges S.D. Harper J.M. Parussini F. Coppens I. Carruthers V.B. Biol. Cell. 2008; 100: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Parasites were grown in 24-well plates for 2 days in the absence of drug selection before transferring them to new wells containing 1 μm pyrimethamine (Sigma). After 2 weeks of selection, parasite clones were derived by limited dilution in 96-well plates. Clones were screened for the absence of TgCPL expression by immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy. Clones were also assessed for correct integration of the construct at the TgCPL locus by PCR using the following primers depicted in Fig. 2A: TgCpl.213.F (a), TgCpl.853.R (b), dhfrHXGPRTdhfr.1.F (c), CplDHFRko.847.R (d), 3′TgCatL.1749205.F (e), and dhfr5′end.105.R (f) (supplemental Table S1). Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and indirect immunofluorescence assay were performed essentially as described previously (15Harper J.M. Huynh M.H. Coppens I. Parussini F. Moreno S. Carruthers V.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4551-4563Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antibodies were diluted 1:5,000 for immunoblotting and 1:250 for indirect immunofluorescence assay. Tachyzoites were labeled with 200 nm BO-LHVS for 30 min in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and antibody staining. Images were acquired on a Nikon E800 upright fluorescence microscope with a SpotRT slider camera or a Zeiss Axiovert Observer Z1 inverted fluorescence microscope and an AxioCAM MRm camera and processed using Compix software or Zeiss Axiovision 4.3 software, respectively. Purified protein was screened at the high throughput facility at the Hauptman Woodward Institute to identify initial crystallization conditions (16Luft J.R. Collins R.J. Fehrman N.A. Lauricella A.M. Veatch C.K. DeTitta G.T. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Twenty-four crystallization leads were identified at the 4-week time point. One of these leads was further optimized in house using sitting drop vapor diffusion to produce crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction data collection. Upon thawing, 1 μl of autoactivated protein solution (4.7 mg/ml) was mixed with an equivalent amount of reservoir solution (40% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m ammonium bromide, and 0.1 m sodium citrate at pH 4.0). The resultant drop was equilibrated over a 100-μl reservoir at 25 °C. American football-shaped crystals measuring ∼30 μm from point to point appeared within 2 weeks. The crystals were cryoprotected by adding 2.5 μl of reservoir solution followed by 0.5 μl of ethylene glycol directly to the drop. Crystals were then mounted in cryoloops and frozen in liquid nitrogen in preparation for x-ray diffraction experiments. Crystals of TgCPL were screened at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource on beamline 11-1 using the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource automated mounting system (17Cohen A.E. Ellis P.J. Miller M.D. Deacon A.M. Phizackerley R.P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2002; 35: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Data from a single crystal maintained at 100 K were collected at a wavelength of 0.98 Å using the Blu-Ice software package (18McPhillips T.M. McPhillips S.E. Chiu H.J. Cohen A.E. Deacon A.M. Ellis P.J. Garman E. Gonzalez A. Sauter N.K. Phizackerley R.P. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2002; 9: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and processed using HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The crystals belong to space group P43212 with unit cell dimensions of 65.6 × 65.6 × 149.8 Å. One complex of the active protease with its propeptide is present in the asymmetric unit, giving a solvent content of ∼43% and a Matthews coefficient of ∼2.2 Å3/Da. However, the asymmetric unit was initially believed to contain one or, remotely possible, two copies of only the active protease in complex with LHVS, which would correspond to Matthews coefficients of ∼3.3 or 1.65 Å3/Da, respectively. The structure of TgCPL was solved by molecular replacement with the program Phaser (20McCoy A.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), using the full resolution range of the data and a search model derived from human procathepsin L (Protein Data Bank code 1cs8). The sequence identity between the active protease domains of TgCPL and 1cs8 is about 50%, whereas the identity between the full-length constructs of the two proteins is about 42%. Because it was expected that the crystal would contain the protease domain in complex with the inhibitor LHVS, the search model was modified prior to molecular replacement to be consistent with this expectation (21Schwarzenbacher, R. A., Godzik, A., Grzechnik, S. K., Jaroszewski, L., Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 60, 1229–1236.Google Scholar). First, the propeptide domain of 1cs8 was manually removed, and then, using a pairwise sequence alignment created with ClustalW (22Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22841) Google Scholar), the non-conserved amino acids were truncated or removed using the program CHAINSAW (23Stein N. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2008; 41: 641-643Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The resulting Phaser-placed model was refined as a rigid body using Refmac5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) and manually edited using Coot (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). Refinement continued by iteration of manual editing in Coot, followed by restrained refinement in Refmac5. For all steps from data preparation through refinement, the CCP4 suite of programs (26Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar, 27Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) was used. After several building/refinement cycles of nearly full-length protease, large polypeptide-like blobs of positive difference density remained, and R factors were stalled near 40%. This suggested that the asymmetric unit contained more than the single copy of the protease that was placed by molecular replacement, but there did not appear to be enough room to place a second copy. LHVS was present in the protein solution, and although it is somewhat peptide-like in appearance, the difference density extended well beyond the active site and was much too large to be accounted for solely by inhibitor. It was then realized that the propeptide domain was not purified away from the active proteases. The model of the protease domain was submitted to ARP/wARP (28Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) to use for initial phase calculations in the automated rebuilding of the full-length proform of the TgCPL construct. This step also served to reduce bias toward the search model. Indeed, ARP/wARP was able to build 64 amino acids belonging to the propeptide in addition to rebuilding most of the existing model, which resulted in a drop of the R factor by ∼15%. The iteration of building and refinement continued as before with this more complete model. In the final cycles of refinement, the propeptide and the protease were described by four translation/libration/screw groups each, with group boundaries suggested by the TLSMD server (29Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 30Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Translation/libration/screw parameters were refined for each group prior to restrained refinement in Refmac5. Model quality was monitored and validated using Coot, MolProbity (31Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall 3rd, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar), and Rfree. Data collection and model refinement statistics are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. One hundred sixty-five water molecules, one ethylene glycol molecule from the cryoprotectant, and two halide atoms originating from either the protein storage buffer (chloride) or the mother liquor (bromide) were placed in the final model. The last two corresponded to strong, round difference density peaks that are surrounded primarily by nitrogen atoms but also a few oxygen atoms and do not appear to be water molecules or metal ions because the distances to the closest potential hydrogen bond donors/acceptors or coordinating ligands are too great. The surrounding atoms are contributed by symmetry-related protein molecules, so the modeled halides are involved in crystal contacts. A search of the Protein Data Bank (32Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27938) Google Scholar) for “vinyl sulfone” yielded 14 hits, all of which were inhibitors bound to papain-like proteases or to the ATP-dependent protease, HslV. These vinyl sulfone inhibitor structures were then manually examined for a scaffold that approximated that of LHVS. Through this search, we identified the inhibitor N-[1S-(2-phenylethyl)-3-phenylsulfonylallyl]-4-methyl-2R-piperazinyl carbonylaminovaleramide (APC3328) bound to human cathepsin K (Protein Data Bank code 1mem) (33McGrath M.E. Klaus J.L. Barnes M.G. Brömme D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which differs from LHVS only in that it contains a piperazine ring in place of the morpholine ring of LHVS; a single-atom difference of nitrogen versus oxygen. Structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the 1mem coordinates, so it was possible to inspect the electron density of the APC3328 inhibitor. Difference electron density shows that the rotamer selected for the inhibitor's leucine side chain is not ideal, so the side chain was altered from the deposited 1mem coordinates to a rotamer that more favorably fits the density.TABLE 2Model refinement statisticsData setTgon077550AABResolution (Å)32.8–1.99No. of reflections23,178No. of reflections in test set1,186Rwork0.165Rfree0.206RMSD bonds (Å)0.01RMSD angles (degrees)1.16Protein atoms2,370Non-protein atoms174Ramachandran statistics (%)aDetermined using the MolProbity Server (50).Residues in favored regions96.6Residues in allowed regions100Unmodeled residuesbResidues −11 to 0 are an N-terminal His tag and linker that replaced the first 104 propeptide residues of the full-length protein sequence (ToxoDB (39) accession number 645.m00037) during cloning.−11-0, 105p–107p, 183p–198p, 1TLS groups (residues)cDetermined using the TLSMD server (30).A: 2–15, 16–118, 119–135, 136–224; P: 108–123, 124–136, 137–168, 169–182Mean Biso + BTLS protein atoms (Å2)30.9Mean Biso non-protein atoms (Å2)26.7Protein Data Bank entry3f75a Determined using the MolProbity Server (50Davis I.W.

Open table in a new tab APC3328 was initially placed in the active site of TgCPL by performing a least squares superposition of all the catalytic triad atoms of TgCPL and 1mem using Lsqkab (34Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2380) Google Scholar), after first removing the propeptide residues from TgCPL. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the catalytic triads is 0.28 Å, with differences between the side chain atoms of the histidine/asparagine residues contributing the most to this value. Nitrogen N4 of the piperazine ring in the superimposed inhibitor was substituted with oxygen to change APC3328 into LHVS, and the side chains of the catalytic triad residues of TgCPL were substituted with those of the superimposed 1mem structure. The side chain amide of Gln69 was flipped 180° so that Nϵ could hydrogen-bond with O4 of the LHVS morpholine ring; Oϵ of Gln69 is 3.2 Å from Nζ of Lys181p in the propeptide-bound structure. To achieve a more meaningful model of the binding mode, energy minimization of this superimposed, modified ligand was performed. To this end, water molecules were removed, and hydrogen atoms were added to protein and ligand polar groups. The active site was defined as residues within 7.0 Å of the starting position of the superimposed ligand. Energy minimization calculations were carried out with QXP/FLO (35McMartin C. Bohacek R.S. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Protein atoms were fixed during the calculations, with the exception of the side chain of Asn69. LHVS is a dipeptide vinyl sulfone that was originally designed as a selective inhibitor of human cathepsins S and V. However, extensive studies of its specificity have revealed that, although most potent against cathepsins S and V, it is also a moderate inhibitor of human cathepsins K, L, and O2 and a weak inhibitor of human cathepsin B (36Brömme D.

Here we demonstrate a simple method for rapid isolation of proteoglycans (RIP) employing phenol/guanidine/chloroform reagent to purify heparan sulfate (HS) PGs quantitatively from various tissues and cells. We further show that this generic purification methodology, when applied in concert with a BODIPYTM fluorescent label, permits structural analyses on RIP-purified HS at ∼1,000-fold higher sensitivity than standard UV detection methods and ∼10–100-fold higher sensitivity than previous fluorescence detection methods. The utility of RIP-BODIPY methodology was demonstrated by rapid profiling of HS structural composition from small tissue samples, multiple mouse organs, and as little as a few thousand cultured cells. It was also used to generate novel insights into in vivo structural changes in HS from Sulf1 knock-out mice for the first time that differed significantly from previous observations limited to tissue culture experiments. RIP was also applied to purify HS for bioassay testing, exemplified by cell assays of fibroblast growth factor signaling activation; this generated data from 2-O-sulfotransferase knock-out mice and revealed an unexpected deficiency in fibroblast growth factor activation by HS from heterozygous mice.

It is critical in many biological processes (including embryonic development, homeostasis, and wound healing), and lack of HS is lethal in higher organisms such as mice (1Turnbull J. Powell A. Guimond S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 2Bishop J.R. Schuksz M. Esko J.D. Nature. 2007; 446: 1030-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). HS is also involved in a variety of disease processes (such as tumor angiogenesis, pathogen adhesion, and neurodegeneration). It carries out these functions primarily by binding to many different proteins and regulating their functions (1Turnbull J. Powell A. Guimond S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 3Ori A. Wilkinson M.C. Fernig D.G. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 4309-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Specific binding is in part determined by the variation in structure of the HS, primarily in the number and location of sulfate moieties (4Powell A.K. Yates E.A. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 17R-30RCrossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Rudd T.R. Skidmore M.A. Guimond S.E. Cosentino C. Torri G. Fernig D.G. Lauder R.M. Guerrini M. Yates E.A.

There is now intense interest in identifying specific structural motifs within HS responsible for binding and regulation of particular proteins and in exploring the heparanome, the entire complements of HS structures expressed by cells and tissues (1Turnbull J.

However, current methods of purification (such as detergent and guanidium salt extraction followed by protease digestion or chloroform/methanol extraction), although good at purifying HS in large amounts from single sources, suffer several drawbacks. They are lengthy and laborious (involving complex extraction processes and multiple column chromatographic steps) and can also result in alteration of native structure, for example N-desulfation (7Drummond K.J. Yates E.A. Turnbull J.E. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr.

Santini F. Guerrini M. Naggi A. Torri G. Casu B. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 294: 15-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address these problems, our rationale was to devise a simple extraction and purification protocol that was both rapid and streamlined, minimizing transfers to reduce losses in yield and providing HS of sufficient purity for comparative structural and functional analysis. We observed that PGs partition exclusively in the aqueous phase in extractions performed with TRIzol® (a well known phenol/guanidine/chloroform reagent that is widely used to purify DNA and RNA from tissues) (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). This observation led us to develop a method for isolation of PGs, exemplified by HSPGs. Here we demonstrate a novel approach for the rapid isolation of proteoglycans (RIP) from most tissues and cell culture samples that is quick (from cell/tissue sample to ion exchange purification in ∼30 min), reduces loss of material (only one transfer before ion exchange step), and is readily scalable. Furthermore, when coupled to a recently developed method for highly sensitive fluorescent labeling of GAG saccharides with BODIPYTM hydrazide (12Skidmore M.A. Guimond S.E. Dumax-Vorzet A.F. Atrih A. Yates E.A. Turnbull J.E. J. Chromatogr.

BaF3 cells expressing FGFR1c were generously provided by David Ornitz (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Organs from normal adult female CD1 mice were obtained from the University of Liverpool Animal House. Sulf1 knock-out mice were generated as described previously (13Ratzka A. Kalus I. Moser M.

For cerebella preparation, heterozygous littermates were intercrossed, and after genotyping, cerebella were dissected from newborns at postnatal day 6. Mouse brains from mice wild type, heterozygous, or null for 2-O-sulfotransferase (14Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Val Wilson, Edinburgh. Murine Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC number CCL-92) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin G, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells were allowed to reach 10,000 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes, 25-mm dishes, and 24-well plates prior to extraction. Cell numbers were obtained by counting duplicate plates. The extraction of HSPGs is identical to the initial purification procedure for RNA. Briefly, wet tissue or cultured cells were homogenized in a tissue grinder or solubilized in the culture dish with 1 ml of TRIzol reagent/100 mg of tissue or 10-cm2 culture dish. Samples were then incubated for 5 min at room temperature and transferred to polypropylene tubes with the addition of 0.2 ml of chloroform/1 ml of original TRIzol reagent used. Tubes were shaken vigorously for 15 s and incubated a further 3 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at ∼8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. HSPGs are present in the upper, aqueous phase (Fig. 1). The aqueous phase was applied to a 0.1–1 ml DEAE column (∼0.1 ml of bed/ml sample) in a disposable mini-column. The column was washed with 10 volumes of PBS, pH 7.4 and 10 volumes of PBS (0.25 m NaCl), pH 7.4 and eluted with 10 volumes of PBS (2 m NaCl) pH 7.4. PBS (2 m NaCl) fractions were desalted on PD10 gel filtration columns and freeze dried (“crude” GAG fraction, see Fig. 1). Freeze-dried samples were reconstituted in 100 μl of HPLC-grade water and digested in a single tube by sequential addition and incubation at 37 °C with 2.5 milliunits of chondroitin ABC lyase (in 500 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0; 4 h), 10 milliunits of neuraminidase (in 125 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0; 4 h), and 2 mg/ml Pronase (in 500 mm Tris acetate, 50 mm calcium acetate; 16 h). Each enzyme and buffer (at 5× final concentrations) were added at one-fifth volume at each step. The mixture was then subjected to DEAE chromatography and desalting as described above. Finally, the samples were applied to Millipore Biomax centrifuge filters (5,000 nominal molecular weight limit, Millipore, Watford, UK) and centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 rpm. The retentate (50 μl) was brought to 500 μl with HPLC-grade H2O and reapplied to the centrifuge filters. This process was repeated three times to ensure remove of salts and other low molecular weight contaminants. The final retentate (purified GAG fraction, see Fig. 1) was stored at −20 °C until use. Samples in 100 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, were digested by sequential addition at 37 °C of 2.5 milliunits of heparinase I (4 h) followed by 2.5 milliunits of heparinase III (4 h) and finally with 2.5 milliunits of heparinase II (16 h). Samples were then applied to a Propac PA-1 strong-anion exchange column (4.6 × 250 mm; Dionex, Leeds, UK) and eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient over 45 min on a Dionex BioLC HPLC at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Disaccharides were identified with reference to authentic heparin unsaturated disaccharide standards. The amounts of HS present in samples was determined by digesting the purified HS to completion as described above for disaccharide analysis. The molar concentration of the disaccharides present in solution was determined at A232 using the Beer-Lambert law with an extinction coefficient of 5,500 mol−1 cm−1 for the unsaturated bond chromophore generated by heparinase enzymes. Disaccharides obtained as for UV detection were labeled with BODIPY hydrazide, as described previously (12Skidmore M.A. Guimond S.E. Dumax-Vorzet A.F. Atrih A. Yates E.A. Turnbull J.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1135: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized samples were suspended in BODIPY fluorescent label hydrazide (5 mg/ml in methanol;10 μl). Methanol was removed by centrifugation under vacuum, and samples were resuspended in DMSO:ethanoic acid (17:3 v/v; 10 μl) prior to incubation for 4 h at room temperature in the dark. Labeled samples were reduced using sodium borohydride (1 m, aqueous; 10 μl) and incubated for 30 min (room temperature) prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen and lyophilization. The fluorescently labeled disaccharides were resuspended in DMSO:H2O (50:50 v/v, 1 ml) prior to loading onto a Propac PA-1 column as above, eluted using a linear gradient of 0–1 m sodium chloride (in 150 mm NaOH) over 30 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min on a Shimadzu HPLC system. Peaks were detected using inline fluorescence detection at excitation wavelength of λ = 488 nm and an emission wavelength of λ = 520 nm using a Shimadzu RF-551 detector. The column was reconditioned by washing with 2 m NaCl (in 300 mm NaOH) before equilibrating in 150 mm NaOH. Previously calculated correction factors were applied to quantitate the observed disaccharides (12Skidmore M.A. Guimond S.E. Dumax-Vorzet A.F. Atrih A. Yates E.A. Turnbull J.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1135: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). BaF3 cells (naturally devoid of HS and FGF receptors) transfected with FGFR1c were maintained as described previously (15Guimond S.E. Turnbull J.E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1343-1346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For proliferation assays, 10,000 cells/well were plated on a 96-well plate with culture medium (100 μl, RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin-G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate without IL-3) and were incubated with 2 ng/ml IL-3 or 1 nm FGF-2 with and without heparin/HS at the concentrations indicated. After 72 h at 37 °C, 250 μg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was added, and the cells were incubated a further 4 h at 37 °C. Following solubilization in 10% SDS, 0.01 n HCl, the plates were read on a Multiscan EX spectrophotometric plate reader (Thermo Electron, Basingstoke, UK) at 570 nm. Increase in absorbance is proportional to cell number. To streamline purification of HS from tissues and cell culture, we examined the benefits of a strategy exploiting phenol/guanidine/chloroform reagent (e.g. the commercial reagent TRIzol) (Fig. 1). We observed that GAGs (including HS) appear exclusively in the aqueous layer after phase separation. Following this initial isolation step, the HS is subjected to routine anion exchange chromatography on a mini-column and desalted, resulting (typically after ∼2 h) in a crude GAG preparation that can be used for initial structural analysis (Fig. 1). Further purification was achieved by sequential single-pot enzyme digestion and a second anion exchange/desalting procedure to remove unwanted GAGs and contaminating proteins. This results (after ∼24 h) in highly purified HS preparation suitable for detailed structural profiling and also bioassays (Fig. 1). A systematic approach was adopted to determine the efficacy of the RIP method in terms of recoveries (spiking experiments with 3H-labeled HSPGs) and maintenance of structural integrity. We examined the efficacy of the RIP method of purification in terms of yields. Initially 3H-labeled syndecan-1 was spiked into 100 mg of fresh mouse brain homogenate and HS purified by RIP. The amount of 3H label in the organic phase, interphase, and aqueous phase of the TRIzol extract was determined and showed that >95% of the spiked 3H-labeled HSPG was recovered in the aqueous phase (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained by comparing yields of spiked samples from liver extracts (data not shown). It is well known that HS can be N-desulfated when exposed to low pH conditions (7Drummond K.J. Yates E.A. Turnbull J.E. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Inoue Y. Nagasawa K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 46: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Jaseja M. Rej R.N.

Res. 1996; 294: 15-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because TRIzol has a pH of around 4.0, it was necessary to determine whether HS underwent any desulfation during the RIP procedure. Heparin, a highly sulfated variant of HS, was used as a proxy molecule in these control experiments and was subjected to RIP purification followed by 13C NMR analysis (10Yates E.A. Santini F. Guerrini M. Naggi A. Torri G. Casu B. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 294: 15-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting NMR spectra confirmed that the purified heparin was identical to parental (untreated) heparin (data not shown), confirming that the procedure does not structurally modify these polysaccharides. We next exploited the RIP method by coupling it with a newly developed method for reducing end labeling of GAG saccharides with the fluorescent tag BODIPY hydrazide (12Skidmore M.A. Guimond S.E. Dumax-Vorzet A.F. Atrih A. Yates E.A. Turnbull J.E. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1135: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). With a detection limit of ∼100 fmol, this provides a >1,000-fold increase in sensitivity over the use of UV absorbance (A232, commonly used to detect the unsaturated non-reducing end bond produced by the action of the heparin lyase enzymes (16Lohse D.L. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24347-24355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and a 10–100-fold increase in sensitivity over previous fluorescent labels (17Kinoshita A Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Kitagawa H. Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal.

Fluorescence also has the advantage of minimizing background noise and non-glycan peaks, thus enhancing sensitivity. HS isolated from mouse kidney was subjected to exhaustive heparinase digestion, and the resulting disaccharides were labeled with BODIPY hydrazide and separated by high resolution strong anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 3a). The results show a typical chromatogram for HS, with a high proportion of unsulfated disaccharide (UA-GlcNAc) and smaller percentages of the other common disaccharides. Peaks eluting before 5 min represent free tag (Fig. 4); importantly, because no labeled saccharides co-elute with free tag, the samples do not require cleanup to remove this before analysis, thus streamlining analysis.FIGURE 4Expanded chromatogram of BODIPY-labeled mouse kidney HS disaccharides showing early eluting free tag peaks. HS was purified from 1 mg of mouse kidney by RIP, digested with heparinases, and labeled with BODIPY hydrazide, and the disaccharides were separated by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HPLC analysis was performed on one-half of the extracted sample. Free tag elutes before 10 min under the wash conditions used and thus does not interfere with clear measurement of the disaccharides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the minimum amount of starting material required to obtain accurate structural data, we extracted HS from 100, 10, and 1 mg of mouse kidney (wet weight) and undertook comparative disaccharide analysis using BODIPY hydrazide (Fig. 3). All three samples gave comparable results, indicating the effectiveness and accuracy of the RIP-BODIPY method. The signal obtained from 500 μg of tissue was still above the detection limits, so it should in principle be possible to analyze smaller amounts. This confirms that minute quantities of tissue can be used for accurate structural profiling of HS. To demonstrate the profiling potential of this methodology, we repeated the RIP extraction and BODIPY structural analysis of a range of mouse organs (Fig. 5). Liver, lung, spleen, and heart were all analyzed and compared with the kidney, along with a comparison between fluorescence and standard UV detection (Fig. 6 and Table 1). Each tissue yielded a unique compositional profile, with heart and kidney being relatively low sulfated and liver and lung being more highly sulfated. Although the UV data were generally in very close agreement with that obtained by BODIPY detection, some differences in quantitation between these two modes of detection were noted (Table 1), as seen in previous studies (20Deakin J.A. Lyon M. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The data were also in broad agreement with previous tissue HS data obtained using standard purification and analysis techniques including UV detection or post-column fluorescence labeling (20Deakin J.A. Lyon M. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Warda M. Toida T. Zhang F. Sun P. Munoz E. Xie J. Linhardt R.J. Glycoconj.

In addition, data on the disaccharide composition of porcine mucosal heparin obtained by BODIPY detection were comparable with that obtained by UV detection data and also literature values (data not shown). Taken together, this provides validation of the RIP-BODIPY methodology.FIGURE 6Comparison of UV versus fluorescent disaccharide analysis of RIP-extracted HS from multiple mouse tissues. Bar charts of the data in Table 1 are shown. HS was purified by RIP from 100 mg of each tissue by RIP and digested with heparinases, and disaccharide composition was measured by HPLC with UV or fluorescence detection (in the latter case, after BODIPY hydrazide labeling) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quantitative comparisons of the compositional profiles are shown for kidney, liver, spleen, lung, and heart (data are expressed the percentage of total disaccharide; mean ± S.D., n = 5).

HS was purified from Swiss 3T3 cells by RIP and analyzed by BODIPY labeling and strong anion exchange HPLC. HS purified from 3T3 cells grown in 100-mm dishes (250,000 cells), 35-mm dishes (40,000 cells), or 24-well plates (4,000 cells) produced comparable results, indicating that the methodology permits profiling from as little as a few thousand cells (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the HS from 3T3 cells has a higher proportion of di- and trisulfated disaccharides (standards 5, 6, and 8) than the mouse tissues (Fig. 6 and Table 1). These data demonstrate the utility of the methodology for profiling HS structures from small numbers of tissue culture cells. A major advantage of the new methodology is application in systems that have previously been intractable due to lack of sufficient sample, such as knock-out mouse models with altered HS molecular phenotypes, exemplified by the Sulf family of enzymes. These are glucosamine endosulfatases that remove 6-O-sulfates from HS in the extracellular environment (23Lamanna W.C. Baldwin R.J. Padva M. Kalus I. Ten Dam G. van Kuppevelt T.H. Gallagher J.T. von Figura K. Dierks T. Merry C.L. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This activity is considered crucial for the proper regulation of several growth factors (24Ai X. Kitazawa T. Do A.T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Labosky P.A. Emerson Jr., C.P. Development. 2007; 134: 3327-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in Sulf activity show a number of specific developmental defects, which become most obvious for the brain (25Kalus I. Salmen B. Viebahn C. von Figura K. Schmitz D. D'Hooge R. Dierks T.

This has been observed in Sulf knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts grown in vitro (23Lamanna W.C. Baldwin R.J. Padva M. Kalus I. Ten Dam G. van Kuppevelt T.H. Gallagher J.T. von Figura K. Dierks T.

https://openalex.org/W2000615435,"α-Hemolysin (HlyA) is an exotoxin secreted by some pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli that causes lysis of several mammalian cells, including erythrocytes of different species. HlyA is synthesized as a protoxin, pro-HlyA, which is activated by acylation at two internal lysines Lys-563 and Lys-689. It has been proposed that pore formation is the mechanism of cytolytic activity for this toxin, as shown in experiments with whole cells, planar lipid membranes, and liposomes, but these experiments have yielded conflicting results about the structure of the pore. In this study, HlyA cysteine replacement mutant proteins of amino acids have been labeled with Alexa-488 and Alexa-546. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, employing labeled toxin bound to sheep ghost erythrocytes, have demonstrated that HlyA oligomerizes on erythrocyte membranes. As the cytotoxic activity is absolutely dependent on acylation, we have studied the role of acylation in the oligomerization, demonstrating that fatty acids are essential in this process. On the other hand, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the hemolytic activity decrease when the erythrocyte ghosts are cholesterol-depleted, hence indicating the role of membrane microdomains in the clustering of HlyA. Simultaneously, HlyA was found in detergent-resistant membranes. Pro-HlyA has also been found in detergent-resistant membranes, thus demonstrating that the importance of acyl chains in toxin oligomerization is the promotion of protein-protein interaction. These results change the concept of the main role assigned to acyl chain in the targeting of proteins to membrane microdomains. α-Hemolysin (HlyA) is an exotoxin secreted by some pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli that causes lysis of several mammalian cells, including erythrocytes of different species.

Synthesis, maturation, and secretion of E. coli HlyA are determined by the hlyCABD operon (3Welch R.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 85-111PubMed Google Scholar). The gene A product is a 110-kDa polypeptide corresponding to protoxin (Pro-HlyA), which is matured in bacterial cytosol to the active form (HlyA) by HlyC-directed acylation. This post-translational modification involves a covalent amide linkage of fatty acids at two internal lysine residues (Lys-563 and Lys-689) for activation (4Stanley P. Koronakis V. Hughes C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 309-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HlyA activated in vivo consists of a heterogeneous family of up to nine different covalent structures (two acylation sites and three possible modifying groups in each site, C14:0 (68%), C15:0 (26%) and C17:0 (6%) (5Lim K.B.

Although these fatty acids are not required for the binding of the toxin to membranes, they are essential for the hemolytic process, inducing a molten globule conformation and promoting the irreversibility of the binding (6Herlax V.

However, these experiments have yielded conflicting results. Although a group of researchers is in favor of a monomer as the active species of the toxin in membranes, other groups postulate that an oligomerization process is involved. Based on experiments with lipid bilayers, Menestrina et al. (8Menestrina G. Mackman N. Holland I.B. Bhakdi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) have suggested that one single HlyA molecule is responsible for the formation of the channel. HlyA has also been recovered from deoxycholate-solubilized erythrocyte membranes as a monomer, indicating either that oligomerization is not required for pore formation or that oligomers are dissociated in the detergent (1Bhakdi S. Mackman N. Nicaud J.M. Holland I.B. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 63-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Benz et al. (9Benz R. Döbereiner A. Ludwig A. Goebel W. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 5: 55-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have found that small variations of toxin concentration have had a considerable effect on the specific membrane conductance. An increase in HlyA concentration, by a factor of 5, results in about 40–100-fold higher membrane conductance. This means that several HlyA molecules could be involved in channel formation (9Benz R. Döbereiner A. Ludwig A. Goebel W. FEMS Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 5: 55-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, they have found that the active channel-forming oligomer and inactive monomer are in an association-dissociation equilibrium (10Benz R. Schmid A. Wagner W. Goebel W. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 887-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the complementation of inactive deleted mutant proteins of HlyA with the corresponding wild type toxin produces hemolytic activity, suggesting that two or more toxin molecules aggregate before pore formation (11Ludwig A. Benz R. Goebel W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All of the evidence suggests the formation of an oligomer. Experiments employing erythrocytes and model membranes have shown that the lesion created by HlyA is perhaps a more complicated event than the creation of a simple, static protein-lined pore. We have recently found that addition of nanomolar concentrations of toxin to planar lipid membranes have resulted in a decrease in membrane lifetime up to 3 orders of magnitude in a voltage-dependent manner, a typical behavior of proteolipidic pores (12Bakás L. Chanturiya A. Herlax V. Zimmerberg J. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 3748-3755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moayeri and Welch (13Moayeri M. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4124-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that osmotic protection of erythrocytes by sugars of different sizes is a function of toxin concentration and assay time. It appears that HlyA induces heterogeneous erythrocyte lesions that increase in size over time and that the rate of the putative growth in the size of HlyA-mediated lesions is temperature-dependent (13Moayeri M. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4124-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been recognized that a variety of pathogens and toxins interacts with microdomains in the plasma membrane. These microdomains are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and probably exist in a liquid-ordered phase, in which lipid acyl chains are extended and ordered (14Brown D.A. London E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Many proteins are targeted to these membrane microdomains by their favorable association with ordered lipids. Interestingly, these proteins are linked to saturated acyl chains, which partition well into these domains (15Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). In this context, and in view of the fact that acyl chains covalently bound to proteins are determinant of specific protein-protein interactions, this research presents a study of HlyA oligomerization on sheep erythrocytes, as well as the implication of fatty acids and cholesterol-enriched microdomains in this process. HlyA is a protein of 1023 amino acids devoid of cysteine. HlyA and Pro-HlyA were purified from culture filtrates of E. coli strains WAM 1824 (16Moayeri M. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and WAM 783, respectively (17Boehm D.F. Welch R.A. Snyder I.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HlyA cysteine mutant protein K344C (HlyA K344C) was purified from the E. coli strain WAM 2205 (18Pellett S. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3081-3087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was kindly provided by Dr. R. A. Welch, University of Wisconsin, Madison. Pro-HlyA cysteine mutant protein (Pro-HlyA K344C) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid (pSF4000ΔBamH1) extracted from WAM 783, using the QuickChange method (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). The sequence for the coding strands of mismatch primer was as follows: 5′-CCATCGTATCCAAGGCATTTGAATCGTTGTGAATACTCC-3′; The mismatch codon is underlined. The mutation has been confirmed by DNA sequencing at Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). The mutated plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL-21 for further purification of Pro-HlyA K344C. Cultures of the corresponding E. coli strain were grown to late log phase in Luria-Bertani medium to an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 0.8–1.0. Cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was concentrated and partially purified by precipitation with 20% cold ethanol. The precipitate containing the protein was collected by centrifugation (1 h, 14,500 × g in a Sorvall centrifuge, rotor SSA 34) and then resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl (TC buffer). SDS-PAGE analysis of this preparation showed a main band at 110 kDa corresponding to more than 90% of the total protein. Proteins of lower molecular mass were removed by dialysis (membrane cutoff, 30 kDa). The protein was stored at −70 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (TCGn). Proteins were first dialyzed in TC (1:100 v/v) before each experiment at 4 °C for 4 h. The purification of Pro-HlyA and Pro-HlyA K344C by the same process employed for HlyA gave low yield, so it was purified from inclusion bodies as described by Sanchez Magraner et al. (19Sánchez-Magraner L. Cortajarena A.L. Goñi F.M. Ostolaza H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein intrinsic fluorescence spectra were recorded on a SLM 4800 Aminco spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm to minimize tyrosine emission, and the emission spectra were recorded in the 310–370 nm wavelength range. Slit width was 4 nm for both excitation and emission. HlyA and Pro-HlyA cysteine mutant proteins in degassed TCGn at pH 7.4 were incubated with sulfhydryl-specific probes at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of 0.4 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. The probes (dissolved in the same buffer) were added in small volumes while stirring in the dark. Alexa-488 was added to a final molar ratio of 30:1 probe to protein. A molar excess of 5:1 probe to protein and 0.1% sodium cholate were used for the specific labeling with Alexa-546. Labeled proteins were separated from unbound probe by elution through PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) and dialysis overnight into TC buffer. HlyA was reacted alongside the mutant proteins to detect nonspecific labeling. The efficiency of labeling was determined from the molar extinction coefficients for Alexa-488, ϵ492 = 67,100 cm−1 m−1, and for Alexa-546, ϵ554 = 90,300 cm−1 m−1 (specifications from Molecular Probes) and ϵ280 = 73,960 cm−1 m−1 for HlyA. All mutant proteins were specifically labeled (molar ratio 0.9–1.1 probe to protein). The nonspecific labeling detected with the wild type toxin HlyA was <10%. The hemolytic activity of the HlyA K344C mutant protein was not detectably decreased by labeling. The hemolysis was determined by measuring the decrease in turbidity (scattered light at 595 nm) of a standardized sheep erythrocyte suspension. Proteins were serially diluted in TC buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2 on a 96-well microtiter plate. One hundred μl of the diluted suspensions were mixed with 100 μl of standardized sheep erythrocytes. The standardization of the sheep erythrocytes was done just before the assay. The erythrocytes were washed in 0.9% NaCl and then diluted to 12.5 μl in 1 ml of distilled water to give a reading of 0.6 absorbance unit at 412 nm (20Soloaga A. Ramírez J.M. Goñi F.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6387-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the absorbance at 595 nm was measured at a Multimode Detector DTX 880 Beckman Coulter. The hemolysis percentage was calculated as shown in Equation 1,% hemolysis=ODc-ODx · 100/ODc-ODTx(Eq. 1) where ODc is the optical density of control erythrocytes; ODx is the optical density of erythrocytes treated with different concentrations of toxin, and ODTx is the optical density of erythrocytes after Triton X-100 addition. The hemolytic activity is defined as the dilution of HlyA preparation producing 50% lysis of the erythrocyte suspension. Specific activity is calculated as the hemolytic activity (in hemolytic units/ml) of the respective protein divided by its concentration (mg/ml). Cholesterol extraction from sheep erythrocytes was performed by two methods, one using small unilamellar vesicles made of egg phosphatidylcholine (SUV-PC) (21Giraud F. M'Zali H. Chailley B. Mazet F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the other employing a 3 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) solution (22Kilsdonk E.P. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Sheep erythrocytes (10% hematocrit) were incubated with 1 μmol of SUV-PC at 37 °C. After 3 h, the cells were sedimented and washed five times with TC buffer. For the cholesterol extraction using CD (Fluka), 1 ml of sheep erythrocytes was incubated with 10 ml of 3 mm CD in TC buffer at 37 °C for 30 min and washed three times with TC buffer. Half of the cells were used for experiments, and the other half was used for cholesterol quantification (Colestat, Weiner). Hemolysis kinetics was determined by measuring the decrease in turbidity of a standardized sheep erythrocyte suspension (control and cholesterol-depleted) exposed to HlyA as a function of time at 37 °C. A series of hemolytic reactions were set up. The highest concentration of HlyA studied (0.2 μm) corresponded to the minimal amount of toxin that would produce 100% of hemolysis in 96-well plate dilution assays. The absorbance at 595 nm was measured at a Multimode Detector DTX 880 from Beckman Coulter. Initial rate of hemolysis was obtained from the linear portion of the kinetic curve (absorbance at 595 nm versus time). 1.5 milliliters of packed sheep erythrocytes (control and cholesterol-depleted) were washed with TC buffer and osmotically lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer, at 4 °C for 30 min. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min at 14,500 × g) and washed until the supernatant remained clear. The membranes were finally resuspended in 3 ml of TC buffer. The concentration of these samples was 0.51 ± 0.06 mg of phospholipid/ml (n = 3). Twenty micrograms of protein was incubated with 75 μl of sheep ghost erythrocytes at 37 °C for 60 min in a TC buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2. The resulting final reaction volume was 1 ml. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 14,500 × g, 4 °C) and washed three times with TC buffer to separate unbound protein. Binding percentage of protein to membranes was calculated as shown in Equation 2,% binding=FT−Fsup/FT · 100(Eq. 2) where FT is the maximum fluorescence of the corresponding labeled protein before its interaction with membranes, and sup is the fluorescence measured in the supernatant after the three washes. A blank of buffer and membranes was subtracted from all fluorescence measurements. For proteins labeled with Alexa-488, the excitation wavelength was 480 nm, and emission fluorescence was measured at 520 nm, and proteins labeled with Alexa-546 were excited at 530 nm, and emission was measured at 570 nm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer is a distance-dependent interaction between the electronic excited states of two fluorescent molecules, in which excitation energy is transferred from a donor molecule (D) to an acceptor molecule (A), without emission of a photon. The efficiency of energy transfer (E) is related to R0, the Förster radius, and to R, the distance between donor and acceptor, as shown by the Equation 3,E=R06/R06+R6(Eq. 3) R0 represents the distance where the transfer is 50% efficient (23Lackowicz J. Principle of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 305-337Google Scholar). When donor and acceptor probes in FRET experiments are chemically different, FRET can be detected by the following: (a) the increase in the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor; (b) the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the donor; or (c) the decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of the donor. For our experiments, Alexa-488 (D) and Alexa-546 (A) were chosen as donor and acceptor, respectively, and method a was selected for the determination of FRET efficiencies. For each HlyA mutant protein tested, three samples were measured differing in the contents of the labeled variants (D and A) and in the corresponding unlabeled mutant protein: (a) D/unlabeled mutant protein, (b) D/A, and (c) unlabeled mutant protein/A. The molar ratio between donor and acceptor was 1:1. FRET was calculated from spectral data as described by Gohlke et al. (24Gohlke C. Murchie A.I. Lilley D.M. Clegg R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 11660-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This approach allows for the calculation of E from three fluorescence spectra. The fluorescence emission spectrum of ghost erythrocytes containing D/A, FD/A (480, λem) (excited at 480 nm), is fitted to the weighted sum of two spectral components as follows: (a) a standard emission spectrum of ghost erythrocytes labeled only with donor, FD(480, λem), and (b) a spectrum of ghost erythrocytes containing D/A, FD/A (530, λem) (excited at 530 nm where only the acceptor absorbs), as shown in Equation 4, FD/A480,λem=a·FD480,λem+b·FD/A530,λem(Eq. 4) The coefficients a and b are the fitted fractional contributions of the two spectral components; b is the acceptor fluorescence signal due to FRET from the donor, normalized by FD/A(530 nm, λem). E was obtained as shown in Equation 5, using the b value obtained from the fitting of the spectra using Sigmaplot 8.0 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). b=E·∈D480∈A530+∈A480∈A530(Eq. 5) ϵD and ϵA are the molar absorption coefficients of D and A at the given wavelengths, respectively; ϵD(480 nm)/ϵA(530 nm) and ϵA(480 nm)/ϵA(530 nm) were determined from the absorption spectra of D and A in singly labeled preparations (D/HlyA and HlyA/A). The absorption spectrum of membranes with unlabeled toxin was subtracted in all the samples. For FRET measurements, mutant proteins labeled with both fluorophores (ranging from 3 to 50 μg of total protein) were added to 75 μl of ghost erythrocyte suspension. The condition for the binding of the proteins to ghost membranes was the one previously described. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature on an SLM 4800 Aminco spectrofluorometer. Alexa-488 was excited at 480 nm, and emission was recorded between 470 and 600 nm. Direct excitation of Alexa-546 was achieved at 530 nm, and the emission was recorded between 540 and 600 nm. For kinetics studies, ghost erythrocytes were mixed with either donor plus acceptor or acceptor plus unlabeled HlyA K344C using a stopped flow (RX 2000, Applied Photophysics Ltd.) adapted to the SLM 4800 Aminco spectrofluorometer. Assays were performed as follows: 5 μg of total toxin per 100 μg of phospholipids (erythrocytes membranes). The excitation monochromator was set at 480 nm, and the emission monochromator was set at 570 nm with 8 nm slit widths. Alexa-546 emission was measured at a rate of 25 samples/s for 240 s at 37 °C. The curves represent the average of three independent experiments obtained from five replicates each. We adapted the procedure from that of Quinn and co-workers (25Koumanov K.S. Tessier C. Momchilova A.B. Rainteau D. Wolf C. Quinn P.J. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 434: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). One volume of protein-bound ghost erythrocytes was resuspended in 4 volumes of TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 4 °C and dispersed by 10 passages through a 21-gauge needle. The mixture was incubated on ice for 20–30 min. The lysate was diluted with an equal volume of 80% (v/v) sucrose solution in TNE buffer. One ml of this suspension was overlayered by 2.3 ml of 35% sucrose solution in TNE buffer, followed by 1 ml of a 5% sucrose solution in TNE buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 190,000 × g in a Beckman SW60 Ti rotor at 4 °C for 18 h. Twelve 0.33-ml fractions were collected from the top of each tube. Pelleted material recovered from the bottom of the tube was named “P” fraction, and the material layered at the 5–35% sucrose interface was designated as DRMs (fractions 3–5). All fractions were stored frozen at −20 °C prior to further analysis. Fifteen microliters from each of the 13 sucrose fractions were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by the Towbin et al. method (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBST buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, and 0.05% Tween, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 2 h. They were then incubated with a solution containing a polyclonal rabbit anti-hemolysin antibody (1:500) or anti-Flotillin-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) (1:1000) in 3% skim milk/PBST at 4 °C overnight, washed with PBST buffer, and finally reacted with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) (1:1000) in PBST buffer with 3% skim milk at room temperature for 2 h. After incubation and washing as stated above, blots were developed by chemiluminescence. Total lipids of sucrose density gradient fractions were extracted by procedure of Floch et al. (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were recovered from the original chloroform extract and subjected to analysis by TLC on high performance TLC plates (Whatman), developed with a two solvent system consisting first of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:18.75:1.75:1 by volume) and then with hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (40:10:1 by volume). Lipid spots were detected by 5% sulfuric acid in ethanol. HlyA does not contain Cys residues in its sequences; therefore, Lys-344 was replaced by Cys (HlyA K344C). The same point mutation was introduced in the unacylated protein (Pro-HlyA K344C). Prior to the FRET experiments, the hemolytic activity of the mutant proteins has been measured and compared with the wild type toxin (HlyA). Fig. 1A shows that mutation located in the insertion region of the toxin into membranes (28Hyland C. Vuillard L. Hughes C. Koronakis V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) does not affect the hemolytic activity of the toxin. As expected, Pro-HlyA K344C is hemolytically inactive as Pro-HlyA, because the fatty acids covalently bound are lacking in both proteins. As HlyA contains hydrophobic domains in its sequence, it presents a great tendency to aggregate. The aggregation percentage of each protein in solution was measured. Briefly, 20 μg/ml of protein in TC buffer was centrifuged at 110,000 × g in a Beckman 70.1 rotor at 4 °C for 2 h. The amount of proteins in the pellet (aggregates) and supernatants was quantified by the Bradford procedure. The aggregation percentage obtained was 21.6 ± 1.6 and 15.9 ± 0.48% for HlyA K344C and Pro-HlyA K344C, respectively. If we compare these values with the aggregation percentage of the wild type protein (27.2 ± 5%), the HlyA mutant protein does not present any difference with HlyA. Instead, Pro-HlyA has less of a tendency to aggregate, probably because of its compact structure (6Herlax V. Bakas L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5177-5184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HlyA contains four tryptophan residues that can serve as intrinsic fluorophores. They are located at positions 431, 479, 578, and 913. Fig. 1B shows that maximum emission does not change because of the presence of mutation, indicating that the Cys introduced does not induce important conformational changes in either HlyA or Pro-HlyA. The blue shift of Pro-HlyA indicates that the Trp residues are located in a more hydrophobic environment than in the acylated protein as published before (7Herlax V. Bakás L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 122: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Resonance energy transfer is a photochemical process whereby one fluorescent molecule or fluorophore, the “donor,” excited by an initial photon of light spontaneously transfers its energy to another molecule, the “acceptor,” by a nonradioactive dipole-dipole interaction (29Forster T. Ann. Phys. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4985) Google Scholar, 30Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). The distance over which energy can be transferred depends on the spectral characteristics of the fluorophores, but it is generally in the 10–100-Å range. Hence, FRET can be used for measuring structure (31Lakowicz J.R. Gryczynski I. Wiczk W. Laczko G. Prendergast F.C. Johnson M.L. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 36: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), conformational changes (32Heyduk T. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and interactions between molecules (33Parsons M. Vojnovic B. Ameer-Beg S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 431-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This has been the aim of our experiment, where labeled mutant proteins of HlyA have been used to study the oligomerization of the toxin on erythrocytes membranes. To carry out this study, two populations of HlyA K344C mutant proteins, one labeled with donor (Alexa-488) and the other with acceptor fluorophores (Alexa-546), have been bound to sheep ghost erythrocytes. The hemolytic activity of the labeled proteins has been the same as that of the unlabeled ones, indicating that the presence of fluorophores does not change the active conformation of the toxin. On the other hand, the binding percentage of the mutant proteins labeled with both fluorophores to ghost erythrocytes has been calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mean binding percentage of three independent experiments has been 23.47 ± 3.61 and 15.36 ± 5.63% for HlyA K344C Alexa-546 (HlyA A) and HlyA K344C Alexa-488 (HlyA D), respectively. The difference is not significant, demonstrating that fluorophores do not change the binding properties of the toxin. These values give us the certainty that the ratio of D:A added in the following experiments is maintained when the toxin is bound to membranes. The fluorescence emission spectrum of a mixture containing HlyA D and HlyA A in solution at a molar ratio of 1:1 was then recorded. Fig. 2A shows that the emission fluorescence of that mixture corresponds to the fluorescence emission of donor; otherwise, when ghost erythrocytes are added, an enhancement of acceptor fluorescence is observed. This result demonstrates that the small a"
https://openalex.org/W2076589773,"The glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme family involved in the hydrolysis of glycerophosphodiesters has been characterized in bacteria and recently identified in mammals. Here, we have characterized the activity and function of GDE3, one of the seven mammalian enzymes. GDE3 is up-regulated during osteoblast differentiation and can affect cell morphology. We show that GDE3 is a glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes GroPIns, producing inositol 1-phosphate and glycerol, and thus suggesting specific roles for this enzyme in GroPIns metabolism. Substrate specificity analyses show that wild-type GDE3 selectively hydrolyzes GroPIns over glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoethanolamine, and glycerophosphoserine. A single point mutation in the catalytic domain of GDE3 (GDE3R231A) leads to loss of GroPIns enzymatic hydrolysis, identifying an arginine residue crucial for GDE3 activity. After heterologous GDE3 expression in HEK293T cells, phosphodiesterase activity is detected in the extracellular medium, with no effect on the intracellular GroPIns pool. Together with the millimolar concentrations of calcium required for GDE3 activity, this predicts an enzyme topology with an extracellular catalytic domain. Interestingly, GDE3 ectocellular activity is detected in a stable clone from a murine osteoblast cell line, further confirming the activity of GDE3 in a more physiological context. Finally, overexpression of wild-type GDE3 in osteoblasts promotes disassembly of actin stress fibers, decrease in growth rate, and increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content, indicating a role for GDE3 in induction of differentiation. Thus, we have identified the GDE3 substrate GroPIns as a candidate mediator for osteoblast proliferation, in line with the GroPIns activity observed previously in epithelial cells.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After their characterization in bacteria, mammalian glycerophosphodiesterases were identified, with the definition of a family of seven members (5Yanaka N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The first of these, GDE1, is an interactor of regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS)16, and was subsequently defined as a GP-PDE regulated by G-protein signaling (4Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, GDE1 expression in HEK293T cells showed increased enzymatic activity upon α/β-adrenergic and lysophospholipid receptor stimulation (4Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The second member, GDE2, was isolated by homology searches in neuronal tissues and its physiological role involves neuronal differentiation (6Rao M. Sockanathan S. Science. 2005; 309: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Yanaka N. Nogusa Y. Fujioka Y. Yamashita Y. Kato N. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 712-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, GDE3 has been characterized as a marker of osteoblast differentiation and was isolated through a differential display method (8Yanaka N. Imai Y. Kawai E. Akatsuka H. Wakimoto K. Nogusa Y. Kato N. Chiba H. Kotani E. Omori K. Sakurai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43595-43602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GDE4 was isolated only recently with three-dimensional modeling defining it as a GP-PDE, although no functional activity has been correlated to its expression (9Chang P.A. Shao H.B. Long D.X. Sun Q. Wu Y.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The remaining members were cloned following data base searches, with further studies required for the definition of their properties (5Yanaka N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The diversity among these family members, in terms of tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and substrate specificity, suggests they selectively regulate biological functions and have distinct physiological roles (5Yanaka N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1811-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The only GP-PDE activity that has been biochemically characterized to date followed GDE1 overexpression in HEK293T cells, which showed a selectivity for the glycerophosphoinositols (GPIs) as substrate (4Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), in contrast to the bacterial GP-PDEs that show broad substrate specificities with respect to the alcohol moiety of the glycerophosphodiesterases (1Larson T.J. Ehrmann M. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5428-5432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tommassen J. Eiglmeier K. Cole S.T. Overduin P. Larson T.J. Boos W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The GPIs are naturally occurring, biologically active metabolites of the phosphoinositides that were originally investigated in the context of Ras-transformed cells (10Valitutti S. Cucchi P. Colletta G. Di Filippo C. Corda D. Cell. Signal. 1991; 3: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). They are present in virtually all cell types, where their intracellular levels can also be modulated according to cell activation, differentiation, and development (Refs. 11Corda D. Iurisci C. Berrie C.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 52-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 12Corda D. Zizza P. Varone A. Filippi B.M. Mariggiò S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Recently, glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns) was characterized as a mediator of purinergic and adrenergic regulation of PCCl3 thyroid cell proliferation (13Mariggiò S. Sebastià J. Filippi B.M. Iurisci C. Volontè C. Amadio S. De Falco V. Santoro M. Corda D. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 2567-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), while GroPIns 4-phosphate (GroPIns4P) has been shown to induce reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts and in T-lymphocytes, by promoting a sustained and robust activation of the Rho GTPases (14Mancini R. Piccolo E. Mariggiò S. Filippi B.M. Iurisci C. Pertile P. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Filippi B.M. Mariggiò S. Pulvirenti T.

Signal. 2007; 19: 2351-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).The GPIs appear to rapidly equilibrate across the plasma membrane when added exogenously to cells, to exert their actions within the cell (12Corda D. Zizza P. Varone A. Filippi B.M. Mariggiò S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma membrane transporter for GroPIns characterized in yeast is the protein GIT1 (17Patton-Vogt J.L. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with one of its orthologs in mammalian cells identified as the human permease Glut2 (18Mariggiò S. Iurisci C. Sebastià J. Patton-Vogt J. Corda D. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This specific transporter has been proposed to mediate both GroPIns uptake and release, which depends on the GroPIns concentration gradient across the plasma membrane. Under physiological conditions, this gradient can arise from the formation of GPIs from the phosphoinositides inside cells following activation of a specific isoform of phospholipase A2, PLA2IVα (13Mariggiò S. Sebastià J. Filippi B.M. Iurisci C. Volontè C. Amadio S. De Falco V. Santoro M. Corda D. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 2567-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Mariggiò S. Filippi B.M. Iurisci C. Dragani L.K. De Falco V. Santoro M. Corda D. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11769-11778Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).The release of the GPIs into the extracellular medium can affect their paracrine targets (16Patrussi L. Mariggiò S. Paccani S.R. Capitani N. Zizza P. Corda D. Baldari C.T. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2351-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or initiate their catabolism. This is supported by our characterization of GDE1 activity, and now of GDE3 activity, both of which show a substrate selectivity toward GroPIns, and catalytic activity after heterologous expression that can only be monitored in the extracellular space. Interestingly, GDE3 activity appears to be related to modulation of osteoblast functions, delineating a role for GDE3 in promoting osteoblast differentiation, and mainly regulating osteoblast proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Minimal Essential Medium α (MEMα), fetal calf serum (FCS), Opti-MEM, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), bovine serum albumin, and Hank's Balanced Salt Solution with calcium and magnesium (HBSS++) were from Invitrogen Brl (Grand Island, NY). [3H]GroPIns was prepared from l-α-[3H]phosphatidylinositol (314.5 GBq/mmol; PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) by deacylation, according to the original procedure of Clarke and Dawson (20Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). [6-3H]Thymidine (18.4 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer. GroPIns was purchased from Euticals S.p.A. (Lodi, Italy) as its calcium salt, and from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) as its lithium salt. All other reagents were of the highest purities available and were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified.Plasmids, Cell Culture, Transfection, and Proliferation AssaysFull-length mouse GDE3 cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pCMV-EGFPN1 (pEGFP-GDE3wt), as reported previously (8Yanaka N. Imai Y. Kawai E. Akatsuka H. Wakimoto K. Nogusa Y. Kato N. Chiba H. Kotani E. Omori K. Sakurai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43595-43602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An Arg→Ala mutant (pEGFP-GDE3R231A) was produced using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), a set of PCR primers (5′-CAGCATGGGGGCCCCTGCGTGTCCCACCAGCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGCTGGTGGGACACGCAGGGGCCCCCATGCTG-3′), and pEGFP-GDE3 as a template, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air, at 37 °C. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 58 μg/ml proline, 53 μg/ml l-aspartic acid, 60 μg/ml l-asparagine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HEK293T and CHO cells were transiently transfected with 4 μg of pEGFP-GDE3wt, pEGFP-GDE3R231A, or vector pEGFP (control) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Stable clones of the MC3T3-E1 murine osteoblastic cell line (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) were transfected with the empty vector (pEF/neoI) or with pEF-GDE3 (MC3T3-E1-Cl15), and were prepared as reported previously (8Yanaka N. Imai Y. Kawai E. Akatsuka H. Wakimoto K. Nogusa Y. Kato N. Chiba H. Kotani E. Omori K. Sakurai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43595-43602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in MEMα supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C, in the presence of the selection antibiotic G418 (500 μg/ml).The osteoblast growth rate was evaluated by cell counting. The different clones were plated into 6-well plates (2 × 104 cell/well) in growth medium. At the indicated times, the cells were detached by trypsinization, recovered by centrifugation, and put through two independent and blinded cell counts (Neubauer cell-counting chamber).For the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, MC3T3-E1 and MC3T3-E1-Cl15 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cell/well in complete growth medium. After 12 h, the cells were treated with 250 μm GroPIns (calcium salt) or the equimolar 125 μm CaCl2 and, when indicated, two further additions followed after 36 and 60 h. After 72 h, a pulse of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) was given 4 h before stopping the reaction by washing twice with HBSS++. The [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was evaluated as previously described (13Mariggiò S. Sebastià J. Filippi B.M. Iurisci C. Volontè C. Amadio S. De Falco V.

J Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Postnuclear Lysate Preparation and Western BlottingTwenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped into homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenanthroline, 2 μm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 5 mm EDTA in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl). Following gentle homogenization by 10 passages through a 28 1/2-gauge needle, postnuclear supernatants were prepared by removing nuclei and unbroken cells by centrifugation (600 × g for 3 min, at 4 °C) according to Ref. 4Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Eighty micrograms of supernatant protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (a kind gift of G. Di Tullio, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Italy) and a polyclonal antibody against GDE3 (epitope: amino acids 210–332) (8Yanaka N. Imai Y. Kawai E. Akatsuka H. Wakimoto K. Nogusa Y. Kato N. Chiba H. Kotani E. Omori K. Sakurai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43595-43602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Western blots were developed using the chemiluminescent method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).GP-PDE Activity AssaysIncubations were routinely at 37 °C with postnuclear supernatants in a final volume of 50 μl, which included 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mg/ml fatty-acid-free bovine serum albumin, 30,000 dpm [3H]GroPIns, [3H]GroPIns4P, or [3H]glycerophosphocholine (GroPCho), unlabeled GroPIns, GroPIns4P, or GroPCho (as indicated), without or with addition of competing glycerophosphodiesters. Incubations were in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ or as otherwise specified. Initial analysis of incubation conditions for the GP-PDE assay indicated that with 10 mm GroPIns as substrate, increasing amounts of postnuclear protein preparations (2, 10, 30 μg) from HEK293T cells overexpressing GFP-GDE3wt maintained linear activities in a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. Thus, 10 μg of postnuclear protein preparations were routinely used, unless otherwise specified. The GroPIns dose-response analysis was performed using 5 mm Ca2+, GroPIns substrate as the Li+ salt (from 100 μm to 500 mm), 10 μg of postnuclear lysate protein, and a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. GroPIns hydrolysis was determined as that measured for GFP-GDE3wt over the background GFP postnuclear preparation control, expressed as nanomoles. In the GP-PDE competition assays, the substrate concentration was 1 mm GroPIns, with addition of a 10-fold excess (10 mm) of competing glycerophosphodiesters.For the in vivo extracellular GP-PDE assays, cells were plated in 6-well plates and 100,000 dpm/well [3H]GroPIns, [3H]GroPIns4P, or [3H]GroPCho were added in 2.5 ml of growth medium. At specific times, 500 μl of medium was analyzed, as indicated below. The incubations were terminated by addition of cold methanol (−20 °C), followed by two-phase extraction, and the lyophilizing of the resultant upper (aqueous) phase (further details in Ref. 22Berrie C.P. Iurisci C. Piccolo E. Bagnati R. Corda D. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434: 187-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For the dose-response curves, GP-PDE activities were calculated from the known cold GroPIns in each assay (pmol) and the level of postincubation GroPIns hydrolysis, as seen by HPLC analysis of the 3H-labeled inositol, inositol 1-phosphate (Ins1P), and GroPIns (further details in Ref. 22Berrie C.P.

Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434: 187-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Quantitative Cell Spreading Assay and Immunofluorescence AnalysisHEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-GDE3wt, pEGFP-GDE3R231A, or pEGFP vector (control), as described above. After 24 h, the cells were directly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose in 0.2 m NaPO4 (pH 7.2), for 30 min. At least three images from different regions of the dish were captured in bright field mode. The edges of individual cells were traced by hand, and the area enclosed by the trace was measured using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Each data point represents a mean of at least 100 individual area measurements. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as reported in Ref. 14Mancini R. Piccolo E. Mariggiò S. Filippi B.M. Iurisci C. Pertile P. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar.Analysis of [3H]Inositol-containing PhospholipidsHEK293T and CHO cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected, and 4 h after transfection they were labeled for 24 h (to isotopic equilibrium) in Medium 199, with 5% FCS containing myo-[3H]inositol (5 μCi/ml). Following labeling, the cells were washed twice with HBSS++ and preincubated for 15 min in HBSS++ containing 10 mm LiCl (pH 7.4) at 37 °C, prior to addition of ATP, as required. Incubations were terminated by medium aspiration and addition of methanol/1 m HCl (1:1, −20 °C), with extraction by addition of a half volume of chloroform (final, 1:1:0.5). After separation of aqueous and organic extraction phases, the [3H]inositol-labeled water soluble metabolites were separated by anion exchange HPLC on a Partisil 10-SAX column using a non-linear water/1 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.35 (phosphoric acid) gradient. Radioactivity associated with the 3H-labeled compounds was analyzed by an on-line flow detector (Packard FLO ONE A-525). GroPIns levels are given as percentages of total aqueous 3H-labeled compounds.

Alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed by the phosphatase substrate system for EIA (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) using the cell lysate supernatant. Activities were corrected for protein concentrations and expressed as nmol/min/mg protein. Transfected MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in osteogenic medium for 7 days were washed twice with PBS and lysed with saline solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 0.2% Triton X-100. Thereafter, 0.5 ml 0.5 n HCl was added to lysates and the mineralized materials were dissolved with gentle overnight shaking. The calcium contents were quantitated by the o-cresolphthalein complexone method with the Calcium C-Test (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Protein concentrations were measured with a Bio-Rad kit.Statistical AnalysisThe data are expressed as means ±S.D./±S.E., as specified, of two to four independent experiments, each performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was by Student's t test.RESULTSGDE3 Is a Glycerophosphoinositol Inositol PhosphodiesteraseWe have previously shown that GDE1 is a GroPIns phosphodiesterase that selectively hydrolyzes GroPIns over GroPCho (4Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, we cloned the GDE3 protein in osteoblasts (8Yanaka N. Imai Y. Kawai E. Akatsuka H. Wakimoto K. Nogusa Y. Kato N. Chiba H. Kotani E. Omori K. Sakurai N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43595-43602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and its alignment with GDE1 and bacterial phosphodiesterases shows conserved amino acids in the catalytic region, such as an arginine believed to be relevant for GP-PDE activity (Fig. 1A, underlined). To investigate the GP-PDE activity of GDE3, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs coding for wild-type GDE3 with a C terminus green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag (GFP-GDE3wt), a GFP-tagged GDE3 with a catalytic domain point mutation (R231A; GFP-GDE3R), or GFP alone (mock-transfected control) (Fig. 1B).Ten micrograms postnuclear protein from HEK293T cells overexpressing GFP-GDE3wt show a GroPIns inositol phosphodiesterase activity, with hydrolysis of GroPIns to Ins1P and glycerol (see “Experimental Procedures,” and Fig. 1, C and D). In comparison, following transfection with pEGFP alone and with pEGFP-GDE3R231A, postnuclear cell lysates showed no background GP-PDE activity over the no-lysate control (Fig. 1D, w/o). There was no evidence of a GDE1-like activity (i.e. hydrolysis of GroPIns to inositol and glycerol phosphate) correlated to GFP-GDE3wt overexpression under these experimental conditions.To determine divalent cation requirements for this GDE3 GP-PDE activity, the GFP-GDE3wt lysate was incubated with 10 mm GroPIns (Li+ salt) in the absence and presence of 10 mm MgCl2, and in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 plus increasing concentrations of CaCl2 (0.1–10 mm). Unlike the enhancement of GDE1 activity with Mg2+ (4Zheng B. Berrie C.P. Corda D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1745-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), this GDE3 activity did not require MgCl2 (data not shown), but instead required addition of millimolar Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). With 5 mm Ca2+, GroPIns hydrolysis by GFP-GDE3wt was essentially linear over 5 h at 37 °C (Fig. 2B), with no activity in the control GFP postnuclear preparation (Fig. 2C). The Eadie-Hofstee plot derived from GroPIns dose-response analysis (Fig. 2D) shows an apparent Km for GDE3 of ∼97.2 mm, and a Vmax of ∼1,900 pmol/mg/min for GroPIns (see “Experimental Procedures”).FIGURE 2.Characterization of GDE3 activity on GroPIns. Postnuclear lysates were prepared from HEK293T cells overexpressing GFP-GDE3wt and GFP (see “Experimental Procedures”). A, quantification of GP-PDE activities on 10 mm GroPIns (Li+ salt) for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 μg of postnuclear GFP-GDE3wt protein in the absence (0) and presence of increasing CaCl2 concentrations, as indicated (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Under these conditions, GDE3 GroPIns inositol phosphodiesterase activity was not inhibited (supplemental Fig. S1 SF1). We also tested other GPIs in this competition assay of GDE3, and 10 mm GroPIns4P and 10 mm GroPIns 4,5-bisphosphate competed with GroPIns hydrolysis at least in part (45 and 55% inhibition, respectively) (Fig. 2E).Cells Overexpressing GDE3 Do Not Have Modified Intracellular GroPIns LevelsGlycerophosphodiesterase activity was also tested intracellularly with the HEK293T cells overexpressing GFP-GDE3wt, GFP-GDE3R, and GFP: these transfectants showed comparable intracellular levels of GroPIns (0.52 ± 0.08%, 0.52 ± 0.01%, 0.53 ± 0.07% of total aqueous radioactivity, respectively; n = 3; see “Experimental Procedures”).Similar results were obtained with CHO cells, where intracellular GroPIns levels can be modulated by hormone stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W1981827594,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death due to the high incidence of metastasis; therefore, novel and effective treatments are urgently needed. A current strategy is cancer-specific targeted gene therapy. Although many identified that cancer-specific promoters are highly specific, they tend to have low activity compared with the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, limiting their application. We developed a targeted gene therapy expression system for lung cancer that is highly specific with strong activity. Our expression vector uses the survivin promoter, highly expressed in many cancers but not normal adult tissues. We enhanced the survivin promoter activity comparable to the CMV promoter in lung cancer cell lines using an established platform technology, whereas the survivin promoter remained weak in normal cells. In mouse models, the transgene was specifically expressed in the lung tumor tissue, compared with the CMV promoter that was expressed in both normal and tumor tissues. In addition, the therapeutic gene BikDD, a mutant form of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 interacting killer, induced cell killing in vitro, and inhibited cell growth and prolonged mouse survival in vivo. Importantly, there was virtually no toxicity when BikDD was expressed with our expression system. Thus, the current report provides a therapeutic efficacy and safe strategy worthy of development in clinical trials treating lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2003116385,"A microorganism is a complex biological system able to preserve its functional features against external perturbations and the ability of the living systems to oppose to these external perturbations is defined ""robustness"". The antibiotic resistance, developed by different bacteria strains, is a clear example of robustness and of ability of the bacterial system to acquire a particular functional behaviour in response to environmental changes. In this work we have modeled the whole mechanism essential to the methicillin-resistance through a systems biology approach. The methicillin is a beta-lactamic antibiotic that act by inhibiting the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). These PBPs are involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycans, essential mesh-like polymers that surround cellular enzymes and are crucial for the bacterium survival.The network of genes, mRNA, proteins and metabolites was created using CellDesigner program and the data of molecular interactions are stored in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). To simulate the dynamic behaviour of this biochemical network, the kinetic equations were associated with each reaction.Our model simulates the mechanism of the inactivation of the PBP by methicillin, as well as the expression of PBP2a isoform, the regulation of the SCCmec elements (SCC: staphylococcal cassette chromosome) and the synthesis of peptidoglycan by PBP2a. The obtained results by our integrated approach show that the model describes correctly the whole phenomenon of the methicillin resistance and is able to respond to the external perturbations in the same way of the real cell. Therefore, this model can be useful to develop new therapeutic approaches for the methicillin control and to understand the general mechanism regarding the cellular resistance to some antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2041457957,"Studies of mineralization of embryonic spicules and of the sea urchin genome have identified several putative mineralization-related proteins. These predicted proteins have not been isolated or confirmed in mature mineralized tissues. Mature <i>Lytechinus variegatus</i> teeth were demineralized with 0.6 n HCl after prior removal of non-mineralized constituents with 4.0 m guanidinium HCl. The HCl-extracted proteins were fractionated on ceramic hydroxyapatite and separated into bound and unbound pools. Gel electrophoresis compared the protein distributions. The differentially present bands were purified and digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography. NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal sequences were determined by Edman degradation and compared with the genomic sequence bank data. Two of the putative mineralization-related proteins were found. Their complete amino acid sequences were cloned from our <i>L. variegatus</i> cDNA library. Apatite-binding UTMP16 was found to be present in two isoforms; both isoforms had a signal sequence, a Ser-Asp-rich extracellular matrix domain, and a transmembrane and cytosolic insertion sequence. UTMP19, although rich in Glu and Thr did not bind to apatite. It had neither signal peptide nor transmembrane domain but did have typical nuclear localization and nuclear exit signal sequences. Both proteins were phosphorylated and good substrates for phosphatase. Immunolocalization studies with anti-UTMP16 show it to concentrate at the syncytial membranes in contact with the mineral. On the basis of our TOF-SIMS analyses of magnesium ion and Asp mapping of the mineral phase composition, we speculate that UTMP16 may be important in establishing the high magnesium columns that fuse the calcite plates together to enhance the mechanical strength of the mineralized tooth."
https://openalex.org/W1974222154,"The glutamine transporter SLC38A3 (SNAT3) plays an important role in the release of glutamine from brain astrocytes and the uptake of glutamine into hepatocytes. It is related to the vesicular GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) transporter and the SLC36 family of proton-amino acid cotransporters. The transporter carries out electroneutral Na+-glutamine cotransport-H+ antiport. In addition, substrate-induced uncoupled cation currents are observed. Mutation of asparagine 76 to glutamine or histidine in predicted transmembrane helix 1 abolished all substrate-induced currents. Mutation of asparagine 76 to aspartate rendered the transporter Na+-independent and resulted in a gain of a large substrate-induced chloride conductance in the absence of Na+. Thus, a single residue is critical for coupled and uncoupled ion flows in the glutamine transporter SNAT3.

Homology modeling of SNAT3 along the structure of the related benzyl-hydantoin permease from Microbacterium liquefaciens reveals that Asn-76 is likely to be located in the center of the membrane close to the translocation pore and forms part of the predicted Na+ -binding site. The amino acid and auxin permease superfamily comprises a wide variety of transport proteins. In mammals, three distinct solute carrier families (SLC) belong to this superfamily, namely SLC32, SLC36, and SLC38 (1Sundberg B.E. Wååg E. Jacobsson J.A. Stephansson O. Rumaks J. Svirskis S. Alsiö J. Roman E. Ebendal T. Klusa V. Fredriksson R. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2008; 35: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite belonging to the same superfamily, the three solute carrier families have different transport mechanisms. The SLC32 family has only one member, the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter, which supposedly carries out a H+-GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) antiport (2Gasnier B. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The SLC36 family comprises four members, two of which have been characterized in more detail. These are the proton amino acid cotransporters 1 and 2 (PAT1 and 2) that carry out glycine and proline uptake in kidney and intestine and are mutated in iminoglycinuria (3Boll M. Daniel H. Gasnier B. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Bröer S. Bailey C.G. Kowalczuk S. Ng C. Vanslambrouck J.M. Rodgers H. Auray-Blais C. Cavanaugh J.A. Bröer A. Rasko J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3881-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The SLC38 family is comprised of 11 members, 5 of which have been characterized in more detail (5Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Two different transport mechanisms are found within this family, namely the Na+-amino acid cotransporters SNAT1, SNAT2, and SNAT4 and the Na+-amino acid cotransporters-H+-antiporters SNAT3 and SNAT5. Transporters of the superfamily play a key role in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission, metabolite absorption, and liver metabolism. Despite their important roles in mammalian physiology, relatively little is known about the structure and function of these transporters. The activity of ion-coupled membrane transporters is frequently associated with currents which de- or hyperpolarize the cell membrane. These currents may be due to electrogenic transport stoichiometry and/or to a non-stoichiometric ion conductance (6Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Transport-associated ion conductances have been identified in a number of transporters but have been particularly well studied in several Na+-coupled neurotransmitter transporters (7Blakely R.D. Defelice L.J. Galli A. Physiology. 2005; 20: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A.

Transport-associated conductances have also been observed in electroneutral transporters that do not carry out net charge movement (8Mager S. Min C. Henry D.J. Chavkin C. Hoffman B.J. Davidson N.

The glutamine transporter SNAT3, for instance, has a transport mechanism in which glutamine uptake is coupled to the cotransport of 1Na+ and the antiport of 1H+ and, hence, is unaffected by changes of the membrane potential (13Bröer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H. Chaudhry F.A. Lang F. Wagner C.A. Bröer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H. Cell. 1999; 99: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Despite the electroneutral transport mechanism, substrate uptake is accompanied by inward currents, which are carried by cations below pH 7 and by protons at alkaline pH. In addition, a substrate-independent cation conductance and a Na+/H+ exchange activity has been observed (17Schneider H.P. Bröer S. Bröer A. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Non-stoichiometric currents can be mediated by the same ions that are involved in the coupled transport process, such as in the case of SNAT3, but may also be carried by different ions. Stoichiometric glutamate transport, for instance, involves Na+, H+, and K+ ions, whereas the glutamate transport-associated conductance is carried by chloride (18Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A crucial question concerning transporter-associated ion conductances is whether the conducting pore coincides with the translocation pathway of the substrate and whether both use the same critical residues. In the case of the glutamate transporters, evidence has been presented suggesting that different residues are critical for the anion conductance than for substrate transport (19Ryan R.M. Mitrovic A.D. Vandenberg R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20742-20751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) but that they all line the same pathway (21Leary G.P. Stone E.F. Holley D.C. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2938-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here we show that asparagine 76 of SNAT3 is critical for substrate-induced ion conductance and affects binding of the cosubstrate Na+. In addition we show that this residue is likely to be localized in the translocation pore in the center of the membrane. Xenopus laevis females were purchased from the South African Xenopus facility (Knysna, Republic of South Africa) and from Xenopus Express, Vernassal, France. Oocytes (stages V and VI) were isolated by collagenase treatment as described (22Bröer S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 227: 245-258PubMed Google Scholar) and allowed to recover overnight. The surgical removal of ovarian tissue was performed under anesthesia (20-min immersion in 1% MS-222) and was approved by the animal ethics committee of the University of Kaiserslautern and the Australian National University. Rat SNAT3 was used as described previously (17Schneider H.P. Bröer S. Bröer A. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Oocytes were microinjected with 20 nl of rSNAT3 cRNA in water at a concentration of 1 μg/μl by using a microinjection device (WPI, Sarasota, Fl); control oocytes were injected with equivalent amounts of diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O or remained uninjected. Double-barrel pH-sensitive microelectrodes, to measure intracellular pH (pHi) and membrane potential in frog oocytes, were prepared as previously described (23Deitmer J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the electrodes were pulled in two stages and silanized by filling a drop of 5% tri-N-butylchlorosilane in 99.9% pure carbon tetrachloride into the prospective ion-selective barrel and then baking the pipette on a hot plate at 475 °C for 4.5–5 min. For pH-selective microelectrodes a small amount of H+-ionophore mixture (Fluka 95291) was backfilled into the tip of the silanized barrel and the remainder filled with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 6.0. The reference barrel was filled with 2 m potassium acetate. Electrodes were accepted for experiments if their response exceeded 50 mV per unit change in pH and if they reacted faster in the bath during calibration before and after each experiment than the fastest pHi changes recorded upon substrate addition. On average, electrodes responded with a change of 54 mV to a change in pH by one unit. The recording arrangement was the same as described previously (24Munsch T. Deitmer J.W. J. Physiol. 1994; 474: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The central and the reference barrel were connected by chloride silver wires to the headstages of an electrometer amplifier. As described previously (25Bröer S. Schneider H.P. Bröer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), optimal pH changes were detected when the electrode was located near the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This was achieved by carefully rotating the oocyte with the impaled electrode. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–25 °C). Only oocytes with a membrane potential more negative than −25 mV were used for experiments. A borosilicate glass capillary 1.5 mm in diameter was pulled to a micropipette and backfilled with 3 m KCl. The resistance of the electrode measured in oocyte saline was around 1 megaohm. For voltage-clamp recordings, both electrodes were connected to the head stages of an Axoclamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The experimental bath was grounded with a chloride-treated silver wire coated by agar dissolved in oocyte saline. Oocytes were clamped at −40 mV unless indicated otherwise. To measure ion conductances associated with SNAT3 expression, short voltage jumps were applied during recordings in increments of 20 mV ranging from −100 to + 20 mV. The slopes of these curves were used to calculate the ion conductance (slope conductance). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. The following primers were used (only sense primers shown, amino acid changing mutation in uppercase): N76D, ttc aat ctc agc Gac gcc atc atg ggc; N76E, ttc aat ctc agc GaG gcc atc atg ggc; N76H, ttc aat ctc agc Cac gcc atc atg ggc; N76Q, ttc aat ctc agc CaA gcc atc atg ggc; N76S, ttc aat ctc agc TCc gcc atc atg ggc. To determine plasma membrane expression, 15 oocytes were washed 3 times with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0. Subsequently, oocytes were incubated in 1.5 ml of Sulfo-NHS-lc-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. The reagent was removed by washing oocytes 4 times with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0. Subsequently, oocytes were lysed by incubation in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100) for 60 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at top speed in a tabletop centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was mixed with 50 μl of streptavidin-coated-agarose particles (Pierce). The suspension was incubated at 4 °C overnight with slight agitation. Agarose particles were washed 4 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and the pellet was subsequently resuspended in 10 μl of 5 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and an aliquot of 30 μl was loaded on the gel. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. SNAT3 was detected using an anti-peptide antibody at a 1:2500 dilution that was raised against a rat SNAT3 peptide (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions and using the provided secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2500 (Amersham Biosciences). Distantly related sequences with sequence homology below 20% are often not identified by BLAST search algorithms. More recently, sensitivity of homology searches has been improved by using profiles built from alignments of multiple sequences and Hidden Markov Models. In these algorithms only the conserved residues are used for searches and compared with profiles generated from aligned data base sequences. The fidelity of these search algorithms can be improved further by incorporation of secondary structure prediction methods (26Söding J. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). To identify whether SNAT3 is related to known structures, we used the HHPred server (27Söding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar), which is based on these improved methods to find related structures. The server identified the hydantoin transporter Mhp1 (Protein Data Bank 2jln) as the closest relative with a known structure (E = 1.6 × 10−6). Other related structures, such as LeuT, showed considerably worse scores. To verify the relatedness of the two structures, we analyzed the sequences of rat SNAT3 and Mhp1 from Microbacterium liquefaciens (DD136890) using the Topcons topology prediction algorithm. The resulting predicted position of each residue relative to the center of the membrane (Z-coordinate) (28Granseth E. Viklund H. Elofsson A. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: e191-e196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the free energy of insertion into the Sec61 translocon (29Hessa T. Meindl-Beinker N.M. Bernsel A. Kim H. Sato Y. Lerch-Bader M. Nilsson I. White S.H. von Heijne G. Nature. 2007; 450: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) were calculated for both sequences. We then plotted the alignment as generated by the HHPred server by introducing the corresponding gaps into the two topology prediction graphs. A homology model was subsequently built using the “Modeler” (30Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10690) Google Scholar) as associated with the HHPred server. We have recently analyzed alignments of functionally characterized members of the SLC32, SLC36, and SLC38 families to identify possible residues involved in ion conductances of the SNAT3 transporter (17Schneider H.P. Bröer S. Bröer A. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We focused on residues that have been identified in ion binding sites in high resolution structures of ion channels and transporters (31Gouaux E. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 310: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and that were conserved in the Na+-dependent transporters of the SLC38 family but not in the proton-dependent SLC32 or SLC36 families (see alignment in Ref 17Schneider H.P. Bröer S. Bröer A. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using these criteria we identified Asn-76, Gly-210, Ser-215, His-300, Thr-343, and Thr-380 as candidates. In this study asparagine 76 was mutated to different amino acids to study its role in ion translocation. When expressed in X. laevis oocytes, SNAT3 carries out an electroneutral transport of glutamine, asparagine, and histidine coupled to the cotransport of 1Na+ and an antiport of 1H+ (13Bröer A. Albers A. Setiawan I. Edwards R.H. Chaudhry F.A. Lang F. Wagner C.A. Bröer S. J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At the same time, an inward current (indicated by the downward deflection of the tracing in Fig. 1A and described in detail in Refs. 17Schneider H.P. Bröer S. Bröer A. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 12Chaudhry F.A. Krizaj D. Larsson P. Reimer R.J. Wreden C. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D. Kavanaugh M. Edwards R.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7041-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is observed that at neutral pH is carried largely by cations but at more alkaline pH is carried by protons (17Schneider H.P. Bröer S. Bröer A. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to these substrate-dependent currents, a substrate-independent alkaline pH-induced conductance is observed. To measure ion conductances associated with SNAT3 expression, short voltage jumps were applied during recordings in increments of 20 mV ranging from −100 to + 20 mV. The size of the resulting current peaks corresponds to the size of the conductance and was measured in the absence and presence of substrate (Fig. 1A). The voltage jumps were used to generate I/V plots (Fig. 1, B and C), and the slopes of the I/V plots were used to derive the conductance for each condition (Table 1). Mutation of asparagine 76 to glutamine (N76Q) completely abolished the glutamine-induced conductance (compare responses to voltage jumps in the presence and absence of glutamine in Fig. 1A). The corresponding I/V plots are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. Fig. 1, B and C, also demonstrate that the mutation abolishes the conductance at both pH 7.4, when it is carried by cations, and 8.4, when it is carried by protons. This suggests that the different cations use the same permeation pathway at both pH values and that this pathway is blocked by the mutation. The substrate-independent conductance at alkaline pH, by contrast, increased in the mutant (compare voltage responses in the absence of substrate in Fig. 1A and see Table 1). No significant difference was observed between asparagine and glutamine-induced currents in N76Q mutants (data not shown). Mutant N76S behaved very similarly to N76Q and also showed no substrate-induced currents at pH 7.4 or 8.4 (data not shown).TABLE 1Slope conductance of SNAT3 and its mutantscDNANa+−Na+pH 7.4pH 8.4GlnpH 7.4pH 8.4GlnpH 7.4pH 8.4pH 7.4pH 8.4MicrosiemensMicrosiemensNone2.511.761.721.76ND1.491.411.62SNAT31.671.824.04.56ND2.331.32.14N76Q3.166.156.9410.15ND5.111.774.70N76H3.7113.13.146.96ND9.722.787.97N76D2.715.381.693.56ND12.511.9356.96N76E3.4316.835.9812.46ND22.626.1978.43 Open table in a new tab Because mutation of Asn-76 to other neutral residues already changed the conductance properties, we replaced asparagine with histidine, which introduces an ionizable and possibly positively charged side chain. Similar to N76Q and N76S, no substrate-induced currents were observed at pH 7.4 for both glutamine (Fig. 2A) and asparagine (Fig. 2B). The N76H mutation also showed a prominent alkali-induced substrate independent conductance (Fig. 2 and Table 1). This conductance was significantly suppressed by the addition of glutamine (Fig. 2A and Table 1) but almost unaffected by asparagine (Fig. 2B). This difference suggested that the nature of the substrate side chain also influenced the characteristics of the conductance. Mutation of Asn-76 to histidine introduced a possible positive charge. To analyze the effect of introducing a negative charge at this position, we exchanged Asn-76 to aspartate or glutamate. Similar to the other mutants, N76D and N76E showed a significantly higher substrate-independent conductance at pH 8.4 (Table 1). Because the transporter is Na+-dependent, we measured conductances in all mutants in the presence and absence of sodium ions (Table 1). As reported previously (12Chaudhry F.A. Krizaj D. Larsson P. Reimer R.J. Wreden C. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D. Kavanaugh M. Edwards R.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7041-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Schneider H.P. Bröer S. Bröer A. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and shown here (Table 1), substrate-induced currents in the wild type are Na+-dependent. Mutants N76D and N76E by contrast showed very large, reversible substrate-induced currents of up to 8 μA in the absence of Na+ (Fig. 3A, compare responses at positions c and d). This conductance was not observed at pH 7.4 and also not in the presence of Na+ (not shown). At −40 mV and pH 8.4, the currents were inwardly directed. Under these conditions, the driving forces of both K+ and H+ were outwardly directed, excluding a participation of these two ions (Fig. 3B). This suggested the presence of a chloride conductance in the absence of Na+. Replacement of chloride by gluconate (in the absence of Na+) indeed completely abolished the conductance (Fig. 3A compare responses at positions a and b). When three different chloride concentrations were used, the shift of the reversal potential of this current was >50 mV for a 10-fold change in the external chloride concentration and, hence, was close to prediction of the Nernst equation for a pure chloride conductance (Fig. 4A). In addition, the conductance increased with the chloride concentration from 4.7 ± 1.8 microsiemens (μS) (at 9 mm Cl−) to 8.9 ± 1.8 μS (at 30 mm Cl−) and 24.7 ± 5.1 μS (at 90 mm Cl−). Thus, introduction of a nominal negative charge generates a chloride conductance, whereas in the wild type all currents appear to be carried by cations. The current showed a strong outward rectification (Figs. 3, A and B, and 4A) and a significant run-down upon repeated substrate additions (not shown). Similar to the other mutants, N76D and N76E also did not show substrate-dependent conductances in the presence of Na+ (not shown). The wild type did not show any substrate-induced currents in the absence of Na+, consistent with the Na+ dependence of the transporter (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Reversal potential of glutamine-induced currents in SNAT3 mutant N76D. Oocytes were injected with 20 ng of cRNA encoding SNAT3 or its mutant N76D, and glutamine-induced (10 mm) currents were analyzed after 3–6 days of expression at pH 7.4 and 8.4. The reversal potential was recorded at three different chloride concentrations (A). The reversal potential at 9 mm chloride was extrapolated (extr.); chloride ions were replaced by gluconate ions.

To assay glutamine transport in the mutants, we used flux assays. Uptake of [14C]glutamine ranged from 20 to 50% of the wild type for the different Asn-76 mutants (Fig. 5A). In agreement with an important role of Asn-76 in Na+-coupled substrate transport, we found that N76D and N76E carried out a reduced uptake of glutamine, which was, however, Na+-independent, whereas substrate transport of the wild type and the other mutants was largely Na+-dependent (Fig. 5A). The transport activity of the mutants at pH 7.4 was too low to be evaluated (data not shown). Thus, Asn-76 appears to be crucial for ion binding of both coupled and uncoupled transport. To further analyze coupled transport, we also analyzed substrate-dependent proton antiport. In agreement with the flux experiments, all mutants showed residual proton translocation (Table 2), with mutant N76H showing the slowest proton antiport activity. Apart from the N76H mutant, all mutants were expressed at the cell surface in similar amounts as the wild type, suggesting that the mutations changed the functional properties of the transporter rather than the folding and trafficking (Fig. 5, B and C).TABLE 2Changes of intracellular pH induced by substrates in SNAT3 and its mutantsSNAT3N76DN76EN76QN76HNInm H+/minnm H+/minnm H+/minnm H+/minnm H+/minnm H+/min100 mm Na+−33.3 ± 11−8.5 ± 2.7−12.4 ± 3.6−9.6 ± 2.9−3.1 ± 0.40.015 ± 0.0150 Na+−9.1 ± 5−4.7 ± 1.5−2.2 ± 0.6−0.9 ± 0.4−0.63 ± 0.3ND Open table in a new tab The effect of Asn-76 mutations on coupled and uncoupled ion transport suggested that Asn-76 is located in the translocation pore of the transporter. High resolution structures of membrane transporters have so far revealed only a limited number of different folds with 12 transmembrane spanning regions. 3The term “fold” refers to a typical protein folding pattern observed in a group of proteins. Widespread among mammalian transporters appears to be the fold of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters exemplified by lactose and glycerol permeases (32Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V.

BLAST or PSI-BLAST searches did not reveal significant homology of SNAT3 to any of the transport proteins for which high resolution structures are available. However, using HHpred, a homology detection server based on a pair wise alignment of profile hidden Markov models (26Söding J. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar), we could identify the hydantoin permease Mhp1 as a protein related to SNAT3 (E-value, 1.6 × 10−6), other proteins being significantly less or not related. The resulting sequence alignment is shown as supplemental Fig. 1. To confirm that the proteins are structurally related, we aligned the hydropathy plots, a method previously used to determine successfully structural similarity between proteins with little or no sequence homology (39Lolkema J.S.

A comparison of two topology-predicting plots as provided by the Topcons server indeed showed a remarkable alignment between SNAT3 and Mhp1 (Fig. 6, A and B).

The involvement of p73 in the regulation of EGFR has not been reported. Here, a strong correlation between EGFR overexpression and increased levels of the oncogenic ΔNp73 isoform in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines was observed. Ectopic expression of TAp73, particularly TAp73β, resulted in suppression of the EGFR promoter, significant downregulation of EGFR protein and efficient induction of cell death in all six EGFR-overexpressing HNSCC cell lines. EGFR overexpression from a heterologous LTR promoter protected lung cancer cells from TAp73β-induced EGFR suppression and apoptosis. Expression of TAp73β efficiently induced promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein expression and PML knockdown by shRNA attenuated the downregulation of EGFR and induction of apoptosis by p73 in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, PML was found to be important for E1A-induced suppression of EGFR and subsequent killing of HNSCC cells. Our data therefore suggest a novel pathway involving PML and p73 in the regulation of EGFR expression."

The science is progressing rapidly, driven by favorable policies and generous financing, but many hurdles remain before cars and trucks run on “gasohol” or “grassoline.” Rising oil prices, fears of global warming, and instability in oil-producing countries have ignited the rush to produce biofuels from plants. The science is progressing rapidly, driven by favorable policies and generous financing, but many hurdles remain before cars and trucks run on “gasohol” or “grassoline.” As crude oil prices continue to rise and concerns about climate change intensify, biofuels—energy-laden compounds derived from plants such as corn, soy, or sugar cane—are staging a comeback. In May this year, President Obama launched a new national policy to both increase fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas pollution for all new cars and trucks sold in the United States (http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-National-Fuel-Efficiency-Policy/). The new standards are projected to save 1.8 billion barrels of oil and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by ∼900 million metric tons. This so-called National Fuel Efficiency Policy has financial weight. On May 5, President Obama announced that $786.5 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act will be provided to speed research and development of advanced biofuels and to expand their commercialization (http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Steps-to-Support-Sustainable-Energy-Options/). That action is expected to help the nation meet mandates set by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (http://energy.senate.gov/public/_files/RL342941.pdf). Principal among these is that biofuels added to gasoline must increase to 36 billion gallons by 2022 (from 4.7 billion gallons in 2007). The Energy Act also specifies that 21 of the 36 billion gallons of biofuels produced by 2022 must come from non-cornstarch products (e.g., sugar or cellulose) and that there must be a clear benefit to greenhouse gas reduction. These recent moves add to the $375 million that the Department of Energy (DOE) committed in 2007 to launch a 5 year Bioenergy Research Initiative (http://genomicsgtl.energy.gov/centers/brcbrochure.pdf). The goal of this initiative is to pioneer the next generation of biofuels and to achieve the ultimate federal target of a 30% reduction in gasoline consumption in the US by 2030 (http://www1.eere.energy.gov/biomass/biofuels_initiative.html). From a scientific perspective, these government financial incentives are adding to those of industry and venture capital and are helping to spearhead an unprecedented alliance of biologists, chemists, and engineers. The goal is to produce second-generation biofuels (dubbed “grassoline”) that are derived from the cellulose of plant cell walls; first-generation biofuels are produced from fuel-rich sugars inside plants. Biofuels development includes a variety of new strategies such as genetically engineering plants with cell wall polymers that can be cleaved, finding and retooling enzymes that digest cell walls, and designing microbes that can more efficiently ferment plant sugars to produce ethanol. In parallel, ethanol production has increased worldwide, reaching 17.8 billion liters in Brazil and 18.4 billion liters in the US in 2006 (http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12450&page=49). Although the total (36.2 billion liters) would replace less than 1% of gasoline used per year, ethanol production is expected to double by 2015 in Brazil; to triple in the US, possibly reaching 136.8 billion liters per year by 2022; and to rise to 15 billion liters per year by 2020 in the European Union (where sugar beets are the main plant source for biofuels). At the same time, second-generation biofuels have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 86%, according to the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, one of the DOE-funded centers (http://www.greatlakesbioenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/biofuelsmythvfact.pdf). Given this environmental boon, one would expect the green movement to embrace biofuels. But environmentalists argue that the land required to grow the estimated 1.3 billion tons of plant biomass needed annually to produce sufficient ethanol to reach government-mandated goals will come at the expense of crop acreage dedicated to food production. Biofuels also must compete with other emerging technologies. For example, in March this year, the DOE committed $277 million of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding for 46 Energy Frontier Research Centers. The funds will be awarded on a competitive basis for advanced fundamental research in fields ranging from solar power and nuclear energy to hydrogen research, electrical energy storage, and, of course, biofuels (http://www.energy.gov/news2009/7083.htm). Regardless of which energy source is in vogue, “right now, the science is making great progress,” says biofuels scientist and engineer Lee Rybeck Lynd at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. “At the same time, the public policy debate is swinging back and forth.” Thus, the success of any new biofuels technology will depend not only on its scientific fitness but also on its environmental, political, and social resilience. When it comes to challenges in developing and producing biofuels, the most formidable is cost. Nature has provided plants with sturdy cell walls composed of three basic polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) that are tough, and therefore expensive, to break down. From a plant perspective, this hardy cell wall structure is an asset: it girds a plant for vertical growth and provides defense against insects, microbes, and other predators. Cellulose and hemicellulose are composed of long strands of glucose (up to 15,000 monomers in length) that polymerize and hydrogen bond into microfibers that repel water. Intertwined is lignin, made up of ringed aromatic molecules called phenyl proprenoids. These molecules polymerize via free radical reactions and, the stable linkages formed, endow a plant with compressive resistance. Chemists have tried traditional methods such as heat, pressure, or acid, but none are robust enough to break down plant cell walls and expose the sugar fuel source inside. Therefore, researchers must use combinations of techniques, a costly enterprise, as process engineers scramble to find ways to consolidate and integrate several technologies into one reaction system. And scale-up to rival even the smallest petroleum refinery is daunting. Thus, biomass recalcitrance is an enormous hurdle and getting around it has precipitated the emergence and divergence of new technologies. Each seeks the cheapest way to choose the right plant, digest its cell walls (deconstruction), and change the exposed sugars to fuels such as ethanol (conversion). “There's quite a bit of creativity going on,” says Chris Somerville, director of the Energy Biosciences Institute, a $500 million joint collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the University of Illinois, and British Petroleum. “People are totally rethinking the practices.” Overall, biomass-to-biofuel technologies can be grouped into three basic platforms, according to the intermediate material generated: sugar, liquid, or gas. With sugar-intermediate technologies, plant biomass (feedstock) is processed in a low-temperature reactor containing enzymes that break down plant cell walls and release sugars that can be converted to ethanol through fermentation. Liquid-intermediate technologies hinge on heating up a feedstock such as oak wood or corn to 600°C and using chemical catalysts to produce pyrolysis liquids or bio-oils, which can be refined directly into gasoline or diesel. “The challenge with pyrolysis is really controlling chemistry at higher temperatures,” says chemical engineer George Huber at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Huber is experimenting with catalysts called zeolites that work like molecular sieves. By engineering them to have the correct pore size and selecting the best temperature and pressure conditions, Huber hopes to control these otherwise unwieldy chemical reactions. Finally, gas-intermediate technologies rely on cooking biomass at temperatures so extreme (700°C to 1000°C) that the material vaporizes into a gas, which, in turn, can be converted to liquid fuel. Traditionally, catalysts performed that conversion. But recently, microbiologist Ralph Tanner at the University of Oklahoma discovered an anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium carboxidivorans strain P7, that can perform the conversion biologically. Tanner has sold the rights to license the technology to Coskata Inc., based in Warrenville, Illinois, which is now developing and marketing this microbial syngas technology (http://www.coskata.com). Each of the three platforms has advantages and disadvantages. For example, methods to convert biomass to sugar to fuel are largely biological and therefore depend on living microorganisms that ferment sugar to ethanol. Such organisms are sensitive to environmental conditions in a reactor and can be poisoned as the fuel they produce (a waste product, from the microbe's perspective) accumulates, with major consequences for scale-up. Meanwhile, the technologies to produce pyrolysis liquids and syngas rely on chemistry, which circumvents the toxicity problems of biology, but require very high temperatures, which can unleash unwanted reactions and byproducts. Biofuels research is experiencing a surge in new ideas, but which ones will win out? “A number of new technologies will co-exist for the next 10–20 years,” says Doug Cameron, Chief Scientific Officer for the investment bank Piper Jaffray. “And then, as some make better sense—and some companies make dumb decisions—we'll settle down to a few.” Whatever the outcome, Cameron asserts, “we are going to see a lot happen in the next 2–3 years.” Corn, soy, sugar cane, and sugar beets are the current plant choices for biofuels, but they are not ideal. Sugar cane requires a tropical climate for growth; corn kernels are a poor source of sugar for fermentation. Corn and soy have to be replanted each year and are also food crops, which makes environmentalists nervous. So biologists are now experimenting with more sustainable, fuel-laden crops, such as a perennial grass known as miscanthus, which can grow up to 14 feet tall in a range of climates (Figure 1). The downside of miscanthus is that it does not self-fertilize and so scientists cannot reproducibly breed hybrid offspring. Hence, plant molecular biologists are trying to manipulate the genes that regulate miscanthus fertility, although the molecular basis for fertility in grasses is poorly understood. Nor do scientists know the molecular players in many other biochemical pathways that regulate plant growth or even understand how plants produce and assemble cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, the very molecules targeted for deconstruction into sugars. “It's still shocking how little we really know about all this,” says microbiologist Martin Keller, director of the DOE's Bioenergy Science Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. “The problem is that research in the past was directed toward, say, one plant person or an enzymologist or a hard core chemist. Never the whole. You need to bring a multidisciplinary team together to really understand the mechanisms.” This lack of knowledge also plays out at the deconstruction step of biofuels production. Plant scientists have identified only a few cellulases (enzymes that digest cellulose), and there is only rudimentary information about their structures and substrates. Thus, biologists are now plunging into hot springs, scraping forest floors, and reaching into cow rumens to find new enzymes in nature that might be applied to deconstruction. Others are characterizing known cellulases in the hopes of modifying genetic sequences to optimize performance. “This is a new era in industrial microbiology,” says UC Berkeley's Chris Somerville. In a very different deconstruction strategy, some plant biochemists are genetically modifying the cell wall polymers themselves. This is no easy feat as knocking out the enzymes that make or assemble lignin results in stunted growth. On the other hand, “you can really make some truly massive changes in the composition and even the structure of lignin and you cannot tell the difference,” says plant biochemist John Ralph at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, a member of the DOE-funded Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center. Ralph is engineering linkages into the lignin polymers of hardwoods, such as conifers, that will be cleaved readily under the right chemical conditions. Lignin is made from a combination of three tightly bonded aromatic monomers: sinapyl, coniferyl, and para-coumaryl alcohols. Based on his four decades of plant chemistry experience, Ralph knew about a fourth lignin monomer, coniferyl ferulate, which has a more labile ester bond. By replacing the native monolignins with the ferulate version, Ralph and his team are trying to obtain a plant with stable lignified cell walls that deconstruct easily under conditions that cleave ester bonds (concentrated ammonia at 100°C). However, altering the balance of any of these lignin components is tricky, as cell wall polymers are not proteins built from easily interchangeable amino acids using an RNA template. Instead, lignin self-assembles, guided by enzymes that are specific for each type of monomer. Therefore, changing a monomer in the lignin polymer requires genetically re-engineering a whole enzymatic pathway. Ralph's team has found a short cut: an enzyme located elsewhere in plant tissues that polymerizes ferulate to make another compound important in plant defense. Their next step is to express that enzyme within the cell walls of popular trees in order to shuttle the ferulate into lignin polymers. Meanwhile, molecular biologists are also testing their mettle at the last step of the process, conversion of sugar to ethanol through fermentation by organisms such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. But biofuel production involving microorganisms is difficult and expensive to scale-up to a level anywhere near that of the petroleum industry. The problem is, when ethanol builds up to a commercially interesting level, the yeast that produce it die. “Making fuels is not what a cell wants to do,” explains physical chemist and engineer Adam Arkin at UC Berkeley. “So, we thought, we are pretty good at understanding tolerance. So let's go with trying to understand and better engineer the ability of these cells to survive, reproduce and grow when eating these feedstocks and expressing these chemicals.” Relying on combinatorial genomics, Arkin and his team use genome libraries from yeast and the sugar-ingesting, fuel-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis. Based on methods pioneered by biochemist Ronald Davis at Stanford University, Arkin created deletions in every Zymomonas gene and “bar-coded” them with a 20-nucleotide DNA tag. Arkin and his team are now exposing the bacteria, containing different gene deletions, to various fuels and toxic byproducts, such as hydrolysate inhibitors, and observing how well the microbes survive. The next step is high-throughput metabolic screens to tease out the genes that confer fitness. The group will then engineer these Zymomonas fitness genes in different combinations into the same organism and look for synergies. “We already are learning a great deal of biology,” Arkin says, “while providing a very effective platform for developing new organisms for industrial use.” That industrial use might extend beyond biofuels to commodity chemicals, foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, virtually anything that currently is made from petroleum. “We have 204 high-value commodity chemicals, alone, that come from the same pathway as biofuels,” Arkin notes. “The next thing you will see is the growth of biofuels' spin-offs.” Whichever fuel-producing technology wins, be it biological or chemical or both, it has to survive the gauntlet of scalability and distribution. “It's not just about the science, it is also about the conversion technology and the process plants that are going to make those fuels,” says Paul Willems, Technology Vice President for Energy Biosciences at British Petroleum. A daunting obstacle often arises when technologies that are stellar in the lab enter the real world. Feedstocks are dirty, for example, and contaminants may inhibit cellulases or poison fuel-converting organisms. Or fuel molecules might be difficult to separate out from the fermentation broth. At the same time, process engineers think about issues such as the size of future processing facilities and where they should be located. Feedstocks provide low energy return per ton of biomass. Thus, hauling truckloads of miscanthus to a processing plant would require so much energy for transportation that it would offset the energy produced from the miscanthus-derived grassoline. So biofuel processing plants need to be smaller entities, located close to the feedstock source. “It is not clear what the landscape will look like as this industry rolls out,” says Timothy Donahue, director of the DOE's Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center. “There are a lot of infrastructure issues that have to be sorted out.” UC Berkeley's Somerville estimates that an overall capital investment of $325 billion or more will be needed to build biofactories that can produce the 65 billion gallons of biofuel needed to meet 2030 national goals. “There is nothing else on that scale except for the petroleum industry,” he says. “This is really, really big.” Science and scalability, however, are not the only challenges ahead. Social issues factor in, as well. Automakers still have to build vehicles that run on the new biofuels at a price and level of performance that consumers will accept. If biofuels or the cars that use them become too expensive, or if engines corrode because an alternative fuel is not hydrophobic enough, then people won't buy them. “The fuel that we use today and the vehicle parts that run on it have been tuned to each other for the last 100 years,” says Willems. “So when something new enters the mix, without the consumer in the equation, it is pretty tricky.” However, the success of biofuels production and flex fuel car use in Brazil (Box 1) suggests that there is plenty of mileage in biofuels.Box 1Lessons from BrazilFor a lesson in biofuels success, Brazil is the award-winning teacher. Facing oil prices of $86 per barrel in the early 1980s (compared to $9 in the late 1960s), the Brazilians took action. Scientists engineered ethanol production from sugar cane, a major cash crop in Brazil, and engineers manufactured vehicles that could run on pure ethanol or a gas-ethanol mix called “gasohol” that is more corrosive than gasoline alone. Then oil prices dropped in the late 1980s, the government pulled its ethanol subsidies, and people abandoned their ethanol-fueled vehicles in favor of cheaper gasoline-fueled cars. Still, biofuels production and use survived and thrived in Brazil because Brazilian scientists and engineers discovered ways to make the process more efficient (breeding sugar cane to increase its yield per hectare of land, for example). And the government, through tax breaks and incentives, pushed automakers to manufacture flexible fuel cars that could run on gasoline, ethanol, or mixes of both. Today, Brazilians are further optimizing the yield of biofuels by genetically engineering sugar cane and the efficiency of biofuels through advances in engine design. And ∼90% of Brazilians own flex fuel vehicles. As long as oil prices stay above $25 per barrel (currently crude oil is ∼$66 per barrel), Brazilians will save money by driving cars that run on ethanol, according to Carlos Henriques de Brito Cruz, Scientific Director of the Foundation for the Support of Research of the State of Sao Paulo (FAPESP). Even if oil prices drop, Brazilians can choose the exact percentage of ethanol in their fuel tank. “The beautiful thing is that the decision is transferred completely from government and automaker to the owner of the car,” says Cruz. “It's power to the consumer.” For a lesson in biofuels success, Brazil is the award-winning teacher.

Researchers must deal with the current food for fuel outcry, in which environmentalists claim that making biofuels from an acre of land dedicated to food will promote more ecological destruction and influence food prices. “We really care about the environment and the long-term effects of biomass production,” says Somerville. “Food for fuel is not sustainable. Therefore, we would like to replace that with crops grown on land not used for food.” Somerville's team is investigating ways to find land that has gone out of production due to salination or pollution, for example, and to genetically engineer crops dedicated to biofuel production that can grow on this land. Finally, there are sustainability issues relating to the biofuels industry itself. The ultimate question of whether biofuels will make it as a viable alternative to fossil fuels comes down to cost. Can scientists engineer methods to make biofuels cheaply enough to rival gasoline at the pump? Right now, biofuels development is in its early adolescence and needs the backing of government to thrive. That does not mean simple subsidization. Government also sets policy. For example, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates that new sources of renewable energy and fuels must meet more stringent greenhouse gas emission thresholds (http://www.epa.gov/oms/renewablefuels/420f09023.htm). But it was only last month that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), commissioned to implement part of that policy, proposed what those new thresholds should be. For second-generation biofuels, the EPA mandates a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (measured over the entire biofuel lifecycle—from production, transport, and land use to distribution, blending, and end use) compared to the threshold levels set for gasoline in 2005 (http://www.epa.gov/oms/renewablefuels/420f09023.htm). It is not yet clear what effect this or any other new legislation will have on the fledgling biofuels industry. But some regulations could favor one type of technology over another for political rather than scientific reasons. “The last thing we need is the government specifying which technology will be the winner,” says Somerville. “There is a tendency to do this. Corn farmers have been very effective in specifying corn ethanol.” Whether the winner is ethanol from corn or grassoline from miscanthus, whether it is a sugar, bio-oil, or syngas-based technology, the jury is still out. But biofuels are very much in. “We have reached a tipping point,” Lynd says. “If we are going to have sustainable transportation, biofuels almost certainly have to be a part of it. This is not discretionary.”"

RNAi-mediated knockdown of CcnA2 and Cdk2 resulted in growth inhibition in both cell lines. These results indicate that the resistance of OSCC to IFNγ is not due simply to the deficiency in STAT1-dependent signaling but results from a defect in the signaling component that mediates this IFNγ-induced down-regulation of CcnA2 and Cdk2 expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

RNAi-mediated knockdown of CcnA2 and Cdk2 resulted in growth inhibition in both cell lines. These results indicate that the resistance of OSCC to IFNγ is not due simply to the deficiency in STAT1-dependent signaling but results from a defect in the signaling component that mediates this IFNγ-induced down-regulation of CcnA2 and Cdk2 expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

It exhibits a number of biological activities in host-defense systems and immunoregulation, including anti-viral and anti-tumor responses (1Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev.

The antiproliferative activity of IFNs has been well documented in a variety of tumor cell types. Multiple studies have shown that both type I (IFNα/β) and type II (IFNγ) IFNs induce cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, which is mediated by the up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 after IFN treatment (3Chin Y.E.

The p21 protein has been shown to inhibit cyclin/ Cdk activity, which phosphorylates the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor and then activates members of the E2F transcription factor family (8El-Deiry W.S.

Several studies have demonstrated the molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance to IFN. Defects in components of the IFN signaling pathway, such as the expression of the IFNγ receptor, Janus kinase (JAK), STAT1, STAT2, and interferon regulatory factor-9 (IRF-9/p48), have been identified in resistant cells (13Xu B.

Furthermore, reduced expression of ISGF-3 (a tetramer complex with STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-9) has been detected in skin squamous carcinoma cells from surgical specimens (18Clifford J.L. Walch E.

However, some types of tumor cells have been reported to resist IFNs despite having a normal JAK-STAT pathway (7Gooch J.L. Herrera R.E. Yee D.

However, the mechanism of JAK-STAT-independent IFN resistance remains poorly understood. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative effect of IFNγ and the resistance to the IFNγ-mediated effect in human oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) cells, we examined the effect of IFNγ on the growth of human OSCC cell lines. We also explored the mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative effect of IFNγ and the unresponsiveness of cells to this molecule. We demonstrated that IFNγ inhibits the growth of the HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 human OSCC cell lines, whereas Ca9–22 cells are resistant to IFNγ despite the presence of intact STAT1-dependent signaling. IFNγ inhibited the expression of cyclin A (CcnA2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) in HSC-2 cells, but not in Ca9–22 cells, and knockdown of either CcnA2 or Cdk2 by siRNA inhibited cell growth in both cell types. Furthermore, IFNγ suppressed the promoter activity of the CcnA2 and Cdk2 genes and destabilized CcnA2 and Cdk2 mRNAs in HSC-2 cells but not in Ca9–22 cells. These results suggest that the resistance of OSCC cells to the antiproliferative effect of IFNγ is not because of a deficiency in STAT1-dependent signaling but, instead, results from a defective signaling component that mediates the IFNγ-induced down-regulation of CcnA2 and Cdk2 expression. Recombinant human IFNγ was purchased from BioSource International Inc. (Camarillo, CA). A cell counting kit was obtained from Dojin Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies against CcnA2 (H432), Cdk2 (M-2), Cdk6 (C-21), p21 (C-19), STAT1 (E23), STAT3 (C-20), histone H1 (AE-4), and β-actin (I-19) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Hercules, CA).

Anti-α-tubulin antibody was obtained from Sigma. FuGENE transfection reagent and histone H1 were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. StealthTM Select RNAi oligonucleotides for CcnA2, Cdk2, and green fluorescent protein were obtained from Invitrogen. The HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, and Ca9–22 human OSCC cell lines were described previously (21Kamata N. Chida K. Rikimaru K. Horikoshi M. Enomoto S. Kuroki T.

These cells were originally isolated from metastatic OSCC cells derived from the oral cavity (21Kamata N. Chida K. Rikimaru K. Horikoshi M. Enomoto S. Kuroki T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1648-1653PubMed Google Scholar). For the cell proliferation assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (3 × 103 cells/well) and grown for 20 h before being treated with IFNγ. After treatment with IFNγ, the viable cell number was determined using the Cell Counting kit (Dojin) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After incubation with the reagent, the optical density at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader. The cell number after treatment with IFNγ was also counted using a hemocytometer after trypsinization. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (24Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14899-14907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) using a modification of the method described by Dignam et al. (25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (5 μg of total protein) were incubated in 12.5 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, containing 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.25 μg of poly(dI-dC). A 32P-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide from the IRF-1 gene (5′-tcgaGCCTGATTTCCCCGAAATGAGGC-3′) (26Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was then added to the reaction mixture. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Total cell lysates were resolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) and separated by SDS-PAGE in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, as described previously (23Hiroi M. Ohmori Y. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). siRNA transfection was performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMaxTM according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate. One day after plating, the siRNA (final concentration, 10 nmol) was suspended in 1 ml of RNAiMAX and added to each well. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and either used to determine the efficiency of knockdown or reseeded into a 96-well plate for the cell proliferation assays. Sequences encoding the 5′-flanking promoter/enhancer region of the human CcnA2 and Cdk2 genes were cloned from human genomic DNA using PCR with high fidelity Platinum PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) and a set of primers corresponding to the human CcnA2 (from −881 to +216) (GenBankTM accession number X68303) (27Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Bréchot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and the human Cdk2 (from −767 to +19) genomic sequences (GenBankTM accession number U50730) (28Shiffman D. Brooks E.E.

The amplified PCR fragments were individually subcloned into a luciferase reporter construct (pGL3-Basic, Promega), and the nucleotide sequence was confirmed. The resulting plasmids were designated as pGL-CcnA2–881 (CcnA2) and pGL-Cdk2–767 (Cdk2). The luciferase reporter plasmid pDel-1, which contains a 2.5-kb sequence from the 5′-flanking region of the human c-myc gene (29He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T.

The luciferase reporter construct pGL-IRF-1, which contains a 1.3-kb sequence from the 5′-flanking region of the IRF-1 gene (26Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and pTK GASluc, which contains four copies of the IFNγ activation site (GAS) motif from the IRF-1 gene upstream of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TK) promoter, were described previously (31Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection procedure and luciferase reporter assay were described previously (23Hiroi M. Ohmori Y. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To standardize the transfection efficiencies, the firefly luciferase activity from pGL luciferase reporter plasmids was normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity from the pRL-TK plasmid (Promega), and the relative luciferase activities in the different OSCC cells were normalized to the activity of the pCMVluc or the pGL3-Control plasmid. Cells were cultured in 6-cm dishes 20 h before stimulation and were then treated with IFNγ for the indicated periods. After trypsinization, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with cold 70% ethanol. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 250 μg/ml of RNase at 37 °C for 40 min. Cellular DNA was stained with 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide, and 5 × 104 cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (EPICS ALTRA, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The proportions of cells in different stages of the cell cycle were determined using WinCycle software (Beckman Coulter). Cells were cultured in 24-well plates for 20 h in complete medium before treatment with IFNγ. After treatment with or without IFNγ for varying periods, cells were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the last hour of the cultivation. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporated [3H]thymidine was extracted with 0.2% SDS and 0.5 n NaOH and measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). CcnA2-dependent kinase activity was assessed in vitro by the phosphorylation of histone H1. Cells were lysed in an ice-cold kinase lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). After centrifugation, 1 μg of anti-CcnA2 antibody was added, and the sample was agitated for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, protein A-agarose beads were added and incubated for an additional hour. The immunoprecipitates were washed with Cdk kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and mixed in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 40 mm MgCl2, 25 mm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 1 μg of histone H1 at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and the samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, and phosphorylation of histone H1 was detected with autoradiography. The preparation of total RNA by the guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method and northern hybridization analyses were carried out as described previously (24Ohmori Y. Schreiber R.D. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14899-14907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments for human CcnA2 and Cdk2 were prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR using a set of primers corresponding to sequences for human CcnA2 (GenBankTM accession number NM001237) and Cdk2 (GenBankTM accession number NM001798). The PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the nucleotide sequences were confirmed. Some northern blots were quantified using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed on the LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) using the TaqMan® probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) in a 20-μl reaction volume. After the reverse transcriptase reaction, qRT-PCR was performed using the TaqMan® Gene Expression Master Mix reagents, the TaqMan® gene expression assay (c-myc, assay ID Hs00153408_m1), and the endogenous control (18 S rRNA) in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were performed and analyzed using the LightCycler 480 system (Roche Diagnostics). Each mRNA level was normalized to that of the 18 S rRNA, and the relative expression level was determined using the standard curve method for multiplex PCR. The transcript abundance was calculated as the percentages of the control or experimental sample values normalized to the 18 S rRNA. IFNγ has been shown to inhibit the growth of a wide variety of tumor cells. We initially examined the effects of various doses of IFNγ on the growth of four asynchronously proliferating human OSCC lines (Fig. 1A). Treatment of HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 cells with IFNγ inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion. However, IFNγ had only a marginal effect on the proliferation of Ca9–22 cells, even at high concentrations (100 ng/ml). In separate experiments, a higher concentration of IFNγ (300 ng/ml) similarly showed no significant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of Ca9–22 cells (data not shown). The differential sensitivity of cell proliferation to IFNγ was also determined by direct cell counting at different times during culture (Fig. 1B). IFNγ inhibited the growth of HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 cells, with a significant inhibition observed after 48 h of IFNγ treatment. By contrast, IFNγ failed to inhibit the growth of Ca9–22 cells at any of the time points examined. IFNγ-mediated biological activities are mediated by the STAT1-dependent signaling pathway (32Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C.

To determine whether the differential antiproliferative effect of IFNγ is because of a defect in STAT1-dependent function, we analyzed the functional integrity of IFNγ-induced STAT1 activation in these oral carcinoma cells. Initially, we assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Try-701) in the OSCC cells by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). IFNγ caused phosphorylation of STAT1 on Tyr-701, and all of the OSCC cells showed similar levels of phosphorylated STAT1. We next analyzed the DNA binding activity of STAT1 in nuclear extracts from cells treated with IFNγ (Fig. 2B). Gel-shift assays using nuclear extracts from OSCC cells showed that in all cell lines IFNγ induced the formation of a prominent DNA binding complex on the probe for the IRF-1 GAS, which contains a high affinity STAT1 binding motif (26Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C.

The presence of STAT1 in the DNA binding complexes was demonstrated by a supershift assay with anti-STAT1 antibody. We further analyzed IFNγ-induced STAT1-dependent transcriptional activity using luciferase reporter constructs containing 1.3 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence from the IRF-1 gene (Fig. 2C), which is regulated by STAT1 (26Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and a heterologous promoter construct containing four copies of the GAS motif from the IRF-1 gene placed upstream of the herpes simplex virus-TK promoter (31Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5474-5482PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2D). IFNγ markedly induced the luciferase activity driven by the IRF-1 promoter and the TK heterologous promoter in all OSCC cells. These results indicate that IFNγ-induced STAT1-dependent transcriptional activity is intact in these OSCC cells and that activation of STAT1 by itself may be insufficient to mediate the antiproliferative effect of IFNγ. Recent studies have shown that IFNγ-activated STAT3 functions as a component of the STAT1-independent signaling pathway (35Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To determine whether the differential antiproliferative effect of IFNγ is because of IFNγ-induced STAT3, we analyzed the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr-705) in the OSCC cells by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. 1). Although constitutively active tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 was observed in all OSCC cells, IFNγ failed to further enhance the phosphorylated Tyr-705 STAT3. These results indicate that STAT3 is not involved in the differences observed in the antiproliferative effect of IFNγ on the different OSCC cells. IFNγ has been shown to activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, which mediates some biological activities of IFNγ (36Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To examine whether IFNγ differentially affects the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HSC-2 and Ca9–22 cells, we measured the levels of the phosphorylated forms of Akt over time using Western blotting techniques (supplemental Fig. 2). Both HSC-2 and Ca9–22 cells constitutively expressed phosphorylated forms of Akt on Thr-308 and Ser-473. However, IFNγ failed to up-regulate these phosphorylated forms of Akt. Consistent with these results, phosphorylation of PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1) (37Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), an upstream kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of Akt Thr-308, was also unchanged in the cells treated with IFNγ. These results do not implicate the PI3K/Akt pathway in the observed differential sensitivity to IFNγ. To understand the underlying mechanism of the IFNγ-induced differential growth inhibition of OSCC cells, we next analyzed the cell-cycle distribution in response to IFNγ treatment using flow cytometry (Fig. 3). Quantitative analysis of the distribution of cells in the cell cycle indicates that treatment of HSC-2 cells with IFNγ blocks S-phase progression concomitant with a decrease in the relative proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase (Fig. 3A). By contrast, Ca9–22 cells showed only a slight change in cell cycle distribution after IFNγ treatment. To confirm that the S-phase cell cycle arrest in HSC-2 cells correlated with the antiproliferative effect of IFNγ, we assessed the rate of DNA synthesis by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (Fig. 3B). A marked inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed in HSC-2 cells after 48 h of IFNγ treatment. Because DNA replication and S-phase progression are regulated by CcnA2-associated kinase (39Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), we analyzed the activity of this kinase using histone H1 as a substrate (Fig. 4A). Although CcnA2-associated kinase activity decreased in a time-dependent fashion in untreated cultures (lanes 1 and 3), treatment of HSC-2 cells with IFNγ markedly inhibited the kinase activity (lanes 2 and 4). By contrast, no inhibitory effect of IFNγ on the kinase activity was observed in Ca9–22 cells. These results indicate that IFNγ inhibits CcnA2-associated kinase activity in HSC-2 cells but not in Ca9–22 cells. CcnA2-associated kinase activity is regulated by Cdk inhibitors such as p21WAF1/Cip1 (8El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

https://openalex.org/W1994053097,"Lithium has long been used for the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar mood disorder. However, nerve cells are not the sole targets of lithium. Indeed, lithium was reported to target numerous cell types, and affect cell proliferation, differentiation and death. Thus, the idea has been raised that lithium may act on signaling pathways involved in neoplastic transformation. Indeed, the effect of lithium on tumor progression is currently being tested in a limited number of clinical trials. However, the molecular mechanisms by which lithium affects neoplastic transformation remain to be characterized. Here, using mouse fibroblasts transformed by the v-src oncogene as a model, we show that lithium drastically inhibits cell motility and compromises the invasive phenotype of v-src-transformed cells. In addition, we show that this effect is mediated by the activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatases, but not by the direct inhibition of the v-Src tyrosine kinase. Finally, we show that lithium activates phosphotyrosine phosphatases by the modulation of the redox status of the cell, independently of the Wnt and the inositol phosphate canonical pathways. Thus, this study supports the idea that lithium, acting similar to an antioxydizer, may have antimetastatic properties in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2042547182,"I was born in Cambridge, England, where my father, David Green, had done the research for his Ph.D. in the laboratory of Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins and where he remained as a Beit Fellow. My mother was English, whereas my father was an American citizen. When war broke out in Europe in 1940, America remained neutral, and my father was forced to leave England or give up his American citizenship. I grew up in Boston, New York, and then Madison, WI, where my father held a succession of academic positions. My earliest exposure to biochemistry, and to vitamins, was meeting the stream of scientists who joined our family for dinners. My mother was famous for her ability to prepare a dinner for guests with very limited notice and for her warm hospitality. Among those whose visits I remember were Luis Leloir and Sarah Ratner. I of course also met the members of my father's laboratory at the Enzyme Institute in Madison, and sometimes on Saturdays, I accompanied him to the laboratory and played with pH indicator dyes in little dimpled porcelain trays. I liked science and mathematics in school but never seriously imagined a career in science, most particularly because at that time there were few women in science, and most of those whom I met had chosen science to the exclusion of marriage and families. During one summer when I was in high school, my father employed me on the “night shift,” charged with preparing beef heart mitochondria for the next day's research. We would process vast amounts of beef heart from the local slaughterhouse in giant Waring Blendors and then isolate the mitochondria by differential centrifugation using a bank of centrifuges in the basement of the Enzyme Institute. I was amazed to find that I liked the work and enjoyed the camaraderie of the night shift. Nonetheless, I went to Radcliffe College in 1956 with the stated goal of becoming a social worker rather than a scientist! By that time, Radcliffe had merged with Harvard in all but name, and our classes were held jointly and graded jointly, even though our degrees remained separate. My cousin Barbara Green was a senior in Bertram Hall, where I was assigned as a freshman, and she was majoring in Biology. She spent hours telling me about the revolution in biology that was occurring, some of it at the Biology Laboratories at Harvard. So in the second semester of my freshman year, I signed up for my first science course, Biology 1. In the laboratory that accompanied this course, I met my husband-to-be, a Harvard sophomore named Larry Matthews. By the end of the first year of college, I had decided to major in Biology. The next 2 years were spent taking the required preparatory courses. I loved organic chemistry and calculus and hated introductory physics for non-majors, which seemed incredibly dry and unrelated to biology; at that time, the course was all about levers and pulleys, with almost nothing about atomic structure and nothing at all about quantum mechanics. In my junior and senior years, my biology courses were fascinating, e.g. a seminar in genetics taught by R. P. Levine and a course in biochemistry taught by George Wald. Wald was an incredibly inspiring lecturer, whose enthusiasm for science was infectious. A few months before graduation and my marriage to Larry, I broke my leg rather badly in a skiing accident, which greatly impaired my hunting for a job after college. Wald offered me a job as a research assistant in his laboratory. In retrospect, I find it amazing that I did not even consider applying to graduate school despite the fact that I graduated summa cum laude in Biology, but in 1960, there were almost no female role models on the faculty at Harvard, and I think it is fair to say that most male faculty members did not expect women, and especially married women, to seriously pursue academic careers in science. I worked in George Wald's laboratory while my husband completed his M.D. degree at Harvard Medical School. It was a revelation for me. The Wald laboratory studied the role of vitamin A in visual transduction, focusing on the events that occurred when visual excitation was triggered by the light-induced isomerization of vitamin A aldehyde (retinaldehyde) bound to rhodopsin. George's laboratory was small, and he offered each of us great independence in studying the steps in the bleaching of rhodopsin that were initiated by light. My bench mate, Toru Yoshizawa, devised a means of measuring the early intermediates in bleaching at very low temperature and discovered pre-lumirhodopsin. John Dowling was studying the physiological role of vitamin A acid (retinoic acid), which was unrelated to vision. George suggested to me that I should examine some rather peculiar spectral changes that accompanied the bleaching of frog rhodopsin at room temperature and then left to spend the summer at Woods Hole. I was to see whether similar changes might accompany bleaching of rhodopsin isolated from cattle retinas. The earlier studies in the Wald laboratory had elucidated a series of irreversible steps in bleaching, from rhodopsin to pre-lumirhodopsin, to lumirhodopsin, and thence to metarhodopsin, but what I saw was that there was a reversible equilibrium between two forms of metarhodopsin that differed in their spectral properties (1Matthews R.G. Hubbard R. Brown P.K. Wald G. Tautomeric forms of metarhodopsin..J. Gen. Physiol. 1963; 47: 215-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The equilibrium could be shifted by varying the temperature or the pH or by adding glycerol to the solution. Classic metarhodopsin was red, with an absorption maximum at 478 nm, indicating that the Schiff base linkage between the protein and retinaldehyde was protonated, whereas what I termed metarhodopsin II was yellow, suggesting that this form had a deprotonated Schiff base. However, the pH dependence of the equilibrium was exactly opposite, with low pH favoring metarhodopsin II, suggesting that a major conformational change in the protein was associated with this transition. In collaboration with Paul Brown, who had designed and built a microspectrophotometer in the Wald laboratory, we were able to make measurements on isolated frog retinas. These measurements confirmed the formation of metarhodopsin II in the retina, and to our delight, they suggested that the appearance of metarhodopsin II coincided with the initiation of a neuronal signal. What we know now, but did not know then, is that metarhodopsin II is R*, the activated form of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin. These experiments were thrilling for me; trying to develop a coherent framework to explain my observations kept me awake at night and let me experience firsthand the excitement of science. Thus began the reorientation that led me to decide to become an independent scientist. Another factor in this transition was the atmosphere in the Wald laboratory. Each day, the entire group met for lunch in a room dedicated for that purpose. We took turns shopping for lunch supplies and shared the costs. Lunch conversations ranged from science to politics to art and music. We were often joined by guests, who contributed vigorously to our discussions. I remember visits from John Edsall, whose laboratory was upstairs, and from Jeffries Wyman, who had just finished walking across the Khyber Pass from India to Afghanistan. Larry and I were frequent guests at the Walds' home, not just for laboratory parties but also more casually. Sometimes we were the only guests for dinner, and sometimes we were joined by guests with expertise and interests that ranged from Mayan archaeology to biology. Ruth Hubbard, George's wife, was not only a fine scientist in her own right but also a wonderful hostess and the mother of a young child. Of all the scientists who influenced my career, I think Ruth had the greatest impact. In apportioning her efforts between science and family, Ruth seemed to have the right balance, and she made it clear that one could do first-rate science and be a wife and mother. I made the decision shortly thereafter that I would go to graduate school. Larry was completing his M.D. degree at Harvard Medical School and seeking a residency in orthopedics. We chose to go to the University of Michigan, he to residency and I to graduate school in biophysics. For a woman who hated introductory physics, one may wonder why I chose a graduate major that involved more years of study of physics. My experience with the interplay of light and rhodopsin had convinced me that it was important to understand biology at the molecular level and that this required quantitative analyses of the experimental data. By this time, I was familiar with the elegant analyses of Edsall and Wyman. Wyman's mathematical analysis of hemoglobin had played a major role in the development of the theory of allosterism (2Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. On the nature of allosteric transitions: a plausible model..J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6128) Google Scholar). I wanted to understand problems of interest to me at a similar level of detail. At that time, Lawrence Oncley was Chair of the Biophysics Research Division at Michigan. It was a small unit with only a few graduate students matriculating each year, and Oncley personally met with each of us and helped us to select courses. Completion of my Ph.D. was delightfully complicated by the birth of my first child, Brian, at the end of my first year of graduate school and not so delightfully by my husband's being subjected to the doctor's draft during the Vietnam War. He was first assigned to Fort Jackson, SC, where I taught for a year at the University of South Carolina. We made many friends at the Department of Biochemistry there, perhaps most of all, Dr. Theodore Cole, who was head of the department. He actually taught the first several lectures in my course, when my son's arrival came a little later than expected! At the end of this year, Larry received orders to go to Vietnam, where he was stationed in An Khe in the Central Highlands, and I returned to graduate school at Michigan. I decided to do my thesis research with Vincent Massey, who had recently moved from Sheffield to Michigan, and with that decision I move from vitamin A to vitamin B2. Massey was studying a broad spectrum of enzymes that used flavin cofactors, and he was particularly interested in understanding how the protein modified the intrinsic reactivity of the flavin cofactor. Massey rapidly assembled a large and very active laboratory, populated with postdoctoral fellows from around the world and with graduate students from both biochemistry and biophysics. He was a little unsure whether a currently single mother of a young child could successfully complete a Ph.D., but he gamely agreed to let me continue in his laboratory. He wanted me to study the old yellow enzyme, “das alte gelbe ferment,” an enzyme that had first been identified by Warburg and Christian and had been purified and characterized by Theorell. To purify the enzyme from yeast autolysates, I adapted a simple batch purification step using DEAE-cellulose, followed by chromatography on DEAE and then on calcium phosphate. To my amazement, old yellow enzyme was not yellow but green! The spectrum indicated a charge transfer complex. Such charge transfer complexes frequently occur when small molecules are bound in close proximity to the flavin cofactor of a flavoprotein. I used anaerobic dialysis of reduced old yellow enzyme to separate the putative small molecule from the protein and was able to identify a peak with absorbance at 330 nm by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-2 (3Matthews R.G. Massey V. The isolation of old yellow enzyme in free and complexed forms..J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1779-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fraction had “regreening” activity. I could isolate compounds from yeast extract that gave rise to similar but not identical spectral changes when added to old yellow enzyme. In the course of purifying these compounds, I caught a whiff of vanilla in the lyophilisate. If I had only looked up the chemical structure of vanilla, I would have saved a year of dissertation research! The mysterious regreening factor was shown to be p-hydroxybenzaldehyde by mass spectral analysis (4Matthews R.G. Massey V. Sweeley C.C. Identification of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde as the ligand in the green form of old yellow enzyme..J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9294-9298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The University of Michigan did not have a sensitive mass spectrometer for biological work at that time, and so I traveled to Michigan State to collaborate with Charles Sweeley in characterizing my ligand. Vanilla, which is p-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, also forms a charge transfer complex with old yellow enzyme! Despite extensive characterization, the physiological function of old yellow enzyme in yeast and its physiological oxidant remain unknown. We had hoped that the identification of the regreening factor would provide a clue as to the oxidizing substrate, but alas, this did not happen. By the time I defended my Ph.D. dissertation, I was pregnant with our second child. My husband and I had planned to pursue joint fellowships in Stockholm, but on my arrival, I discovered that Sweden provided 9-month maternity leaves and had absolutely no facilities for care of a newborn, so my fellowship had to be delayed until our return to the United States. Larry had promised to return to Michigan as a faculty member upon completion of his research fellowship, and I was offered an opportunity to do my postdoctoral fellowship with Charles Williams at Michigan. The Williams laboratory also studied flavoproteins, especially flavin-disulfide oxidoreductases, and efforts to determine the x-ray structures of these important enzymes were under way in other laboratories. I was particularly interested in measuring the pH dependence of the reduction potential of the flavin cofactor of lipoamide dehydrogenase. The two-electron reduced form of lipoamide dehydrogenase, in which the redox-active disulfide is reduced but the flavin remains oxidized, exhibits characteristic absorbance at 530 nm indicative of a charge transfer complex between a thiolate (presumably from the reduced disulfide bond) and the oxidized flavin. Our studies showed that reduction of the disulfide by dihydrolipoamide involved transfer of two electrons and two protons throughout the pH range between 5.5 and 7.6. Thus, if the charge transfer absorbance is due to a thiolate interacting with the oxidized flavin, it is necessary to invoke a base that accepts the second proton upon reduction as shown in Fig. 1. We postulated that an active-site residue, perhaps a histidine, is protonated upon reduction of the disulfide and that this conjugate base stabilizes the thiolate anion of the reduced disulfide (5Matthews R.G. Williams Jr., C.H. Measurement of the oxidation-reduction potentials for two-electron and four-electron reduction of lipoamide dehydrogenase from pig heart..J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3956-3964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). I next wanted to see whether this putative active-site base played a role in activation of dihydrolipoamide for disulfide interchange with the redox-active disulfide of dihydrolipoamide reductase. My colleague David Ballou had an anaerobic stopped-flow spectrophotometer, which permitted rapid measurements of the enzyme absorbance after the oxidized dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was mixed with dihydrolipoamide or the reduced enzyme was mixed with lipoamide. We measured the reaction in both directions as a function of pH. Our experimental results were consistent with a mechanism in which the active-site base accepts a proton from dihydrolipoamide to activate the thiol for nucleophilic attack on the enzymatic disulfide bond (6Matthews R.G. Ballou D.P. Thorpe C. Williams Jr., C.H. Ion pair formation in pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase..J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3199-3207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Shortly after this paper was published, Charles Williams attended a symposium in La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, at which Georg Schultz presented the x-ray structure of the related flavin-disulfide oxidoreductase, glutathione reductase. To our delight, a histidine was indeed present in the active site, perfectly positioned to stabilize the thiolate in the two-electron reduced enzyme. This x-ray structure, which illuminated so many of our experiments, influenced me profoundly. It was clear that our detailed kinetic and thermodynamic experiments could help to interpret the structure that they provided and that their beautiful structure could help us visualize the active site in ways that immediately suggested further experiments. The Williams laboratory was a very exciting place to be at that time. Colin Thorpe, trained as a inorganic chemist, was a postdoctoral fellow, and Keith Wilkinson and Mike O'Donnell were graduate students in the laboratory. We discussed our experiments on a daily basis, and together, we examined the structure of glutathione reductase and discussed its implications for our own work. The entire laboratory met daily for lunch, and our discussions ranged from science to politics. Charles was also an amazing mentor, who gave each of us independent and non-overlapping projects and who also allowed us to move our projects in new directions. Because Larry and I were not easily moveable since he was now an Assistant Professor in Orthopedics, Charles arranged for me to receive an appointment as a non-tenure track assistant professor and coaxed the Veterans Affairs Hospital into giving me a small laboratory and a technician so that I could begin independent research. I cannot emphasize enough how daring a decision that was for Charles, the Veterans Affairs Hospital, and the Chair of Biological Chemistry at the University of Michigan, Jud Coon. Only a few years before, anti-nepotism rules would have forbidden my appointment in most departments in the country, and yet here these brave men were encouraging me to begin an independent academic career. I decided to study the role of folic acid (vitamin B9) in one-carbon metabolism. The structure of the active reduced form of this vitamin is chemically very similar to that of dihydroriboflavin, and both can function in oxidation-reduction reactions (Fig. 2). However, in contrast to the roles of riboflavin-derived cofactors, which almost universally involve oxidoreduction, many enzymes that use folate cofactors catalyze reactions involving transfer of a one-carbon unit with no apparent involvement of oxidoreductions. I wanted to see whether “latent oxidoreductions” facilitated these one-carbon transfers. Folate-dependent enzymes such as dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase had already been studied in detail because they were important targets for cancer chemotherapy. I focused my attention on the folate-dependent enzymes involved in methionine biosynthesis and regeneration (Fig. 3). The first step in this pathway, in which a methyl group is generated de novo by reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate, is catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). This enzyme was shown to be a flavoprotein with an FAD cofactor in Robert Stokstad's laboratory in Berkeley. Although the Stokstad laboratory was unable to purify the mammalian enzyme to homogeneity, their studies also elucidated an extremely important allosteric modulation of MTHFR activity by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (7Kutzbach C. Stokstad E.L. Mammalian methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase: partial purification, properties, and inhibition by S-adenosylmethionine..Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 250: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). AdoMet serves as the universal methyl donor in biological systems, and its availability regulates the de novo synthesis of methyl groups, which uniquely are transferred to homocysteine to form methionine, the precursor of AdoMet. Thus, the Stokstad laboratory had provided a classic example of feedback inhibition. My major interest in this pathway pertained to the cellular control of one-carbon metabolism. Methylenetetrahydrofolate is essential for the de novo biosynthesis of thymidylate and is reversibly interconvertible with 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, the one-carbon donor for de novo purine biosynthesis. As shown by Stokstad, reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate is an irreversible reaction that removes this one-carbon donor from the pool available for nucleotide biosynthesis. Under these circumstances, partitioning of one-carbon units should not be regulated just by demand for methionine but also by demand for purines and pyrimidines, but no mechanism for this partitioning was known. The second step in the de novo generation of the methyl group of methionine is the transfer of the methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine to form methionine. In prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli, this step terminates the pathway for methionine biosynthesis. In mammals, for which methionine is an essential amino acid because they are unable to synthesize homocysteine, this step conserves methionine by regenerating the methyl group. Thus, methionine must be supplied from the diet to support protein synthesis, but the demands for methionine for biological methylation reactions can be sustained by regeneration of methionine from the homocysteine produced as a result of these reactions. Methionine synthase in mammals uses methylcobalamin, a derivative of vitamin B12, as a prosthetic group, and in E. coli, a highly homologous protein, the metH gene product, is synthesized when the bacteria are supplied with vitamin B12. The E. coli protein had been characterized, and the detailed mechanism was described by the laboratories of Herb Weissbach, who has recently written a Reflections article describing his studies (8Weissbach H. The isolation of the vitamin B12 coenzyme and the role of the vitamin in methionine synthesis..J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23497-23504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and of Frank Huennekens. The mechanism based on these studies is shown in Fig. 4. During catalysis, the cobalamin prosthetic group is alternately methylated with a methyl group derived from methyltetrahydrofolate and demethylated by transfer of the methyl group to homocysteine. Demethylation results in the formation of cob(I)alamin, in which the pair of electrons forming the carbon–cobalt bond in methylcobalamin remain on the cobalt. Cob(I)alamin is highly reactive toward oxygen, and during turnover, it undergoes oxidation about once in every thousand turnovers, forming cob(II)alamin. This form of the enzyme is inactive, and return to the catalytic cycle requires both reduction and remethylation. The Huennekens laboratory showed that the electron donor for reductive reactivation in the E. coli enzyme is flavodoxin, a small electron transport protein (9Fujii K. Huennekens F.M. Activation of methionine synthetase by a reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-dependent flavoprotein system..J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6745-6753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The source of the methyl groups for reactivation is AdoMet rather than methyltetrahydrofolate (10Mangum J.H. Scrimgeour K.G. Cofactor requirements and intermediates in methionine biosynthesis..Fed. Proc. 1962; 21: 242Google Scholar). I found this complicated reaction cycle very intriguing. Here is an enzyme that reacts with three different substrates and must distinguish between the reactivation and primary turnover methyl donors to avoid futile cycling. In the absence of any structural information, we had no clue about how this discrimination might occur. My small laboratory group began our studies by developing methods for the efficient purification to homogeneity of both enzymes, mindful of Arthur Kornberg's commandment “do not waste clean thinking on dirty enzymes” (11Kornberg A. Ten commandments: lessons from the enzymology of DNA replication..J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3613-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Purification of MTHFR was particularly challenging because in this case the enzyme had to be purified from a mammalian source since the bacterial enzyme lacked the complex allosteric regulation of the mammalian enzyme. We chose pig liver because it was readily available from a local slaughterhouse, but 3 kg of pig liver contain only 7 mg of MTHFR! Maria Vanoni, who was a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory, placed a Chinese poster on our wall, “This is the year of the pig.” Frozen pig livers were diced and blended into a slurry that was clarified by low speed centrifugation. Chromatography of this disgusting soup was impossible, so we devised a batch DEAE purification that gave us a 20-fold purification with a 99% yield and resulted in a clear solution containing our enzyme. Subsequent chromatographic steps resulted in a 32,000-fold purification with a 14% overall yield to produce 1 mg of homogeneous enzyme (12Daubner S.C. Matthews R.G. Purification and properties of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase from pig liver..J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 140-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Younger readers may wonder why we did not simply clone MTHFR, but this was the early 1980s, when mammalian cloning was in its infancy. Ironically, although we later collaborated with Rima Rozen in Montreal to clone human MTHFR, the only successful method of overexpression is in baculovirus-infected cells (13Yamada K. Chen Z. Rozen R. Matthews R.G. Effects of common polymorphisms on the properties of recombinant human methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14853-14858Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) (and very recently in Pichia pastoris (14Wolthers K.R. Scrutton N.S. Cobalamin uptake and reactivation occurs through specific protein interactions in the methionine synthase-methionine synthase reductase complex..FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), despite efforts in many laboratories. The inability to successfully overexpress mammalian enzymes has greatly inhibited many efforts to study mammalian metabolism at the molecular level and remains one of the great barriers to progress. About 10 years after our initial purification of porcine MTHFR, I received a call from Rima Rozen, a human geneticist at McGill University in Montreal. She thought that she had cloned human MTHFR and sent me some sequence data to look at. Unfortunately, the sequence was of an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase rather than the desired MTHFR. At that time, I had a graduate student, James Sumner, who was attempting to clone porcine MTHFR using peptide sequence data from the N-terminal catalytic domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain. Rima and I decided to join forces, and in a few months, human MTHFR had indeed been cloned (15Goyette P. Sumner J.S. Milos R. Duncan A.M. Rosenblatt D.S. Matthews R.G. Rozen R. Human methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase: isolation of cDNA, mapping and mutation identification..Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 16Kang S.S. Wong P.W. Susmano A. Sora J. Norusis M. Ruggie N. Thermolabile methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase: an inherited risk factor for coronary artery disease..Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 536-545PubMed Google Scholar). Rima was particularly interested in reports that a frequent polymorphism in human MTHFR was associated with elevated plasma homocysteine and might be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in humans. Before sequencing of the MTHFR gene, this polymorphism was identified by the thermolability of the MTHFR protein in lymphocyte extracts (16Kang S.S. Wong P.W. Susmano A. Sora J. Norusis M. Ruggie N. Thermolabile methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase: an inherited risk factor for coronary artery disease..Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 536-545PubMed Google Scholar). By analysis of the MTHFR gene from 114 humans, she located the polymorphism at nucleotide 677. At this locus, a C leads to an alanine in position 222 of human MTHFR, whereas a T leads to a valine in the same position. The polymorphism is extremely common, with ∼10% of humans having the TT genotype. Rima showed that the 677C→T polymorphism was indeed associated with significant thermolability of MTHFR, as assessed by heat treatment of lymphocyte extracts (17Frosst P. Blom H.J. Milos R. Goyette P. Sheppard C.A. Matthews R.G. Boers G.J. den Heijer M. Kluijtmans L.A. van den Heuvel L.P. Rozen R. A candidate genetic risk factor for vascular disease: a common mutation in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase..Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5104) Google Scholar). Frustrated by the inability to express human MTHFR at levels necessary for biochemical analysis, we decided to clone, overexpress, and purify the enzyme from E. coli. As mentioned earlier, this enzyme lacks the C-terminal regulatory domain of the mammalian enzymes. Christal Sheppard was able to overexpress and purify the wild-type bacterial enzyme (18Sheppard C.A. Trimmer E.E. Matthews R.G. Purification and properties of NADH-dependent 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MetF) from Escherichia coli..J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 718-725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and she collaborated with the laboratory of Martha Ludwig to obtain a crystal structure of the enzyme (19Guenther B.D. Sheppard C.A. Tran P. Rozen R. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. The structure and properties of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase from Escherichia coli suggest how folate ameliorates human hyperhomocysteinemia..Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The bacterial enzyme is a tetramer of identical subunits that are arranged in a planar rose"
