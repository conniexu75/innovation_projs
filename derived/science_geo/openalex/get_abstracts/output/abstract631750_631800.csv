https://openalex.org/W2938206352,"Cancer treatments have evolved from indiscriminate cytotoxic agents to selective genome- and immune-targeted drugs that have transformed the outcomes of some malignancies1. Tumor complexity and heterogeneity suggest that the ‘precision medicine’ paradigm of cancer therapy requires treatment to be personalized to the individual patient2–6. To date, precision oncology trials have been based on molecular matching with predetermined monotherapies7–14. Several of these trials have been hindered by very low matching rates, often in the 5–10% range15, and low response rates. Low matching rates may be due to the use of limited gene panels, restrictive molecular matching algorithms, lack of drug availability, or the deterioration and death of end-stage patients before therapy can be implemented. We hypothesized that personalized treatment with combination therapies would improve outcomes in patients with refractory malignancies. As a first test of this concept, we implemented a cross-institutional prospective study (I-PREDICT, NCT02534675 ) that used tumor DNA sequencing and timely recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies. We found that administration of customized multidrug regimens was feasible, with 49% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment. Targeting of a larger fraction of identified molecular alterations, yielding a higher ‘matching score’, was correlated with significantly improved disease control rates, as well as longer progression-free and overall survival rates, compared to targeting of fewer somatic alterations. Our findings suggest that the current clinical trial paradigm for precision oncology, which pairs one driver mutation with one drug, may be optimized by treating molecularly complex and heterogeneous cancers with combinations of customized agents. A prospective clinical study of cancer patients (I-PREDICT) demonstrated the feasibility of matching genomic alterations found in tumors to combined drug treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2938634307,"Precision medicine focuses on DNA abnormalities, but not all tumors have tractable genomic alterations. The WINTHER trial (
 NCT01856296
 ) navigated patients to therapy on the basis of fresh biopsy-derived DNA sequencing (arm A; 236 gene panel) or RNA expression (arm B; comparing tumor to normal). The clinical management committee (investigators from five countries) recommended therapies, prioritizing genomic matches; physicians determined the therapy given. Matching scores were calculated post-hoc for each patient, according to drugs received: for DNA, the number of alterations matched divided by the total alteration number; for RNA, expression-matched drug ranks. Overall, 303 patients consented; 107 (35%; 69 in arm A and 38 in arm B) were evaluable for therapy. The median number of previous therapies was three. The most common diagnoses were colon, head and neck, and lung cancers. Among the 107 patients, the rate of stable disease ≥6 months and partial or complete response was 26.2% (arm A: 23.2%; arm B: 31.6% (P = 0.37)). The patient proportion with WINTHER versus previous therapy progression-free survival ratio of >1.5 was 22.4%, which did not meet the pre-specified primary end point. Fewer previous therapies, better performance status and higher matching score correlated with longer progression-free survival (all P < 0.05, multivariate). Our study shows that genomic and transcriptomic profiling are both useful for improving therapy recommendations and patient outcome, and expands personalized cancer treatment. Prospective analysis of transcriptomic and genomic alterations increases the proportion of patients with solid cancer who are eligible for receiving matched therapies and shows promise in improving clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2939798759,"Chronic inflammation is postulated to be involved in the development of end-stage renal disease in diabetes, but which specific circulating inflammatory proteins contribute to this risk remain unknown. To study this, we examined 194 circulating inflammatory proteins in subjects from three independent cohorts with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In each cohort, we identified an extremely robust kidney risk inflammatory signature (KRIS), consisting of 17 proteins enriched in tumor necrosis factor-receptor superfamily members, that was associated with a 10-year risk of end-stage renal disease. All these proteins had a systemic, non-kidney source. Our prospective study findings provide strong evidence that KRIS proteins contribute to the inflammatory process underlying end-stage renal disease development in both types of diabetes. These proteins point to new therapeutic targets and new prognostic tests to identify subjects at risk of end-stage renal disease, as well as biomarkers to measure responses to treatment of diabetic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W2938864889,"Sequencing of circulating tumor DNA from cancer patients is a cost-efficient approach with turnaround time compatible with clinical practice to inform treatment decision-making in a phase 1 trial setting Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) supports blood-based genomic profiling but is not yet routinely implemented in the setting of a phase I trials clinic. TARGET is a molecular profiling program with the primary aim to match patients with a broad range of advanced cancers to early phase clinical trials on the basis of analysis of both somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) across a 641 cancer-associated-gene panel in a single ctDNA assay. For the first 100 TARGET patients, ctDNA data showed good concordance with matched tumor and results were turned round within a clinically acceptable timeframe for Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) review. When a 2.5% variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold was applied, actionable mutations were identified in 41 of 100 patients, and 11 of these patients received a matched therapy. These data support the application of ctDNA in this early phase trial setting where broad genomic profiling of contemporaneous tumor material enhances patient stratification to novel therapies and provides a practical template for bringing routinely applied blood-based analyses to the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2937725692,"Spliceosome mutations are common in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but the oncogenic changes due to these mutations have not been identified. Here a global analysis of exon usage in AML samples revealed distinct molecular subsets containing alternative spliced isoforms of inflammatory and immune genes. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) was the dominant alternatively spliced isoform in MDS and AML and is characterized by a longer isoform that retains exon 4, which encodes IRAK4-long (IRAK4-L), a protein that assembles with the myddosome, results in maximal activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of B cells (NF-κB) and is essential for leukaemic cell function. Expression of IRAK4-L is mediated by mutant U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1) and is associated with oncogenic signalling in MDS and AML. Inhibition of IRAK4-L abrogates leukaemic growth, particularly in AML cells with higher expression of the IRAK4-L isoform. Collectively, mutations in U2AF1 induce expression of therapeutically targetable 'active' IRAK4 isoforms and provide a genetic link to activation of chronic innate immune signalling in MDS and AML."
https://openalex.org/W2935889870,"Van der Waals heterostructures with small misalignment between adjacent layers ('interlayer twist') are of interest because of electronic structure and correlation phenomena (such as superconductivity) that are determined by both the atomic lattice and long-range superlattice potentials arising in interlayer moiré patterns1-7. Previously, such twisted heterostructures have involved a single planar interface between layers isolated by exfoliation and micromechanically stacked in the desired relative orientation1,8-12. Here we demonstrate a class of materials-van der Waals nanowires of layered crystals-in which a tunable interlayer twist evolves naturally during synthesis. In vapour-liquid-solid growth, nanowires of germanium(II) sulfide, an anisotropic layered semiconductor, crystallize with layering along the wire axis13 and have a strong propensity for forming axial screw dislocations. Nanometre-resolved electron diffraction shows that Eshelby twist, induced by a torque on the ends of a cylindrical solid due to the stress field of an axial dislocation14,15, causes a chiral structure in the van der Waals nanowires. The in-plane germanium sulfide crystal axes progressively rotate along the wire, and germanium sulfide layers in adjacent turns of the helix naturally form a moiré pattern because of their interlayer twist. The axial rotation and the twist are tunable by varying the nanowire thickness. Combined electron diffraction and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy show the correlation between the interlayer twist and locally excited light emission that is due to progressive changes in the lattice orientation and in the interlayer moiré registry along the nanowires. The findings demonstrate a step towards scalable fabrication of van der Waals structures with defined twist angles, in which interlayer moiré patterns are realized along a helical path on a nanowire instead of a planar interface."
https://openalex.org/W2938720998,"Nanopore DNA sequencing is limited by low base-calling accuracy. Improved base-calling accuracy has so far relied on specialized base-calling algorithms, different nanopores and motor enzymes, or biochemical methods to re-read DNA molecules. Two primary error modes hamper sequencing accuracy: enzyme mis-steps and sequences with indistinguishable signals. We vary the driving voltage from 100 to 200 mV, with a frequency of 200 Hz, across a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore, thus changing how the DNA strand moves through the nanopore. A DNA helicase moves the DNA through the nanopore in discrete steps, and the variable voltage moves the DNA continuously between these steps. The electronic signal produced with variable voltage is used to overcome the primary error modes in base calling. We found that single-passage de novo base-calling accuracy of 62.7 ± 0.5% with a constant driving voltage improves to 79.3 ± 0.3% with a variable driving voltage. The variable-voltage sequencing mode is complementary to other methods to boost the accuracy of nanopore sequencing and could be incorporated into any enzyme-actuated nanopore sequencing device. The accuracy of nanopore DNA sequencing is substantially improved by application of a variable-voltage sequencing mode."
https://openalex.org/W2940484530,"To investigate the associations of marital status with major clinical outcomes including type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.The study cohort (1999-2014) included 9,737 (45% male) Iranian adults with a mean age of 47.6 years. Marital status was defined as married versus never married, divorced and widowed. The relationship between marital status and the four above mentioned outcomes were investigated using Cox regression models adjusted for the main confounders, specific to each outcome.After more than 12 years of follow-up, 1,889 (883 men) individuals developed hypertension, 1,038 (468 men) T2D, 1015 (597 men) CVD and 668 (409 men) all-cause mortality. Compared with married, being never married in men was associated with higher risk of hypertension [hazard ratio (HR): 1.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-2.16] and all-cause mortality (2.17; 0.95-5.00; p-value = 0.066) after adjusting for confounders. Among women, compared with married status, widowed status was associated with a lower risk of T2D (0.74; 0.56-0.97) in the confounders adjusted model. Moreover, never married women had a lower risk of hypertension (0.58; 0.37-0.90) compared to married ones in the age adjusted model, a finding that did not achieve significance, after further adjustment for confounders.We found that the relationship between marital status and health outcomes varied by gender. Being never married was an important risk factor for hypertension and tended to be a significant risk factor for mortality in men. However, among women, being widowed was associated with a lower risk of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2940845035,"The gut-brain-axis (GBA) describing the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and brain was recently implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study describes a novel synbiotic containing three metabolically active probiotics and a novel polyphenol-rich prebiotic which has beneficial impacts on the onset and progression of AD. In a transgenic humanized Drosophila melanogaster model of AD, the synbiotic increased survivability and motility and rescued amyloid beta deposition and acetylcholinesterase activity. Such drastic effects were due to the synbiotic's combinatorial action on GBA signaling pathways including metabolic stability, immune signaling, oxidative and mitochondrial stress possibly through pathways implicating PPARγ. Overall, this study shows that the therapeutic potential of GBA signaling is best harnessed in a synbiotic that simultaneously targets multiple risk factors of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2937595927,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of special interest due their potential clinical use in cell-based therapy. Therapies engaging MSCs are showing increasing promise in the cancer treatment and anticancer drug screening applications. A multitude of growth factors and cytokines secreted from these cells are known to give such multifunctional properties, but details of their role are yet to be absolutely demonstrated. In this study, we have evaluated the influence of BMSCs on K562 cell line as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, with the use of a cytokine antibody array recognizing 34 cytokines. For this purpose, BMSCs were isolated and co-cultured with K562 cells; thereafter, cultured K562 alone and co-cultured K562 with BMSCs (10:1) were collected at day 7 and subjected to cell cycle distribution assay as well as annexin/PI analysis and Ki/caspase-3 assay for apoptosis assessment. In the following, the gene and protein expression levels of BAX and BCL-2 as pro- and anti-apoptotic agents were investigated. Furthermore, after 7 days' treatment, culture medium was collected from both control and experimental groups for cytokine antibody array. It was found that BMSCs resulted in a robust increase in the number of cells at G0/G1 phase and arrest the G0/G1 phase as well as significantly inducing late apoptosis in K562 cells. The significant presence of TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1), and moderate elevated signals for CINC-1 (cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1) were obvious in the co-cultured conditioned media, but no significant increase was found in 32 other cytokines. It is concluded that co-culture of BMSCs with K562 cells could secrete a substantial amount of TIMP-1 and CINC-1. These cytokines could be involved in the inhibition of the K562 cell proliferation via BAX and caspase-3 cascade pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2940299115,"Background Because of the strong link between childhood obesity and adulthood obesity comorbidities, and the difficulty in decreasing body mass index (BMI) later in life, effective strategies are needed to address this condition in early childhood. The ability to predict obesity before age five could be a useful tool, allowing prevention strategies to focus on high risk children. The few existing prediction models for obesity in childhood have primarily employed data from longitudinal cohort studies, relying on difficult to collect data that are not readily available to all practitioners. Instead, we utilized real-world unaugmented electronic health record (EHR) data from the first two years of life to predict obesity status at age five, an approach not yet taken in pediatric obesity research. Methods and findings We trained a variety of machine learning algorithms to perform both binary classification and regression. Following previous studies demonstrating different obesity determinants for boys and girls, we similarly developed separate models for both groups. In each of the separate models for boys and girls we found that weight for length z-score, BMI between 19 and 24 months, and the last BMI measure recorded before age two were the most important features for prediction. The best performing models were able to predict obesity with an Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 81.7% for girls and 76.1% for boys. Conclusions We were able to predict obesity at age five using EHR data with an AUC comparable to cohort-based studies, reducing the need for investment in additional data collection. Our results suggest that machine learning approaches for predicting future childhood obesity using EHR data could improve the ability of clinicians and researchers to drive future policy, intervention design, and the decision-making process in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2941184981,"Chronic, low-grade inflammation increases the risk for atherosclerosis, cancer, and autoimmunity in diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Levels of CD4+ T helper 17 (Th17) cells, which secrete interleukin 17A (IL-17A), are increased in obesity and contribute to the inflammatory milieu; however, the relationship between signaling events triggered by excess nutrient levels and IL-17A-mediated inflammation is unclear. Here, using cytokine, quantitative real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, and ChIP assays, along with lipidomics and MS-based approaches, we show that increased levels of the nutrient-responsive, post-translational protein modification, O-GlcNAc, are present in naive CD4+ T cells from a diet-induced obesity murine model and that elevated O-GlcNAc levels increase IL-17A production. We also found that increased binding of the Th17 master transcription factor RAR-related orphan receptor γ t variant (RORγt) at the IL-17 gene promoter and enhancer, as well as significant alterations in the intracellular lipid microenvironment, elevates the production of ligands capable of increasing RORγt transcriptional activity. Importantly, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid biosynthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), is O-GlcNAcylated and necessary for production of these RORγt-activating ligands. Our results suggest that increased O-GlcNAcylation of cellular proteins may be a potential link between excess nutrient levels and pathological inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2942225997,"Background Regardless of significant gains and signs of progress in the last decades, maternal undernutrition remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia. Supporting the progress of interventions being taken in the country with evidence might be important to keep the sustainability of the government effort. We aimed at determining the extent of undernutrition and its associated factors among pregnant mothers in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted by including 940 selected pregnant mothers through a cluster sampling. A face-to-face interview was administered to pregnant mothers at a household level. We collected data using an Online Data collection kit (ODK) and the collected data was directly downloaded from the Google Cloud platform and finally imported to Stata 14 for further analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with undernutrition. A crude and adjusted odds ratio with their 95% confidence interval was calculated to declare the association and its significance. Model fitness was assured through the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test and model classification accuracy. Result 14.4% (95%CI: 12.3–16.7) of pregnant mothers were undernourished. After adjusting for the main covariates; as the age of the pregnant mothers increases the odds of being undernourished decreases by 10% (AOR: 0.90; 95%CI: 0.87–0.95) and having a poor marital condition (AOR: 2.18; 95%CI: 1.03–4.59) increased the odds of undernutrition. The risk of undernutrition was also decreased by 43% among those pregnant mothers who consumed coffee sometimes (AOR: 0.57; 95%CI: 0.36–0.89) as compared to daily consumers. Conclusion A significant proportion of pregnant mother were undernourished. Integration of nutritional interventions with maternity health services would be highly important to improve the nutritional status of the mothers. It is also important to counsel pregnant mothers about a consequence of frequent coffee drinking during their pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2951879240,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an effective approach for detecting vertebrates and plants, especially in aquatic ecosystems, but prior studies have largely examined eDNA in cool temperate settings. By contrast, this study employs eDNA to survey the fish fauna in tropical Lake Bacalar (Mexico) with the additional goal of assessing the possible presence of invasive fishes, such as Amazon sailfin catfish and tilapia. Sediment and water samples were collected from eight stations in Lake Bacalar on three occasions over a 4-month interval. Each sample was stored in the presence or absence of lysis buffer to compare eDNA recovery. Short fragments (184–187 bp) of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene were amplified using fusion primers and then sequenced on Ion Torrent PGM or S5 before their source species were determined using a custom reference sequence database constructed on BOLD. In total, eDNA sequences were recovered from 75 species of vertebrates including 47 fishes, 15 birds, 7 mammals, 5 reptiles, and 1 amphibian. Although all species are known from this region, six fish species represent new records for the study area, while two require verification. Sequences for five species (2 birds, 2 mammals, 1 reptile) were only detected from sediments, while sequences from 52 species were only recovered from water. Because DNA from the Amazon sailfin catfish was not detected, we used a mock eDNA experiment to confirm our methods would enable its detection. In summary, we developed protocols that recovered eDNA from tropical oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems and confirmed their effectiveness in detecting fishes and diverse species of vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2942426262,"Background Childhood acute respiratory infection remains the commonest global cause of morbidity and mortality among under-five children. In Ethiopia, it remains the highest burden of the health care system. The problem varies in space and time, and exploring its spatial distribution has supreme importance for monitoring and designing effective intervention programs. Methods A two stage stratified cluster sampling technique was utilized along with the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data. About 10,006 under-five children were included in this study. Bernoulli model was used to investigate the presence of purely spatial clusters of under-five acute respiratory infection using SaTScan.ArcGIS version 10.1 was used to visualize the distribution of pneumonia cases across the country. Mixed-effect logistic regression model was used to identify the determinants of acute respiratory infection. Result In this study, acute respiratory infection among under-five children had spatial variations across the country (Moran’s I: 0.34, p < 0.001). Acute respiratory infection among under-five children in Tigray (p < 0.001) and Oromia (p < 0.001) National Regional States clustered spatially. History of diarrhoea (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 4.71, 95% CI: (3.89–5.71))), 45–59 months of age (AOR = 0.63, 95% CI: (0.45–0.89)), working mothers (AOR = 1.27, 95% CI: (1.06–1.52)), mothers’ secondary school education (AOR = 0.65; 95% CI: (0.43–0.99)), and stunting (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI: (1.00–1.54)) were predictors of under-five acute respiratory infection. Conclusion and recommendation In Ethiopia, acute respiratory infection had spatial variations across the country. Areas with excess acute respiratory infection need high priority in allocation of resources including: mobilizing resources, skilled human power, and improved access to health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2939216081,"Identifying which ecosystem services are relevant to different stakeholders and understanding stakeholders’ perceptions of such services is useful for making informed decisions, especially in regions of the world where the achievement of biodiversity conservation goals is threatened by economically productive activities. In this article, we assess social preferences for ecosystem services in a biodiversity hotspot in central Chile. We use a consultative case study to ask local stakeholders (n = 70) from the Campana Peñuelas Biosphere Reserve to identify the most important ecosystem services the area provides for them and inquire about the perceived vulnerability of the services to changes in the future. We also explore the association between the perceived importance of ecosystem services and the sociodemographic and cultural characteristics of the respondents, which allows us to identify contrasting stakeholder perceptions of different ecosystem services. The most important services for local actors were the drinking water, fresh air and climate change control, genetic pool of plant communities in central Chile, and educational value. From the perspective of local actors, the services that could be threatened by negative changes in the future in terms of their provision included the possibilities of developing conservation activities focused on iconic threatened animal and plant species, water regulation, food from agriculture, and drinking water. Contrasting perceptions about the importance of ecosystem services emerged among stakeholders. While small farmers and members of local organizations attributed higher importance values to provisioning services, scientists and rangers and administrators of protected areas as well as teachers, NGO members and local government employees attributed more importance to the regulating and cultural services associated with threatened species. Our results can serve as a source of information for the planning and decision-making processes related to the search for socially and ecologically sustainable solutions for land use management."
https://openalex.org/W2940504349,"With the increasing competitiveness in the vine market, coupled with the increasing need for sustainable use of resources, strategies for improving farm management are essential. One such effective strategy is the implementation of precision agriculture techniques. Using photogrammetric techniques, the digitalization of farms based on images acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides information that can assist in the improvement of farm management and decision-making processes. The objective of the present work is to quantify the impact of the pest Jacobiasca lybica on vineyards and to develop representative cartography of the severity of the infestation. To accomplish this work, computational vision algorithms based on an ANN (artificial neural network) combined with geometric techniques were applied to geomatic products using consumer-grade cameras in the visible spectra. The results showed that the combination of geometric and computational vision techniques with geomatic products generated from conventional RGB (red, green, blue) images improved image segmentation of the affected vegetation, healthy vegetation and ground. Thus, the proposed methodology using low-cost cameras is a more cost-effective application of UAVs compared with multispectral cameras. Moreover, the proposed method increases the accuracy of determining the impact of pests by eliminating the soil effects."
https://openalex.org/W2940817401,"Nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAATs) are high-performance tools for rapidly and accurately detecting infectious agents. They are widely used in high-income countries to diagnose disease and improve patient care. The complexities associated with test methods, reagents, equipment, quality control and assurance require dedicated laboratories with trained staff, which can exclude their use in low-resource and decentralized healthcare settings. For certain diseases, fully integrated NAAT devices and assays are available for use in environmentally-controlled clinics or emergency rooms where relatively untrained staff can perform testing. However, decentralized settings in many low- and middle-income countries with large burdens of infectious disease are challenged by extreme environments, poor infrastructure, few trained staff and limited financial resources. Therefore, there is an urgent need for low-cost, integrated NAAT tools specifically designed for use in low-resource settings (LRS). Two essential components of integrated NAAT tools are: 1) efficient nucleic acid extraction technologies for diverse and complex sample types; and 2) robust and sensitive nucleic acid amplification and detection technologies. In prior work we reported the performance and workflow capacity for the nucleic acid extraction component. In the current study we evaluated performance of eight novel nucleic acid amplification and detection technologies from seven developers using blinded panels of RNA and/or DNA from three pathogens to assess both diagnostic accuracy and suitability as an essential component for low-cost NAAT in LRS. In this exercise, we noted significant differences in performance among these technologies and identified those most promising for potential further development."
https://openalex.org/W2941745688,"This research work proposes a novel priority aware schedule based charging algorithm that uses wireless power transfer (WPT) technique in order to charge embedded sensor nodes (SNs) in a wireless body area network (WBAN). Implanted sensor nodes in WBANs require energy for both information extraction and data transmission to the remote controller unit. Thus, energy shortage of these SNs deteriorates due to the data transmission process of the patient health monitoring system. However, continuous operation by means of electromagnetic induction for energy harvesting, obtained from ambient sources, reduces the overall efficiency of the primary unit. With this paradigm in sight, an algorithm demonstrating the modeling of a priority-based mechanism is proposed in order to ensure proper sensor voltage level and to reduce the transmission losses. Medium access control (MAC) protocols are used for inductive powering from the primary unit to the secondary unit in a collision-free centralized scheduling scheme. Therefore, the proposed wireless charging algorithm for implanted SNs in WBAN is designed as per carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) technique. Because of this, the overall power consumption of SNs for certain operation periods, successful charging probabilities for multiple SNs, and instantaneous power requirements are considered as key performance measures of analysis. It is assumed that proper energy storage in both transmitters and receivers can handle channel interference and traffic contention. Simulation results verify that a significant reduction in power consumption for the proposed priority aware algorithm will maintain almost similar output. For this reason, saturating class—C as well as class—E driver circuits have been used to justify the performance in two different circuit topologies. Effects of priority with respect to the full charge period have also been observed for the multi-node system. Furthermore, from performance analysis, it has been demonstrated that the scheduling scheme causes both single MOSFET composed saturating class—C and Lchoke modeled class—E associated driver circuits to be considerably more loss efficient than corresponding existing ones."
https://openalex.org/W2941705417,"Purpose Non-communicable chronic diseases have become the leading causes of mortality and disease burden worldwide. With information about the frequency of diabetes as a major non-communicable chronic disease in Russia being scarce, we assessed the prevalence of diabetes and its associated factors in a rural and urban population in Russia. Methods The Ural Eye and Medical Study is a population-based study in the city of Ufa/Russia and in villages in a distance of 65 km from Ufa. Inclusion criterion was an age of 40+ years. All study participants underwent a standardized interview and a detailed general examination. Diabetes mellitus was defined by a plasma glucose concentration ≥7.0 mmol/L or self-reported history of physician diagnosis of diabetes. Results Out of a population of 7328 eligible individuals, 5899 individuals (2580 (43.7%) men) (participation rate:80.5%) participated (mean age:59.0±10.7 years (range:40–94 years)). Diabetes mellitus was present in 687 individuals (11.7%;95% confidence interval (CI):11.9,12.5). Awareness rate of having diabetes was 500/687 (72.8%;95%CI:69.0,76.0), with mean known duration of diabetes of 10.0±9.4 years. Known type 1 diabetes was present in 44 subjects and known type 2 diabetes in 358 subjects. Prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 3.2% (95%CI:2.7,3.6) in the study population. Among patients with diabetes, 59.1% (95%CI:55.4,62.8) received treatment for diabetes, among whom 237 (58.5%;95%CI:53.7,63.3) individuals had adequate glycemic control. In multivariable analysis, higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus was associated with older age (P<0.001; odds ratio (OR):1.03;95%CI:1.01,1.04), higher body mass index (P<0.001;OR:1.07;95%CI:1.04,1.10), lower prevalence of vigorous daily work (P = 0.002;OR0.68;95%CI:0.53,0.87), positive history of arterial hypertension (P = 0.03;OR:1.40;95%CI:1.03,1.89) and cardiovascular diseases (P = 0.001;OR:1.60;95%CI:1.21,2.13) including heart attacks (P = 0.01;OR:1.80;95%CI:1.15,2.81), higher serum concentration of triglycerides (P<0.001;OR:1.51;95%CI:1.30,1.75), higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.01;OR:1.01;95%CI:1.01,1.02), higher number of meals taken daily (P<0.001;OR:1.46;95%CI:1.25,1.69), and non-Muslim religion (P = 0.02;OR:0.73;95%CI:0.56,0.94). Conclusions In this ethnically mixed, urban and rural Russian population aged 40+ years, the awareness rate of diabetes (72.8%) was relatively high, while the diabetes prevalence (11.7%) was comparable with that of other countries such as China and the USA. Factors associated with higher diabetes prevalence were similar in Russia and these other countries and included older age, higher body mass index and higher serum concentration of triglycerides, lower prevalence of vigorous daily work, arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2941207120,"In laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) the area between the vibrating vocal folds during phonation is of interest, being referred to as glottal area waveform (GAW). Varying camera resolution may influence parameters computed on the GAW and hence hinder the comparability between examinations. This study investigates the influence of spatial camera resolution on quantitative vocal fold vibratory function parameters obtained from the GAW. In total 40 HSV recordings during sustained phonation (20 healthy males and 20 healthy females) were investigated. A clinically used Photron Fastcam MC2 camera with a frame rate of 4000 fps and a spatial resolution of 512×256 pixels was applied. This initial resolution was reduced by pixel averaging to (1) a resolution of 256×128 and (2) to a resolution of 128×64 pixels, yielding three sets of recordings. The GAW was extracted and in total 50 vocal fold vibratory parameters representing different features of the GAW were computed. Statistical analyses using SPSS Statistics, version 21, was performed. 15 Parameters showing strong mathematical dependencies with other parameters were excluded from the main analysis but are given in the Supporting Information. Data analysis revealed clear influence of spatial resolution on GAW parameters. Fundamental period measures and period perturbation measures were the least affected. Amplitude perturbation measures and mechanical measures were most strongly influenced. Most glottal dynamic characteristics and symmetry measures deviated significantly. Most energy perturbation measures changed significantly in males but were mostly unaffected in females. In females 18 of 35 remaining parameters (51%) and in males 22 parameters (63%) changed significantly between spatial resolutions. This work represents the first step in studying the impact of video resolution on quantitative HSV parameters. Clear influences of spatial camera resolution on computed parameters were found. The study results suggest avoiding the use of the most strongly affected parameters. Further, the use of cameras with high resolution is recommended to analyze GAW measures in HSV data."
https://openalex.org/W2941385873,"Background C1q TNF related protein 3 (CTRP3) is an adipokine secreted from adipose tissue. Previous studies have suggested that CTRP3 improves insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation. Human studies have evaluated circulating levels of this adipokine in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetic retinopathy, metabolic syndrome, and coronary artery diseases. However, circulating levels of this adipokine in patients with diabetic nephropathy have not been evaluated. The present study aimed to assess serum levels of CTRP3 in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy (T2DM-NP) and its relationship with metabolic and inflammatory markers. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed on 55 controls, 54 patients with T2DM, and 55 patients with T2DM-NP. Serum levels of CTRP3, adiponectin, TNF-α, and IL-6 were measured by ELISA technique. Results Serum levels of CTRP3 were significantly lower in patients with T2DM (257.61 ± 69.79 ng/mL, p < 0.001) and T2DM-NP (222.03 ± 51.99 ng/mL, p < 0.001) compared to controls (328.17 ± 80.73 ng/mL), and those with T2DM-NP compared to T2DM group. CTRP3 was independently associated with HOMA-IR (r = -0.327, p < 0.05) and adiponectin (r = 0.436, p < 0.01) in T2DM group. In T2DM-NP patients, CTRP3 independently was associated with eGFR (r = 0.428, p < 0.01) and HOMA-IR (r = -0.436, p < 0.01). Furthermore, CTRP3 revealed a ability to differentiate T2DM-NP patients from controls (area under curve (95% confidence interval): 0.881 (0.820–0.943) and p < 0.001). Conclusion Decreased serum levels of CTRP3 in patients with T2DM and diabetic nephropathy and its association with pathologic mechanism in these patients suggested a possible role for CTRP3 in pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy; nevertheless, further studies are required in this regard."

Cohesin is a ring complex composed of four core subunits and seven regulatory subunits. In an effort to comprehensively identify additional cohesin-interacting proteins, we used gene editing to introduce a dual epitope tag into the endogenous allele of each of 11 known components of cohesin in cultured human cells, and we performed MS analyses on dual-affinity purifications. In addition to reciprocally identifying all known components of cohesin, we found that cohesin interacts with a panoply of splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). These included diverse components of the U4/U6.U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex and several splicing factors that are commonly mutated in cancer. The interaction between cohesin and splicing factors/RBPs was RNA- and DNA-independent, occurred in chromatin, was enhanced during mitosis, and required RAD21. Furthermore, cohesin-interacting splicing factors and RBPs followed the cohesin cycle and prophase pathway of cell cycle–regulated interactions with chromatin. Depletion of cohesin-interacting splicing factors and RBPs resulted in aberrant mitotic progression. These results provide a comprehensive view of the endogenous human cohesin interactome and identify splicing factors and RBPs as functionally significant cohesin-interacting proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2942197567,"Background In Ontario, Canada, healthcare for transgender individuals is accessed through primary care; however, there are a limited number of practitioners providing transgender care, and patients are often on waiting lists and/or traveling great distances to receive care. Understanding how primary care is implemented and delivered to transgender individuals is key to improving access and eliminating healthcare barriers. The purpose of this study is to understand how the implementation of primary care services for transgender individuals compares across various models of primary care delivery in Ontario. Methods A qualitative, exploratory, multiple-case study guided by Normalization Process Theory (NPT) was used to compare transgender care delivery and implementation across three primary care models. Three cases known to provide transgender primary care and represent different primary care models in Ontario, Canada (i.e., family health team, community health centre, fee-for service physician) were explored. The NoMAD survey, a tool to measure implementation processes, and qualitative interviews with primary care practitioners and allied healthcare staff were administered. Results Using the NPT framework to guide analysis, key themes emerged about successful implementation of primary care services for transgender individuals. These themes include creating a safe space for patients, identifying gaps in services, understanding practitioners’ roles, and the need for more training and education in transgender care for practitioners. Conclusions Primary care services for transgender individuals can and should be delivered in all models of primary care. Training and awareness for healthcare practitioners are needed to develop capacity in providing primary care to transgender individuals. A greater number of practitioners and organizations are needed to take on this work, embedding and normalizing transgender care into routine practice to address barriers to access and improve quality of care for transgender individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2941530073,"Early embryonic endocardium undergoes endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition to form cardiac cushion mesenchymal cells (MCs). Embryonic endocardium also gives rise to fibroblasts, intramyocardial adipocytes, and coronary mural cells, including smooth muscle cells and pericytes, in development. Whether endocardial cells directly differentiate into fibroblasts, coronary mural cells, and adipocytes or indirectly via an intermediate stage of endocardial-derived cushion MCs remains unknown. In addition to endocardium, epicardium and neural crest also contribute to cardiac cushion MCs. Given the developmental heterogeneity of cushion MCs and the lack of specific markers for endocardial-derived cushion MCs, conventional genetic lineage tracing utilizing Cre recombinase driven by one specific regulatory element is not sufficient to examine the fates of endocardial-derived cushion MCs. Intersectional genetic targeting approaches, which combine regulatory elements from two or more genes, have been employed to increase the specificity of cell targeting. Here, we developed a dual-recombinase intersectional targeting approach using Nfatc1-Dre, Sox9-CreER, and Cre/Dre double-dependent reporter Ai66 to specifically label endocardial-derived cushion MCs. Taking advantage of intersectional lineage tracing, we found that a subset of cardiac cells including fibroblasts, coronary mural cells, and intramyocardial adipocytes in adult hearts were derived from endocardial-derived cushion MCs. Our study suggests that embryonic endocardium contributes to cushion MCs first, and then endocardial-derived cushion MCs migrate into myocardium and differentiate into fibroblasts, coronary mural cells, and adipocytes in development. Understanding developmental origins of cardiac cell lineages will provide us more insights into cardiac development, regeneration, and diseases."

High-fidelity Cas9 variants have been identified; however, they often have reduced activity, constraining their utility, which presents a major challenge for their use in research applications and therapeutics. Here we developed a tRNAGln-processing system to restore the activity of multiple high-fidelity Cas9 variants in human cells, including SpCas9-HF1, eSpCas9, and xCas9. Specifically, acting on previous observations that small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) harboring an extra A or G (A/G) in the first 5′ nucleotide greatly affect the activity of high-fidelity Cas9 variants and that tRNA–sgRNA fusions improve Cas9 activity, we investigated whether a GN20 sgRNA fused to different tRNAs (G-tRNA-N20) could restore the activity of SpCas9 variants in human cells. Using flow cytometry, a T7E1 assay, deep sequencing–based DNA cleavage activity assays, and HEK-293 cells, we observed that a tRNAGln–sgRNA fusion system enhanced the activity of Cas9 variants, which could be harnessed for efficient correction of a pathogenic mutation in the retinoschisin 1 (RS1) gene, resulting in 6- to 8-fold improved Cas9 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2937547895,"Objective Hispanics/Latinos have some of the highest prevalence rates for cardiovascular disease risk factors, but stark differences exist by self-reported background. Cardiovascular disease risk factors negatively impact cognition in Hispanics/Latinos; less is known about these relationships by Hispanic/Latino backgrounds. We investigated cognitive associations with cardiovascular disease risk factor burden in a diverse cohort, the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Methods Baseline data from this observational study of cardiovascular disease and its antecedents was collected from 2008–2011. We included 7,121 participants 45–74 years old from Central American, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, or South American backgrounds. Dichotomous indicators for hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and smoking were evaluated and totaled, with participants grouped by lowest (0–2), middle (3) or highest (4–5) burden. Cognitive testing included the Brief Spanish English Verbal Learning Test, letter fluency, and digit symbol substitution. Results In separate fully-adjusted linear regression models, lower fluency and digit symbol substitution performance were restricted to the highest compared to the lowest burden group; whereas the middle burden group displayed impaired memory performance compared to the lowest burden group (p-values≤0.05). Background interacted with burden for learning and memory performance. That is, the association of burden level (i.e., lowest, middle, or highest) with cognitive performance was modified by background (e.g., Mexicans vs Cuban). Conclusions Hispanics/Latinos with higher levels of cardiovascular disease risk factor burden displayed lower levels of cognitive performance, with learning and memory performance modified by background."
https://openalex.org/W2940576700,"Background Globally, an estimated two million women have undergone Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), and approximately four percent of women who have been circumcised live in Ghana. In the Bawku Municipality and Pusiga District, sixty one percent of women have undergone the procedure. This study therefore aimed at identifying the factors that sustain the practice of FGM despite its illegality, in the Bawku Municipality and the Pusiga District. Method This study used a descriptive qualitative design based on grounded theory. We used purposive sampling to identify and recruit community stakeholders, and then used the snowball sampling to identify, recruit, and interview circumcised women. We then used community stakeholders to identify two types of focus group participants: men and women of reproductive age and older men and women from the community. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted and qualitative analysis undertaken to develop a conceptual framework for understanding both the roots and the drivers of FGM. Results Historical traditions and religious rites preserve FGM and ensure its continuity, and older women and peers are a source of support for the practice through the pressure they exert. The easy movement of women across borders (to where FGM is still practice) helps to perpetuate the practice, as does the belief that FGM will preserve virginity and reduce promiscuity. In addition, male dominance and lack of female autonomy ensures continuation of the practice. Conclusion Female Genital Mutilation continues to persist despite its illegality because of social pressure on women/girls to conform to social norms, peer acceptance, fear of criticism and religious reasons. Implementing interventions targeting border towns, religious leaders and their followers, older men and women and younger men and women will help eradicate the practice."
https://openalex.org/W2940741388,"Inorganic arsenic is an environmental human carcinogen of several organs including the urinary tract. RWPE-1 cells are immortalized, non-tumorigenic, human prostate epithelia that become malignantly transformed into the CAsE-PE line after continuous in vitro exposure to 5μM arsenite over a period of months. For insight into in vitro arsenite transformation, we performed RNA-seq for differential gene expression and targeted sequencing of KRAS. We report >7,000 differentially expressed transcripts in CAsE-PE cells compared to RWPE-1 cells at >2-fold change, q<0.05 by RNA-seq. Notably, KRAS expression was highly elevated in CAsE-PE cells, with pathway analysis supporting increased cell proliferation, cell motility, survival and cancer pathways. Targeted DNA sequencing of KRAS revealed a mutant specific allelic imbalance, 'MASI', frequently found in primary clinical tumors. We found high expression of a mutated KRAS transcript carrying oncogenic mutations at codons 12 and 59 and many silent mutations, accompanied by lower expression of a wild-type allele. Parallel cultures of RWPE-1 cells retained a wild-type KRAS genotype. Copy number analysis and sequencing showed amplification of the mutant KRAS allele. KRAS is expressed as two splice variants, KRAS4a and KRAS4b, where variant 4b is more prevalent in normal cells compared to greater levels of variant 4a seen in tumor cells. 454 Roche sequencing measured KRAS variants in each cell type. We found KRAS4a as the predominant transcript variant in CAsE-PE cells compared to KRAS4b, the variant expressed primarily in RWPE-1 cells and in normal prostate, early passage, primary epithelial cells. Overall, gene expression data were consistent with KRAS-driven proliferation pathways found in spontaneous tumors and malignantly transformed cell lines. Arsenite is recognized as an important environmental carcinogen, but it is not a direct mutagen. Further investigations into this in vitro transformation model will focus on genomic events that cause arsenite-mediated mutation and overexpression of KRAS in CAsE-PE cells."
https://openalex.org/W2941771476,"miRNAs may play effective roles in breast cancer so modulating their expression levels could have therapeutic benefits. Recent studies have found the combination of miRNA-based therapeutics with conventional drugs as promising. This study aimed to find drug-responsive miRNAs, and explore their anticancer activities in HER2+ breast cancer cells and regulatory role in the trastuzumab response. qRT-PCR-array analysis was performed with effective concentrations of tamoxifen and trastuzumab treated BT-474, SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells. Motility and invasion analyses were performed with wound healing and xCELLigence impedance-based assays respectively. Viability of cells following mimic transfection and drug treatment was assessed by WST-1 assay. Western blot analysis was used to assess miR-770-5p regulation of proteins and their phosphorylated forms. The clinical relevance of miR-770-5p was examined by TCGA data analysis. The qRT-PCR-array results indicated that miR-770-5p was responsive in a drug and cell line independent manner. Overexpression of miR-770-5p inhibited the motility and cell invasion through regulation of AKT and ERK proteins. Additionally, miR-770-5p potentiated the effectiveness of trastuzumab. Thus, regulating the expression level of miR-770-5p in combination with trastuzumab treatment may simultaneously inhibit the downstream elements of PI3K and MAPK signalling, thereby blocking the proliferation, motility and invasion capacities of HER2+ breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2941751960,"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is rapidly becoming more accessible and popular as a technique to monitor body composition. The reliability of DXA has been examined extensively using a number of different methodological approaches. This study sets up to investigate the accuracy of measuring the parameters of body composition (BC) by means of the whole-body and the segmental DXA method analysis with the typical error of measurement (TEM) that allows for expressing the error in the units of measure. The research was implemented in a group of 63 participants, all of whom were university students. Thirty-eight males (22.6±2.9 years, average body mass 77.5±8.4 kg) and 25 females (21.4±2.0 years, average body mass 58.6±7.2 kg) were recruited. The measured parameters included body mass (BM), fat-free mass (FFM), body fat (BF), bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD). For the whole-body analysis, the determined TEM was: BM at the level of 0.12 kg in females and 0.29 kg in males; BF 0.25kg and 0.44% females, 0.52 kg and 0.66% males; FFM 0.24 kg females and 0.42 kg males; BMC 0.02 kg females and males; BMD 0.01g/cm2 females and males. The TEM values in the segmental analysis were: BF within the range of 0.04–0.28 kg and 0.68–1.20% in females, 0.10–0.36 kg and 0.72–1.94% in males; FFM 0.08–0.41 kg females and 0.17–0.86 males, BMC 0.00–0.02 kg females and 0.01–0.02 kg males in relation to the body segment (upper limb, trunk, lower limb). The BMD value was at the level of 0.01–0.02g/cm2. The study results showed high reliability in measuring body composition parameters using the DXA method. The whole-body analysis showed a higher accuracy of measurement than the segmental. Only the changes that are greater than the TEM, or the upper bound (95%) of the confidence interval of the measurement can be considered demonstrable when interpreting repeated measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2940953420,"Background Low birth weight (LBW) is an important indicator of newborn survival. It is associated with higher risk of morbidity, mortality and long-term health consequences. Little has been done on incidence and recurrence risk of LBW in developing countries including Tanzania. This study aimed to determine the incidence and recurrence risk of LBW among women who delivered at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC), Tanzania. Methods A hospital-based prospective cohort study was conducted using maternally-linked data from KCMC birth registry between 2000 and 2010. A total of 26,191 women delivered singleton live babies during the study period. Of these, 4,603 (17.6%) had subsequent pregnancies. The recurrence risk of LBW was estimated using a multivariable log-binomial regression model. A robust variance estimator was used to account for correlation between births of the same mother. Results The incidence of LBW was 7.1%. The absolute recurrence risk of LBW was 28.1%. This corresponds to a relative risk (RR) of 5.08-fold, 95% CI 4.01–6.45). Antenatal care visits (<4) (RR: 5.00; 95% CI 3.58–6.98), preterm birth (RR: 4.55; 95% CI 3.21–6.43), positive HIV status (RR: 7.49: 95% CI 3.91–14.36) and preeclampsia (RR: 4.37; 2.60–7.35) in the first pregnancy were important predictors of LBW recurrence. Conclusion The incidence of LBW and its recurrence was high in the study population. Women with previous history of LBW had higher risk of recurrent LBW in subsequent pregnancies. Identification of factors associated with LBW recurrence, proper post-partum care management to ensure Healthy Timing and Spacing of Pregnancy, Pre-conception care and close clinical follow-up during subsequent pregnancy may help reduce LBW recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2942466655,"This study aimed to analyze changes in the expression of autophagy- and phagocytosis-related genes in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), especially in relation to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy of the diseased tissue was carried out to investigate if the gene expression changes are translated into ultrastructural alterations. LV tissue samples from patients with DCM (n = 13) and from controls (CNT; n = 10) were analyzed by RNA-sequencing, whereupon the altered expression (P < 0.05) of 13 autophagy- and 3 phagocytosis-related genes was observed. The expression changes of the autophagy-related genes NRBP2 and CALCOCO2 were associated with cardiac dysfunction and remodeling (P < 0.05). The affected patients had a higher activity of these degradation processes, as evidenced by the greater number of autophagic structures in the DCM tissue (P < 0.001). Differences in the ultrastructural distribution were also found between the DCM and CNT tissues. These results show that in patients with DCM, the altered expression of NRBP2 and CALCOCO2 is related to LV dysfunction and remodeling. Clarification of the molecular mechanisms of cardiac autophagy would help in the future development of therapies to improve LV performance."
https://openalex.org/W2942105281,"Caspase-3 activation in the limbic system and depressive-like symptoms are observed after an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and studies suggest that inflammation may play a significant role. Combined treatment with the probiotic strains Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus helveticus in rats has been shown to attenuate caspase-3 activation and depressive-like behaviour together with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The present study was designed to determine the respective contribution of these two strains on caspase-3 activity in the limbic system and on depressive-like behaviour. Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four groups: Vehicle, L. helveticus R0052, B. longum R0175 and L. salivarius HA-118, administered orally for 14 days (109CFU daily) before inducing MI by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for 40 min followed by 14 days of reperfusion. Animals were then tested for socialisation, passive avoidance and forced swim test to assess depressive-like behaviour. At day 18 the animals were sacrificed; infarct size was estimated, plasma C-reactive protein concentration and brain caspase-3 activity were measured. Results indicated that infarct size did not vary across the different treatments. Rats treated with B. longum spent more time socializing, learned more rapidly the passive avoidance test and spent less time immobile in the forced swim test compared to the vehicle groups. Caspase-3 activity and plasma C-reactive protein concentrations were reduced in the lateral and medial amygdala as well as in the dentate gyrus of B. longum-supplemented animals. The only significant effect in the two groups receiving Lactobacilli compared to vehicle was that rats receiving L. salivarius learned more rapidly in the step-down passive avoidance test. In conclusion, most of the beneficial effects that we previously reported with the combination of two probiotic strains in our experimentation regarding post-myocardial infarction depression are related to Bifidobacterium longum."

Mdx mice were randomly assigned into three groups: mdxS, the control group receiving intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of saline solution (100μL); mdxP, positive control group receiving prednisolone (1mg/kg) by oral gavage; and mdxT, treated group receiving i.p. injections of tempol (100 mg/kg). C57BL/10 mice were also used as controls. Tempol treatment promoted gain in muscle strength and reduced myonecrosis and inflammatory response in the dystrophic diaphragm (DIA) and biceps brachii (BB) muscles. No evidence of Tempol's beneficial performance on angiogenesis in DIA and BB mdx muscles was found. The findings presented here show that Tempol treatment improves dystrophic phenotype, supporting its use as a potential therapeutic strategy in DMD."

In this study, the ammonia-oxidizing archaea phylum Crenarchaeota was enriched from 9.2 to 53.0%. Nitrosomonas, Nitrosococcus, and Nitrosospira, which are ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, increased from 3.2, 1.7, and 0.1% to 12.8, 20.4, and 3.3%, respectively. Ca. Brocadia, Ca. Kuenenia, and Ca. Scalindua, which are anammox bacteria, were detected in the seeding sludge, accounting for 77.1, 11.5, and 10.6%. After cultivation, the dominant genus changed to Ca. Kuenenia, accounting for 82.0%. Nitrospirae, nitrite oxidation bacteria, decreased from 2.2 to 0.1%, while denitrifying genera decreased from 12.9 to 2.1%. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of nitrogen-removing microorganisms in an anammox reactor, thereby facilitating the improvement of such reactors.

https://openalex.org/W2941498273,"Memory enables us to use information from our past experiences to guide new behaviours, calling for the need to integrate or form inference across multiple distinct episodic experiences. Here, we compared children (aged 9–10 years), adolescents (aged 12–13 years), and young adults (aged 19–25 years) on their ability to form integration across overlapping associations in memory. Participants first encoded a set of overlapping, direct AB- and BC-associations (object-face and face-object pairs) as well as non-overlapping, unique DE-associations. They were then tested on these associations and inferential AC-associations. The experiment consisted of four such encoding/retrieval cycles, each consisting of different stimuli set. For accuracy on both unique and inferential associations, young adults were found to outperform teenagers, who in turn outperformed children. However, children were particularly slower than teenagers and young adults in making judgements during inferential than during unique associations. This suggests that children may rely more on making inferences during retrieval, by first retrieving the direct associations, followed by making the inferential judgement. Furthermore, young adults showed a higher correlation between accuracy in direct (AB, BC) and inferential AC-associations than children. This suggests that, young adults relied closely on AB- and BC-associations for making AC decisions, potentially by forming integrated ABC-triplets during encoding or retrieval. Taken together, our findings suggest that there may be an age-related shift in how information is integrated across experienced episodes, namely from relying on making inferences at retrieval during middle childhood to forming integrated representations at different memory processing stages in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2942200250,"The 6-deoxy sugar l-rhamnose (l-Rha) is found widely in plant and microbial polysaccharides and natural products. The importance of this and related compounds in host-pathogen interactions often means that l-Rha plays an essential role in many organisms. l-Rha is most commonly biosynthesized as the activated sugar nucleotide uridine 5'-diphospho-β-l-rhamnose (UDP-β-l-Rha) or thymidine 5'-diphospho-β-l-rhamnose (TDP-β-l-Rha). Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these sugar nucleotides have been studied in some detail in bacteria and plants, but the activated form of l-Rha and the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes have yet to be explored in algae. Here, using sugar-nucleotide profiling in two representative algae, Euglena gracilis and the toxin-producing microalga Prymnesium parvum, we show that levels of UDP- and TDP-activated l-Rha differ significantly between these two algal species. Using bioinformatics and biochemical methods, we identified and characterized a fusion of the RmlC and RmlD proteins, two bacteria-like enzymes involved in TDP-β-l-Rha biosynthesis, from P. parvum Using this new sequence and also others, we explored l-Rha biosynthesis among algae, finding that although most algae contain sequences orthologous to plant-like l-Rha biosynthesis machineries, instances of the RmlC-RmlD fusion protein identified here exist across the Haptophyta and Gymnodiniaceae families of microalgae. On the basis of these findings, we propose potential routes for the evolution of nucleoside diphosphate β-l-Rha (NDP-β-l-Rha) pathways among algae."

During early Xenopus laevis embryogenesis, the timing of a key developmental event, the midblastula transition (MBT), is sensitive to nuclear import factor levels. How might altering nuclear import factors and MBT timing in the early embryo affect downstream development of the organism? We microinjected X. laevis two-cell embryos with mRNA to increase levels of importin α or NTF2, resulting in differential amounts of nuclear import factors in the two halves of the embryo. Compared to controls, these embryos exhibited delayed gastrulation, curved neural plates, and bent tadpoles with different sized eyes. Furthermore, embryos microinjected with NTF2 developed into smaller froglets compared to control microinjected embryos. We propose that altering nuclear import factors and nuclear size affects MBT timing, cell size, and cell number, subsequently disrupting later development. Thus, altering nuclear import factors early in development can affect function and size at the organismal level."
https://openalex.org/W2937530801,"Reproduction is a process that is extremely sensitive to changes in nutritional status. The nutritional control of oogenesis via insulin signaling has been reported; however, the mechanism underlying its sensitivity and tissue specificity has not been elucidated. Here, we determined that Drosophila Makorin RING finger protein 1 gene (Mkrn1) functions in the metabolic regulation of oogenesis. Mkrn1 was endogenously expressed at high levels in ovaries and Mkrn1 knockout resulted in female sterility. Mkrn1-null egg chambers were previtellogenic without egg production. FLP-FRT mosaic analysis revealed that Mkrn1 is essential in germline cells, but not follicle cells, for ovarian function. As well, AKT phosphorylation via insulin signaling was greatly reduced in the germline cells, but not the follicle cells, of the mutant clones in the ovaries. Furthermore, protein-rich diet elevated Mkrn1 protein levels, without increased mRNA levels. The p-AKT and p-S6K levels, downstream targets of insulin/Tor signaling, were significantly increased by a nutrient-rich diet in wild-type ovaries whereas those were low in Mkrn1exS compared to wild-type ovaries. Taken together, our results suggest that nutrient availability upregulates the Mkrn1 protein, which acts as a positive regulator of insulin signaling to confer sensitivity and tissue specificity in the ovaries for proper oogenesis based on nutritional status."
https://openalex.org/W2942198579,"Typhoid fever affects 21 million people globally, 1% of whom succumb to the disease. The social, economic and public health consequences of this disease disproportionately affect people in Africa and Asia. In order to design context specific prevention strategies, we need to holistically characterise outbreaks in these settings. In this study, we used retrospective data (2013–2016) at national and district level to characterise temporal and spatial dynamics of Typhoid fever outbreaks using time series and spatial analysis. We then selected cases matched with controls to investigate household socio-economic drivers using a conditional logistic regression model, and also developed a Typhoid fever outbreak-forecasting framework. The incidence rate of Typhoid fever at national and district level was ~ 160 and 60 cases per 100,000 persons per year, respectively, predominantly in urban areas. In Kasese district, Bwera sub-county registered the highest incidence rate, followed by Kisinga, Kitholhu and Nyakiyumbu sub-counties. The male-female case ratio at district level was at 1.68 and outbreaks occurred between the 20th and 40th week (May and October) each year following by seven weeks of precipitation. Our forecasting framework predicted outbreaks better at the district level rather than national. We identified a temporal window associated with Typhoid fever outbreaks in Kasese district, which is preceded by precipitation, flooding and displacement of people. We also observed that areas with high incidence of Typhoid fever also had high environmental contamination with limited water treatment. Taken together with the forecasting framework, this knowledge can inform the development of specific control and preparedness strategies at district and national level."
https://openalex.org/W2941703528,"Although breast cancer mortality is decreasing, morbidity following treatment remains a significant issue, as patients face symptoms such as cancer-related fatigue (CRF). The aim of the present study is to develop a classification system that monitors fatigue via integration of an objective clinical assessment with patient self-report. Forty-three women participated in this research. Participants were post-treatment breast cancer survivors who had been surgically treated for their primary tumour with no evidence of neoplastic disease at the time of recruitment. Self-perceived fatigue was assessed with the Spanish version of the Piper Fatigue Scale-Revised (R-PFS). Objective fatigue was assessed by the 30 second Sit-to-Stand (30-STS) test. Confirmatory factor analysis was done with Maximum Likelihood Extraction (MLE). Internal consistency was obtained by Cronbach's α coefficients. Bivariate correlation showed that 30-STS performance was negatively-inversely associated with R-PFS. The MANOVA model explained 54.3% of 30-STS performance variance. Using normalized scores from the MLE, a classification system was developed based on the quartiles. This study integrated objective and subjective measures of fatigue to better allow classification of patient CRF experience. Results allowed development of a classification index to classify CRF severity in breast cancer survivors using the relationship between 30-STS and R-PFS scores. Future research must consider the patient-perceived and clinically measurable components of CRF to better understand this multidimensional issue."
https://openalex.org/W2940777769,"Background In Nigeria, recent reports suggest that dengue viruses could be a major cause of acute fevers. We sought to make a cross-sectional estimate of the prevalence of current and previous dengue infections in patients presenting with fever to healthcare centres in Cross River State Nigeria. Methodology/Principal findings This cross-sectional health facility survey recruited persons with temperature ≥38°C. Dengue virus immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody testing using Onsite Duo dengue Ag-IgG/IgM lateral flow immunoassay cassettes was done. Samples which tested positive were further confirmed using the RecombiLISA dengue IgM and IgG enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits and classified into primary and secondary dengue infection. Malaria testing was carried out using microscopy. Between 4 January 2017 and 24 August 2017 a total of 420 participants were sampled across 11 health centres. The mean age was 34 (range = 1–99), 63% were female, 49% reported sleeping under a treated mosquito net in the past week and 44% reported taking an antimalarial prior to seeking care. The mean number of days fever was present prior to seeking care was 8, and many of the participants presented with symptoms indicative of respiratory or urinary tract infections. Testing indicated that 6% (95% CI: 2, 13; n = 24) had either a primary or secondary dengue infection with or without co-existing malaria, while 4% (95% CI: 2, 9; n = 16) had either a primary or secondary dengue infection without co-existing malaria. 52% (95% CI: 46, 58; n = 218) had a malaria infection with or without any dengue infection, and 50% (95% CI: 44, 57; n = 210) had a malaria infection without any dengue infection. Conclusion Our study confirms the presence of dengue at not insignificant levels in patients attending health centres with fever in this south eastern province of Nigeria. These data highlight the danger of the common presumption in this setting that fever is due to malaria. Surveillance for dengue is vital in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2942350535,"The aim of this study was to describe energy partitioning in dairy crossbreed bulls fed tropical forage-based diets supplemented with different additives. Twenty F1 crossbred bulls (Holstein x Gyr) with initial and final live weight (LW) averages of 190 ± 17 and 275 ± 20 kg were fed sorghum (Sorghum bicolour) and Tanzania grass (Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania) silage (70:30 DM basis) with supplemented concentrate at a forage to concentrate ratio of 50:50. The bulls were allocated to four treatment: control groups (without additives), monensin [22 mg/kg monensin dry matter (DM)] (M), virginiamycin (30 mg/kg virginiamycin DM) (V), and combination (22 mg/kg DM of monensin and 30 mg/kg DM of virginiamycin) (MV), in a completely randomised design. The intake of gross energy (GE, MJ/d), digestible energy (DE, MJ/d), metabolizable energy (ME, MJ/d), as well as energy losses in the form of faeces, urine, methane, heat production (HE), and retained energy (RE) were measured. Faecal output was measured in apparent digestibility trial. Right after the apparent digestibility trial, urine samples were collected in order to estimate the daily urinary production of the animals. Heat and methane production were measured in an open circuit respirometry chamber. The intake of GE, DE, and ME of the animals receiving monensin and virginiamycin alone or in combination (MV) showed no differences (P>0.05) from the control treatment. However, the MV treatment reduced (P<0.05) the methane production (5.44 MJ/d) compared to the control group (7.33 MJ/d), expressed in MJ per day, but not when expressed related to gross energy intake (GEI) (CH4, % GEI) (P = 0.34). Virginiamycin and monensin alone or in combination did not change (P>0.05) the utilization efficiency of ME for weight gain, RE and net gain energy. This study showed that for cattle fed tropical forages, the combination of virginiamycin and monensin as feed additives affected their energy metabolism by a reduction in the energy lost as methane."
https://openalex.org/W2942446210,"We retrospectively analyzed serum IgM antibodies (Abs) to influenza viruses from two tertiary hospitals in Beijing from December 2016 to February 2018. Samples from 36,792 patients, aged 0-98 years, were collected and tested. Among the patients, 923 children from two winter flu seasons were assayed with both antigens and IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B and assigned as paired groups. Another 2,340 adults and 1,978 children with only antigen tested in the 2016 and 2017 winter flu seasons were named as unpaired groups. IgM Abs-positivity rates in children were 0.80% and 36.57% for Flu A and Flu B, respectively, peaking at 4-5 years of age. For adults, the Flu A and Flu B IgM Abs-positivity rates were 10.34% and 21.49%, respectively, peaking at 18-35 years of age. The trend of temporal distribution between the children and the adults was significantly correlated for IgM Abs to Flu B, but not for Flu A. Compared with unpaired groups, the detection rate of Flu A antigen was significantly higher than IgM Abs in children, whereas frequencies of IgM Abs were higher than antigen in adults. Incidence of Flu B antigen was sharply increased in 2017 winter than in the 2016 winter in both children and adults, but no concomitant increase was observed in IgM Abs to Flu B. For paired children groups, incidence of Flu B antigen in the 2017 flu season was significantly higher than that in the 2016 flu season; in contrast, positive rates of IgM Abs in the 2017 flu season were even lower than those in 2016. Considering antigen detection may reflect the Flu A/Flu B epidemic, our results indicate single-assayed IgM Abs were less effective in the diagnosis of acute influenza virus infection, and the use of this assay for epidemiology evaluations was not supported by these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2941506454,"In actinobacteria, post-translational modification of proteins with prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein Pup targets them for degradation by a bacterial proteasome assembly consisting of the 20S core particle (CP) and the mycobacterial proteasomal ATPase (Mpa). Modification of hundreds of cellular proteins with Pup at specific surface lysines is carried out by a single Pup-ligase (PafA, proteasome accessory factor A). Pupylated substrates are recruited to the degradative pathway by binding of Pup to the N-terminal coiled-coil domains of Mpa. Alternatively, pupylation can be reversed by the enzyme Dop (deamidase of Pup). Although pupylated substrates outcompete free Pup in proteasomal degradation, potential discrimination of the degradation complex between the various pupylated substrates has not been investigated. Here we show that Mpa binds stably to an open-gate variant of the proteasome (oCP) and associates with bona fide substrates with highly similar affinities. The proteasomal degradation of substrates differing in size, structure and assembly state was recorded in real-time, showing that the pupylated substrates are processed by the Mpa-oCP complex with comparable kinetic parameters. Furthermore, the members of a complex, pupylated proteome (pupylome) purified from Mycobacterium smegmatis are degraded evenly as followed by western blotting. In contrast, analysis of the depupylation behavior of several pupylome members suggests substrate-specific differences in enzymatic turnover, leading to the conclusion that largely indiscriminate degradation competes with differentiated depupylation to control the ultimate fate of pupylated substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2941916269,"The yeast dynamin-like protein Vps1 has roles at multiple stages of membrane trafficking including Golgi to vacuole transport, endosomal recycling, endocytosis and in peroxisomal fission. While the majority of the Vps1 amino acid sequence shows a high level of identity with the classical mammalian dynamins, it does not contain a pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain). The Dyn1 PH domain has been shown to bind to lipids with a preference for PI(4,5)P2 and it is considered central to the function of Dyn1 in endocytosis. The lack of a PH domain in Vps1 has raised questions as to whether the protein can function directly in membrane fusion or fission events. Here we demonstrate that the region Insert B, located in a position equivalent to the dynamin PH domain, is able to bind directly to lipids and that mutation of three lysine residues reduces its capacity to interact with lipids, and in particular with PI(4,5)P2. The Vps1 KKK-AAA mutant shows more diffuse staining but does still show some localization to compartments adjacent to vacuoles and to endocytic sites suggesting that other factors are also involved in its recruitment. This mutant selectively blocks endocytosis, but is functional in other processes tested. While mutant Vps1 can localise to endocytic sites, the mutation results in a significant increase in the lifetime of the endocytic reporter Sla2 and a high proportion of defective scission events. Together our data indicate that the lipid binding capacity of the Insert B region of Vps1 contributes to the ability of the protein to associate with membranes and that its capacity to interact with PI(4,5)P2 is important in facilitating endocytic scission."
https://openalex.org/W2953227081,"Influenza virus infections cause between 291 243 and 645 832 deaths annually, with the highest burden in low-income settings. Research in high-income countries has examined public understanding of influenza, but there is little information on views and behaviours about influenza in low-income countries. We explored communities' ideas about the severity, causes, prevention and treatment of influenza in Chikwawa district, Malawi. We conducted 64 in-depth interviews with parents of children aged <5 years, and 7 focus groups with community health workers, parents, and traditional healers. Data were analysed thematically and using a framework matrix to compare views between groups. Respondents held varied ideas about influenza, and many were uncertain about its causes and treatment. Some parents, traditional healers and health workers thought influenza was not severe because they felt it did not cause death or limit activities, but others disagreed. Many saw influenza as a symptom of other conditions, especially malaria and pneumonia, rather than as a disease of its own. Most mentioned dust as the main cause of influenza and believed influenza could be prevented by cleaning the home thoroughly. Treatment seeking for influenza followed different stages, usually starting with home remedies followed by purchasing drugs from groceries and then visiting a health centre. Seeking a clinician tended to be triggered by severe symptoms like high fever or difficulty breathing, and suspicions of malaria or pneumonia. Community health workers provide health education for communities, but some lacked understanding of influenza. Our findings suggest uncertainty about the causes and control of influenza among parents and varied levels of understanding among health providers. Strengthening the capacity of community health workers to provide relevant information about influenza prevention and treatment could address parents' interest in further information and support informed health seeking and engagement with future influenza interventions."
