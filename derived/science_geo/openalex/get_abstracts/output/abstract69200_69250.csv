https://openalex.org/W2023754051,"This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent ( 50 )."

When linolenic acid (Δ9,12,15) was used as substrate, it also was isomerized to a conjugated acid which was tentatively identified as cis-9,trans-11,cis-15-octadecatrienoic acid. Subsequent hydrogenation of this conjugated trienoic acid produced a nonconjugated cis,trans-dienoic acid but no monoenoic acid. Incubation of whole bacteria with linoleic acid in D2O produced cis-9,trans-11-octadecadienoic acid which contained a single deuterium atom at C-13. A spectrophotometric assay was developed for the presence of linoleate Δ12-cis,Δ11-trans-isomerase, an enzyme localized in the cell envelope. The enzyme did not require the addition of nucleotide cofactors or the presence of a hydrogen atmosphere. The Km for linoleic acid was 1.2 x 10-5 m, and for linolenic acid it was 2.3 x 10-5 m. The average equilibrium constant for the isomerization of linoleic acid was 61 when measured from the forward and reverse directions."

https://openalex.org/W2069152963,"Chick cells incubated at 1 degrees C with interferon fail to develop antiviral activity, but this activity appears subsequent to a 7-hour incubation at 37 degrees C after removal of interferon by repeated washings. Treatment with actinomycin D blocks the development of the latter activity. Cells incubated with interferon at 1 degrees C for up to 1 hour and then washed and incubated for 2 hours at 37 degrees C develop a degree of antiviral activity proportional to the concentration of interferon at initial incubation; at any concentration, the antiviral activity increased with the duration of initial incubation at 1 degrees C, but a maximal response was reached at 10 or 20 minutes. Treatment with trypsin after incubation with interferon at 1 degrees C inhibited development of antiviral activity. Interferon is rapidly bound to a superficial cell site, and this binding is necessary for development of antiviral activity in chick cells."
https://openalex.org/W1576233736,"Abstract Experiments with the soluble supernatant fraction of fetal rat liver indicate that it contains a glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase. This enzyme can utilize ammonia or glutamine as substrate, but the Km for glutamine is low (approximately 10-5 m) while the Km for ammonium ion-ammonia is at least 100 times higher. The ATP saturation curve for the enzyme appears to be sigmoidal. The pH optimum is 7.4. Glutamine analogues inhibit the ability of either glutamine or ammonia to serve as substrate. Comparisons of the change in the amounts of the glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase and aspartate transcarbamylase in the soluble fraction of the cell and in the amounts of acetylglutamate-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase in the particulate fraction of the cell with development from 4 days prior to gestation to 2 days after birth are reported. They suggest that the new enzyme provides carbamyl phosphate for the pyrimidine pathway. The same enzyme activity has also been found in the soluble fraction of a pigeon liver homogenate."

This reaction is not accidental, but acts as a specific antipredator device. Observational data and theoretical considerations indicate that such protean displays function to confuse and disorient the predator and to increase its reaction time. Thus the survival of the prey is assisted, and the selective advntage whereby such erratic patterns of the prey animals may have evolved is created."

https://openalex.org/W1500151791,"Abstract 1. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies at 77° K of sperm whale ferrimyoglobin as a function of pH showed a transition from a predominantly high spin form to a predominantly low spin form as the pH increased, according to a pK value of about 9.2. This transition appears to coincide with the well known hemic acid dissociation observed in optical spectroscopy. The intensities of the spectra of these two forms are interpreted as accounting for the greater part of the intensities predicted for the iron(III) present. 2. A component of the signal from the more alkaline of these forms, which is tentatively labeled as high spin, is distinctly different from the high spin signal observed at neutral pH. The temperature dependence of the signals could be explained by a thermally balanced equilibrium between high spin and low spin forms, as suggested earlier for horse myoglobin. 3. Near pH 12, in a region in which the protein is known to undergo structural alteration, new high spin and low spin forms appear. These changes, like those described above, are reversed by lowering the pH. 4. The signals from 1 eq of copper(II) bound to the ferrimyoglobin were studied as a function of pH. Two forms of EPR signal were observed; they were interconverted with a pK of approximately 7.9. No intermediate forms were observed. Superhyperfine structure could be detected. The form at high pH could be recognized as highly complexed, probably with 4 nitrogen atoms involved in the coordination. The form at lower pH could not be correlated with model compounds because of the lack of entirely appropriate model studies, but it did not seem to be at variance with the conclusions of Banaszak, Kendrew, and Watson on the modes of copper(II) binding in the crystalline state. 5. Observations on complexes at pH 11 of the pentapeptide, l-valyl-l-leucyl-l-seryl-l-glutamylglycine, the amino-terminal segment of the protein, are similar to previous results with the copper(II) complexes of triglycylglycine. They show general similarities to the properties of the protein complex, but probably match it somewhat less well than does the complex with acetylglycylglycyl-l-histidylglycine. 6. In the equimolar copper(II)-ferrimyoglobin complexes there was little evidence of copper-iron interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1531608498,"Pieces of the digestive gland of the starfish, Asterias forbesi, were incubated in vitro with various radioactive lipid precursors in order to follow the biosynthesis of the alkyl and alkenyl glycerol ethers. Acetate-1-14C was incorporated readily into alkyl glycerol ethers of both neutral lipid and phospholipid fractions, but very poorly into the alkenyl glycerol ethers. Stearic acid-1-14C and stearaldehyde-1-14C were both incorporated into alkyl glycerol ethers, but the fatty aldehyde was a much better precursor of alkenyl glycerol ethers than was the fatty acid. When stearyl alcohol-1-14C-1,1'-3H was compared with stearaldehyde-1-14C-1-3H, it was found, from isotope ratios and relative specific activities, that the fatty aldehyde served as a better precursor than the fatty alcohol in the biosynthesis of alkenyl ethers; on the other hand, the fatty alcohol was more efficiently incorporated into the alkyl ethers. In each of these cases, sufficient tritium was retained on the primary carbon of the lipid product to preclude the obligatory involvement of fatty acids as intermediates in the biosynthesis of lipid ethers. The evidence presented militates against a direct precursor-product relationship between alkyl and alkenyl lipid ethers."

In agreement with earlier findings, it was found that papaya lysozyme has a molecular weight of about 25,000 and that glycine is its sole amino-terminal residue. Molecular weight determinations in dissociating solvents indicate that the molecule consists of a single polypeptide chain. Papaya lysozyme lyses Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls at a rate one-third of that exhibited by egg white lysozyme; however, it displays a chitinase activity toward tetra-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine 400 times that of the egg white enzyme. No involvement of tryptophan residues in the active site of papaya lysozyme could be demonstrated."

Soft and hard evidence of sex preferences indicate a higher number of boys are desired and if sex control by medication were available the actual preference for boys might be even higher. Possible societal consequences of a boy surplus might be an increase in criminal behavior a decrease in agents of moral education and an intensification of interracial and interclass tensions; changes caused by sex control would probably be spread throughout society however and the effects lessened. Various approaches to protecting society from science and technology are presented and the direction given to technology by society is stressed.

The isolated stomachs of the dogfish, Squalus acanthias, and the skate, Raja erinacea, were found to incorporate long chain alcohols and acetate, but not long chain fatty acids, into glyceryl ethers. 2. The criterion for evaluation of incorporation of radioactive substrates into glyceryl ethers was the measurement of activity of individual isopropylidene derivatives separated by means of gas-liquid chromatography. 3. A pathway for incorporation of long chain alcohols involving aldehydes and fatty acids as intermediates was ruled out by means of studies which utilized mixtures of cetyl alcohol-1-14C and cetyl alcohol-1-3H. 4. An unexpected finding was a relatively greater enrichment in tritium as compared with 14C in the process of glyceryl ether synthesis from mixtures of cetyl alcohol-1-3H and cetyl alcohol-1-14C."

Attempts to determine the nature of the osmium black end products have been frustrated by their insolubility. The preparation of watersoluble analogs and their characterization as polymers suggest that the insoluble osmium blacks are coordination polymers. This is consonant with the unusually favorable properties of osmium black in electron microscopy. Although polymers of osmium have frequently been postulated as the end products of reaction of osmium tetroxide with tissue conistituents or with other organic compounds, this is the first example of their characterization."

https://openalex.org/W1553204931,"Abstract 1. The phosphatide plasmalogens of Clostridium butyricum, mainly ethanolamine and N-methylethanolamine plasmalogens, have been catalytically reduced and the resulting saturated glycerol ethers isolated as diacetate derivatives. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed that the linkage of the ether chain was 1(3)-glycerol. Hydrolysis of the diacetates followed by periodate oxidation yielded close to an equivalent amount of formaldehyde, in confirmation of the 1(3)-linkage. 2. The aldehyde chains released from the phosphatide plasmalogens were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography and shown to be similar in composition to the published composition of the 1-linked fatty acids of phosphatidylethanolamine from the same organism. 3. A study of the kinetics of incorporation of 1-14C-acetate into the phospholipid fraction of growing C. butyricum showed that the fatty acids had specific activities 5 to 6 times higher than those of the corresponding aldehydes after 5 to 10 min, and 2 to 3 times higher after 45 min. In the neutral lipid fraction, the esterified fatty acids had higher specific activities than the aldehydes up to 45 min after addition of 1-14C-acetate; subsequently, the ratios were reversed. Pathways from acetate to aldehydes to acids are not consistent with the data. The results are consistent with a derivation of the long chain aldehydes from the corresponding fatty acids. 4. Growing cells of C. butyricum incorporated 1-3H-1-14C-palmitaldehyde into fatty acids of plasmalogens with loss of 98% of the tritium, and into the aldehydes of plasmalogens with loss of about 85% of the tritium. Most, but not all, of the labeled palmitaldehyde appeared to have undergone oxidation prior to incorporation into plasmalogen-bound aldehyde."

The iodine content of these preparations was low, and spectrophotometric titration revealed monoiodotyrosine as the principal iodoamino acid. Iodination of goiter thyroglobulin in vitro increased its sedimentation rate in accord with the increase in density. Iodination in vitro produced a sequential appearance of monoiodotyrosine, diiodotyrosine, and thyroxine, suggesting a precursor-product relationship among these iodoamino acids. Thyroglobulin preparations from normal human glands collected randomly at autopsy showed an analogous distribution of iodoamino acids for similar iodine contents, except that thyroxine seemed to be formed at somewhat lower iodine levels in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2011294285,"A 3-micromolar concentration of tetrodotoxin completely inhibits the stimulation of respiration of rat brain cortex that takes place upon application of electrical impulses. It also inhibits increase in the rate of the respiration that occurs when calcium ions are omitted from the incubation medium. No effect of tetrodotoxin on brain respiration takes place when stimulation is brought about by the addition of 100 millimolar potassium chloride. Tetrodotoxin prevents the fall in the rate of oxidation of cerebral acetate that occurs during electrical stimulation but does not affect the increased rate of the oxidation that occurs in the presence of an increased concentration of potassium chloride. The data indicate that oxidation of cerebral acetate is diminished by influx of sodium ions, which is prevented by tetrodotoxin, and is increased by influx of potassium ions, which is unaffected by tetrodotoxin."

https://openalex.org/W1514858961,"Abstract The absorption spectra of both imidazole and acetylhistidine undergo bathochromic shifts in the presence of formaldehyde. When the spectra in formaldehyde are compared to those in water, the difference maximum is at 220 and 229 mµ for imidazole and acetylhistidine, respectively. In high concentrations of formaldehyde (about 7 m), the limiting value for the molar difference extinction coefficient of acetylhistidine is about 1600. In conjunction with other evidence discussed, the spectral data permit the conclusion that the difference peak generated by the imidazole group in formaldehyde is due to the formation of a hydroxymethyl derivative. When the spectrum of chymotrypsin in formaldehyde is compared to that in water, a difference peak is observed at 230 mµ. Although the major contribution to this low wave length peak is the result of solvent-induced red spectral shifts of the absorption envelopes of the aromatic chromophores (primarily tryptophyl groups), part of the total difference absorbance is due to the reaction between formaldehyde and the imidazole groups of the histidine residues. The contribution of the latter effect to the observed difference absorbance has been assessed from the results of spectral measurements of the enzyme and appropriate model mixtures in formaldehyde solution. The limiting molar difference extinction coefficient for the reaction between the histidine residues of chymotrypsin and formaldehyde, corrected for solvent effects, is equal to twice that observed for acetylhistidine. The change in the corrected molar difference extinction of chymotrypsin, as a function of formaldehyde concentration, agrees with the theory for the reaction of 1 mole of the enzyme with 2 moles of formaldehyde."

https://openalex.org/W1502575875,"Abstract When sperm whale ferrimyoglobin is mixed, at pH 6.6 to 6.7 and 23°, with 2 to 7 moles of copper(II) ion per mole of protein, at a concentration of the latter of 0.2 mm, the copper(II) ions become bound to the protein within a few seconds, as shown by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In a slower process, which can be correlated with a previously described conformational transition, the characteristic high spin iron(III) signal at g = 6 is reduced in intensity without change in shape. The extent of the reduction in the heme iron(III) signal at equilibrium depends linearly on the mole ratio of the copper(II); it is essentially complete at a mole ratio of 7, but not observable at a mole ratio of 1. Throughout most of the course of the process, the reduction in the iron(III) signal parallels the reduction in the Soret peak intensity at 409 mµ. The loss of the signal may be caused by dipolar coupling between paramagnetic ions, but it is significant that it may be produced by zinc ions, which are not paramagnetic but do promote the conformational transition in a similar way. At equilibrium, the copper(II) signal is reduced in intensity and somewhat broadened, but without other striking changes in form, and some degree of dipolar coupling of neighboring paramagnetic ions is indicated. Binding of the 1st copper(II) ion is relatively strong, but the binding of the additional 6 copper(II) ions in the altered complex cannot be distinguished according to a gradation of binding strengths."
https://openalex.org/W1966584445,"Goat lymphocytes were cultured in vitro with phytohemagglutinin and nonviable mycoplasmas. Addition of the mycoplasmas, even as late as 45 hours after adding phytohemagglutinin, completely inhibited the increase in synthesis of DNA and RNA normally induced in lymphocytes by the mitogen. The suppression of synthesis did not result from killing of the cells by the mycoplasmas, combination of the organisms with phytohemagglutinin, or competition for combining sites on the cell surface, which indicates that some other mechanism of inhibition was operative. A similar depression of response to phytohemagglutinin in lymphocytes in culture has been observed in human diseases associated with an immune defect. The present demonstration that at least certain mycoplasmas can profoundly affect lymphocyte function in vitro suggests that thay may alter the immune response in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1485391777,"Abstract 7-Methyl-7,8-dihydrofolate was used as a model compound to study the mechanism of reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. 7-Methylfolate is not a substrate but is a competitive inhibitor of folate reductase (Ki = 1.3 x 10-6 m). Since 7-methyl-7,8-dihydrofolate could not be prepared by dithionite reduction of 7-methylfolate, a new method involving reduction with zinc dust in 1.0 m NaOH was used. When this reduction was performed in the presence of tritiated water, tritium was incorporated not only at position 7, but also at carbon 9 and in the 7-methyl group of 7-methyl-7,8-dihydrofolate. As a result of the study of the mechanism of reduction of 7-methyl-7,8-dihydrofolate to 7-methyltetrahydrofolate by different agents, the following was established. (a) The reduction with dithionite proceeds entirely through an intramolecular rearrangement involving elimination of hydrogen from carbon 7. (b) The catalytic hydrogenation in water proceeds almost entirely by the direct addition of hydrogen to the 5,6-double bond. (c) The reduction with borohydride proceeds mainly through the direct addition of hydrogen as in b, and to the lesser extent through rearrangement as in a. The implications of these results with respect to the mechanism of reduction of dihydrofolate are discussed."
