https://openalex.org/W1984967704,"A new class of porphyrin-based chromophore systems has been prepared from ethyne-elaborated porphyrin synthons through the use of metal-mediated cross-coupling methodologies. These systems feature porphyrin chromophores wired together through single ethynyl linkages. This type of topological connectivity affords exceptional electronic interactions between the chromophores which are manifest in their room temperature photophysics, optical spectroscopy, and electrochemistry; these spectroscopic signatures indicate that these species model many of the essential characteristics of biological light-harvesting antenna systems."

Although the activity dependence of synaptic efficacy has been studied extensively, less is known about how activity shapes the intrinsic electrical properties of neurons. Lobster stomatogastric ganglion neurons fire in bursts when receiving synaptic and modulatory input but fire tonically when pharmacologically isolated. Long-term isolation in culture changed their intrinsic activity from tonic firing to burst firing. Rhythmic stimulation reversed this transition through a mechanism that was mediated by a rise in intracellular calcium concentration. These data suggest that neurons regulate their conductances to maintain stable activity patterns and that the intrinsic properties of a neuron depend on its recent history of activation."

https://openalex.org/W1858019207,"Man is among the exceptional higher animals that are unable to synthesize L-ascorbic acid because of their deficiency in L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the enzyme catalyzing the terminal step in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis. In the present study, we isolated a segment of the nonfunctional L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene from a human genomic library, and mapped it on chromosome 8p21.1 by spot blot hybridization using flow-sorted human chromosomes and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Sequencing analysis indicated that the isolated segment represented a 3'-part of the gene, where the regions corresponding to exons VII, IX, X, and XII of the rat L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene remain with probable deletion of the regions corresponding to exons VIII and XI. In the identified exon regions were found various anomalous nucleotide changes, such as deletion and insertion of nucleotide(s) and nonconformance to the GT/AG rule at intron/exon boundaries. When the conceptual amino acid sequences deduced from the four exon sequences were compared with the corresponding rat sequences, there were a large number of nonconservative substitutions and also two stop codons. These findings indicate that the human nonfunctional L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene has accumulated a large number of mutations without selective pressure since it ceased to function during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2083227510,An intracellular compartment has been isolated to which MHC class II molecules are transported on their way to the plasma membrane. They arrive with an associated invariant chain which is then proteolytically processed while MHC class II molecules acquire antigenic peptide. These loaded class II molecules then leave the compartment devoid of invariant chain and bound for the plasma membrane. This compartment represents a new stage in the endocytic/lysosomal pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1580327310,"The cellular mechanisms which lead to the generation and pathological deposition of beta amyloid in Alzheimer's disease are unknown. In this report we describe the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to an 11.5-kDa COOH-terminal derivative which contains the full-length beta amyloid sequence. This processing step normally occurs at low levels in parallel with APP maturation in the secretory pathway. Inhibition of oxidative energy metabolism by sodium azide or the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone increased the proteolysis of APP to the 11.5-kDa derivative by about 80-fold with accumulation of this APP derivative in the Golgi complex. Agents which inhibit protein transport in the secretory pathway, including monensin and brefeldin A, also increased the production of the 11.5-kDa derivative. Inhibition of APP maturation demonstrated that the 11.5-kDa derivative could be produced by proteolysis of immature APP. These results demonstrate that APP processing to potentially amyloidogenic COOH-terminal derivatives occurs in either the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi complex and can be modulated by the state of cellular energy metabolism. Deficits in oxidative energy metabolism have recently been found in the cerebral cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings raise the possibility that energy-related metabolic stress may lead to altered metabolism of APP and contribute to amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W1553426129,"The Na+/H+ exchange activity (NHE1 human isoform) is rapidly activated in response to growth factors and hyperosmotic stress. To get insight into the mechanism of NHE1 activation, we studied the direct interaction of a ubiquitous Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory factor, calmodulin (CaM) with NHE1. Binding experiments with CaM-Sepharose, as well as fluorescence measurements with dansylated CaM, revealed that the NHE1 cytoplasmic domain strongly binds CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Fusion protein analysis with deletion mutants provided evidence for high (Kd approximately 20 nM) and intermediate (Kd approximately 350 nm) affinity CaM-binding sites located in neighboring regions of NHE1 (amino acids 636-656 and 657-700). To assess a regulatory role of CaM-binding sites, several cDNAs having deletion and point mutations in the high affinity site were generated and expressed in the exchanger-deficient fibroblast cell line PS120. Deletion and point mutations of positively charged residues of the high affinity CaM-binding site resulted in up to 50 and 80% reductions of cytoplasmic alkalinization caused by growth factors (alpha-thrombin, etc.) and 100 mM sucrose, respectively. In these mutants, the reduction in alkalinization was apparently in proportion to that of the CaM-binding ability. These results suggest that binding of Ca2+/CaM to the high affinity site is involved at least partly in the activation of NHE1 in response to different extracellular signals."
https://openalex.org/W1552687651,"A rabbit animal model of the human disease familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which is the result of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor deficiency, was used to develop an in vivo approach to gene therapy based on recombinant adenoviruses. Recombinant, replication-defective adenoviruses expressing the lacZ gene under the control of different promoters were infused into the portal circulation of New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Expression of lacZ could be obtained in virtually all hepatocytes within 3 days post-infusion, but was undetectable by 3 weeks. This was not associated with liver pathology. An LDL receptor expressing adenovirus was constructed using the most active promoter and was infused into the portal vein of rabbits deficient in LDL receptor. Analysis of liver tissues harvested 3 days after virus infusion demonstrated human LDL receptor protein in the majority of hepatocytes that exceeded the levels found in human liver by at least 10-fold. Transgene expression was stable for 7-10 days and diminished to undetectable levels within 3 weeks. Infusion of LDL receptor expressing virus led to substantial reductions in serum cholesterol that returned to base line within 3 weeks; this acute reduction in serum cholesterol was associated with accumulations of lipid in hepatocytes. The development of neutralizing antibodies to the recombinant adenovirus markedly diminished the effectiveness of a second dose. These studies illustrate the advantages of recombinant adenoviruses for the treatment of liver metabolic diseases and define issues, such as viral genome instability and blocking immune response, that need to be overcome before the promise of this technology can be fully realized."
https://openalex.org/W1502708974,"The asymmetric unit membrane (AUM) forms the apical plaques of mammalian urothelium and is believed to play a role in strengthening the urothelial apical surface thus preventing the cells from rupturing during bladder distention. We have shown previously that purified bovine AUMs contain four major integral membrane proteins: the uroplakins Ia (27 kDa), Ib (28 kDa), II (15 kDa), and III (47 kDa). This contradicts some previous reports indicating that some of these proteins are absent in AUMs of several species. Using an improved procedure, we isolated AUMs from, in addition to cattle, eight mammalian species (human, monkey, sheep, pig, dog, rabbit, rat, and mouse). The AUMs of these species appear morphologically similar bearing crystalline patches of 12-nm protein particles with a center-to-center spacing of 16.5 nm. Using antibodies raised against synthetic oligopeptides or individual bovine uroplakins, we established by immunoblotting that the four uroplakins are present in AUMs of all these species. The DNA-deduced amino acid sequences of bovine and mouse uroplakin II revealed 83% identity. These results indicate that uroplakins Ia, Ib, II, and III are the major protein components of probably all mammalian urothelial plaques, and that the sequence and three-dimensional structure of uroplakin molecules are highly conserved during mammalian evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1546275634,"The ubiquitous plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) is rapidly activated in response to various extracellular signals. To understand how the intracellular Ca2+ is involved in this activation process, we investigated the effect of Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin on activity of the wild-type or mutant NHE1 expressed in the exchanger-deficient fibroblasts (PS120). In wild-type transfectants, a short (up to 1 min) incubation with ionomycin induced a significant alkaline shift (approximately 0.2 pH unit) in the intracellular pH (pHi) dependence of the rate of 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ uptake, without changes in the cell volume and phosphorylation state of NHE1. Mutations that prevented calmodulin (CaM) binding to a high affinity binding region (region A, amino acids 636-656) rendered NHE1 constitutively active by inducing a similar alkaline shift in dependence of Na+/H+ exchange. These same mutations abolished the ionomycin-induced NHE1 activation. These data suggest that CaM-binding region A functions as an autoinhibitory domain and that Ca2+/CaM activates NHE1 by binding to region A and thus abolishing its inhibitory effect. Furthermore, we found that a short stimulation with thrombin and ionomycin had apparently no additive effects on the alkaline shift in the dependence of Na+/H+ exchange and that deletion of region A also abolished such an alkaline shift induced by a short thrombin stimulation. The results strongly suggest that the early thrombin response and the ionomycin response share the same activation mechanism. Based on these data and the results shown in the accompanying paper (Bertrand, B., Wakabayashi, S., Ikeda, T., Pouyssegur, J., and Shigekawa, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 13703-13709), we propose that CaM is one of the major signal transducers that mediate distinct extracellular signals to the pHi sensor of NHE1."
https://openalex.org/W1482605042,"alpha 1-Adrenergic agonists activate a hypertrophic response in cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes, which include an increase in cell size, organization of contractile proteins into sarcomeric units, and the induction of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene. Previous findings have supported a role for ras in this signaling pathway. Utilizing microinjection techniques to delivery affinity-purified neutralizing antibodies to G alpha q,11 into cultured ventricular myocytes, the current studies demonstrate a functional requirement for the heterotrimeric G protein, Gq, in the alpha 1-adrenergic induction of the ANF gene, changes in cell size, organization of myofilaments, and phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Expression of a constitutively active mutant of G alpha q leads to the expression of ANF protein in these cells. Taken together, these data suggest that G q-dependent pathways are necessary and sufficient to activate defined features of the hypertrophic response. In attempts to further delineate the relative roles of ras and Gq in this pathway, we found that G alpha q is required for alpha 1-adrenergic phosphoinositide hydrolysis, though ras does not appear to be necessary for this response. In addition, we coexpressed an inhibitory ras mutant, along with the constitutively active G alpha q. Expression of ANF protein stimulated by the G alpha q mutant was not inhibited. Thus, both ras- and Gq-dependent pathways are necessary to fully transduce defined features of alpha 1-adrenergic-stimulated hypertrophy of neonatal cardiac ventricular myocytes, but activated Gq may be able to induce ANF expression independent of inhibitory ras."
https://openalex.org/W1511492934,"Using transfection and gel retardation assays, we have characterized further the antioxidant response element (ARE) found in the 5'-flanking region of the rat glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene. The ARE core sequence (5'-GTGACAAAGC-3') is sufficient for transcriptional activation of the Ya subunit gene by metabolizable planar aromatic compounds, phenolic antioxidants, and hydrogen peroxide. When the ARE sequence is ligated to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transfected into HepG2 cells, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity is modestly inducible by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Since the ARE is responsive to TPA and shows some sequence similarity to an AP-1-binding site (Jun/Fos recognition motif), we have explored whether members of the Jun/Fos family of transcription factors might bind to the ARE. Using in vitro synthesized Jun and Fos, binding to the ARE could not be detected, whereas Jun/Fos binding to a classical AP-1-binding site, a TPA response element (TRE) from the human collagenase gene, could be demonstrated by gel retardation assays. If the 2 A nucleotides underlined in the ARE core sequence (5'-GTGACAAAGC-3') are changed to TC, the ARE sequence (ARE-TRE) becomes a high-affinity AP-1-binding site and retains xenobiotic inducibility. Removal of the -GC- dinucleotide at the 3'-end of the ARE or the ARE-TRE eliminates xenobiotic inducibility. However, the ARE-TRE construct without the -GC- dinucleotide is still a high-affinity AP-1 site and responsive to TPA. Taken together, our data suggest that the ARE is not a high-affinity binding site for the Jun/Fos heterodimer. Functionally, however, an AP-1-binding site can resemble an ARE in its response to various xenobiotics if a 3'-GC- dinucleotide is present."
https://openalex.org/W1516777352,"Abstract Rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells transfected with a human hepatic lipase (HL) cDNA synthesized and secreted 50-80 ng of human HL/mg of cell protein at 4 h, approximately 50% of which was bound to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The newly synthesized HL possessed enzymatic activity. When rabbit beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) and canine chylomicrons or chylomicron remnants were incubated with HL-secreting cells, remnant binding and uptake were enhanced 3-fold compared with nontransfected cells. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy showed enhanced uptake of 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine-labeled beta-VLDL by the HL-transfected cells. When 125I-beta-VLDL were added to conditioned medium from HL-secreting cells, the HL in the media enhanced the binding and uptake of the remnant lipoproteins by nontransfected cells about 3-fold. Likewise, surface-bound HL (without HL in the medium) also was able to mediate the enhanced binding of the remnants. This HL-enhanced binding was shown to be mediated by an interaction with cell-surface HSPG. Heparinase treatment to remove cell-surface HSPG or chlorate treatment to prevent HSPG sulfation of the HL-secreting cells abolished all the HL-mediated enhanced binding and uptake. Furthermore, heparinase pretreatment of nontransfected cells prevented the enhanced binding and uptake of beta-VLDL incubated with conditioned medium from HL-secreting cells. As binding was not enhanced in the absence of HSPG, an HL-HSPG initial interaction appears essential. Addition of apolipoprotein (apo) E to the beta-VLDL did not facilitate HL-mediated binding and uptake; in fact, beta-VLDL from apoE-null mice demonstrated a similar degree of enhanced binding as did rabbit beta-VLDL with or without added apoE. On the other hand, beta-VLDL from transgenic mice overexpressing binding-defective apoE(Arg142-->Cys) did not display any enhanced binding and uptake by the HL-secreting cells, and it appears that the apoE(Arg142-->Cys) actually inhibited the HL-mediated interaction. This mutant form of apoE is associated with a dominant mode of expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia in contrast to the more commonly occurring recessive disorder. Impaired HL interaction with the apoE(Arg142-->Cys) beta-VLDL may contribute to remnant lipoprotein accumulation in the plasma of patients with this mutant form of apoE. Thus, HL contributes to the enhanced cell association of specific types of remnant lipoproteins by initiating their binding to cell-surface HSPG."
https://openalex.org/W1597396112,"The initial step in the clearance of apolipoprotein (apo) E-enriched remnant lipoproteins from the plasma appears to be sequestration within the liver mediated by their binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The surface-bound remnants are believed to be internalized by their interaction with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein or by the LDL receptor. Cholesterol-induced rabbit beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) enriched in human apoE3 display 4-5-fold enhanced binding to cultured cells. The present study attempts to determine whether recessive versus dominant type III hyperlipoproteinemia might be explained, at least in part, by a variable interaction of the mutant forms of apoE with the HSPG and impaired uptake. The beta-VLDL+apoE2(Arg158-->Cys), which is associated with recessive type III hyperlipoproteinemia, bound more poorly than beta-VLDL+apoE3 but still possessed significant enhanced binding (approximately 2-2.5-fold compared with beta-VLDL without added apoE) to HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells. In comparison, beta-VLDL+apoE(Arg142-->Cys), beta-VLDL+apoE(Arg145-->Cys), and beta-VLDL+apoE-Leiden, which are associated with dominant type III hyperlipoproteinemia, bound more poorly. This same hierarchy of binding and uptake was determined by [14C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters in LDL receptor-negative cells and by secretion of apoE3 and the variant apoE forms from McA-RH7777 cells. Furthermore, the enhanced binding of the apoE-enriched beta-VLDL was almost totally inhibited by heparinase treatment of the cells, and the basal binding activity was inhibited by 80-90% following addition of an LDL receptor antibody capable of blocking receptor-ligand interaction. The beta-VLDL enriched in apoE or apoE-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine complexes bound to isolated HSPG from McA-RH7777 cells or the rat liver to a very similar degree. Likewise, the binding of beta-VLDL plus the various forms of apoE to the LDL receptor-related protein on ligand blots paralleled the results of other studies. In conclusion, all of the type III hyperlipoproteinemic apoE variants are defective in displaying enhanced binding to HSPG and in the cellular uptake initiated by HSPG. However, apoE2(Arg158-->Cys) displayed more activity than the variants associated with the dominant forms of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. The hierarchy of binding and uptake was as follows: apoE3 > apoE2(Arg158-->Cys) > apoE(Arg145-->Cys) > apoE(Arg142-->Cys) approximately apoE-Leiden (the latter two usually displaying very little, if any, enhanced binding and uptake). Thus, a correlation exists between the mode of expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia and the binding and uptake of the specific apoE mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1582965598,"The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) adenosine deaminase (DRADA) deaminates adenosine residues to inosines and creates I-U mismatched base pairs in dsRNAs. Its involvement in RNA editing of glutamate-gated ion channel gene transcripts in mammalian brains has been proposed as one of the biological functions for this recently identified cellular enzyme. We purified a mixture of three forms, 93, 88, and 83 kDa, of bovine DRADA proteins, all likely to be active enzymes. We determined that DRADA has a native molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme exists as a monomer. The purified enzyme was not inhibited by 2'-deoxycoformycin, a transition state analog inhibitor of adenosine deaminase and AMP deaminase, suggesting that the catalytic mechanism of DRADA might be different from that of other deaminases. DRADA binds specifically to dsRNA with a dissociation constant of 0.23 nM for a synthetic dsRNA, and the Michaelis constant is 0.85 nM. These values indicate that DRADA has a much higher affinity for its substrate than other deaminases such as adenosine deaminase and AMP deaminase. DRADA may need this extremely high affinity to catalyze efficiently the modification of relatively rare substrate RNAs in the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2066720853,"It is shown here that maturation of the m7G-capped precursors of U3 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) occurs by a previously unknown pathway. In contrast to the 5' m7G-capped precursors of other snRNAs, this RNA is not exported to the cytoplasm but is retained in the nuclei of Xenopus laevis oocytes, where it undergoes trimethylation of its 5' cap. The m7G caps of most snRNA precursors are trimethylated only after transport of the RNAs to the cytoplasm. The nuclear retention and maturation of this nucleolar RNA raises the possibility that other m7G-capped RNAs are also retained and modified in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2027361206,"Synapsin I and synapsin II are neuron-specific phosphoproteins that have a role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and in the formation of nerve terminals. After depletion of synapsin II by antisense oligonucleotides, rat hippocampal neurons in culture were unable to consolidate their minor processes and did not elongate axons. These aberrant morphological changes were accompanied by an abnormal distribution of intracellular filamentous actin (F-actin). In addition, synapsin II suppression resulted in a selective decrease in the amounts of several synaptic vesicle-associated proteins. These data suggest that synapsin II participates in cytoskeletal organization during the early stages of nerve cell development."
https://openalex.org/W2112360090,"Stimulation of endothelial cells by cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B. NF-kappa B in turn regulates the expression of several genes involved in the inflammatory reaction, including cell adhesion molecules, interleukins, and transcription factors. One of these induced genes encodes an inhibitor of NF-kappa B, ECI-6/I kappa B alpha, that contains in its 5' regulatory region six consensus binding sites for NF-kappa B. We demonstrate here that these sites display striking differences in their ability in vitro to bind to various NF-kappa B subunits. In vivo, all six sites contribute, though to varying degrees, to transcription from the ECI-6/I kappa B alpha promoter, as demonstrated by deletion and mutation analysis. Among the NF-kappa B subunits tested p65, the p65/p50 heterodimer and, to a lesser extent, c-Rel, are able to activate transcription, whereas p50 or p50/Re1B were inactive. Since many genes regulated by NF-kappa B contain only one or two DNA-binding sites for this transcription factor, the presence of six functional NF-kappa B-binding sites in the ECI-6/I kappa B alpha promoter represents a unique feature of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1953136289,"Cell surface proteins that bind to the Fc part of immunoglobulin (Ig) A and/or IgG are expressed by many strains of the group A Streptococcus, an important human pathogen. Two extensively characterized proteins in this group of molecules are protein Arp that preferentially binds IgA and protein H that binds IgG. In addition, recent work has shown that many group A streptococcal strains express a novel type of Fc-binding protein, designated protein Sir, that binds both IgA and IgG. Protein Sir22, the molecule expressed by a strain of serotype M22, has now been purified and characterized after expression of the cloned gene in Escherichia coli. Dot-blot analysis with a large number of purified monoclonal Igs showed that protein Sir22 reacted with 19 out of 20 IgA proteins and with 19 out of 24 IgG proteins. The affinity constants for the reactions between protein Sir22 and Ig were determined to be 7.0 x 10(8) M-1 for serum IgA, 2.4 x 10(8 M-1 for secretory IgA, and 7.8 x 10(8) M-1 for IgG. Inhibition experiments showed that the bindings of IgA and IgG to protein Sir22 were mutually exclusive, indicating shared or contiguous binding sites. Analysis of the sequence of the sir22 gene indicated a gene product with 365 amino acid residues, including a 41-residue signal peptide. The processed form of the protein, 324 residues, has a calculated M(r) of 37,168. Deletion analysis of the sir22 gene showed that a 156-residue NH2-terminal fragment of protein Sir22 retained the ability to bind both IgA and IgG. The overall organization of protein Sir22 is similar to that of the IgA-binding protein Arp and the IgG-binding protein H. All three of these proteins are members of the M protein family and have a central repeat region of the C type."
https://openalex.org/W1548747789,"Previous analyses have suggested that the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase activates src family tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn by dephosphorylating regulatory COOH-terminal residues. We have examined the status of p56lck and p59fyn in murine and human CD45- T cell lines. Surprisingly, despite the fact that p56lck and p59fyn were spontaneously hyperphosphorylated, the tyrosine kinase activity of both enzymes was increased in CD45- versus CD45+ cells. In vitro exposure of hyperphosphorylated p56lck to CD45 decreased enzyme activity to near-basal levels. Lck from CD45- cells was hyperphosphorylated on the cyanogen bromide digestion fragment that contains the negative regulatory residue Tyr-505, and the identity of this site of phosphorylation was confirmed by trypsin digestion followed by high performance liquid chromatography. Loss of CD45 results, therefore, in a paradoxical hyperphosphorylation of the COOH-terminal tyrosine and increased src family kinase enzymatic activity."

An isoform of grb2 complementary DNA (cDNA) was cloned that has a deletion in the SH2 domain. The protein encoded by this cDNA, Grb3-3, did not bind to phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) but retained functional SH3 domains and inhibited EGF-induced transactivation of a Ras-responsive element. The messenger RNA encoding Grb3-3 was expressed in high amounts in the thymus of rats at an age when massive negative selection of thymocytes occurs. Microinjection of Grb3-3 into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that Grb3-3, by acting as a dominant negative protein over Grb2 and by suppressing proliferative signals, may trigger active programmed cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1546686271,"Trophoblasts of ruminant species secrete multiple forms of a novel Type I interferon (IFN-tau) for a few days preceding implantation. These IFN-tau are structurally distinct from IFN-alpha, -beta, and -omega, but it remains unclear whether they have any distinguishing biological properties. It has been of interest, therefore, to study their interaction with Type I IFN receptors. However, a recombinant bovine IFN-tau (boIFN-tau 1) prepared for such use is rapidly inactivated during chemical iodination with 125I, presumably because a critical tyrosine becomes modified. Here we describe the synthesis of a novel IFN-tau 1 in which Leu169 and Leu171 in the carboxyl terminus have been replaced by 2 tyrosine residues. The recombinant product (rboIFN-tau 1Y2) can be readily iodinated without significant loss of antiviral and antiproliferative activities, provided that reaction time with 125I is minimized. Both rboIFN-tau 1Y2 and rboIFN-alpha 1 compete with each other for binding to bovine endometrial cell membranes and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. Dissociation constants of both IFN are quite similar (Kd = 3.7 x 10(-10) and 3.5 x 10(-10) M, respectively). Cross-linking studies reveal a single size class of receptor polypeptide on endometrium and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells whose molecular weight is reduced from approximately 130,000 to approximately 70,000 by treatment with N-glycosidase. These studies with a single recombinant form of boIFN-tau avoid the difficulties that arise from use of a mixture of naturally occurring isoforms. They provide further evidence for the presence of a receptor common to both IFN-tau and IFN-alpha in bovine tissues and no indication for a unique IFN-tau-binding polypeptide in endometrium."

Res. 41, 47-62). In this study, we have analyzed the effect of retinoids on the production and activity of enzymes involved in the proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) by EC. Substrate gel electrophoresis (zymography) revealed several major matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), of approximately 98-96, 72-68, and 46-45 kDa, whose activities were altered in their amounts in the conditioned media (CM) of EC following retinol or retinoic acid treatment when compared to amounts detected in CM of control cells. All of these gelatinases were inactivated by 1,10-phenanthroline, indicating that they were MMPs. MMP inhibitors (MMPI) were also present in these CM and were separated by gel filtration. Four distinct peaks of MMPIs were detected in the CM of EC. Chromatographic profiles indicated that an approximately 27-kDa MMPI was specifically increased in the CM of retinol-treated cells, whereas a 22-18.5-kDa MMPI was increased in CM derived from retinoic acid-treated cells. The MMPI synthesized by retinol-treated EC was immunologically related to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, type 1 (TIMP-1), and the MMPI produced by retinoic acid-treated cells was related to TIMP-2, as indicated by biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation studies as well as Western blot analysis. Therefore, retinol and retinoic acid treatment of EC differentially affects the types and activity of MMPs and MMPIs produced by the cells, distinct changes which are both correlated with growth inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1571997650,"Maturation of noninfectious nodavirus provirions occurs by autoproteolytic cleavage of most of the 180 copies of the alpha-protein that make up the icosahedral capsid. This maturation, which is much slower than viral assembly, produces an infectious particle that is more stable than the provirion and makes viral uncoating thermodynamically distinct from assembly, allowing assembly and (a time-delayed) uncoating to occur under similar conditions. The results of structural, computational, and molecular genetic studies suggest that maturation depends both on intrasubunit strain, produced during assembly, and on a critical aspartic acid residue. This residue lies in a hydrophobic pocket that is stabilized by intersubunit contacts. It is close to the scissile bond and exhibits an environmentally elevated pKa. The apparent involvement of a single acidic residue in the hydrolytic cleavage of a peptide bond contrasts with the involvement of 2 such residues in acid proteases."

A. 91, 2517-2521) places Cys-170 and Cys-242 on the periphery of an alpha/beta-barrel so that they cannot be involved in catalysis of steroid recognition. This demonstrates that bromoacetoxysteroid affinity-labeling agents may provide misleading information regarding the topography of steroid hormone binding sites. When NADPH was modeled into the crystal structure of 3 alpha-HSD, Tyr-55 was implicated as the general acid, since it is in close proximity to the C-4 position of the nicotinamide ring and could polarize the substrate carbonyl. In support of this model, the purified Y55F mutant was found to be catalytically inactive, but still formed an E-NADPH complex (measured by fluorescence titration) and an E-NADH-testosterone complex (measured by equilibrium dialysis). The ability of the Y55F mutant to form binary and ternary complexes, but not aid in hydride transfer, is consistent with Tyr-55 acting as the general acid. 3 alpha-HSD is a member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, and Tyr-55 is invariant in members of this family where it may perform a similar function. Tyr-205 is present in a pentapeptide sequence that is conserved in HSDs that belong to the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family and has been implicated as the general acid within these enzymes. The Y205F mutant was found to be kinetically similar to wild-type r3 alpha-HSD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1515387372,"Ferrochelatase catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX to form protoheme. It is located in the mitochondria in all eukaryotes and is also found in plastids in plants. Although it has been purified from animals and microorganisms, and genes for it isolated and characterized, very little is known about plant ferrochelatases. We have isolated a cDNA for ferrochelatase from the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana by functional complementation of a mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in this enzyme. The cDNA encodes a protein of 52 kDa, which has 25-35% sequence similarity to ferrochelatases from other organisms. There is an N-terminal extension of about 65 residues, which is almost certainly the chloroplast transit peptide, since the precursor protein, transcribed and translated in vitro, is efficiently imported and processed to the mature size by isolated pea chloroplasts. In contrast, the precursor was not processed by mitochondrial processing peptidase activity, nor could import into isolated yeast mitochondria be demonstrated conclusively, although, presumably, in the rescued yeast mutant, at least some of the Arabidopsis ferrochelatase must be present in the mitochondria. A single transcript the same size as the cDNA was detected in both Arabidopsis leaves and roots, although the amount of message was greater in the photosynthetic tissue. Southern analysis suggests that there is a single gene for chloroplast ferrochelatase in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W1578444073,"Endothelin (ET) receptors display subtype heterogeneity and so far three subtypes of ET receptors, namely ETA, ETB, and ETC, have been identified, cloned, sequenced, and characterized. Based on the binding profile of ET and related peptides, a novel ET receptor (ETAX) was identified in the follicular membranes of Xenopus laevis oocytes (Kumar, C. S., Nuthulaganti, P., Pullen, M., and Nambi, P. (1993). Mol. Pharmacol. 44, 153-157). Here we report the cloning and characterization of this ETAX subtype from X. laevis heart. A cDNA was isolated that encodes a protein of 415 amino acids that shares 74, 60, and 51% identities with human ETA, human ETB, and Xenopus ETC receptors, respectively. Competition binding studies of the cloned receptor expressed in COS cells using ET-related peptides suggested that this receptor is pharmacologically identical to that expressed in Xenopus oocyte follicular, heart, and lung membranes. Phosphoinositide turnover and oocyte electrophysiological studies indicated that the cloned receptor is functionally coupled to a second messenger system."
https://openalex.org/W1579960871,"The importance of geranylgeranylation to the interaction of Rab proteins with RabGDI was investigated with a set of Rab6 mutants post-translationally modified by all known C-terminal lipid combinations. Rab6 proteins geranylgeranylated on CXC or CC motifs were found to be significantly better substrates for membrane extraction by RabGDI than either Rab6 proteins geranylgeranylated on CAAL motifs or Rab6 proteins that were farnesylated and palmitoylated. The methylation status of the CXC motif did not significantly affect interaction of wild type Rab6 with RabGDI. Rab6 protein sequences required for RabGDI interaction were then identified. Consistent with the significant homology between Rab-GDI and the Rab escort protein, a subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RabGGTase), we show that there is an overlap between Rab6 motifs required for RabGDI binding and RabGGTase processing. The effector domain, loop3/beta 3 and the hypervariable region of Rab6 are all required for RabGDI binding, whereas loop3/beta 3 and the hypervariable region but not the effector domain are required for efficient processing of Rab6 by RabGGTase. Interestingly, however, loop3/beta 3 of Rab6 when introduced into H-Ras is sufficient to allow some in vivo processing of a C-terminal CSC motif."
https://openalex.org/W1507063694,"Protein synthesis elongation factor 2 (EF-2) from eukaryotes contains an unusual modified histidine residue, termed diphthamide. Diphthamide has been shown to be a site of ADP-ribosylation by bacterial toxins, but its function remains obscure. We expressed mutant genes of EF-2 with substitutions of 19 other amino acids for His-699, which is modified to diphthamide, in yeast cells and found that they can be classified into three groups. In the first group (Group 1), replacement of His-699 by the basic amino acid Arg or Lys showed not only loss of EF-2 activity but also inhibitory effects on the growth of cells co-expressing wild-type EF-2. In the second group (Group 2), replacement with Gly, Pro, Ser, or Asp resulted in nonfunctional EF-2, but it did not affect the growth of cells co-expressing wild-type EF-2. In the third group (Group 3), replacement by one of the other 13 amino acids resulted in a functional EF-2. In the Group 3 mutants, EF-2 was not ribosylated by diphtheria toxin, indicating that the mutant EF-2s did not form diphthamide. However, the viable cells grew more slowly than cells expressing wild-type EF-2 and showed temperature sensitivities. This result suggests that diphthamide may confer heat resistance on EF-2, although it still may be active without diphthamide at a normal temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1557954634,"A novel aminopeptidase, termed aminopeptidase Y, was purified from yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as two molecular forms of 70 and 75 kDa, which were identical immunologically, catalytically and in N-terminal sequence up to 14 residues. They contained 0.81 and 0.84 mol of zinc atom/mol of protein, respectively. N-Gly-canase generated a single 53-kDa species from both forms, and endoglycosidase H gave a 54-kDa species. Immunoblotting after subcellular fractionation showed that aminopeptidase Y is localized in the vacuole/lysosome-soluble compartment as the 70-kDa form. Aminopeptidase Y hydrolyzed all amino acid-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amides (MCA) examined, especially Lys- and Arg-MCA. Dipeptidyl-MCAs were far more rapidly hydrolyzed (Lys-Ala-MCA/Lys-MCA = 350-fold, Arg-Arg-MCA/Arg-MCA = 150-fold). Hydrolysis of amino acid-MCAs or dipeptides was markedly enhanced by Co2+, whereas that of dipeptidyl-MCAs, tripeptides, and larger peptides was inhibited. Rabbit anti-aminopeptidase Y antiserum adsorbed over half the aminopeptidase activities in vacuolar extract from wild-type yeast cells. ABYS1 mutant cells from which the genes of four vacuolar proteases had been deleted contained aminopeptidase Y as a 74-kDa proform. This was converted to the mature form (70 kDa) by vacuolar extract of wild-type cells and by purified yeast vacuolar protease B."
https://openalex.org/W1493369644,"Factor 5 is a Drosophila RNA polymerase II initiation factor that also affects the elongation phase of transcription. We have used a cDNA encoding the large subunit of factor 5 (F5a) to produce recombinant F5a (rF5a). Antibodies directed against peptides deduced from the sequence of the F5a cDNA recognized rF5a and the large subunit of factor 5 purified from Kc cells. A chimeric human/fly factor composed of the small subunit of human TFIIF (RAP30) and rF5a stimulated elongation by Drosophila RNA polymerase II when assayed using a dC-tailed template. In addition, the chimeric human/fly factor functioned during initiation in either the Drosophila or human system. Therefore, the structure of the large subunit of TFIIF is sufficiently conserved from human to fly to allow functional interaction with both the small subunit of TFIIF and RNA polymerase II from either species. Analysis of deletion mutants of F5a indicated that almost all of the protein was required for initiation while only the NH2-terminal region was required for stimulating transcriptional elongation. A comparison of our results with those obtained with RAP74 suggest that the carboxyl terminal region of the protein may be involved in interactions with RNA polymerase II or other factors during initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1589418575,"Four mutants of the Escherichia coli F1ATPase, gamma S8-C, gamma T106-C, gamma S179-C, and gamma V286-C, which have a cysteine introduced at different sites in the gamma-subunit by site-directed mutagenesis, were reacted with the fluorescent reagent N-(4-7-(diethylamino)4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)-maleimide (CM) under conditions that selectively label the introduced Cys residue. With each mutant the effect of nucleotide binding on the fluorescence of the probe has been monitored. The results obtained with the mutants gamma S8-C and gamma T106-C are similar. In both cases, there was a spectral shift and change in fluorescence intensity on adding AMP.PNP or ATP to enzyme emptied of nucleotide from catalytic sites, while no change in the fluorescence spectrum was observed upon adding ADP. The fluorescence spectral changes obtained with ATP were transient and involved an initial rapid fluorescence enhancement followed by a subsequent fluorescence quenching. The kinetics of these ATP-induced fluorescence changes and the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis as monitored by the rates of ATP binding and of Pi formation were the same under conditions of unisite catalysis, indicating that the conformational changes in the gamma-subunit being measured by the fluorescent probe are driven by ATP hydrolysis in catalytic sites. No nucleotide-dependent fluorescence changes were observed with CM bound at a Cys at position 179. Nucleotide-dependent changes in fluorescence were seen with CM bound at position 286, but these appear to reflect structural changes due to binding of ADP or ATP in noncatalytic sites. The fluorescence changes observed in mutants gamma S8-C and gamma T106-C were not seen in subunit epsilon-free E. coli F1ATPase, although such enzyme preparations are highly active ATPases. We conclude that the structural changes monitored by the fluorescent probe are a part of the conformational coupling, whereby catalytic site events are linked to proton channeling."
https://openalex.org/W1524950548,"We have purified oligosaccharyltransferase from hen oviduct microsomes some 850-fold. Oligosaccharyltransferase activity copurified with a 200-kDa complex consisting of two 65-kDa polypeptides and a 50-kDa polypeptide. N-terminal sequence analysis indicated that the 50-kDa subunit was the avian form of OST48, a canine pancreatic microsomal protein associated with oligosaccharyltransferase. As the first step toward reconstitution of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, the 50-kDa subunit was purified to homogeneity under nondenaturing conditions. The complete amino acid sequence of the 50-kDa subunit was determined by sequence analysis of peptides isolated by a combination of gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography from chemical and enzymatic digests. The protein consists of 412 residues in a single polypeptide chain. The amino acid sequence of the 50-kDa subunit of avian oligosaccharyltransferase is 92% identical to the sequence of canine OST48 protein and about 25% identical to WBP1 protein from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast WBP1 protein has been shown in vitro, as well as in vivo, to be essential for the oligosaccharyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1512919689,"In addition to membrane immunoglobulin (mIg), the B-cell antigen receptor contains Ig-alpha/Ig-beta heterodimers that link mIg to intracellular signaling molecules. To compare the ability of the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta to transduce signals in B- and T-cells, we constructed chimeric genes encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human CD8 alpha and the cytoplasmic domain of murine Ig-alpha (CD8/Ig-alpha) or Ig-beta (CD8/Ig-beta). In murine B-cell hybridoma LK 35.2 cells, antibody-mediated cross-linking of mIg, CD8/Ig-alpha, or CD8/Ig-beta induced similar increases in intracellular calcium levels and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Substitution of alanine for the conserved leucine, but not the conserved isoleucine, residue within the putative activation motif of CD8/Ig-beta destroyed signaling ability. In murine T-cell hybridoma DO-11.10 cells, cross-linking of the T-cell antigen receptor, CD8/Ig-alpha, or CD8/Ig-beta stimulated equivalent protein tyrosine phosphorylation and interleukin-2 production. Thus, the cytoplasmic domains of Ig-alpha and Ig-beta are equally capable of initiating early signaling events downstream of B- and T-cell antigen receptors as well as evoking a complete biological effector response in lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1575807259,"Abstract The bacteriophage lambda terminase is composed of two subunits, gpNu1 and gpA. In vitro, the holoenzyme is a site-specific endonuclease, helicase, ATPase, and can package lambda DNA into proheads. gpA possesses ATPase and helicase activities which are similar to those of the holoenzyme. Both terminase and gpA can hydrolyze a wide range of deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside triphosphates to inorganic phosphate and the corresponding diphosphate. Nucleoside diphosphates are not substrates for either protein. ATPase of both proteins is stimulated by double-stranded DNA. The ATPase of gpA is protein concentration-dependent, while that of terminase is not. Helicase activity of both proteins is not concentration-dependent, and requires a hydrolyzable triphosphate. ATP, dATP, and GTP supported helicase activity, while adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate, adenosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, ADP, CTP, and UTP did not. The kinetic parameters of ATPase and helicase activities were similar for both proteins, but packaging with terminase was optimal only at a significantly higher level of ATP. Packaging was detectable at significant levels with CTP and UTP, but not with GTP. Packaging also differed from ATPase and helicase in the utilization of divalent metal cations and susceptibility to various inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1570718537,"We have investigated the DNA elements responsible for transcription from the proximal portion of the mouse neurofilament heavy gene (NF-H) promoter by in vitro transcription using extracts from expressing (brain) and non-expressing (liver) tissues. We have found that constructs containing 5' region from -1314 to -115 exhibit a 3-5-fold higher level of NF-H promoter activity, relative to the adenovirus major late promoter (pML), in brain versus liver extracts. Deletion to -85 lowers the level of brain transcription by 2-fold, while deletion from -65 through -31 reduces transcription by 5-fold to a relatively strong (10% of pML) basal level. Basal level expression is observed in all deletions transcribed with liver extract. Deletion to -24 (TATA-less) abolishes promoter activity with both extracts. Deletion of the -115 to -65 region from a larger construct reduces transcription in brain extracts to basal levels, suggesting that this region contains the elements necessary for the brain-specific enhancement of promoter function. Mutation of a palindromic sequence within this region abolishes brain-specific enhanced promoter activity. This loss of enhanced transcriptional activity is correlated with the loss of a shifted band in gel shift assays. Our studies suggest that the sequence (-106)GGGGAGGAGG-(15 bp)-CCTCCTCCCC(-72) (where bp = base pairs) is important in brain-specific enhancement of transcription from the mouse NF-H promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1543505082,"Baculovirus-mediated expression has become a powerful tool for the high yield production of functionally active recombinant proteins. In order to further enhance the utility of this expression system, we constructed versatile transfer vectors that facilitate the secretion of recombinant proteins from host insect cells by inserting functional secretory leader sequences down-stream of the polyhedrin promoter. In-frame insertion of cDNA sequences results in the synthesis of fusion proteins containing a heterologous signal sequence which directs the recombinant protein to the secretory pathway. Human and insect leader sequences were successfully tested with a number of proteins including the thermostable Pyrococcus furiousus (Pfu) DNA polymerase in an effort to maximize secretion of heterologous proteins from insect cells. The human placental alkaline phosphatase signal sequence (MLGPCMLLLLLLLGLRLQLSLG) proved to be optimal for the secretion of not only this thermostable bacterial enzyme but also for the secretion of other biologically active polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1601358721,"Abstract A yeast genomic DNA encoding a new vacuolar aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase Y, was isolated by using a cDNA fragment obtained by screening the lambda gt11 yeast cDNA library with anti-aminopeptidase Y antibody. The DNA sequence encodes 537 amino acids. The protein, whose NH2-terminal sequence was determined previously by analysis of the purified enzyme, consists of 481 amino acids, and the calculated molecular weight (52,900) coincides with the value obtained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme after removal of sugar chains, 53 kDa. The 56-residue preprosequence was divided into two parts by putative processing sites for signal peptidase and conversion to the mature form; the 21-residue presequence has a hydrophobic stretch which may function as the signal sequence for transit through the endoplasmic reticulum, and the 35-residue prosequence (4013 Da) accounts for the 4-kDa difference between proaminopeptidase Y in the vacuolar proteases-deleted ABYS1 mutant and wild-type mature enzyme. The aminopeptidase Y gene was localized on chromosome II by genetic mapping. A deletion mutant was constructed by disrupting the aminopeptidase Y gene. Vacuolar aminopeptidase activities toward Ala-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) and Lys-MCA were 13 and 20% of wild-type, and those in the presence of Co2+ were 2.2 and 2.8%, respectively. Mutant cells showed no ability to hydrolyze Lys-Ala-MCA to Lys and Ala-MCA, although vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y activity was similar to that in wild-type cells."

https://openalex.org/W1598047674,"Elements necessary for the steroid hormone 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3) to induce a biological response include the presence of specific intracellular receptors (vitamin D3 receptors (VDR)) and modulation of gene expression via hormone-activated receptor binding to regulatory regions of target genes. These parameters were examined in normal and Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized human B cells and compared with 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells of the T and monocytic lineages. Although resting tonsillar B cells did not express VDR mRNA, activation of these cells with interleukin-4 induced VDR in the absence of exogenously supplemented 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3. As indicators of hormone-mediated gene regulation we analyzed modulation of CD23, a common B cell/monocyte surface antigen, and 24-hydroxylase. 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited CD23 expression in U937 cells, yet failed to modulate CD23 expression in B cells. Furthermore, 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 induced 24-hydroxylase mRNA expression and metabolic activity in both U937 cells and lectin-activated T cells, yet failed to induce 24-hydroxylase mRNA or its metabolic activity in B cells. These findings suggest that although human B lymphocytes can express VDR mRNA and protein, they exhibit a functional block for vitamin D-dependent gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1494276408,"New methods for the purification of highly active bacteriophage lambda terminase holoenzyme, and its individual subunits, gene products (gp) A and gpNu1, have been developed. These methods are rapid, simple, reproducible, and give high yields of unaggregated protein from small volumes of culture. The procedures involve fractionation of extracts of Escherichia coli strains harboring plasmids engineered to overproduce the respective proteins. All purified proteins exist as monomers or dimers at moderate concentrations. At concentrations where holoenzyme efficiently promotes in vitro cosN-cleavage and lambda DNA packaging, gpA displays neither of these activities unless supplemented with gpNu1 and the E. coli protein integration host factor. At high protein concentrations, however, gpA can promote cos-cleavage by itself. Although gpNu1 itself cannot promote either cosN-cleavage or DNA packaging, it does modulate these activities of gpA. GpA is a DNA-stimulated ATPase whose catalytic parameters closely resemble those of the holoenzyme. Like the holoenzyme, gpA displays a DNA helicase activity which is able to melt the annealed cosN overhangs. Certain preparations of gpA appear to undergo a time-dependent amino-terminal clipping at discrete sites even in the presence of as many as four protease inhibitors and at low temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1563359156,"The reaction requirements and kinetic properties of the in vitro endonuclease activity of the bacteriophage lambda terminase and its large subunit, gene product (gp) A, have been analyzed. Optimal cleavage reaction activity for both proteins requires Mg2+, a pH between 8.5 and 9.0, and is enhanced by ATP or ATP analogs. Under these conditions both terminase and gpA generate aberrant nicks in and around cosN. Optimal nicking specificity of terminase is observed under conditions of 50-100 mM salt, 5 mM spermidine, 1.5 mM ATP, and a pH between 7.0 and 7.5. Specific activity of terminase is greatly reduced under these conditions, and gpA is completely inactive at all protein concentrations tested. Under optimal reaction conditions, gpA endonuclease activity differs from that of the holoenzyme in that it can only be detected at high concentrations, is strongly protein concentration-dependent, and can not be stimulated by the Escherichia coli protein integration host factor. Addition of purified gpNu1 partially, but not completely, minimized these differences, suggesting that the role of gpNu1 in the holoenzyme is to modulate the basal endonuclease of gpA."
https://openalex.org/W1621367409,"Signal peptidase I (also called leader peptidase) is the endopeptidase that removes the signal peptides of most secreted proteins during or after translocation in Escherichia coli. Precursor recognition is contingent in part on the presence of small, uncharged residues in the -3 and -1 positions relative to the cleavage site, and may also depend on the structure of the processing region. Most precursor processing regions include residues likely to form a beta-turn. Mutations were introduced into the processing region of maltose-binding protein (MBP) that altered the prediction of beta-turn formation in this region. MBP species with a decreased probability of beta-turn formation were processed slowly or not at all, whereas MBP species with an increased probability of beta-turn formation were processed efficiently. Mutations altering the prediction of beta-turn formation in the MBP processing region were also made in cis to a proline in the +1 position. Cleavage at the normal processing site is blocked by proline in the +1 position; this MBP species, MBP27-P, inhibits processing of other proteins by signal peptidase I. Decreasing the probability of beta-turn formation in the processing region of MBP27-P eliminated the inhibition of signal peptidase I, and these MBP27-P derivatives remained unprocessed, suggesting that the formation of a beta-turn in the MBP processing region was necessary for recognition by signal peptidase I. Increasing the probability of beta-turn formation in cis to proline at +1 in MBP did not alter recognition of the protein by the processing enzyme. The results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that the efficiency of recognition and processing by signal peptidase I is increased by the formation of a beta-turn in the processing region of the MBP signal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1527231571,"The actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of filamentous Acanthamoeba myosin II is inactivated by phosphorylation of a short non-helical tailpiece at the C-terminal end of each heavy chain even though the catalytic sites are in the N-terminal globular head. Consistent with this effect, phosphorylation at the tip of the tail alters the conformation of the head as shown by a shift in the principal site of cleavage by endoproteinase Arg-C (Ganguly, C., Martin, B., Bubb, M., and Korn, E. D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20905-20908). We now show that the sedimentation coefficient of monomeric phospho-myosin II is 1.3-4.6% lower than that of dephospho-myosin II, which suggests that phosphorylation produces a less compact conformation with a small increase in frictional coefficient. As shown by changes in papain digestion patterns, bound nucleotide also affects the conformation of the head region of monomeric phospho- and dephospho-myosin II, the conformation of the head region of filamentous phospho- and dephospho-myosin II, and the conformation of the C-terminal region of the tail of filamentous phospho-myosin II. Conformational differences between the dephospho- and phospho-forms of myosin II in the presence of nucleotide, as detected by susceptibility to proteolysis, therefore, appear to be greater in filaments than in monomers. These results provide additional evidence for communication between the N-terminal heads and C-terminal tails of Acanthamoeba myosin II."
https://openalex.org/W1562223828,"We have studied the effect of DNA supercoiling on open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at the TAC16 and TAC17 promoters. A two-dimensional gel retardation assay was used to measure the relative rate of association between RNA polymerase and the TAC promoters on individual topoisomers. Plasmid DNAs usually have several promoters that complicate the analysis of RNA polymerase binding to only one of them. We avoided this problem by using minicircles of DNA carrying only a single promoter. These were generated in vivo by the site-specific recombination system of bacteriophage lambda. Both the TAC16 and TAC17 promoters exhibited a biphasic response to negative supercoiling. Between superhelical densities of 0 and -0.04, increases in the negative linking difference favored binding. Beyond -0.04, either no effect on binding (TAC16) or a slight inhibition of binding (TAC17) was observed for increases in the negative linking difference. The unwinding at the rate-limiting step was calculated for both TAC promoters at moderate superhelical densities. This unwinding was found to be a fraction (about 20-30%) of the total unwinding measured by topoisomerase I relaxation (about one turn). In addition, the 1-base pair difference in spacer length between the TAC16 and TAC17 promoters resulted in different extents of activation and inhibition by negative supercoiling."
