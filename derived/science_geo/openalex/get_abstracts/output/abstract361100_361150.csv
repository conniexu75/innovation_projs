We examined whether and how hippocampal theta oscillations affect neocortical assembly patterns by recording populations of single cells and transient gamma oscillations in multiple cortical regions, including the somatosensory area and prefrontal cortex in behaving rats and mice. Laminar analysis of neocortical gamma bursts revealed multiple gamma oscillators of varying frequency and location, which were spatially confined and synchronized local groups of neurons. A significant fraction of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as localized gamma oscillations in all recorded neocortical areas were phase biased by the hippocampal theta rhythm. We hypothesize that temporal coordination of neocortical gamma oscillators by hippocampal theta is a mechanism by which information contained in spatially widespread neocortical assemblies can be synchronously transferred to the associative networks of the hippocampus.

An essential aspect of cortical operation is that the results of local computations are integrated globally.

Phase modulation is a potential mechanism by which the hippocampus can coordinate disparate neocortical cell assemblies. To test this hypothesis and expand on previous works (Hyman et al., 2005Hyman J.M. Zilli E.A. Paley A.M. Hasselmo M.E.

We report here that a significant fraction of neurons in all recorded neocortical areas and locally emerging gamma oscillations are phase modulated by the hippocampal theta rhythm. To investigate the effect of hippocampal theta oscillations on neocortical networks we recorded multiple single units and LFP in the associative and primary somatosensory (Figure 1A, referred to here as “parietal”) areas or the anterior cingulate and prelimbic divisions of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 28 rats and 11 mice during task performance on an elevated maze and/or REM sleep. The reference theta oscillation signal was always derived from the CA1 pyramidal layer of the dorsal hippocampus (see Figure S1 available online). Network activity in the cortex is organized by the interplay of various classes of principal cells and inhibitory interneurons (Markram, 2006Markram H. The blue brain project.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005Somogyi P. Klausberger T. Defined types of cortical interneurone structure space and spike timing in the hippocampus.J. Physiol. 2005; 562: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Since these two major classes of neurons have different firing rates, circuit and resonant properties and contribute differentially to cortical operations (Beierlein et al., 2000Beierlein M.

Neurosci. 2006; 7: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), experimental identification, and separation of excitatory principal cells and inhibitory neurons are important for studying the effects of afferent signals on neocortical activity. Simultaneous recording of multiple single units in a small neocortical volume allowed us to identify putative principal cells and inhibitory interneurons (Figures 1B and 1C; Barthó et al., 2004Barthó P. Hirase H. Monconduit L. Zugaro M. Harris K.D. Buzsáki G. Characterization of neocortical principal cells and interneurons by network interactions and extracellular features.J.

Influence of the hippocampus on interneurons of the rat prefrontal cortex.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 514-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar; see Supplemental Data). The majority of the recorded neocortical units were classified as putative pyramidal cells (n = 2297, 85% in rats, n = 72, 84% mice) and the minority as putative interneurons (n = 343, 13% in rats; n = 14, 16% in mice). Several statistical methods were used to quantify the significance and magnitude of theta phase-locking of neocortical cells (Figures 2A–2D). Using Rayleigh tests (Figures 2E and 2F; α = 0.05) we found that the percentage of significantly modulated interneurons was higher than that of pyramidal cells in both parietal (32% versus 11%, respectively) and prefrontal cortices (46% versus 28%, respectively). The percentage of both cell types with significant theta phase-locking was significantly higher in PFC than in the parietal area (Figures 2E and 2F), but the fractions of significantly modulated neurons within the parietal subregions were similar (interneurons/pyramidal cells; S1: 33%/10%; posterior associative area [PtA]: 27%/11%). In contrast, the depth of theta modulation (von Mises concentration coefficient) of pyramidal cells was consistently higher than that of the interneurons (Figure S2). Additional analyses, including nonparametric tests, fit of a mixture model and spectral analysis, aimed to control for the assumptions of the Rayleigh test and gave comparable results (Supplemental Data; Figures S2 and S3). The preferred phases of significantly modulated neurons were similarly and broadly distributed for both interneurons and pyramidal cells, with highest density corresponding to the peak/descending phase of the CA1 theta cycle (Figures 2G and 2H). Theta phase-locking of neocortical neurons occurred during both running on the track and REM sleep. Neurons could be significantly phase locked to theta in either one or both of these theta-associated states (Figures 2I–2L). In the subset of significantly modulated neurons that were recorded in both states the preferred phase of theta modulation was correlated across states (Figure 2L; Rcircular = 0.42). On average, the preferred phase of the population was significantly delayed during running compared to during REM in PFC, but not in the parietal cortex (∼75° ; circular anova, p < 10−5 and p > 0.3, respectively; Figures 2K and 2L). Comparable results were obtained in mice (Figure S4). Approximately 60% of putative interneurons (of n = 14 total) and 35% of pyramidal neurons (of n = 72) were significantly (α = 0.05) modulated, with similar theta phase preferences across the population. These findings in rats and mice show that hippocampal theta oscillations impose a detectable phase-modulatory effect on the firing rate of neocortical neurons. Before examining the impact of theta phase on gamma oscillations, we investigated the local origin of gamma activity in the neocortex. First, we estimated the coherence between spike trains of pairs of neurons with sufficiently high firing rates (>5Hz). In a fraction of them (n = 123 pairs, 15% ± 10% of all pairs) significant coherence peaks between 30 and 140 Hz were found (Figure S5). Next, we computed the coherence between unit firing and the LFP recorded at multiple sites of the silicon probe (Figure 3A). Spikes were locked most coherently in a narrow band of a particular gamma frequency to the LFP in a localized cortical volume (Figures 3B–3D, 3F, and S6A–S6C). Spike-LFP coherence in the gamma band was in general, though not always, highest around the soma of the respective unit and decreased with distance (Figures 3D and 3E). Most neurons were phase-locked to the troughs of LFP gamma cycles (Figure 3G). In a related approach, we calculated average spectral power in short (50–100 ms) epochs temporally surrounding the action potentials of single neurons. Similar to coherence analysis, these “spike-triggered” spectra showed strong correlation between the firing of a subset of neurons and the LFP power within specific narrow ranges of gamma frequency oscillations in localized neocortical areas (Figures 3H, 3I, and S6D–S6I). Analysis of spectra at various time lags from the triggering spike showed that increases of the space-frequency localized power were transient, reaching maximum within 0–100 ms from the reference spike (Figure S6). Some data sets contained simultaneously recorded neurons that were phase-locked or correlated with gamma oscillations, which were localized at the same location (putative layer and/or column) and/or frequency (e.g., Figures 3C, 3D, 3H, and 3I), indicating that gamma oscillations with particular localization and/or frequency are associated with the activity of unique groups of neurons. Synchronization of pools of neurons was tentatively associated with transient increases of LFP power at specific locations and narrow gamma frequency bands. Because of volume conduction and the linear summation of different transient gamma oscillations with variable amplitudes and frequencies continuous summation of spectral power in the gamma band may not yield reliable results. Therefore, we devised two alternative approaches. The first approach is based on the monotonous decay of power away from gamma sources. Exploiting our multiple site recordings, a subset of well isolated gamma bursts were detected as local maxima of the spectral power in time, space, and frequency, and the detected events tended to cluster (e.g., Figure 4). The second approach for the detection of gamma bursts is based on the covariance of spectral power in space (between different recording sites) and frequency (between different frequency bins, see Supplemental Data). Briefly, we performed factor analysis (principal component analysis followed by the Varimax rotation of the eigenvectors) of the spectral power in the gamma frequency range (30–150 Hz) seeking basis vectors that most parsimoniously captured the structure of power covariation between different frequency bins at different recording sites (Figures 3H, 3I, and 4D). The end product of this analysis was a set of factors, each of which was characterized by a vector of factor loadings reflecting the contribution of the respective frequency bins and recording sites to spectral power covariations. Projection of the spectra on these factors yielded a time series, termed factor scores, which reflect the strength of a given factor at any moment in time (Figure S7). Each of these factors could correspond to gamma oscillations with a distinct frequency and location pattern, and thus we refer to them as gamma frequency location (gFL) factors, or gFLs. Several (from 0 to 32) gFLs were selected in each session based on explained covariance (Figure 5A). The space-frequency profiles of gFL factor loadings shared many features with those produced by unit-LFP spectral analysis and local maxima analysis. First, the gFL profiles showed a clear peak at a particular frequency and location (Figures 5B–5G). Second, some gFLs from the same recording session had similar frequencies but localized at different locations (Figures 5C, 5E, and 5G), while others displayed gamma oscillations of different frequencies at overlapping locations (Figures 5C, 5D, and 5G). Third, the spatial profiles of gFLs had elevated loading over several hundred micrometers, occasionally showing apparent localization in one cortical layer or a single cortical “column” (e.g., Figures 5C and 5E). Several location-frequency profiles of gFLs closely corresponded to those revealed by the unit-LFP spectral analysis (compare Figures 3C and 3D and Figures 5B and 5C) and local maxima analysis (Figure 4), confirming the validity of the method. We next tested whether neocortical gamma oscillators are modulated by hippocampal theta. First, we found that the strongest theta modulation of neocortical gamma power occurred in a gamma frequency band higher than in the hippocampus (Figure 6A), eliminating volume-conduction of hippocampal gamma to the neocortex as a potential confound. Second, in a subset of fast firing (>15 Hz) putative interneurons, we estimated the strength of unit-LFP gamma coherence at various time leads and lags from the peak of hippocampal theta (Figure 6B) and found maximum coherence on the descending slope of theta. Third, in a subset of experiments, we spatially isolated gamma bursts on the basis of power decay and clustered them in space and frequency (Figures 4D–4F). The probability of gamma bursts in some of these clusters was significantly biased by theta phase (Figure 6C). Although these separate approaches provided firm evidence for the theta phase modulation of neocortical gamma power, each of them had limitations. To overcome these limitations, we analyzed the relationship between the gFL factor score time series (which reflects the instantaneous strength of individual gamma oscillators; Figure S7) and hippocampal theta LFP (Figure 6D) and found significant coherence at theta frequency in a large fraction of the gFLs (e.g., Figure 6E). We also detected discrete times of gamma “burst” occurrence using the local maxima of the continuous gFL score time series. In a large percentage (∼30%) of detected neocortical gFLs we found that gamma bursts were significantly phase modulated by hippocampal theta with the highest incidence near the peak of theta (Figures 6F–6H). High-frequency neocortical gamma bursts (>100 Hz) had stronger theta modulation and theta phase preference at a later phase (∼50°; Figure 6I) than lower-frequency gamma oscillations. As expected from unit analysis, hippocampal gFL-bursts were more likely to be significantly modulated by hippocampal theta than those localized in the neocortex (60% versus 30%; Figure 6G). Because the gFL analysis does not exploit the phase in the LFP signal, it can still be biased by the volume conduction of hippocampal gamma to the neocortex. We performed a number of analyses to rule out the contribution of the volume-conduction (see Supplemental Data). First, we estimated coherence between the gFL score and hippocampal LFP by partializing it by the hippocampal gamma power corresponding to the frequency range of the respective gFL. Approximately 90% of all gFLs (>98% for high frequency gFLs) retained a significant peak in the theta band. Second, for each gFL we computed coherence between the LFP in the center of the gFL-identified spatial gamma profile and at all other sites. The peak coherence occurred at the frequency close to the preferred frequency of the gFL (Figures S8A and S8B), with a spatial profile that matched that of the gFL (Figure 6J), providing a direct phase-synchronization measure of the local neocortical gamma. Next, we computed the integrated gamma LFP-LFP coherence within the gFL preferred frequency band in short sliding windows for the entire session and estimated the coherence between this time series and hippocampal LFP for each pair of recording sites (Figure 6K). The significant peaks at theta frequency revealed theta modulation of gamma synchronization between the LFP in the center of the gFL and spatially contiguous recording sites. If modulation of gamma power in the neocortex was a result of volume conduction of currents from the hippocampus one would expect that theta modulation of LFP-LFP coherence would increase toward hippocampus. However, in most cases the spatial profile of theta modulation of LFP-LFP gamma coherence closely matched that of the gFL and average LFP-LFP gamma coherence (e.g., compare Figure 5D and Figures 6J and 6K). The phase shift between gamma synchronization signal and hippocampal LFP was larger for the fast gamma, consistent with the phase preference analysis of gFL bursts (Figures S8C and S8D). Third, the spatial location of gFLs, the magnitude of theta modulation and the preferred theta phase of gFL-identified gamma bursts were similar between the first and second halves of the recording session (Figure S9), indicating that each gFL score represents the time course of an independent process. Finally, we identified a number of theta modulated gFLs in PFC, where volume-conduction of gamma is not expected due to its distance from the hippocampus. Overall, these findings indicate that hippocampal theta oscillations can exert a significant effect on local computation, represented by location and frequency-specific gamma oscillations, in wide neocortical areas. Theta phase modulation of neocortical unit discharges and gamma activity should be reflected by the membrane potential fluctuations in single neurons. To test this hypothesis, we obtained stable intracellular recordings from deep layer S1 neurons (n = 4) and biocytin-filled pyramidal cells in the mPFC (layer 2 = 1; layer 5 = 15; layer 6 = 7), together with simultaneous LFP recordings from the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer in an additional 27 rats anesthetized by urethane/ketamine-xylazine (Isomura et al., 2006Isomura Y.

Hippocampal theta (3–5 Hz under anesthesia) occurred either spontaneously or was induced by tail pinching. Theta frequency oscillations of the membrane potential occurred transiently in several neocortical neurons.

Meristem activity is controlled by auxin and cytokinin, two hormones whose interactions in determining a specific developmental output are still poorly understood. By means of a comprehensive genetic and molecular analysis in Arabidopsis , we show that a primary cytokinin-response transcription factor, ARR1, activates the gene SHY2/IAA3 ( SHY2 ), a repressor of auxin signaling that negatively regulates the PIN auxin transport facilitator genes: thereby, cytokinin causes auxin redistribution, prompting cell differentiation. Conversely, auxin mediates degradation of the SHY2 protein, sustaining PIN activities and cell division.

To explore the genetic basis of relapse, we performed genome-wide DNA copy number analyses on matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 61 pediatric patients with ALL. The diagnosis and relapse samples typically showed different patterns of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs), with the CNAs acquired at relapse preferentially affecting genes implicated in cell cycle regulation and B cell development. Most relapse samples lacked some of the CNAs present at diagnosis, which suggests that the cells responsible for relapse are ancestral to the primary leukemia cells. Backtracking studies revealed that cells corresponding to the relapse clone were often present as minor subpopulations at diagnosis. These data suggest that genomic abnormalities contributing to ALL relapse are selected for during treatment, and they point to new targets for therapeutic intervention."

However, it remains unclear at and between which processing stages visuospatial attention modulates oscillatory synchronization in the human brain. We thus combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a spatially cued motion discrimination task with source-reconstruction techniques and characterized attentional effects on neuronal synchronization across key stages of the human dorsal visual pathway. We found that visuospatial attention modulated oscillatory synchronization between visual, parietal, and prefrontal cortex in a spatially selective fashion. Furthermore, synchronized activity within these stages was selectively modulated by attention, but with markedly distinct spectral signatures and stimulus dependence between regions. Our data indicate that regionally specific oscillatory synchronization at most stages of the human dorsal visual pathway may enhance the processing of attended visual stimuli and suggest that attentional selection is mediated by frequency-specific synchronization between prefrontal, parietal, and early visual cortex.

When confronted with cluttered visual scenes, visuospatial attention adaptively devotes the brain's processing capacity to the information relevant for the task at hand. It has been suggested that oscillatory synchronization of neuronal activity within and between cortical areas acts as a flexible mechanism of attentional selection by regulating the gain of information transmission between neuronal populations (Engel et al., 2001Engel A.K.

As a consequence, it remains unclear whether visuospatial attention modulates oscillatory synchronization in early visual areas suggested to express the effect of top-down signals on sensory processing (Hopfinger et al., 2000Hopfinger J.B.

Selective visual attention and perceptual coherence.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2006; 10: 38-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In particular, it is unknown whether selective attention has regionally specific effects on oscillatory synchronization within these areas, which might help to strengthen the case for their functional specialization in mediating attentional selection. Furthermore, it is currently not known whether and how selective attention modulates the rhythmic synchronization between frontal, parietal, and early visual regions in the human brain. To address these questions, we combined MEG with novel source-reconstruction techniques. This allowed us to simultaneously investigate oscillatory activity within, and synchronization between, several well-defined cortical regions across the entire human brain. Subjects performed a spatially cued motion discrimination task (Figure 1). Correspondingly, we focused on five key regions involved in visual motion processing and spatial attention: pericalcarine cortex (V1/V2), human motion complex (MT+), ventral and posterior intraparietal sulcus (vIPS and pIPS), and FEF. In all of these regions, attention modulated local oscillatory activity in a spatially selective fashion, but attentional modulations exhibited a remarkably different spectral signature and stimulus dependence between cortical areas. Importantly, the spatial selectivity of attentional modulations allowed for unequivocal dissociation of neural correlates of visuospatial attention from nonspecific processes such as arousal or task preparation. Furthermore, we found that spatial attention also selectively modulated the oscillatory synchronization between MT+, posterior IPS, and FEF in a relatively stimulus-independent fashion. Our data suggest that oscillatory synchronization serves as a mechanism of visuospatial attention along the entire human dorsal visual pathway, including early visual processing stages as well as frontoparietal regions implicated in the control of attention. Our data indicate that the spectral profile of corresponding attentional modulations is not homogenous but varies substantially between regions. Furthermore, our data provide strong evidence that the enhanced routing of attended visual information across processing stages is mediated by frequency-specific synchronization between these regions. We recorded whole-head MEG while subjects (n = 8) performed a spatially cued motion discrimination task (Figure 1). Subjects ignored a stimulus in the uncued hemifield while discriminating the motion direction of a random dot pattern in the cued hemifield. The motion coherence of stimuli was adjusted to the subjects' individual discrimination threshold. Performance was on average 78% correct (SD 3%) at 18% motion coherence (SD 5%) with a median response latency of 1.1 s (SD 0.2 s). We characterized frequency-specific activity at the sensor level by pooling responses within anterior, lateral, and posterior sensors (Figure 2). We observed a brief low (10–20 Hz) and high (70–140 Hz) frequency response to cue presentation followed by a tonic and widespread suppression from about 10 to 50 Hz. Onset of the dynamic random dot stimuli was followed by a transient and then tonic high-frequency response (50–100 Hz) primarily localized at posterior sensors. This high-frequency response was complemented by a strong and widespread decrease of activity below 50 Hz. This characteristic antagonistic spectral profile of responses to visual stimuli closely resembles previous MEG data employing dynamic random dot stimuli presented in the center of the visual field (Donner et al., 2007Donner T.H. Siegel M. Oostenveld R. Fries P. Bauer M. Engel A.K. Population activity in the human dorsal pathway predicts the accuracy of visual motion detection.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 98: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Siegel et al., 2007Siegel M. Donner T.H. Oostenveld R. Fries P. Engel A.K. High-frequency activity in human visual cortex is modulated by visual motion strength.Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Before and during stimulus presentation, attention modulated population activity along the entire dorsal visual pathway in a spatially selective fashion (Figure 3). We estimated neural activity at the cortical source level using a linear spatial filtering technique (“beamforming”; see Experimental Procedures). We separately investigated the stimulation-free delay interval (750–0 ms before stimulus onset), the stimulus interval (100–500 ms after stimulus onset), and four contiguous frequency ranges roughly corresponding to classical EEG bands: 5–15 Hz (“alpha”), 15–35 Hz (“beta”), 35–60 Hz (“low gamma”), and 60–100 Hz (“high gamma”). To isolate spatially selective attention from unspecific effects (such as arousal), we contrasted activity between “attend left” and “attend right” trials. In accordance with previous reports (Thut et al., 2006Thut G. Nietzel A. Brandt S.A. Pascual-Leone A. Alpha-band electroencephalographic activity over occipital cortex indexes visuospatial attention bias and predicts visual target detection.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9494-9502Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, Worden et al., 2000Worden M.S. Foxe J.J. Wang N. Simpson G.V.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2667-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), attention induced a relative suppression of alpha band activity in the hemisphere representing the attended hemifield before stimulus onset. However, in contrast to these reports, we also found widespread attentional baseline suppressions in the beta band and, more surprisingly, in the low (right hemisphere) and high (bilateral) gamma band, specifically around the calcarine. By contrast, in the stimulus interval, we observed an attentional enhancement of low gamma band activity in extrastriate areas, which accords with previous sensor-level data (Gruber et al., 1999Gruber T. Müller M.M. Keil A. Elbert T. Selective visual-spatial attention alters induced gamma band responses in the human EEG.Clin. Neurophysiol. 1999; 110: 2074-2085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, Wyart and Tallon-Baudry, 2008Wyart V. Tallon-Baudry C. Neural dissociation between visual awareness and spatial attention.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2667-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, unlike these reports, during stimulation we observed further attentional modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma bands. These effects were not attributable to phase-locked event-related fields (ERFs), which are also modulated by visuospatial attention (Hillyard and Anllo-Vento, 1998Hillyard S.A. Anllo-Vento L. Event-related brain potentials in the study of visual selective attention.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). We repeated the above analyses after subtracting the average signal components phase locked to cue or stimulus onset, thus removing any ERFs. This analysis yielded results nearly identical to the data described above (see Figure S1 available online). These attentional modulations thus reflect rhythmic neuronal activity not phase locked to external events. Both the spectral signature and stimulus dependence of attentional modulations differed markedly between subsequent processing stages of the dorsal visual pathway. We compared spatially selective attentional effects between five key stages: V1/V2, MT+, vIPS, pIPS, and FEF. For each region of interest (ROI), we computed a predictive index of the focus of attention using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Figure 4) (Green and Swets, 1966Green D.M. Swets J.A. Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics. Wiley, New York1966Google Scholar). Ranging between 0 and 1, this index can be interpreted as the probability of an ideal observer to predict the subject's focus of attention from the hemispheric lateralization of activity on a single trial. Values larger or smaller than 0.5 (chance level) correspond to an attentional enhancement or suppression, respectively. We observed the strongest spectral dissociation in the beta band during stimulation (Figure 4B): while such activity was enhanced in V1/V2, it was suppressed in the FEF (direct comparison between regions: p < 0.01; corrected). We observed further strong regional differences: during the delay interval (Figure 4A), attention suppressed beta band activity in the IPS but not in V1/V2 (direct comparison: p < 0.01; corrected). By contrast, high gamma band activity was suppressed in V1/V2, but not in pIPS and FEF (direct comparisons: p < 0.01; corrected). During stimulus presentation (Figure 4B), we found an enhancement of beta band activity specifically in V1/V2, while vIPS and pIPS showed predominantly an increase of gamma band activity (direct comparisons: p < 0.01; corrected). Furthermore, alpha band activity was suppressed in pIPS, but not in FEF and V1/V2 (direct comparisons: p < 0.01; corrected). The comparison of attentional effects between the delay and stimulus intervals revealed a remarkable difference in the stimulus dependence of these effects between posterior and frontal regions. V1/V2, MT+, vIPS, and pIPS showed a strong stimulus dependence with even opposite significant attentional modulations before and during stimulation (direct comparisons between intervals: p < 0.01 for all of these regions and bands; corrected). By contrast, in the FEF we found no stimulus dependence with the same attentional beta band suppression in both intervals (direct comparisons: p > 0.1 for all bands). A direct comparison revealed significantly lower stimulus dependence in FEF than in the four posterior regions (p < 0.001; corrected). Thus, attentional modulation was strongly stimulus dependent in V1/V2, MT+, and the IPS, as predicted for brain areas expressing the effect of attention. By contrast, attentional modulation was stimulus independent in the FEF, as predicted for a region controlling the deployment of attention. These effects were remarkably consistent across individuals. We repeated the above ROC analysis for the two strongest attentional modulations in the high- and low-frequency range during the delay (alpha band: pIPS; gamma band: V1/V2) and stimulus (beta band: V1/V2; gamma band: pIPS) interval as well as the stimulus-independent beta band effect in FEF (Figure 5). All of these effects were consistently observed in individual subjects, with many effects being statistically significant even on the single-subject level. We also consistently observed the dissociation of the spectral pattern and stimulus dependence of attentional modulations in individual subjects. For the spectral dissociation, 86% of the single-subject comparisons between regions showed the same sign of difference as the group-level comparison. 46% of these consistent interregional differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05) even on the single-subject level. The stimulus dependence showed a similar consistency: 86% of the temporal comparisons that showed a significant stimulus dependence on the group level (V1/V2, MT+, vIPS, and pIPS) displayed the same sign of difference for single subjects. 62% of these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for individual subjects. Furthermore, we found a significantly lower stimulus dependence in FEF compared to the posterior regions in 63% of the direct comparisons on the single-subject level (p < 0.05). In sum, most of the effects observed at the group level were also statistically significant on the single-subject level. The temporal evolution of attentional modulations resembled the sustained maintenance of covert attention on the peripheral target location. We focused on V1/V2 and vIPS, which showed the strongest effects of attention. During the cue interval, there was a transient but strongly lateralized response from about 100–400 ms post cue onset (Figure 6). This transient could reflect lateralized stimulus responses to the cue (presented at 0.4 deg to the right or left from fixation), the attention shift, or both. This transient was followed by tonic attentional modulations up to stimulus onset that matched those effects observed for the fixed delay interval analyzed above. These tonic baseline modulations were statistically significant (p < 0.05; corrected) in the alpha band for V1/V2 and vIPS and in the beta band for vIPS. During stimulus presentation, we found that attentional modulations evolved about 100 ms post stimulus onset and were again tonically sustained up to the behavioral response. For the stimulus interval, we found statistically significant tonic modulations in the low and high gamma band in vIPS (p < 0.05; corrected). If the reported modulations of oscillatory activity are functionally relevant for the enhanced processing of attended visual information, their strength should be correlated with behavioral performance. We thus tested, for those intervals, ROIs, and frequency bands that showed significant attentional modulations (see Figure 4), whether these were stronger before correct than before incorrect behavioral responses. Indeed, we found a significant behavioral effect for several attentional modulations: the strength of alpha band suppression in MT+, vIPS, and pIPS during the delay interval as well as the strength of high gamma band enhancement in pIPS during the stimulus interval significantly predicted the correctness of the behavioral response (p < 0.01). In other words, the stronger these spatially selective attentional modulations were on a given trial, the more likely the subjects would successfully complete that trial. Thus, in support of a functional relevance, the lateralization of oscillatory activity along the dorsal stream allowed for predicting not only the focus of attention but also the subjects' behavioral discrimination performance. It has been proposed that attention flexibly routes relevant sensory signals through the cortical hierarchy by selectively modulating the synchronization between the corresponding neuronal groups across different cortical processing stages (Fries, 2005Fries P. A mechanism for cognitive dynamics: neuronal communication through neuronal coherence.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2005; 9: 474-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar). We predicted that this should be reflected in a spatially selective modulation of the interregional phase coherence (see Experimental Procedures), specifically between areas MT+, pIPS, and the FEF. Selecting these relatively distant (>37 mm) regions allowed for probing synchronization between the key processing stages involved in the spatially cued motion discrimination task (Sapir et al., 2005Sapir A. d'Avossa G. McAvoy M. Shulman G.L. Corbetta M. Brain signals for spatial attention predict performance in a motion discrimination task.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 17810-17815Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) while minimizing confounding effects of volume conduction between nearby areas. We estimated the coherence between these regions at the cortical source level (see Experimental Procedures) and isolated spatially selective effects of attention by contrasting coherence in the hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the attended hemifield. Across all bands and both intervals, we found significant spatially selective attentional modulations of interregional synchronization between each pair of ROIs (Figure 7). Attention enhanced high-frequency synchronization (35–100 Hz) in the hemisphere contralateral to the attended hemifield, while in the low frequency range (5–35 Hz), we found a relative decrease of synchronization. Importantly, this antagonistic pattern was expressed both in the absence and in the presence of the visual stimulus, closely resembling an attentional control mechanism. Overall, 6 out of the 8 significant modulations were consistent across intervals. In particular, synchronization between MT+ and pIPS showed the most significant attentional effects that were all consistent across intervals. These effects were spatially specific and could not be explained by a spatial distance confound. For each ROI pair, we performed a control analysis testing for an attentional effect between these two ROIs and a third control ROI placed at equal mutual distance (see Experimental Procedures). There was no significant attentional effect on interregional synchronization for any of these control analyses (p > 0.05). Taken together, these results show that visuospatial attention modulates frequency-specific neuronal synchronization between MT+, pIPS, and FEF in a spatially selective fashion. We have characterized the modulation of local population activity and interregional synchronization by visuospatial attention in the human dorsal visual pathway during a spatially cued motion discrimination task. Before and during visual stimulation, attention modulated local population activity along the entire dorsal visual pathway in a spatially selective manner. Attentional effects were tonically sustained throughout the delay and stimulus intervals and were consistently observed in individual subjects, and their strength predicted subjects' behavioral performance on single trials. The spectral signature and stimulus dependence of attentional effects differed markedly between visual, parietal, and frontal cortex. While attentional modulations were strongly stimulus dependent in V1/V2, MT+, and IPS, they were relatively stimulus independent in the FEF. Spatial attention also selectively modulated the coherence between areas MT+, pIPS, and the FEF in different frequency ranges in a relatively stimulus-independent fashion. The present data show at which processing stages of the human dorsal visual pathway visuospatial attention modulates the rhythmic patterning of neuronal activity. Previous studies have shown enhancement of gamma band activity and suppression of alpha band activity by visuospatial attention in macaque areas V4 and LIP (Fries et al., 2001Fries P. Reynolds J.H.

We investigated gray matter morphometry and white matter anisotropy in CRPS patients and matched controls. Patients exhibited a disrupted relationship between white matter anisotropy and whole-brain gray matter volume; gray matter atrophy in a single cluster encompassing right insula, right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and right nucleus accumbens; and a decrease in fractional anisotropy in the left cingulum-callosal bundle. Reorganization of white matter connectivity in these regions was characterized by branching pattern alterations, as well as increased (VMPFC to insula) and decreased (VMPFC to basal ganglion) connectivity. While regional atrophy differentially related to pain intensity and duration, the strength of connectivity between specific atrophied regions related to anxiety. These abnormalities encompass emotional, autonomic, and pain perception regions, implying that they likely play a critical role in the global clinical picture of CRPS."

Therefore, it is important to understand how cells precisely regulate the availability of IUPs. We observed that regulation of transcript clearance, proteolytic degradation, and translational rate contribute to controlling the abundance of IUPs, some of which are present in low amounts and for short periods of time. Abundant phosphorylation and low stochasticity in transcription and translation indicate that the availability of IUPs can be finely tuned. Fidelity in signaling may require that most IUPs be available in appropriate amounts and not present longer than needed."

Transcription factors such as PU.1 (also known as Sfpi1) and C/EBPalpha (Cebpa) have general roles in myelomonocytic development, but the transcriptional basis for producing tissue macrophage subsets remains unknown. Here we show that Spi-C (encoded by Spic), a PU.1-related transcription factor, selectively controls the development of red pulp macrophages. Spi-C is highly expressed in red pulp macrophages, but not monocytes, dendritic cells or other tissue macrophages. Spic(-/-) mice have a cell-autonomous defect in the development of red pulp macrophages that is corrected by retroviral Spi-C expression in bone marrow cells, but have normal monocyte and other macrophage subsets. Red pulp macrophages highly express genes involved in capturing circulating haemoglobin and in iron regulation. Spic(-/-) mice show normal trapping of red blood cells in the spleen, but fail to phagocytose these red blood cells efficiently, and develop an iron overload localized selectively to splenic red pulp. Thus, Spi-C controls development of red pulp macrophages required for red blood cell recycling and iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2044221124,"Daily sleep cycles in humans are driven by a complex circuit within which GABAergic sleep-promoting neurons oppose arousal. Drosophila sleep has recently been shown to be controlled by GABA, which acts on unknown cells expressing the Rdl GABAA receptor. We identify here the relevant Rdl-containing cells as PDF-expressing small and large ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) of the circadian clock. LNv activity regulates total sleep as well as the rate of sleep onset; both large and small LNvs are part of the sleep circuit. Flies mutant for pdf or its receptor are hypersomnolent, and PDF acts on the LNvs themselves to control sleep. These features of the Drosophila sleep circuit, GABAergic control of onset and maintenance as well as peptidergic control of arousal, support the idea that features of sleep-circuit architecture as well as the mechanisms governing the behavioral transitions between sleep and wake are conserved between mammals and insects."

We found that VopS could act to covalently modify a conserved threonine residue on Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 with adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP). The resulting AMPylation prevented the interaction of Rho GTPases with downstream effectors, thereby inhibiting actin assembly in the infected cell. Eukaryotic proteins were also directly modified with AMP, potentially expanding the repertoire of posttranslational modifications for molecular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2080428182,"Neuronal activity-regulated gene expression has been suggested to be an important mediator of long-lasting, experience-dependent changes in the nervous system, but the activity-dependent component of gene transcription has never been selectively isolated and tested for its functional significance. Here, we demonstrate that introduction of a subtle knockin mutation into the mouse Bdnf gene that blocks the ability of the activity-regulated factor CREB to bind Bdnf promoter IV results in an animal in which the sensory experience-dependent induction of Bdnf expression is disrupted in the cortex. Neurons from these animals form fewer inhibitory synapses, have fewer spontaneous inhibitory quantal events, and exhibit reduced expression of inhibitory presynaptic markers in the cortex. These results indicate a specific requirement for activity-dependent Bdnf expression in the development of inhibition in the cortex and demonstrate that the activation of gene expression in response to experience-driven neuronal activity has important biological consequences in the nervous system."

Although the mechanisms leading to these declines are generally well known, the consequences for the aquatic biota have not yet been reported. By examining crustacean zooplankton remains preserved in lake sediment cores, we document near extirpations of calcium-rich Daphnia species, which are keystone herbivores in pelagic food webs, concurrent with declining lake-water calcium. A large proportion (62%, 47 to 81% by region) of the Canadian Shield lakes we examined has a calcium concentration approaching or below the threshold at which laboratory Daphnia populations suffer reduced survival and fecundity.

https://openalex.org/W2057135010,"Mechanistic studies of CNS myelination have been hindered by the lack of a rapidly myelinating culture system. Here, we describe a versatile CNS coculture method that allows time-lapse microscopy and molecular analysis of distinct stages of myelination. Employing a culture architecture of reaggregated neurons fosters extension of dense beds of axons from purified retinal ganglion cells. Seeding of oligodendrocyte precursor cells on these axons results in differentiation and ensheathment in as few as 3 days, with generation of compact myelin within 6 days. This technique enabled (1) the demonstration that oligodendrocytes initiate new myelin segments only during a brief window early in their differentiation, (2) identification of a contribution of astrocytes to the rate of myelin wrapping, and (3) molecular dissection of the role of oligodendrocyte gamma-secretase activity in controlling the ensheathment of axons. These insights illustrate the value of this defined system for investigating multiple aspects of CNS myelination."
https://openalex.org/W2057322831,"A well preserved 220-million-year-old fossil from marine deposits of the Late Triassic of Guizhou in southwest China sheds light on the intermediate steps in the acquisition of the unique turtle body-plan. Transitional forms are scarce in this lineage, making this transition one of the mysteries of reptile evolution. The find is the most primitive turtle known. It has a fully developed plastron, the ventral dermal armour, evolved before the carapace, the dorsal (upper) part of the shell structure. In this fossil the carapace consists of neural plates only. This suggest that the carapace developed via ossification of the neural plates and broadening of the ribs — a sequence that echoes the developmental pattern in young turtles today. 220-million-year-old fossils from southwestern China represent the most primitive turtle known, and shed light on intermediate steps in the acquisition of the unique and highly specialized turtle body-plan. The origin of the turtle body plan remains one of the great mysteries of reptile evolution. The anatomy of turtles is highly derived, which renders it difficult to establish the relationships of turtles with other groups of reptiles. The oldest known turtle, Proganochelys from the Late Triassic period of Germany1, has a fully formed shell and offers no clue as to its origin. Here we describe a new 220-million-year-old turtle from China, somewhat older than Proganochelys, that documents an intermediate step in the evolution of the shell and associated structures. A ventral plastron is fully developed, but the dorsal carapace consists of neural plates only. The dorsal ribs are expanded, and osteoderms are absent. The new species shows that the plastron evolved before the carapace and that the first step of carapace formation is the ossification of the neural plates coupled with a broadening of the ribs. This corresponds to early embryonic stages of carapace formation in extant turtles, and shows that the turtle shell is not derived from a fusion of osteoderms. Phylogenetic analysis places the new species basal to all known turtles, fossil and extant. The marine deposits that yielded the fossils indicate that this primitive turtle inhabited marginal areas of the sea or river deltas."
https://openalex.org/W2055230688,"Drugs activating 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) potently suppress appetite, but the underlying mechanisms for these effects are not fully understood. To tackle this issue, we generated mice with global 5-HT2CR deficiency (2C null) and mice with 5-HT2CRs re-expression only in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons (2C/POMC mice). We show that 2C null mice predictably developed hyperphagia, hyperactivity, and obesity and showed attenuated responses to anorexigenic 5-HT drugs. Remarkably, all these deficiencies were normalized in 2C/POMC mice. These results demonstrate that 5-HT2CR expression solely in POMC neurons is sufficient to mediate effects of serotoninergic compounds on food intake. The findings also highlight the physiological relevance of the 5-HT2CR-melanocortin circuitry in the long-term regulation of energy balance."
https://openalex.org/W2009299837,"As a major output station of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) projects to the thalamus and brainstem nuclei thereby controlling motor behavior. A less well known fact is that the GPi also projects to the lateral habenula (LHb) which is often associated with the limbic system. Using the monkey performing a saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes, we found that antidromically identified LHb-projecting neurons were distributed mainly in the dorsal and ventral borders of the GPi and that their activity was strongly modulated by expected reward outcomes. A majority of them were excited by the no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by the reward-predicting target. These reward-dependent modulations were similar to those in LHb neurons but started earlier than those in LHb neurons. These results suggest that GPi may initiate reward-related signals through its effects on the LHb, which then influences the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.

These results suggest that GPi may initiate reward-related signals through its effects on the LHb, which then influences the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. The internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) is the final output station of the basal ganglia through which body movements are controlled (DeLong, 1971DeLong M.R. Activity of pallidal neurons during movement.J. Neurophysiol. 1971; 34: 414-427PubMed Google Scholar). The GPi projects to the motor part of the thalamus which is mutually connected with the motor and premotor cortices and to subcortical motor structures such as the pedunculopontine nucleus (Parent et al., 1999Parent M. Levesque M. Parent A. The pallidofugal projection system in primates: evidence for neurons branching ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the thalamus and brainstem.J. Chem. Neuroanat. 1999; 16: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The former pathway may control learned body movements and the latter pathway may control innate movements. Indeed, lesions of the GPi lead to a variety of movement disorders including slowing of movements (Horak and Anderson, 1984Horak F.B. Anderson M.E.

Many GPi neurons change their activity when animals or humans move particular parts of their body (DeLong et al., 1985DeLong M.R. Crutcher M.D. Georgopoulos A.P. Primate globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus: functional organization.J. Neurophysiol. 1985; 53: 530-543PubMed Google Scholar, Iansek and Porter, 1980Iansek R. Porter R. The monkey globus pallidus: neuronal discharge properties in relation to movement.J. Physiol. 1980; 301: 439-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In short, the GPi is instrumental for the basal ganglia to control body movements. One less-well-known fact is that the GPi also projects to the lateral habenula (LHb), a small nucleus located above the thalamus at its posterior end close to the midline (Lecourtier and Kelly, 2007Lecourtier L. Kelly P.H. A conductor hidden in the orchestra? Role of the habenular complex in monoamine transmission and cognition.Neurosci Biobehav. Rev. 2007; 31: 658-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This is puzzling given the dominant motor role of the GPi. However, recent studies have shown that many neurons in the basal ganglia encode nonmotor signals, especially in relation to expected rewards (Hikosaka et al., 2006Hikosaka O. Nakamura K. Nakahara H. Basal Ganglia orient eyes to reward.J. Neurophysiol. 2006; 95: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the projection from the GPi to the LHb might be a key to link the basal ganglia and the limbic system providing reward-related information. Indeed, a recent study from our laboratory has shown that the LHb neurons in monkeys are excited by a visual stimulus that indicates absence of reward and inhibited by a stimulus that indicates presence of reward (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). This negative reward signal may contribute to the well-known reward coding of dopamine neurons (Christoph et al., 1986Christoph G.R. Leonzio R.J. Wilcox K.S. Stimulation of the lateral habenula inhibits dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of the rat.J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 613-619PubMed Google Scholar, Ji and Shepard, 2007Ji H. Shepard P.D.

Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the GPi is a source of reward-related information in the LHb, we used the antidromic stimulation method to identify GPi neurons that projected to the LHb. The activity of theses neurons was then examined while the monkey was performing a visually guided saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes. The results showed that LHb-projecting neurons were located mainly at the borders of the GPi, had firing patterns different from movement-related GPi neurons, and they changed their activity in relation to expected rewards. We identified LHb-projecting neurons by their antidromic activation from the LHb (Figure 1) using two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), D and N. In each experiment we positioned the first electrode at the LHb and made sure that its tip was within the LHb by recording multi-unit activity related to rewards, as described in Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar. We then lowered a second electrode from the putamen to the GP on the same side as the LHb being recorded, while applying biphasic (negative-positive) pulses of electric currents through the LHb electrode periodically (every 0.5 s). When an antidromically activated neuron was found, the monkey was asked to perform one-direction-rewarded task (1DR; Figure 2A). In the task, a visual target was presented randomly on the left or right, and the monkey had to make a saccade to it immediately. Correct saccades were signaled by a tone stimulus after the saccade. Saccades to one position were rewarded, whereas saccades to the other position were not rewarded. Thus, the target instructed the saccade direction and also indicated the presence or absence of the upcoming reward. The rewarded position was the same in a block of 24 consecutive trials and was then changed to the other position abruptly for the next block with no external instruction. Both monkeys showed significantly shorter saccade latencies in rewarded trials than in unrewarded trials (Figure 2B) indicating that they understood the position-reward contingencies. A total of 74 GPi neurons were activated antidromically from the LHb. The antidromic latency ranged from 1.3 to 6.8 ms (2.6 ± 1.0 ms, mean ± SD, see Figures S4A–S4C available online). The antidromic collisions occurred with a mean latency of 3.2 ± 1.1 ms. The threshold current used for antidromic activation ranged from 5 to 260 μA (115 ± 68 μA, see Figures S4D–S4F). Figure 1D shows the LHb stimulating site where an electrode track is visible in the LHb. Antidromically activated neurons were found usually at the border between the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) and the GPi and the ventral border of the GPi (Figure S3). As the electrode was advanced, the characteristic activity of GPe neurons (high-frequency tonic firing and occasional pauses) faded and then the characteristic activity of GPi neurons (high-frequency tonic firing with no pause) grew larger. In this relatively quiet GPe-GPi border region antidromically activated neurons were found, often in a cluster of 2–3 neurons. A second group of antidromically activated neurons were found at the ventral border of the GPi where the characteristic GPi neurons became sparse. In the following we will call these antidromically activated neurons “LHb-projecting GPi neurons.” To verify the location, we made electrolytic microlesions at the recording sites of LHb-projecting GPi neurons. Two electrolytic microlesion sites are visible in Figure 1C along the bottom of the three electrode penetrations: one being at the GPe-GPi border (anatomically called the internal medullary lamina) and the other in the middle of the GPi which corresponds to a structure called the accessory medullary lamina. Other LHb-projecting neurons were also located in the internal medullary lamina, which are visible in adjacent sections (Figure S2). None of the LHb-projecting neurons were found at the border between the putamen and the GPe, a region called the external medullary lamina. We found that the LHb-projecting neurons were electrophysiologically different from other GPi neurons that were not activated antidromically and were presumed to be related to body movements (see Supplementary Note A). The LHb-projecting GPi neurons had a mean baseline firing rate of 33 ± 20 spikes/s, which is lower than that of the presumed motor GPi neurons (77 ± 16 spikes/s, see Supplemental Data; p < 0.01, ANOVA). The duration of spikes of the LHb-projecting GPi neurons, defined as the time interval between the first and second negative peaks of the spike, was generally longer (0.55 ± 0.1 ms; purple waveforms in Figure 1B) than that of the motor GPi neurons (0.46 ± 0.04 ms; black waveforms in Figure 1B; p < 0.01, ANOVA). About two-thirds of LHb-projecting GPi neurons (49/74, 66%) showed significant modulations of their firing rate after the onset of the target. One example is shown in Figure 3A. The neuron increased its activity phasically after the appearance of the saccade target indicating the absence of upcoming reward and decreased after the appearance of the target indicating the presence of upcoming reward. The increase and decrease depended on the reward contingency, regardless of target position. We call this type of modulation “reward negative type.” This neuron was antidromically activated (Figure 3C) from the LHb where we recorded the multiunit activity shown in Figure 3B. Interestingly, neurons in the LHb where the stimulation was applied showed similar reward-related changes in activity (Figure 3B). For both the GPi neuron and the LHb multiunit, the responses to the target were phasic and did not continue until the outcome (reward or no reward) and their responses to the outcome were weak, if any. There were also LHb-projecting GPi neurons that responded in an opposite manner to the one described above, increasing their activity in response to the reward-predicting target and decreasing to the no-reward-predicting target. We call this “reward positive type.” One example is shown in Figure 4A. This neuron's response to the reward-predicting target grew slowly and ended slowly after the outcome. Some of the LHb-projecting GPi neurons responded to the target differentially depending on its direction, as shown in Figure 4B. This neuron was similar to the one in Figure 3A, but the excitation by the no-reward-predicting target occurred only when the target was presented on the ipsilateral side to the recording site. Do the LHb-projecting GPi neurons and the LHb neurons encode expected reward and target positions differently? Figure 5 suggests an answer to this question. Here we plotted, for each neuron, the difference of response to the target between rewarded and unrewarded trials (abscissa) and contralateral and ipsilateral trials (ordinate), separately for the GPi neurons (Figure 5A) and the LHb multiunits (Figure 5B; see Figure S5 for single-unit LHb data). For both the GPi neurons and the LHb neurons, reward-dependent activity modulation was larger than position-dependent modulation, but more so among the LHb neurons. The reward-dependent modulation was negative for some GPi neurons (as shown in Figure 3A) and positive for other GPi neurons (as shown in Figure 4A). In contrast, the reward-dependent modulation was exclusively negative for the LHb neurons. To test this impression, we performed two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (target position [contralateral versus ipsilateral] × reward contingency [reward versus no reward]) for each neuron. Of the 74 LHb-projecting GPi neurons, 29 neurons showed a reward-only modulation (red dots in Figure 5A; main effect of reward contingency, p < 0.01), 20 neurons also showed direction related modulation on top of reward modulation (green dots; main effect of both reward contingency and target position, p < 0.01), and 5 neurons showed a direction-only modulation (blue dots; main effect of target position). About one-fourth of the LHb-projecting GPi neurons (n = 20) did not show any significant modulation to either reward or position (yellow dots). In contrast, LHb neurons were predominantly modulated by reward contingency only (n = 26, red dots in Figure 5B) or by both reward and position (n = 7, green dots). To further characterize the reward-related property of the LHb-projecting GPi neurons, we categorized them into three groups, namely, (1) negative type, represented by the red and green dots on the left side of Figure 5A, (2) positive type, represented by the red and green dots on the right side of Figure 5A, and (3) reward-unrelated type, represented by the yellow and blue dots in Figure 5A. Figures 6A and 6B show the population average spike density functions of the negative and positive groups, respectively. The negative type GPi neurons (n = 37, 50%), as a majority, responded with a phasic increase of firing after the onset of the no-reward-predicting target, and with a phasic decrease of firing after the onset of the reward-predicting target (ANOVA, p < 0.01; Figure 6A). Both responses were phasic and did not continue until the reward outcome. Thus, the response pattern of the negative type GPi neurons was very similar to that of the LHb neurons (Figure 6C). The positive type GPi neurons (n = 12, 16%) acted in an opposite manner, increasing their firing rate after the reward-predicting target and decreasing after the no reward-predicting target (ANOVA, p < 0.01; Figure 6B). The increasing response to the reward-predicting target continued until the reward delivery, as seen in the example neuron shown in Figure 4A. A close examination revealed that the activity of the GPi neurons reflected reward prediction error. Note that during the 1DR task the reward outcome was predictable by the position of the target, except for the first trial of a new block where the position-reward contingency reversed. As represented by the thick blue and red lines in Figure 6A, the negative type GPi neurons showed no responses to the outcome, except for the first trial (thin blue and red lines in Figure 6A). The thin blue line indicates the neuronal activity when the monkey had been expecting a reward (as indicated by a decrease in activity after target onset in Figure 6A), but there was no reward unexpectedly (as indicated by an increase in activity after the outcome). The thin red line indicates the neuronal activity when the monkey had been expecting no reward (as indicated by an increase in activity after target onset), but there was a reward unexpectedly (as indicated by a decrease in activity after the outcome). Similar reward prediction-related activity changes were observed in the LHb neurons (Figure 6C). A further analysis of within-block neural changes is presented in the next section. The antidromic activation of GPi neurons from the LHb suggests that the GPi neurons project their axons to the LHb and possibly have synaptic contacts with LHb neurons. However, it does not necessarily indicate that the activity changes in the LHb neurons were initiated by the inputs from the GPi. To investigate this issue, we examined the latency at which each of the three groups of neurons started differentiating their activity depending on the expected reward outcome (see Experimental Procedures for details). Figure 6D shows the percentage of the negative type GPi neurons that discriminated the reward/no-reward contingency after target onset. The percentage increased abruptly and exceeded the criterion level of significance (indicated by gray line, p = 0.01) at 115 ms after target onset. The discrimination latency for the positive type GPi neurons was 163 ms (Figure 6E). The discrimination latency for the LHb neurons was 135 ms (Figure 6F). These results suggest that the negative type GPi neurons, but not the positive type GPi neurons, could initiate the reward-related activity in LHb neurons. This also means that the negative type neurons may have an excitatory influence on the LHb (see Discussion). The changes of neural and the corresponding behavioral responses within a block were examined. Figures 7A and 7B show the neural responses after the change of the position-reward contingency in different groups of LHb-projecting GPi neurons (upper four rows) and LHb neurons (fifth row). The reward-negative GPi neurons and LHb neurons showed similar patterns of within-block changes. The similarity includes the post-reward delivery response, where the neurons showed differential responses depending on the presence or absence of reward only on the first trial in a block. This demonstrates that these neurons encode reward prediction error. The reward-positive group showed the opposite pattern of posttarget response changes, but with no clear first-trial-specific postreward responses. The null group also showed some postreward responses as the reward-positive neurons, suggesting that the null group may also play some yet unspecified roles. Figure 7C shows the changes of saccadic latency toward the target. We have shown that LHb-projecting GPi neurons changed their activity differentially depending on the expected reward. Their activity was sometimes differential for the direction of the saccade target, but such changes were smaller than their pronounced reward-related activity. The LHb-projecting GPi neurons were different from other GPi neurons in that their firing rates were lower, their spike durations were longer, and they were located peripherally in the GPi. The recording sites were exactly as expected from a series of anatomical studies on the monkey conducted by Parent and his colleagues (Parent et al., 2001Parent M. Levesque M. Parent A. Two types of projection neurons in the internal pallidum of primates: single-axon tracing and three-dimensional reconstruction.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the LHb-projecting neurons are a distinct group of GPi neurons, as suggested anatomically (Parent et al., 2001Parent M. Levesque M. Parent A. Two types of projection neurons in the internal pallidum of primates: single-axon tracing and three-dimensional reconstruction.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These properties of the LHb-projecting GPi neurons appear similar to “border cells” described by DeLong and his colleagues (DeLong, 1971DeLong M.R. Activity of pallidal neurons during movement.J. Neurophysiol. 1971; 34: 414-427PubMed Google Scholar, Richardson and DeLong, 1991Richardson R.T. DeLong M.R. Electrophysiological studies of the functions of the nucleus basalis in primates.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 295: 233-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), so called because they were found at the border of the GP. The border cells tended to be activated by the delivery of rewards (as we saw in the LHb-projecting GPi neurons) or aversive air puffs. However, these authors interpreted the border cells as part of the nucleus basalis of Meynert which projects to the cerebral cortex (Richardson and DeLong, 1991Richardson R.T. DeLong M.R. Electrophysiological studies of the functions of the nucleus basalis in primates.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 295: 233-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The border cells were examined further in subsequent studies, especially in relation to dopaminergic denervation (Tremblay et al., 1989Tremblay L. Filion M. Bedard P.J. Responses of pallidal neurons to striatal stimulation in monkeys with MPTP-induced parkinsonism.Brain Res. 1989; 498: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). While the relationship of the border cells with the LHb is unknown, we speculate that at least a subset of these neurons correspond to the LHb-projecting GPi neurons examined here. Another line of evidence for the reward processing in the GP came from a series of studies showing that some GPi neurons are sensitive to glucose and change their activity in relation to consummatory behavior (Karadi et al., 1995Karadi Z. Faludi B. Lenard L. Czurko A. Niedetzky C. Vida I. Nishino H. Glucose-sensitive neurons of the globus pallidus: II. Complex functional attributes.Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 37: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Such glucose-sensitive neurons were found in the ventromedial and rostral part of the GPi in the rat and monkey, which roughly matches the location of LHb-projecting neurons. According to Parent et al., 2001Parent M. Levesque M. Parent A. Two types of projection neurons in the internal pallidum of primates: single-axon tracing and three-dimensional reconstruction.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 439: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, LHb-projecting neurons constitute about 10% of the total number of neurons in the GPi. Would such a minority of GPi neurons play a significant role in controlling behavior? There are at least two lines of research that may support this view. First, human patients with pallidal lesions often show nonmotor symptoms, although the most common symptoms are movement disorders.

Second, human brain imaging studies have shown that the GPi is related to reward processing. They report that the ventral striatum (especially the nucleus accumbens) and the dorsal striatum (Knutson and Cooper, 2005Knutson B. Cooper J.C. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of reward prediction.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2005; 18: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) are commonly activated by expected rewards. In many cases, however, the GPi was also activated (Calder et al., 2007Calder A.J. Beaver J.D. Davis M.H. van Ditzhuijzen J. Keane J. Lawrence A.D.

These motivation- or reward-related observations on the human GP might reflect changes in the state of the LHb-projecting GPi neurons. If this is true, how might the LHb-projecting GPi neurons participate in controlling behaviors? We found that there are at least two types of neurons in relation to reward: one negative type (excited by no-reward-indicating targets and inhibited by reward-indicating targets) and the other, positive type (excited by reward-indicating targets and inhibited by no-reward-indicating targets). The response pattern of the negative type GPi neurons was similar to that of the LHb neurons (Figures 6A and 6C) and more critically, the responses to the target started earlier in the negative type GPi neurons than in the LHb neurons. The similarity between the two groups of neurons extends to the responses to the reward prediction error: they were excited by the unexpected absence of reward (i.e., on the first trial after the position-reward contingency), but not by the expected absence of reward, and were inhibited by the unexpected presence of reward. These data, showing the two groups of neurons having similar phase of activation even at the first trial of a block, are consistent with the idea that the negative type GPi neurons have excitatory connections to LHb neurons. In contrast, the positive type GPi neurons started showing reward sensitivity later than that of LHb neurons and did not clearly encode reward prediction error. They are thus unlikely to initiate the reward-related responses in LHb neurons but could contribute to the later part of the LHb responses. The suggested excitatory GPi-LHb connection in this study is somewhat puzzling, because a general consensus seems to be that this connection is GABAergic and inhibitory, in the same way as the other GPi efferents are (Vincent et al., 1982Vincent S.R. Kimura H. McGeer E.G. A histochemical study of GABA-transaminase in the efferents of the pallidum.Brain Res. 1982; 241: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the excitatory connection is mediated by acetylcholine, as the LHb receives input from the cholinergic nucleus basalis of Meynert and ventrolateral septum (Herkenham and Nauta, 1977Herkenham M. Nauta W.J. Afferent connections of the habenular nuclei in the rat. A horseradish peroxidase study, with a note on the fiber-of-passage problem.J. Comp. Neurol. 1977; 173: 123-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that some of the LHb-projecting neurons in the rostral part of the entopeduncular nucleus (the GPi counter part of the rat) are cholinergic (Moriizumi and Hattori, 1992Moriizumi T. Hattori T. Choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons in the rat entopeduncular nucleus.Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2015557224,"When sufficient force is applied to a glassy polymer, it begins to deform through movement of the polymer chains. We used an optical photobleaching technique to quantitatively measure changes in molecular mobility during the active deformation of a polymer glass [poly(methyl methacrylate)]. Segmental mobility increases by up to a factor of 1000 during uniaxial tensile creep. Although the Eyring model can describe the increase in mobility at low stress, it fails to describe mobility after flow onset. In this regime, mobility is strongly accelerated and the distribution of relaxation times narrows substantially, indicating a more homogeneous ensemble of local environments. At even larger stresses, in the strain-hardening regime, mobility decreases with increasing stress. Consistent with the view that stress-induced mobility allows plastic flow in polymer glasses, we observed a strong correlation between strain rate and segmental mobility during creep."

On the basis of laboratory measurements, we show that molten carbonates have electrical conductivities that are three orders of magnitude higher than those of molten silicate and five orders of magnitude higher than those of hydrated olivine. High conductivities in the asthenosphere probably indicate the presence of small amounts of carbonate melt in peridotite and can therefore be interpreted in terms of carbon concentration in the upper mantle. We show that the conductivity of the oceanic asthenosphere can be explained by 0.1 volume percent of carbonatite melts on average, which agrees with the carbon dioxide content of mid-ocean ridge basalts."

https://openalex.org/W2024900249,"Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (Ncor1) is an activator for the enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) that is required for embryogenesis, but its physiological functions are unknown. Now experiments in knock-out mice lacking Ncor1 show that disruption of the Ncor1–Hdac3 interaction causes aberrant regulation of clock genes and results in abnormal circadian behaviour — with a sleep–wake cycle closer to 23 hours than the normal 24. These mice are also leaner than normal and more insulin sensitive as a result of increased energy expenditure. Loss of a functional Ncor1–Hdac3 complex in vivo changes the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical for normal energy balance. Targeting of the Ncor1–Hdac3 enzyme could be a highly specific intervention in diseases of nutritional stress such as obesity and diabetes. This paper shows that specific genetic disruption of the Ncor–HdaC3 interaction in mice causes aberrant regulation of clock genes and results in abnormal circadian behaviour. These mice are also leaner and more insulin sensitive due to increased energy expenditure. Loss of a functional Ncor–HdaC3 complex in vivo changes the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical for normal energy balance. Rhythmic changes in histone acetylation at circadian clock genes suggest that temporal modulation of gene expression is regulated by chromatin modifications1,2,3. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate a critical relationship between circadian and metabolic physiology4,5,6,7. The nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (Ncor1) functions as an activating subunit for the chromatin modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3)8. Lack of Ncor1 is incompatible with life, and hence it is unknown whether Ncor1, and particularly its regulation of Hdac3, is critical for adult mammalian physiology9. Here we show that specific, genetic disruption of the Ncor1–Hdac3 interaction in mice causes aberrant regulation of clock genes and results in abnormal circadian behaviour. These mice are also leaner and more insulin-sensitive owing to increased energy expenditure. Unexpectedly, loss of a functional Ncor1–Hdac3 complex in vivo does not lead to sustained increases in known catabolic genes, but instead significantly alters the oscillatory patterns of several metabolic genes, demonstrating that circadian regulation of metabolism is critical for normal energy balance. These findings indicate that activation of Hdac3 by Ncor1 is a nodal point in the epigenetic regulation of circadian and metabolic physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2034684171,"Aerobic nitrification of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate is a key process in the oceanic nitrogen cycling mediated by prokaryotes. Apart from Bacteria belonging to the beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria involved in the first nitrification step, Crenarchaeota have recently been recognized as main drivers of the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite in soil as well as in the ocean, as indicated by the dominance of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes over bacterial amoA. Evidence is accumulating that archaeal amoA genes are common in a wide range of marine systems. Essentially, all these reports focused on surface and mesopelagic (200-1,000 m depth) waters, where ammonia concentrations are higher than in waters below 1,000 m depth. However, Crenarchaeota are also abundant in the water column below 1,000 m, where ammonia concentrations are extremely low. Here we show that, throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, the abundance of archaeal amoA genes decreases markedly from subsurface waters to 4,000 m depth, and from subpolar to equatorial deep waters, leading to pronounced vertical and latitudinal gradients in the ratio of archaeal amoA to crenarchaeal 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. The lack of significant copy numbers of amoA genes and the very low fixation rates of dark carbon dioxide in the bathypelagic North Atlantic suggest that most bathypelagic Crenarchaeota are not autotrophic ammonia oxidizers: most likely, they utilize organic matter and hence live heterotrophically."

https://openalex.org/W2079598920,"Of the concepts used to improve the efficiency of organic syntheses, two have been especially effective: atom economy (the use of routes in which most of the atoms present in the reactants also end up in the product) and chemoselectivity (the use of reactions that take place only at desired positions in a molecule). Synthesis of complex natural products is the most demanding arena in which to explore such principles. The bryostatin family of compounds are especially interesting targets, because they combine structural complexity with promising biological activity. Furthermore, synthetic routes to some bryostatins have already been reported, providing a benchmark against which new syntheses can be measured. Here we report a concise total synthesis of bryostatin 16 (1), a parent structure from which almost all other bryostatins could in principle be accessed. Application of atom-economical and chemoselective reactions currently under development provides ready access to polyhydropyran motifs in the molecule, which are common structural features of many other natural products. The most notable transformations are two transition-metal-catalysed reactions. The first is a palladium-catalysed reaction of two different alkynes to form a large ring. The product of this step is then converted into a dihydropyran (the 'C ring' of bryostatins) in the second key reaction, which is catalysed by a gold compound. Analogues of bryostatin that do not exist in nature could be readily made by following this route, which might allow the biological activity of bryostatins to be fine-tuned."

This nonlinearity leads, for example, to a qualitative change in the behavior of the spectral function. The universal theory developed in this article is applicable to a wide class of one-dimensional fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems."
https://openalex.org/W2023380041,"There is a fascination about the quest to learn more about 'LUCA', the hypothetical last universal common ancestor from which all current living organisms are descended. Fossil evidence from the time, 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago, is sparse and so LUCA hunters rely on indirect evidence for information on LUCA's biology and environment. Reconstructions of ancestral protein sequences based on genetic evidence from extant genomes pointed to a hot environment, and a thermophilic LUCA. But ribosomal RNA sequences were thought consistent with a cooler environment. A new 'molecular thermometer' method may have resolved this apparent discrepancy. The analysis of rRNA and protein sequences from hundreds of modern species using the latest mathematical models of molecular evolution suggests that there were two phases of environmental temperature change. What was to become LUCA was first mesophilic, living in waters at about 60°C, then adapted to higher temperatures, above 70°C, to produce a thermophilic common ancestor. As the oceans then cooled the Bacteria and Archaea–Eukaryota diversified. Phylogeny-driven reconstructions of ancestral protein sequences have predicted that the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) was a thermophile, but analyses of ribosomal RNA sequences suggested that LUCA preferred a cooler environment. rRNA and protein sequences are used to show that thermotolerance initially increased from a mesophilic LUCA to thermophilic ancestors of Bacteria and Archaea–Eukaryota, and then subsequently decreased. Fossils of organisms dating from the origin and diversification of cellular life are scant and difficult to interpret1, for this reason alternative means to investigate the ecology of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and of the ancestors of the three domains of life are of great scientific value. It was recently recognized that the effects of temperature on ancestral organisms left ‘genetic footprints’ that could be uncovered in extant genomes2,3,4. Accordingly, analyses of resurrected proteins predicted that the bacterial ancestor was thermophilic and that Bacteria subsequently adapted to lower temperatures3,4. As the archaeal ancestor is also thought to have been thermophilic5, the LUCA was parsimoniously inferred as thermophilic too. However, an analysis of ribosomal RNAs supported the hypothesis of a non-hyperthermophilic LUCA2. Here we show that both rRNA and protein sequences analysed with advanced, realistic models of molecular evolution6,7 provide independent support for two environmental-temperature-related phases during the evolutionary history of the tree of life. In the first period, thermotolerance increased from a mesophilic LUCA to thermophilic ancestors of Bacteria and of Archaea–Eukaryota; in the second period, it decreased. Therefore, the two lineages descending from the LUCA and leading to the ancestors of Bacteria and Archaea–Eukaryota convergently adapted to high temperatures, possibly in response to a climate change of the early Earth1,8,9, and/or aided by the transition from an RNA genome in the LUCA to organisms with more thermostable DNA genomes10,11. This analysis unifies apparently contradictory results2,3,4 into a coherent depiction of the evolution of an ecological trait over the entire tree of life."

NO has the potential to act as an anterograde or retrograde modulator, but its mechanisms of controlling neuronal excitability in the brain are not well characterized. We have exploited a glutamatergic synapse in the auditory brainstem, called the calyx of Held (Forsythe, 1994Forsythe I.D.

The morphology of the calyx is analogous to an axon terminal field enveloping a single neuronal soma, so providing the ultimate input-specificity of one synapse to one target neuron. This giant synapse serves as a relay in pathways responsible for sound localization, by comparison of auditory information from both cochleae (Oertel, 1999Oertel D.

Concepts of plasticity often focus on changes in synaptic strength, but the synaptic response must also integrate with the intrinsic voltage-gated currents of the target neuron to generate an action potential (AP) output. Therefore, modulation of these postsynaptic intrinsic conductances contributes to neuronal excitability (Daoudal and Debanne, 2003Daoudal G. Debanne D.

In this paper, we identify a form of activity-dependent signaling mediated by NO, which acts over relatively slow timescales (5–30 min), consistent with a physiological role in tuning a neuronal population to the volume-average of local spontaneous and evoked synaptic activity. MNTB neurons and the calyx of Held express the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv3.1b (Elezgarai et al., 2003Elezgarai I. Diez J. Puente N. Azkue J.J. Benitez R. Bilbao A. Knopfel T. Donate-Oliver F.

In this region, endothelial NOS (eNOS) was localized to blood vessels on the ventral surface and within capillaries but was not detectable in MNTB neurons or glial cells, as emphasized by the separate localization of eNOS and Kv3.1b. In contrast, an antibody to nNOS showed strong labeling of the MNTB (Figure 1Aiv). Colabeling of Kv3.1b with the vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (vGLUT2) (Billups, 2005Billups B. Colocalization of vesicular glutamate transporters in the rat superior olivary complex.Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 382: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and with nNOS showed that Kv3.1b (green, Figure 1B) was largely present in membranes, while nNOS (red) was located in the cytoplasm of MNTB principal neurons. The localization of either vGLUT2 (green, Figure 1C) or PSD-95 (green, Figure 1D) with Kv3.1b clearly shows the synaptic profiles of the calyx around each neuron, emphasizing the postsynaptic cytoplasmic location of nNOS (red). DAPI staining showed principal neurons with prominent nucleoli (Figures 1C and 1D, ∗). To investigate the role of NO in auditory brainstem signaling, we used the fluorescent probe DAR-4M (Kojima et al., 2001Kojima H. Hirotani M. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Urano Y. Higuchi T. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Bioimaging of nitric oxide with fluorescent indicators based on the rhodamine chromophore.Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) to monitor NO production in brainstem slice preparations of the mouse SOC. Presynaptic calyceal APs were evoked using midline bipolar stimulation at 36°C–37°C (Billups et al., 2002Billups B. Wong A.Y. Forsythe I.D. Detecting synaptic connections in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body using calcium imaging.Pflugers Arch. 2002; 444: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and stimulation rates of up to 100 Hz. These rates of synaptic stimulation were well within the auditory pathway physiological range for both spontaneous and sound-driven inputs. High levels of spontaneous firing are a feature of the auditory pathway (Liberman and Oliver, 1984Liberman M.C. Oliver M.E. Morphometry of intracellularly labeled neurons of the auditory nerve: correlations with functional properties.J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 223: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), with the mouse MNTB having spontaneous rates between 0 and 150 Hz, and peak sound-evoked firing rates can exceed 700 Hz in vivo (Kopp-Scheinpflug et al., 2008Kopp-Scheinpflug C. Tolnai S. Malmierca M.S. Rubsamen R. The medial nucleus of the trapezoid body: comparative physiology.Neuroscience. 2008; 154: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The slice preparation divides MNTB neurons into two groups: those with an intact calyceal input (connected) and the majority, without an intact calyx (nonconnected), caused by severing the axon when cutting the brain slice. Spontaneous AP firing of MNTB neurons in an in vitro slice is rare (<<1 Hz) since there is no intact input from the cochlea. Following a 5 min control period (Figure 2A), calyceal axons were stimulated (indicated by each arrow) at 100 Hz, seven times (each 120 s), and DAR-4M fluorescence changes were monitored. A connected MNTB neuron possessing an intact calyceal input (“connected”) showed a slow increase in DAR-4M fluorescence (Figure 2A, filled symbols, data expressed as ΔF/F0 [t1/2 = 679 ± 42 s, n = 14]). The nonconnected cell showed a smaller magnitude change (open symbols), but no change in fluorescence was observed in another preparation in the absence of stimulation (gray symbols). The DAR-4M/NO reaction is irreversible, so termination of NO production is observed as a declining rate of increase following stimulation; the asymptote is not dye depletion, since application of the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) increased fluorescence of both connected and nonconnected neurons to a similar level. In averaged data from three connected neurons (Figure 2B), delivery of two identical 100 Hz trains led to a biphasic rise of DAR-4M fluorescence that also increased further with SNP. To aid quantification and pharmacological characterization of NO production, we used two identical consecutive stimulus trains (Figure 2C). Each is referred to as a “synaptic stimulus protocol” (SSP), consisting of a 60 s, 100 Hz train with a 50% duty cycle (SSP = 60 s at 100 Hz, 500 ms on, 500 ms off; i.e., an average of 50 Hz over 1 min). The two SSPs were separated by 1000 s, and each caused increases in [Ca2+]i in connected MNTB neurons and a reproducible DAR-4M fluorescence change (in paired experiments on the same slice). A single Fura-2 image at 380 nm shows (Figure 2C, left) a connected (red circle) and a nonconnected (black circle) MNTB neuron with the 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio plotted during synaptic stimulation (red and black insets, respectively). The change in DAR-4M fluorescence (ΔF1) is shown in the middle image and plotted over time in Figure 2C, right (ΔF/F0). The actions of pharmacological agents were assessed as the ratio of signal differences (ΔF2/ΔF1) between the first control SSP (ΔF1 = ΔF1100s-ΔF100 s) and the second test SSP (ΔF2 = ΔF2000s − ΔF1000s). Figure 2D shows a single cell receiving two SSP stimuli (open symbols) overlaid with data from another slice showing suppression of the SSP2 response by glutamate receptor antagonists (Figure 2D, filled symbols). Because of the continued increase in DAR-4M fluorescence following SSP1, the measured SSP2 fluorescence signal was larger than that for SSP1. The continued accumulation from SSP1 was measured at both ΔF1 and ΔF2 time points (Figure 2E, 1xSSP = zero, ΔF2/ΔF1 = 0.35 ± 0.28, n = 3). Because of this small continued increase, the dashed line in the summary data (Figure 2E) gives the best estimate for a zero response to SSP2. Under control conditions, ΔF2/ΔF1 is larger than 1 (ΔF2/ΔF1 = 1.51 ± 0.12, n = 13), suggesting potentiation of NO production for the second stimulus. Perfusion of glutamate receptor antagonists following SSP1, resulted in reduced ΔF2/ΔF1 ratios for NO production (Figure 2E, filled bars) and reduced [Ca2+]i for SSP2 (open bars). The NMDAR antagonist AP-5 blocked NO accumulation at all animal ages tested (up to P21, Figure S4B). The AMPAR antagonist DNQX also partially blocks NMDAR, and so reduced NO accumulation when applied alone, but the absence of NO accumulation in AP-5 implies that Ca2+-permeable AMPAR expressed in the MNTB (Joshi et al., 2004Joshi I. Shokralla S. Titis P. Wang L.Y. The role of AMPA receptor gating in the development of high-fidelity neurotransmission at the calyx of Held synapse.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) make little or no contribution to nNOS activation. Competitive NOS antagonists, N-PLA (10 μM), L-NMMA (500 μM), and 1400W (10 μM), each suppressed DAR-4M fluorescence ratios ΔF2/ΔF1 but left SSP2-evoked [Ca2+]i increases unaffected (Figure 2E, open bars for N-PLA and L-NMMA). These results are consistent with NMDAR- and calcium-dependent induction of nNOS and suggest little involvement of endothelial or inducible NOS isoforms (Hopper and Garthwaite, 2006Hopper R.A. Garthwaite J. Tonic and phasic nitric oxide signals in hippocampal long-term potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 11513-11521Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A key action of NO is activation of sGC and generation of intracellular cGMP. Measurement of cGMP was performed (using the same in vitro slice preparation) in response to perfusion of NO-donors and after presynaptic stimulation (SSP). Low basal cGMP concentrations were enhanced by inhibition of phosphodiesterases (IBMX, 0.5 mM) in control nonstimulated slices (Figure 2F) and were unchanged by perfusion with Bay 41-2272, an allosteric enhancer of the sGC activity (1 μM, data not shown), suggesting little basal sGC activity at rest in vitro. Perfusion of the NO donor SNAP (100 μM) increased cGMP concentrations by two orders of magnitude. Electrical stimulation of the presynaptic axons in the MNTB showed that a physiological stimulus also raised cGMP, and this was further potentiated by IBMX. Despite the small number of intact calyceal axons, we still detected strong cGMP production, and this increase was blocked by tetrodotoxin or by inhibition of nNOS with N-PLA (10 μM), confirming generation of cGMP on synaptic stimulation through an nNOS-dependent mechanism. NO has long been considered a putative volume transmitter, but it is difficult to prove this concept in most brain areas, where synaptic inputs are distributed between many neurons. Visualization of transneuronal NO diffusion in the MNTB was achieved using DAR-4M and calcium imaging. Figure 3A shows two neurons in which one receives a calyceal input (∗, red circle). On delivery of two SSPs, this neuron exhibited sustained large changes in [Ca2+]i (red trace, inset) while a noninnervated neuron (black circle) showed no change in [Ca2+]i (black trace, inset). Following SSP1, the ΔF1 image shows a global increase in fluorescence (Figure 3A, ΔF1), and a plot of the DAR-4M ΔF/F0 against time (Figure 3A, right) shows clear NO accumulation after SSP1 in both neurons (red, connected; black, nonconnected). Perfusion of the NO scavenger, PTIO (Figure 3A, ΔF2) prior to the second SSP suppressed the fluorescent increase in the noninnervated neuron and surrounding tissue (Figure 3A, right, black symbols after SSP2), although the innervated neuron continued to respond (Figure 3A, right, red symbols after SSP2). A line scan for this same data is shown in Figure 3B (data plot along the 100 μm white line in Figure 3A). The innervated neuron (∗) shows high fluorescence following SSP1, while the nonconnected neuron (#) also shows substantial fluorescence (ΔF1, black trace). Following perfusion by PTIO (ΔF2, gray trace), the increase in background fluorescence is suppressed everywhere, while the innervated neuron still shows a rise in NO fluorescence. Averaging the fluorescence intensities for ΔF1 and ΔF2 measured over four innervated neurons (“On Cell”) versus the 20 μm either side of the same neuron (“Off Cell”) in the absence (filled bars) and presence of PTIO during the second SSP (gray bars) shows that NO diffusion was prevented by scavenging (Figure 3C). Further evidence for the diffusion of NO was obtained by estimating NO accumulation with distance from known sources. The NO concentration gradient was estimated from the rate of change of DAR-4M fluorescence and plotted against distance from a single neuron source following one SSP. The rate of change decreased proportionally to the distance from the source neuron (Figure 3D) compared with the response to perfusing an NO donor, where the gradient did not change with distance. Numerical simulation of NO spread was made within a block of neural tissue (Figure S1). A 20 μm diameter spherical constant-rate source of NO gives a highly localized [NO] diffusion curve when subject to inactivation, i.e., NO is scavenged or degraded (Figure 3E, left curve); however, a good fit with the experimental data (Figure 3E, right curve) required potentiation of NO synthesis, which is consistent with the facilitation observed in the paired SSP protocols (Figure 2E). Using physiological levels of spontaneous AP firing, the model predicted basal NO generation and enhanced synthesis with sound-driven activity (Figures S1A and S1B), so when the tonotopic distribution of spontaneous activity (Smith et al., 1998Smith P.H. Joris P.X. Yin T.C. Anatomy and physiology of principal cells of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) of the cat.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 3127-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) is taken into consideration, the model predicts an in vivo gradient of NO across the tonotopic axis of the MNTB (Figures S1A and S1B), which would interact with tonotopic gradients of ionic conductances measured from “silent” in vitro brain slices (Discussion). Further confirmation of the volume transmission hypothesis was obtained by loading single neurons with DAR-4M-AM using a loose patch configuration, thus reducing the background fluorescence from the bulk tissue. In one field of view, both labeled cells had intact calyceal inputs (Figure 3F), as indicated by raised intracellular calcium on stimulation (340/380nm ratio traces, red insets). The line scan across one neuron showed increased fluorescence following synaptic stimulation (F1) compared to control (F0). DAR-4M fluorescence is plotted along the line scan for F0 and F1 in Figure 3F (right graph). In another experiment, two connected neurons flanked one nonconnected MNTB neuron (Figure 3G). Line scans across the nonconnected neuron showed SSP-evoked rises in DAR-4M fluorescence, as indicated in the example images F0 (before) and F1 (after SSP). Similar data were obtained from four such neuron pairs and confirm accumulation of NO in connected as well as in nonconnected neurons following synaptic stimulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from MNTB neurons with an identified calyceal input or from other neurons without a functional input showed that both connected (Figures 4A and 4B, insets show representative traces) and nonconnected neurons (Figures 4D and 4E) had large voltage-activated outward K+ currents that were suppressed in both cases on synaptic stimulation. The slow 10–15 min time course of the depression (Figures 4B and 4E) was mimicked by perfusion of DEA-NONOate (Figure 4C, open triangles in the absence of stimulation, 100 μM) and contrasts with the minor run-down observed over 20 min recording in slices receiving neither stimulation nor NO donor (Figure 4C, filled squares). Identical results were obtained with SNP (100 μM, n = 6, data not shown), so individual data for SNP and DEA were combined in later figures. Summary data are plotted as mean absolute current magnitude (measured at +50 mV) in Figure 4F, showing the suppression of outward K+ currents on synaptic stimulation (SSP) by ∼50% in connected neurons, which was blocked by perfusion of 1400W (10 μM, n = 4) during the SSP. Similarly, outward potassium currents were suppressed in nonconnected neurons by an SSP and on perfusion of DEA (100 μM). Application of SNP (100 μM) also reduced high-voltage-activated currents (evoked by depolarizations positive to −10 mV, Figure 4G), and this suppression was blocked by the sGC inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinozalin-1-one (ODQ, 1 μM) and occluded by perfusion of low concentrations of tetraethylammonium (TEA, 3 mM). This concentration of TEA is selective for Kv3 currents in MNTB neurons (Brew and Forsythe, 2005Brew H.M. Forsythe I.D.

Res. 2005; 206: 116-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Macica et al., 2003Macica C.M. von Hehn C.A. Wang L.Y. Ho C.S. Yokoyama S. Joho R.H. Kaczmarek L.K.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 4H; summarized in Figure 4I). We conclude that NO is generated in response to stimulation of glutamatergic receptors at the calyx of Held and acts to suppress postsynaptic Kv3 currents within the cell of origin and across a population of active and inactive neurons through a process of volume transmission. Phosphorylation is a major control mechanism of Kv3 potassium channels (Song et al., 2005Song P. Yang Y. Barnes-Davies M. Bhattacharjee A. Hamann M. Forsythe I.D. Oliver D.L. Kaczmarek L.K. Acoustic environment determines phosphorylation state of the Kv3.1 potassium channel in auditory neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); high levels of phosphorylation suppress channel opening, while dephosphorylation increases open probability. Perfusion of the PKG antagonist KT 5823 (1 μM) enhanced resting Kv3 currents and blocked the suppression by SNP. The high-voltage-activated current was confirmed as Kv3 as it was blocked by perfusion with TEA (3 mM) (Figure 4J). In other experiments, the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (100 nM, included in the patch pipette or bath perfused) rapidly suppressed the high-voltage-activated currents (Figure 4K) and occluded the response to NO donors (data not shown). The averaged data are plotted in Figure 4L and suggest that native Kv3 channel activity is highly dependent on the equilibrium between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The extent to which this mechanism reflects direct versus indirect actions is presently unclear because of the range of kinase signaling converging at the Kv3.1 channel and needs further investigation. Volume diffusion of NO between neurons and their synaptic terminals means that the net physiological effect of NO modulation could involve both presynaptic and/or postsynaptic effects. Given the broad spectrum of potential NO actions, we next sought to establish which sites of action were of most relevance for modulation of transmission strength by monitoring the effect of NO donors on MNTB field potentials and by comparing spontaneous and evoked EPSCs at the calyx of Held/MNTB synapse. Perfusion of SNP inhibited the postsynaptic component of the evoked extracellular compound field potentials (Figure S2; C2, postsynaptic)"

Imaging techniques have enabled the examination of structural rearrangements during activity-dependent processes at the synapse. While many studies have examined structural changes of dendritic spines, little is known about structural plasticity of presynaptic boutons. We therefore examined how axonal boutons are affected during long-term depression (LTD). We used time lapse two-photon laser scanning microscopy and extracellular field recordings to monitor simultaneously synaptic morphology and activity for up to five hours in mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. LTD induction dramatically increased the turnover of presynaptic boutons, while decreasing the number of putative synaptic contacts between Schaffer collateral boutons and spines of CA1 pyramidal cells. Our data indicate a substantial presynaptic contribution to activity-dependent morphological plasticity and provide opportunities for studying the molecular mechanisms of the structural remodeling of synaptic circuits."

Like its yeast relative UBP10, Scrawny deubiquitylates histone H2B and functions in gene silencing. Consistent with previous studies of this conserved pathway of chromatin regulation, scny mutant cells have elevated levels of ubiquitinylated H2B and trimethylated H3K4.

Even in the absence of any particles or radiation, in pure vacuum, virtual particles are constantly created and annihilated. In an electromagnetic field, the presence of virtual photons manifests itself as a small renormalization of the energy of a quantum system, known as the Lamb shift. We present an experimental observation of the Lamb shift in a solid-state system. The strong dispersive coupling of a superconducting electronic circuit acting as a quantum bit (qubit) to the vacuum field in a transmission-line resonator leads to measurable Lamb shifts of up to 1.4% of the qubit transition frequency. The qubit is also observed to couple more strongly to the vacuum field than to a single photon inside the cavity, an effect that is explained by taking into account the limited anharmonicity of the higher excited qubit states."

https://openalex.org/W1993443442,"The transient, A-type K+ current (IA) controls the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites by regulating the back-propagation of action potentials and by shaping synaptic input. Dendritic A-type K+ channels are targeted for modulation during long-term potentiation (LTP) and we have recently shown that activity-dependent internalization of the A-type channel subunit Kv4.2 enhances synaptic currents. However, the effect of changes in IA on the ability to induce subsequent synaptic plasticity (metaplasticity) has not been investigated. Here, we show that altering functional Kv4.2 expression level leads to a rapid, bidirectional remodeling of CA1 synapses. Neurons exhibiting enhanced IA showed a decrease in relative synaptic NR2B/NR2A subunit composition and did not exhibit LTP. Conversely, reducing IA by expression of a Kv4.2 dominant-negative or through genomic knockout of Kv4.2 led to an increased fraction of synaptic NR2B/NR2A and enhanced LTP. Bidirectional synaptic remodeling was mimicked in experiments manipulating intracellular Ca2+ and dependent on spontaneous activation of NMDA receptors and CaMKII activity. Our data suggest that A-type K+ channels are an integral part of a synaptic complex that regulates Ca2+ signaling through spontaneous NMDAR activation to control synaptic NMDAR expression and plasticity."

However, the role of this single polymorphism in disease initiation and progression remains poorly understood. The lack of Asp 57 creates a positively charged P9 pocket, which confers a preference for negatively charged peptides. Gluten lacks such peptides, but tissue transglutaminase (TG2) introduces negatively charged residues at defined positions into gluten T-cell epitopes by deamidating specific glutamine residues on the basis of their spacing to proline residues. The commonly accepted model, proposing that HLA-DQ8 simply favours binding of negatively charged peptides, does not take into account the fact that TG2 requires inflammation for activation and that T-cell responses against native gluten peptides are found, particularly in children. Here we show that beta57 polymorphism promotes the recruitment of T-cell receptors bearing a negative signature charge in the complementary determining region 3beta (CDR3beta) during the response against native gluten peptides presented by HLA-DQ8 in coeliac disease. These T cells showed a crossreactive and heteroclitic (stronger) response to deamidated gluten peptides. Furthermore, gluten peptide deamidation extended the T-cell-receptor repertoire by relieving the requirement for a charged residue in CDR3beta. Thus, the lack of a negative charge at position beta57 in MHC class II was met by negatively charged residues in the T-cell receptor or in the peptide, the combination of which might explain the role of HLA-DQ8 in amplifying the T-cell response against dietary gluten."

We report here experiments that identify a MuSK-binding protein, the mammalian homolog (Tid1) of the Drosophila tumor suppressor, tumorous imaginal discs (Tid56), a heat shock protein (hsp) 40 homolog.

Pharmacol. 2006; 172: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), including those involving tyrosine phosphorylation. Tid1 has been shown to interact with, and to modulate the signaling of, the Jak family of protein tyrosine kinases (Sarkar et al., 2001Sarkar S. Pollack B.P. Lin K.T. Kotenko S.V. Cook J.R. Lewis A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 19461-19471Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that Tid1 is closely associated with MuSK at the neuromuscular junction and that it is essential for spontaneous and agrin-induced clustering of AChRs, as well as for the maintenance of clustered AChRs at adult synapses. Whereas Tid1 is not required for agrin-induced MuSK activation, an N-terminal fragment of Tid1 can induce AChR phosphorylation and clustering independently of agrin and MuSK. Thus, Tid1 is a critical factor that acts downstream of MuSK activation in the neurally mediated differentiation and maintenance of the neuromuscular synapse. To identify proteins that interact with MuSK, we carried out two bacterial two-hybrid screens (Joung et al., 2000Joung J. Ramm E. Pabo C. A bacterial two-hybrid system for studying protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7382-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), first using the entire cytoplasmic domain (residues 515–869) of mouse MuSK as bait and then using the juxtamembrane region (residues 515–692), which contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site required for agrin-induced AChR clustering (Herbst and Burden, 2000Herbst R. Burden S. The juxtamembrane region of MuSK has a critical role in agrin-mediated signaling.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, Watty et al., 2000Watty A. Neubauer G.

USA. 2000; 97: 4585-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); in both cases, a cDNA library of embryonic day 19 (E19) rat skeletal muscle was the target (Figure S1A available online). Tumorous imaginal discs (Tid1), a rat homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Tid56 and the heat shock protein hsp40, appeared twice in the initial screen and six times in the second screen (Figures 1A and S1B). Tid1 has two alternatively spliced forms, “Tid1 short” (Tid1S) and “Tid1 long” (Tid1L), which differ in the last 33 amino acid residues of their C termini (Syken et al., 1999Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. TID1, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor l(2)tid, encodes two mitochondrial modulators of apoptosis with opposing functions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar; Figure S1C). Importantly, the bacterial two-hybrid screens only identified the short isoform of Tid1 as a MuSK-binding partner (Figure 1A). To determine whether Tid1 binds to MuSK in skeletal muscle cells, we immunoprecipitated detergent extracts of C2C12 myotubes with a polyclonal antibody against MuSK (anti-MuSK; Fuhrer et al., 1997Fuhrer C. Sugiyama J.E. Taylor R.G. Hall Z.W.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both Tid1S and Tid1L (anti-pan Tid1). A band of ∼40 kDa, corresponding to Tid1S (453 residues), was detected on the immunoblots, but Tid1L, also present in the cell lysates, was not (Figure 1B, lane 3). The coimmunoprecipitation of Tid1S with MuSK was highly specific, as the band did not appear in negative control lanes (Figure 1B, lanes 1–2 and 6–8). Similar results were obtained when a polyclonal antibody specific for Tid1S (anti-Tid1S, see Experimental Procedures) was used for immunoprecipitation, and anti-MuSK was employed for immunoblotting (Figure 1C, lane 2). “Pull-down” assays using anti-MuSK were also performed with detergent extracts of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle from adult rats. Anti-MuSK specifically coimmunoprecipitated Tid1S (Figure 1D, lane 1). Thus, both two-hybrid and biochemical studies indicate that MuSK is associated with Tid1S, but not Tid1L. In cultured myotubes, AChRs are normally distributed diffusely along the muscle cell surface, except for occasional spontaneous, or aneural, AChR clusters. Coculturing myotubes with motoneurons or treatment with recombinant neural agrin induces aggregation of AChRs into high-density clusters resembling those on the postsynaptic membranes of NMJs (Christian et al., 1978Christian C.N. Daniels M.P. Sugiyama H. Vogel Z. Jacques L. Nelson P.G. A factor from neurons increases the number of acetylcholine receptor aggregates on cultured muscle cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Using a pan-Tid1 polyclonal antibody (anti-Tid1; Lo et al., 2004Lo J.F. Hayashi M. Woo-Kim S. Tian B. Huang J.F. Fearns C. Takayama S. Zapata J.M. Yang Y. Lee J.-D. Tid1, a cochaperone of the heat shock 70 protein and the mammalian counterpart of the Drosophila tumor suppressor l(2)tid, is critical for early embryonic development and cell survival.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2226-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we examined the localization of Tid1 in C2C12 mouse myotubes by immunofluorescence. In the absence of agrin, Tid1 immunofluorescence was found in the cytoplasm of the myotubes; it was also associated with spontaneous AChR clusters seen on the cell surface (Figures 2Aa–2Ac). Treatment with recombinant neural agrin (CAg12,4,8, Ferns et al., 1992Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. RNA splicing regulates agrin-mediated acetylcholine receptor clustering activity on cultured myotubes.Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) dramatically increased the number of AChR and Tid1 clusters, which in each case were precisely colocalized (Figures 2Ag–2Ai). Thus, like the postsynaptic proteins rapsyn and MuSK, Tid1 coclusters with AChRs on the muscle cell membrane in both agrin-stimulated and unstimulated muscle cells. As with MuSK (Valenzuela et al., 1995Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. et al.Receptor tyrosine kinase specific for the skeletal muscle lineage: expression in embryonic muscle, at the neuromuscular junction, and after injury.Neuron. 1995; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), the overall level of Tid1 expression in C2C12 cells was low in undifferentiated myoblasts and high in myotubes and as with the AChR (Godfrey et al., 1984Godfrey E.W. Nitkin R.M. Wallace B.G. Rubin L.L. McMahan U.J. Components of Torpedo electric organ and muscle that cause aggregation of acetylcholine receptors on cultured muscle cells.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), it was not altered by agrin (Figure 2B). The induction of Tid1 clusters by agrin thus does not represent increased expression of Tid1, but rather a redistribution of Tid1, either among subcellular fractions or within the cell membrane. The strong association of MuSK with Tid1S, a protein without a transmembrane sequence, suggests that Tid1S may become bound to the membrane and clustered through its association with MuSK. To test this idea, we examined the distribution of Tid1 in myotubes derived from skeletal muscles of MuSK knockout (MuSK−/−) mice (Glass et al., 1996Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. et al.Agrin acts via a MuSK receptor complex.Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), cultured with and without agrin. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that neither AChRs nor Tid1 formed spontaneous or agrin-induced clusters in MuSK-deficient myotubes (Figures 2Ca–2Cf). Transfection of the mutant myotubes with FLAG-tagged MuSK rescued their ability to cluster AChRs and Tid1 on the cell surface (Figures 2Cg–2Ci). Subcellular fractionation assays showed significant differences in the distribution of Tid1S in the membrane versus cytosolic fractions of wild-type (MuSK+/+) and MuSK−/− myotubes (Figure 2D). In wild-type myotubes, 29.3% of Tid1S was found in the membrane fraction and 70.7% in the cytosol. In MuSK−/− cells, membrane-bound Tid1S was decreased to 8.6%, whereas the cytosolic form increased to 91.4% (p < 0.05, n = 4). There was no significant difference in the total amount of Tid1S in the wild-type and MuSK−/− myotubes, and agrin did not change the proportion of Tid1S in the membrane versus the cytosolic fraction. Taken together (see also Figure 8C), our data suggest that Tid1S is constitutively associated with MuSK on the myotube membrane. Binding to MuSK appears to be required for Tid1 membrane association and for both the spontaneous and agrin-induced clustering of Tid1. Moreover, as with the AChR (Anderson et al., 1977Anderson M.J. Cohen M.W. Zorychta E. Effects of innervation on the distribution of acetylcholine receptors on cultured muscle cells.J. Physiol. 1977; 268: 731-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), agrin appears to cluster Tid1 by redistributing it within the membrane, rather than by recruiting additional Tid1S to the cell surface. To examine the distribution of Tid1 in developing and adult skeletal muscles, we double-stained frozen sections of hindlimb muscles from embryonic and postnatal mice for AChRs (α-bungarotoxin, αBTX) and Tid1 (Figures 2Ea–2Eu). At E13, before nerve contact, muscle staining for both AChRs and Tid1 was weak and diffusely distributed. At E14.5, shortly after innervation, faint but discernible Tid1 immunofluorescence appeared, coincident with small AChR clusters. Clusters containing AChR and Tid1 were more numerous and brighter by E16. Similar to MuSK (Bowen et al., 1998Bowen D.C. Park J.S. Bodine S. Stark J.L. Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. Glass D.J. DiStefano P.S. Localization and regulation of MuSK at the neuromuscular junction.Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), colocalization of Tid1 and AChRs increased throughout embryogenesis, until the two proteins appeared precisely in register at neonatal and adult NMJs (Figures 2Ea–2Eu). Consistent with the immunostaining, and similar to the pattern of MuSK expression, western blots revealed markedly enhanced levels of Tid1 protein in fetal muscles shortly after nerve-muscle contact (day E14.5). Expression remained high throughout the embryonic period, but gradually decreased after birth (Figure 2F). We then transected the sciatic nerves of adult mice and stained cryosections of denervated soleus muscles for Tid1, AChR (αBTX), and synaptophysin. Eight days after denervation, the precise colocalization of Tid1 and AChRs at endplates was maintained (Figures S4a–S4c) whereas synaptophysin immunoreactivity was abolished (Figures S4j and S4m), confirming the postsynaptic localization of Tid1. At 8 weeks after denervation (Figure S5), AChR clusters were fragmented, with significantly reduced AChR staining (Figure 2Ew). Their mean size was 33% of those in innervated soleus muscles (Figure 5D, p < 0.001), consistent with earlier experiments (Frank et al., 1976Frank E. Gautvik K. Sommerschild H. Persistence of junctional acetylcholine receptors following denervation.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1976; 40: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Tid1 remained colocalized with AChRs at the denervated endplates, but with reduced intensity of immunofluorescence (Figure 2Ev). The mean size of Tid1 clusters was 18% of those in control muscles (Figure S5D, p < 0.001). The mean ratio of Tid1 cluster size to AChR cluster size was 98% in control muscles, but only 58% after denervation (Figure S5E, p < 0.001), suggesting that dispersal of endplate Tid1 after denervation precedes that of AChRs. In one denervated hindlimb, myofibers appeared to be reinnervated, as judged by synaptophysin staining. At these endplates, Tid1 and AChR staining were restored to near-normal levels (Figures S5C–S5E). Western blotting showed a dramatic increase in the level of Tid1 protein after chronic denervation (Figure 2F), similar to that seen with MuSK (Valenzuela et al., 1995Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. et al.Receptor tyrosine kinase specific for the skeletal muscle lineage: expression in embryonic muscle, at the neuromuscular junction, and after injury.Neuron. 1995; 15: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and the AChR (Merlie et al., 1984Merlie J.P. Isenberg K.E. Russell S.D. Sanes J.R. Denervation supersensitivity in skeletal muscle: analysis with a cloned cDNA probe.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The increase in all three proteins may reflect a general activation of synaptic protein gene transcription in extrasynaptic regions of muscle following denervation (Hall and Sanes, 1993Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Synaptic structure and development: the neuromuscular junction.Cell. 1993; 72: 99-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Thus, as with AChRs, both endplate and nonendplate Tid1 levels appear to be regulated by innervation. To determine whether Tid1 is required for AChR clustering, we utilized RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit mouse Tid1 expression. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeted to the region encoding the N-terminal domain of Tid1 (see Experimental Procedures) was inserted into a vector also containing a gene for the modified red fluorescent protein marker DsRed-Express. Transfection of cultured myotubes with the shRNA resulted in a dramatic decrease in the level of Tid1 expression, whereas transfection with a vector containing a scrambled shRNA sequence showed no change (Figure S6A). About 50% of the cells in both cases expressed the fluorescent marker (Figure S6B). When shRNA-transfected cultures were incubated for 5 hr, either with or without neural agrin, and stained for AChRs, the number of clusters was significantly reduced both in the absence (Figures 3Ad–3Af) and presence (Figures 3Aj–3Al) of agrin. In contrast, expression of the scrambled control shRNA had no effect on the number of AChR clusters in either case (Figures 3Aa–3Ac and 3Ag–3Ai). In individual myotubes, the observed reduction in receptor clusters correlated well with the degree of Tid1 immunofluorescence intensity (Figures S6Ce–S6Cl). When the time course of cluster formation was examined, Tid1 knockdown significantly reduced the number of AChR clusters at all time points (Figure 3B, p < 0.01). To rule out the possibility that the reduction in AChR clusters was caused by interference with the expression of genes unrelated to Tid1 (“off target” effects), cDNAs encoding human Tid1S or Tid1L were coexpressed along with the Tid1-targeted shRNA. To ensure that the mouse Tid1-specific shRNA would not affect their expression, selected nucleotides were silently mutated in the shRNA-targeted region of the human Tid1 cDNAs (see Experimental Procedures). Coexpression of the mouse Tid1-targeted shRNA with the full-length human Tid1S (hTid1S), but not human Tid1L (hTid1L), successfully rescued both spontaneous and agrin-induced AChR clustering activity in myotubes (Figures 3Ca–3Cc, 3Cg–3Ci, and 3D). Thus, the inhibitory effect of shRNA on AChR clustering in cultured myotubes is mediated specifically by interference with Tid1S expression. Previous studies in other cell types have shown that mutation of a key residue in human Tid1 cDNA (H121Q) functionally inactivates Tid1 by allowing it to bind to, but not activate, its cochaperone, hsp70 (Syken et al., 1999Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. TID1, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor l(2)tid, encodes two mitochondrial modulators of apoptosis with opposing functions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found that a silently mutated human Tid1S with the H121Q mutation did not rescue shRNA-mediated inhibition of AChR clustering (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, the effect of Tid1 on AChR clustering likely depends upon its ability to activate hsp70. The inability of the mutated (H121Q) human Tid1S cDNA to rescue clustering after shRNA inhibition led us to investigate the role of the different Tid1S domains in AChR clustering. Tid1 contains three well-characterized domains: an N-terminal DnaJ domain (residues 92–150), a cysteine-rich region (residues 223–303), and a C-terminal domain (residues 307–428). The DnaJ domain was of particular interest, since it contains the critical H121Q mutation. We constructed a set of truncated fragments of Tid1S lacking some or all of the domains (Figure 4A). Cultured muscle cells were transfected with plasmid cDNAs encoding the myc-tagged fragments and 3–4 days later were incubated with or without neural agrin for 4 hr. Whereas other constructs had no significant effect on the number and size of spontaneous AChR clusters (Figure 4B, left panels), transfection of cDNA encoding the N-terminal half of Tid1 [Tid1(1-222)] induced robust clustering of AChRs (Figures 4BVII–4BIX and 4C). The clusters induced by Tid1(1-222) were smaller than those induced by agrin (Figures 4Bi–4Biii), but were similar to receptor microclusters seen in the early stages of agrin-induced AChR clustering (Weston et al., 2003Weston C. Gordon C. Teressa G. Hod E. Ren X.-D. Prives J. Cooperative regulation by Rac and Rho of agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering in muscle cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In agrin-treated myotubes, transfection with Tid1(1-222) led to a slight, but statistically significant (0.01 < p < 0.05), increase in the number of clusters on the myotube surface (Figure 4B, right panels; Figure 4C) as compared to control myotubes. The physiologic activity of Tid1(1-222) was confirmed by showing that, like full-length human Tid1S, it is able to rescue the inhibition of AChR clustering caused by Tid1-targeted shRNA. The rescue was ineffective when the fragment contained the H121Q mutation (Figure S6D). Binding assays with 125I-αBTX revealed no increase in surface AChRs after transfection with Tid1(1-222) or other truncated fragments in either agrin-treated or untreated myotubes (Figure S7A). Interestingly, Tid1S was unable to induce AChR clustering in the absence of shRNA inhibition (Figures 4B and 4C). As MuSK activation is the initial step in the agrin pathway, we examined whether Tid1(1-222) induces phosphorylation of MuSK by immunoprecipitating transfected cells with anti-MuSK and subsequently immunoblotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. None of the Tid1S fragments caused MuSK phosphorylation (Figure 4D), suggesting that activation of MuSK is not required for Tid1(1-222)-induced AChR clustering. Transfecting muscle cultures from MuSK knockout mice with Tid1(1-222) revealed that even the total absence of MuSK had little or no effect on the fragment's ability to cluster AChRs (Figure 4E). Our experiments thus show that not only is Tid1 expression required for AChR clustering, but that an active fragment of Tid1 can induce AChR clustering in the absence of agrin or MuSK. To determine whether Tid1 is required for the maintenance of AChR clusters at mature endplates, we used electroporation to introduce either the Tid1-specific or scrambled shRNA into the TA muscles of adult mice. 5.5 weeks later, transfected and normal muscle fibers were stained for AChRs and Tid1. Untransfected muscle fibers and those expressing scrambled shRNA had a single large central AChR and Tid1-positive cluster that appeared as a brightly stained, “pretzel”-like structure with sharp boundaries, ∼40 μm in diameter (Figures 5Aa–5Ad). In contrast, fibers expressing the Tid1-targeted shRNA showed mild to severe disruption of AChR clusters. In fibers with a slight decrease in Tid1 staining, individual receptor clusters were broken into several large fragments (Figures 5Ae–5Ah). In fibers in which Tid1 staining was severely reduced, the AChR clusters were fragmented into many (>20) discontinuous structures, ∼2–5 μm in diameter (Figures 5Ai–5Ap). In the most severe cases, Tid1 immunostaining was completely absent, and the NMJ was massively disorganized, with numerous small, weakly stained AChR clusters whose boundaries were poorly defined. These structures were scattered over a larger area than a normal AChR cluster, suggesting diffusion away from the endplate region (Figures 5Bb and 5Be). Ten weeks after electroporation, only a few fragments remained in prior sites of innervation (Figures 5Ca–5Cc). Tid1 is thus clearly required to maintain the normal structure of AChR clusters at adult motor endplates. When myofibers expressing Tid1-shRNA were stained with a polyclonal antibody against synaptophysin, the pattern of presynaptic innervation was dramatically changed, closely matching the observed changes in AChR clusters (Figure S8). In fibers in which endplate Tid1 immunostaining was reduced or undetectable, AChRs were dispersed and appeared as small, isolated, bead-like aggregates. Motor nerve endings remained, forming numerous branches in register with the fragmented AChR clusters. These result"

Although Brd4 has been implicated in the transcriptional control of papillomavirus-encoded E2 protein, it is unclear how Brd4 regulates E2 function and whether the involvement of Brd4 in transactivation and transrepression is common to different types of E2 proteins. Using DNase I footprinting performed with in vitro reconstituted human papillomavirus (HPV) chromatin and nucleosome-free DNA templates, we found that Brd4 facilitates E2 binding to its cognate sequences in chromatin depending on bromodomains and the E2-interacting region of Brd4. Moreover, the coactivator and corepressor function of Brd4 requires at least one intact bromodomain and is mediated by its direct association with E2 proteins encoded by cancer-inducing high risk HPV-16 and HPV-18, wart-causing low risk HPV-11, and bovine papillomavirus type 1, in part through enhancing the protein stability of E2 that is normally degraded via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Our findings indicate that a chromatin adaptor can bridge and enhance the binding of a sequence-specific transcription factor to chromatin and further promote the stability of a labile transcription factor via direct protein-protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2014430225,"Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a fatal childhood neurological disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal protease tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 (TPP1). TPP1 represents the only known mammalian member of the S53 family of serine proteases, a group characterized by a subtilisin-like fold, a Ser-Glu-Asp catalytic triad, and an acidic pH optimum. TPP1 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme (pro-TPP1) that is proteolytically processed into the active enzyme after exposure to low pH in vitro or targeting to the lysosome in vivo. In this study, we describe an endoglycosidase H-deglycosylated form of TPP1 containing four Asn-linked N-acetylglucosamines that is indistinguishable from fully glycosylated TPP1 in terms of autocatalytic processing of the proform and enzymatic properties of the mature protease. The crystal structure of deglycosylated pro-TPP1 was determined at 1.85 angstroms resolution. A large 151-residue C-shaped prodomain makes extensive contacts as it wraps around the surface of the catalytic domain with the two domains connected by a 24-residue flexible linker that passes through the substrate-binding groove. The proenzyme structure reveals suboptimal catalytic triad geometry with its propiece linker partially blocking the substrate-binding site, which together serve to prevent premature activation of the protease. Finally, we have identified numerous processing intermediates and propose a structural model that explains the pathway for TPP1 activation in vitro. These data provide new insights into TPP1 function and represent a valuable resource for constructing improved TPP1 variants for treatment of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis."

https://openalex.org/W2104625525,"We demonstrate that distinct mechanisms of top-down control regulate, respectively, the sensitivity and gain of sensory responses in the owl's optic tectum (OT). Electrical microstimulation in the forebrain gaze control area, the arcopallial gaze field (AGF), results in a space-specific regulation of sensory responses in the OT. AGF microstimulation increases the responsiveness of OT neurons representing stimuli at the same location as that represented at the AGF site. We show that the mechanism that underlies this effect operates focally to enhance neuronal sensitivity and improve tuning consistency and spatial resolution. At the same time, AGF microstimulation decreases the responsiveness of OT neurons representing stimuli at all other locations. The mechanism that underlies this effect operates globally to modulate neuronal gain. The coordinated action of these different mechanisms can account for many of the reported effects of spatial attention on neural responses in monkeys and on behavioral performance in humans."

We show that purified TPP1 requires at least partial glycosylation for in vitro autoprocessing and proteolytic activity. We crystallized the fully glycosylated TPP1 precursor under conditions that implied partial autocatalytic cleavage between the prosegment and the catalytic domain. X-ray crystallographic analysis at 2.35 Å resolution reveals a globular structure with a subtilisin-like fold, a Ser475-Glu272-Asp360 catalytic triad, and an octahedrally coordinated Ca2+-binding site that are characteristic features of the S53 sedolisin family of peptidases. In contrast to other S53 peptidases, the TPP1 structure revealed steric constraints on the P4 substrate pocket explaining its preferential cleavage of tripeptides from the unsubstituted N terminus of proteins. Two alternative conformations of the catalytic Asp276 are associated with the activation status of TPP1. 28 disease-causing missense mutations are analyzed in the light of the TPP1 structure providing insight into the molecular basis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

EC 3.4.14.9) result in an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease of childhood called “classical late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis” (late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, OMIM 204500). This enzyme was first purified from bovine pituitary glands and characterized as an acidic pepstatin-insensitive aminopeptidase (1Doebber T.W. Divor A.R. Ellis S. Endocrinology.. 1978; 103: 1794-1804Google Scholar). By exploiting its affinity to mannose 6-phosphate receptors, TPP1 was subsequently found to be missing in material from late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis patients (2Sleat D.E. Donnelly R.J. Lackland H. Liu C.G. Sohar I. Pullarkat R.K. Lobel P. Science.. 1997; 277: 1802-1805Google Scholar). Almost at the same time, high affinity substrates and inhibitors were characterized for TPP1 originating from rat spleen (3Vines D. Warburton M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1998; 1384: 233-242Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated a lysosomal localization and an optimal pH of 4.0-5.0 for the tripeptidyl exopeptidase activity of TPP1. In vitro, TPP1 cleavage preferentially occurs between hydrophobic amino acids in the P1 and P1′ positions (according to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (4Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1967; 27: 157-162Google Scholar)) and is hampered by the presence of Pro or Lys in the P1 position or Pro in P1′ position (5Warburton M.J. Bernardini F. FEBS Lett.. 2001; 500: 145-148Google Scholar). Further studies on the substrate specificity revealed that TPP1 prefers positively charged, small amino acids in positions P2 and P3 (6Oyama H. Fujisawa T. Suzuki T. Dunn B.M. Wlodawer A. Oda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 2005; 138: 127-134Google Scholar, 7Tian Y. Sohar I. Taylor J.W. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 6559-6572Google Scholar). Additionally, TPP1 shows endopeptidase activity at a pH optimum of 3.0 (8Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Oda K. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2000; 268: 904-908Google Scholar) that mediates the autocatalytic processing of the 68-kDa TPP1 precursor to the mature 46-kDa active enzyme in vitro (9Lin L. Sohar I. Lackland H. Lobel P.

During processing, the primary eukaryotic 562-amino acid translation product is trimmed to the 368 C-terminal amino acids that contain the catalytic domain and all five potential N-glycosylation sites. The elimination of one particular glycosylation site at Asn286 results in complete loss of TPP1 activity, but the other glycosylation sites might also contribute to the stability of TPP1 (11Steinfeld R. Steinke H.B. Isbrandt D. Kohlschutter A. Gartner J. Hum. Mol. Genet.. 2004; 13: 2483-2491Google Scholar, 12Wujek P. Kida E. Walus M. Wisniewski K.E. Golabek A.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 12827-12839Google Scholar). At least 56 distinct disease-causing mutations in the TPP1 gene have been reported up to now, many of which disrupt folding, processing, and trafficking of TPP1 (11Steinfeld R. Steinke H.B.

The sequence homology of TPP1 to bacterial pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl peptidases suggests a similar catalytic mechanism involving a Glu, Asp, and Ser triad, with the conserved serine acting as catalytic nucleophile (14Rawlings N.D.

We have crystallized the fully glycosylated TPP1 precursor expressed in mammalian cells at conditions permissive for autocatalytic processing, and we determined the structure by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) analysis of the selenomethionine derivative and refined it against the 2.35 Å native data. We discuss here the structural features of TPP1 and the putative effect of mutations in the TPP1 gene. Materials—Cell culture medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides for the introduction of the C-terminal tag were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Munich, Germany). Molecular weight protein markers were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Endo H (cleaves within the core of high mannose oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins leaving one N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residue bound after cleavage) and PNGase F (completely cleaves off all types of oligosaccharide chains from N-linked glycoproteins) were supplied by New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Expression of TPP1—The amino acid sequence “RSHHHHHH” was introduced at the C terminus of the TPP1 cDNA to facilitate the purification of TPP1. Transfection of the modified TPP1 cDNA and selection of HEK 293 cells were performed as described previously (11Steinfeld R. Steinke H.B. Isbrandt D. Kohlschutter A. Gartner J. Hum. Mol. Genet.. 2004; 13: 2483-2491Google Scholar). Both the native and selenomethionine derivative recombinant protein samples of TPP1 were purified from the cell culture supernatant. The medium was cleared by centrifugation at 3000 × g and 4 °C for 60 min and then filtered with a 0.2-μm pore membrane. After having added 20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 40 mm imidazole, the crude solution was loaded on a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). Bound TPP1 was eluted with an imidazole gradient and was typically released at 70-90 mm imidazole. For crystallization the purified TPP1 fractions were pooled and concentrated using a centrifugal filter (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). The final solution contained 10 mg/ml TPP1 and was adapted to 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 4.6, and 50 mm NaCl. Deglycosylation of TPP1—Endo H and PNGase F digestions were performed at nondenaturing conditions according to the supplier's protocol with one exception; the PNGase F treatment of autoprocessed TPP1 was done at pH 7.0 to minimize TPP1 degradation. TPP1 activity was measured according to Vines and Warburton (3Vines D. Warburton M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1998; 1384: 233-242Google Scholar). Total activity of autoprocessed TPP1 was defined as 100% and the activities of other TPP1 variants were related to it. Mass Spectrometry—Glycosylated and deglycosylated TPP1 were incubated with trypsin (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) overnight at 37 °C and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) and electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The MALDI-MS analysis was performed on a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF instrument (Applied Biosystems, Frankfurt, Germany), and the LC-MS/MS analysis was done on an LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Scientific, Hamburg, Germany). Crystallization—All solutions used for crystallization purposes were sterile-filtered and contained 0.03% sodium azide. Crystals were grown by mixing 2 μl of 10 mg/ml TPP1 solution with 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 7% PEG4000, 0.02 m zinc sulfate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 0.1 m ammonium sulfate. Diffraction quality crystals appeared after 7 days. Both the native and selenomethionine derivative crystals crystallized under the same conditions. SDS-PAGE Analysis of Crystals—Selected crystals were washed in reservoir solution before dissolving them in 5 μl of water and loading them in SDS buffer. SDS-PAGE showed the coexistence of both the cleaved mature and uncleaved immature TPP1 molecules in the crystals. Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement—The crystals (both native and selenomethionine derivative) were flash cryo-cooled using 25% glycerol and 5% MPD (in steps of 5% increasing gradient) using MiTeGen loops. A native dataset to 2.35 Å was recorded on the beamline PX2 at the Swiss Light Source on a MAR225 mosaic CCD detector. The selenomethionine derivative datasets (peak and inflection point at selenium edge) were collected with a MAR165 CCD detector on the beamline 14.2 at BESSY, Berlin, Germany. Data were processed, scaled, and analyzed using the programs HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar), SAD-ABS, and XPREP (Bruker AXS, Madison WI). The peak and inflection point datasets collected at the absorption edge of selenomethionine were used for the initial phasing and model building of TPP1. The structure solution using SHELXD (21Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Google Scholar) identified eight selenium sites, consistent with the presence of a dimer in the asymmetric unit. With MAD phases calculated using these sites, the high resolution native dataset was used for phase extension with a new α test autotracing version of SHELXE (22Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A.. 2008; 64: 112-122Google Scholar) that was able to trace about half of the main chain. The crystal used for the MAD experiment diffracted poorly, accounting for the relatively high merging R values, but the Rp.i.m. values of under 2% indicate that this was more than compensated for by the high redundancy of the data. This was confirmed by the very clear SHELXD solution for the selenium substructure with a correlation coefficient of 42.0% and a peak height ratio of 0.768:0.189 between the lowest correct site and the highest noise peak. Using the selenomethionine positions, bulky side chains, and biochemical properties as a guideline, the model was completed manually using COOT (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Google Scholar). Refmac_5.2.0019 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) was used for structure refinement. The model was refined first isotropically to convergence and then treating each molecule in the asymmetric using as a translation, libration, and skew rigid group. The final model consists of 1050 amino acid residues, 8 N-acetyl-d-glucosamine substituents, 8 zinc ions, 2 calcium ions, and 2 sulfates. For the prosegment, amino acids Ser20 through Ser180 were observed, and for the catalytic domain residues, His197 through Pro563 and the first amino acid “Arg” of the purification tag was modeled. Computer Graphics—The graphical representation of the TPP1 structure was performed using the computer program PyMOL 1_1. Glycosylation of TPP1 Is Essential for in Vitro Autoprocessing and Protease Activity—Previous studies have pointed to the importance of N-glycosylation for intracellular folding and trafficking of TPP1 (12Wujek P. Kida E. Walus M. Wisniewski K.E. Golabek A.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 12827-12839Google Scholar, 25Tsiakas K. Steinfeld R. Storch S. Ezaki J. Lukacs Z. Kominami E. Kohlschutter A. Ullrich K. Braulke T. Glycobiology.. 2004; 14: C1-C5Google Scholar). In particular, replacement of Asn286 by Ser or Gln prevents intracellular processing of TPP1. To elucidate the importance of N-glycosylation for in vitro protease activity, we studied autoprocessing of purified TPP1 after complete deglycosylation and measured in vitro activity of autoprocessed TPP1 after deglycosylation. PNGase F-treated TPP1 precursor was unable to autoprocess at pH 3.5 and remained inactive, even after 24 h of incubation. Autoprocessed TPP1 almost completely lost its peptidase activity after deglycosylation with PNGase F (Fig. 1A). In contrast, partial deglycosylation by Endo H digestion did not prevent TPP1 autoprocessing nor did it significantly affect TPP1 protease activity (Fig. 1B). Control experiments with heat-inactivated PNGase F or Endo H ruled out that factors other than glycosidase activities were responsible for these effects (data not shown). These results indicate that TPP1 requires some N-linked glycosylation for cell-free peptidase activity. Tryptic digests of glycosylated and deglycosylated TPP1 were analyzed by MALDI-MS and electrospray ionization-LC-MS/MS for additional modifications that could explain the loss of TPP1 activity. No abnormalities were detected. Partial Autoprocessing of TPP1 Precursor during Crystallization—Human TPP1 was engineered with a C-terminal His6 tag, overexpressed in HEK 293 cells, and purified by metal ion affinity chromatography. Fully glycosylated TPP1 precursor was incubated at crystallization conditions that allowed slow autoprocessing. Crystals appeared after 7 days of incubation at pH 4.9 and room temperature. SDS-PAGE analysis of representative crystals showed the presence of TPP1 precursor as well as autoprocessed TPP1 along with the TPP1 prosegment (Fig. 2). This result points to the coexistence of unprocessed and processed TPP1 within the crystals and is consistent with experiments showing that TPP1 autoactivation is relatively slow at pH 4.5-5.5 and does not involve degradation of the TPP1 prosegment (10Golabek A.A. Wujek P. Walus M. Bieler S. Soto C. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 31058-31067Google Scholar). Overall Structure and Fold of TPP1—TPP1 is globular and has an overall fold similar to that of subtilisin and to members of the S53 family of sedolisin peptidases such as sedolisin and kumamolisin. The asymmetric unit contains two TPP1 monomers. Each monomer is a complex of two chains, the prosegment and the catalytic domain (Fig. 3A). The data collection and refinement statistics are displayed in Tables 1 and 2.TABLE 1Data collection statisticsData statisticsNativeSelenium peakSelenium inflectionWavelength1.00000 Å0.97971 Å0.97987 ÅBeamlineSLS-PX2BESSY-14.2BESSY-14.2DetectorMAR225 CCDMAR165 CCDMAR165 CCDSpace groupP21212P21212P21212a100.5 Å100.4 Å100.4 Åb113.5 Å113.3 Å113.1 Åc128.9 Å128.4 Å128.3 ÅResolution2.35 Å (2.45-2.35 Å)2.70 Å (2.80-2.70 Å)2.70 Å (2.80-2.70 Å)Reflections measured447,6001,339,9401,343,398Unique reflections60,71440,69540,750Redundancy7.26 (6.11)32.70 (20.60)32.75 (20.67)Completeness (%)98.4 (94.8)99.3 (96.5)99.3 (96.6)Mean I/σ (I)17.20 (3.15)31.02 (4.62)34.31 (4.44)Rint (%)5.55 (57.20)11.30 (60.85)11.02 (62.51)Rp.i.m.

It is composed of five α-helices formed by α1, α2, α3, α4, and α5 and two sets of antiparallel β-strands, formed by β1-β5-β6 and β7-β2-β4-β3, and stabilized by a disulfide bridge between Cys111 and Cys122 on β3 and β4, respectively (Fig. 3B). The catalytic domain contains residues His197 through Pro563 and has a calculated molecular mass of 39.7 kDa. It contains 10 α-helices and 14 β-strands. The core of the TPP1 molecule includes seven all-parallel β-strands β8-β9-β10-β11-β12-β15-β17 and is sandwiched and prominently flanked by four helices α8, α9, α11, and α13 near the active site. There are two disulfide linkages, the first between Cys365 and Cys526 and the second between Cys522 and Cys537, stabilizing the antiparallel α-strands β20 and β21 (Fig. 3, C and D). Two proline residues, Pro378 and Pro449, are found in cis conformation. The schematic topology of the TPP1 structure is given in Fig. 4. Each molecule has an octahedrally coordinated Ca2+-binding site, coordinated by carboxylate oxygens of Asp517 and Asp543, the main chain carbonyls of Val518, Gly539, and Gly541, and a water molecule (Fig. 5A). Also, there are four Zn2+-binding sites in each of the TPP1 units that are quite likely to be nonphysiological and a result of the crystallization procedure (Fig. 5B). As expected, glycosylations were observed at residues Asn210, Asn286, Asn313, and Asn443 and were modeled as N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. No electron density is observed for the glycosylation site at residue Asn222 in both monomers. The residues Ser181 to Leu196 could not be modeled as no density is observed for these residues (Fig. 3A). This might be explained by the variation of the cleavage sites at pH values 4.5-5.5 that result in a slow TPP1 processing and variable cleavage after residues Ser181, Glu189, and Gly195 (10Golabek A.A. Wujek P. Walus M. Bieler S. Soto C. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 31058-31067Google Scholar). However, no other structural ambiguity was found in any of the regions near the active site, indicating that autoprocessing is not associated with any major change in the secondary structure of TPP1. Attempts to refine group occupancies of the prosegment and the catalytic domain indicate that both are probably fully occupied, suggesting that the prosegment is homogeneously located within the crystals no matter whether the TPP1 precursor is cleaved or not. These data are in agreement with the lack of differences in the CD spectra measured after TPP1 autoprocessing (10Golabek A.A. Wujek P. Walus M. Bieler S. Soto C. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 31058-31067Google Scholar) and consistent with recent studies suggesting that the TPP1 prosegment remains tightly bound to the catalytic domain at pH 4.5 even after cleavage (26Golabek A.A. Dolzhanskaya N. Walus M. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 16497-16504Google Scholar). Multiple molecular contacts between the prosegment and the catalytic domain explain this strong binding that covers ∼21 and 15% of the total solvent accessible surface areas of the prosegment and the catalytic domain (if glycosylation is not taken into account), respectively (supplemental Fig. S1). The catalytic domain and the prosegment contribute 56 and 65 residues, respectively, to form the interface between the two domains. Salt bridges are formed predominantly between the guanidinium group of Arg339 and the carboxylates of Asp118, the ϵ-amino group of Lys346 and carboxylates of Asp118, carboxylates of Glu302, and the guanidinium group of Arg175. In addition, there are several hydrogen bonds stabilizing the complex between the prosegment and the catalytic domain (supplemental Table S1). The strongest interface interactions involve polar amino acid side chains and hence are sensitive to pH changes. Hence, lowering the pH will release the catalytic domain from the trap formed by the prosegment and will allow autoproteolytic cleavage of the linker. Homology of TPP1 to Members of the Sedolisin Family of Serine Proteases—Although the amino acid sequence identity of TPP1 relative to other members of the S53 family of peptidases is rather low, there is a considerable structural homology. The TPP1 precursor shares only 18.7% of its amino acid sequence with pro-kumamolisin that is currently the only reported structure of a full-length S53 peptidase. However, superposition of the reported structure of pro-kumamolisin (17Comellas-Bigler M. Maskos K. Huber R. Oyama H. Oda K. Bode W. Structure (Lond.).. 2004; 12: 1313-1323Google Scholar) with this full-length TPP1 structure reveals a 1.64 Å root mean square deviation of the 376 matching C-α atoms (supplemental Fig. S2). The TPP1 and kumamolisin prosegments (TPP1 residues 20-180) have a 1.67 Å root mean square deviation of the 125 matching C-α atoms, and the two catalytic domains (TPP1 residues 197-563) have a 1.47 Å root mean square deviation of the 270 matching C-α atoms. This indicates that the structural homology between the TPP1 precursor and pro-kumamolisin is high and that the catalytic domains of the two proteases match even better than their prosegments. The latter finding is underlined by the fact that the catalytic domains are longer and yet show a lower deviation. The crystal structure of TPP1 reveals a subtilisin like fold and contains a Ser475-Glu272-Asp360 catalytic triad similar to kumamolisin and sedolisin (15Wlodawer A. Durell S.R. Li M. Oyama H. Oda K. Dunn B.M. BMC Struct. Biol.. 2003; 3: 8Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). Ser475, the nucleophile, resides on helix α13, and Glu272, the general base catalyst along with Asp276, lies on helix α8. Asp360 lies on a loop connecting the strands β12 and β13, whereas Asp327 is observed on the loop connecting strand β11 to helix α10 (Fig. 3D). Superposition of the catalytic center of TPP1 with that of kumamolisin, sedolisin, and subtilisin discloses the high degree of structural homology among them (Fig. 6, A and B). The overall structure of the catalytic domains of TPP1, kumamolisin, and sedolisin resemble with each other, and even the subtilisin fold contains similar regions (supplemental Fig. S3, A-C). Although the TPP1 prosegment bears good similarity to the kumamolisin prosegment, both differ significantly from the corresponding regions of subtilisin (supplemental Fig. 3D). The calcium ion is observed at a position homologous to that of other reported sedolisin structures (Fig. 3, C and D, and Fig. 5A). We have demonstrated the importance of N-glycosylation for in vitro autoprocessing and protease activity of TPP1. These results extend previous studies on the intracellular processing of TPP1 that showed the effect of mutagenesis of one or several N-glycosylation sites on intracellular folding and trafficking of TPP1 (12Wujek P. Kida E. Walus M. Wisniewski K.E. Golabek A.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 12827-12839Google Scholar). Our experimental data reveal that in vitro unprocessed or processed TPP1 loses its protease activity after complete deglycosylation by PNGase F treatment. This loss of activity cannot be explained by instability, because deglycosylated TPP1 precursor showed no evidence for accelerated degradation (Fig. 1A). In addition, previously autoactivated and thus presumably properly folded TPP1 protease becomes inactive after complete deglycosylation with PNGase F. Interestingly, partial deglycosylation by Endo H treatment is not associated with a disturbed autoprocessing and loss of protease activity. This suggests that either the complex N-linked oligosaccharides that are not cleaved by Endo H or the terminal N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues that remain after Endo H cleavage are critical for autoprocessing and protease activity of TPP1. This finding is supported by the fact that Endo H-deglycosylated TPP1 precursor is indistinguishable from fully glycosylated TPP1 in terms of autocatalytic processing of the precursor and enzymatic properties of the mature protease (accompanying paper by Guhaniyogi et al. (28Guhaniyogi J. Sohar I. Das K. Stock A.M. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2009; 284 (in press)Google Scholar)). It can be speculated that complete deglycosylation might lead to a significant conformational alteration or that N-linked oligosaccharides are involved in the catalytic process that is mediated by TPP1. Further studies are required to determine the precise oligosaccharide components and molecular interactions that are essential for TPP1 activity. We have crystallized fully glycosylated TPP1 at conditions that allow slow autoprocessing and obtained an ∼50:50% mixture of unprocessed and processed TPP1 within the crystals. Nevertheless, the resulting crystal structure did not suffer from any major structural ambiguities, and only the linker region carrying the potential cleavage sites for autoprocessing was poorly defined. As pointed out by Guhaniyogi et al. (28Guhaniyogi J. Sohar I. Das K. Stock A.M. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem.. 2009; 284 (in press)Google Scholar), there is a good agreement between the structures of the glycosylated TPP1 precursor and the Endo H-deglycosylated one (PDB ID 3EDY). Furthermore, the crystal structure of pro-kumamolisin, the most homologous bacterial member of the sedolisin family, showed that the connecting linker runs through the entire active site cleft (17Comellas-Bigler M. Maskos K. Huber R. Oyama H. Oda K. Bode W. Structure (Lond.).. 2004; 12: 1313-1323Google Scholar). Superposition of pro-kumamolisin with the active kumamolisin revealed that the catalytic domain of the proenzyme exhibits an almost identical structure and is already properly prefolded within the proenzyme (18Comellas-Bigler M. Fuentes-Prior P. Maskos K. Huber R. Oyama H. Uchida K. Dunn B.M. Oda K. Bode W. Structure (Lond.).. 2002; 10: 865-876Google Scholar). Considering the high degree of structural homology between kumamolisin and TPP1, it can be assumed that also the TPP1 linker runs through the active site cleft of TPP1 and hence is partially cleaved and therefore disordered within our crystals. However, the cleaved off prosegment remains bound to the catalytic domain at pH 4.5 (or higher pH), as has been demonstrated recently (26Golabek A.A. Dolzhanskaya N. Walus M. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 16497-16504Google Scholar). In conclusion, our data suggest that uncleaved and cleaved off TPP1 prosegments show virtually identical structures and positioning and that the catalytic domains of unprocessed and processed TPP1 possess very similar structures as well. The lack of significant structural differences between unprocessed and processed TPP1 is supported by the absence of alterations in CD spectroscopy observed after TPP1 processing (10Golabek A.A. Wujek P. Walus M. Bieler S. Soto C. Wisniewski K.E. Kida E. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 31058-31067Google Scholar). However, we find densities for two conformations of Asp276, one position superposing with the equivalent residues in kumamolisin (Asp82) and sedolisin (Asp84) and the other superposing with the Endo H-deglycosylated TPP1 precursor (PDB 3EDY) that is not autoactivated (Fig. 8). Although we did not model alternative conformations in view of the modest resolution, it is likely that these two conformations reflect the active and inactive state of the catalytic center. As described below, Asp276 is involved in the catalytic process that requires the proper positioning in the catalytic center. The high degree of structural homology between TPP1 and other members of the sedolisin family also implies that the catalytic mechanism that mediates the proteolytic cleavage is very similar. The active site of TPP1 includes the three amino acids Ser475, Glu272, and Asp360 from which the name of the SEDolisin family of peptidases is derived. During the catalytic process, the Ser475 hydroxyl group loses the O-γ proton and so becomes a stronger nucleophile. The only plausible proton acceptors are the carboxylic oxygens of Glu272. In the approaching polypeptide substrate, the scissile peptide bond is oriented toward Ser475 O-γ with its carbonyl group inserting into the oxyanion hole, fixed by subsite interactions of both flanking peptide moieties (Fig. 7). This would allow the nucleophilic Ser475 O-γ to attack the polarized carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond to form a tetrahedral intermediate and to pass through the transition state with simultaneous proton transfer from the acidic Ser475 oxonium cation via the Glu272 carboxylic group to Asp276. The Asp360 side chain helps to create the oxyanion hole, stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate of the reaction. Apart from the nucleophilic Ser475, all other residues participating in the catalytic mechanism are acidic amino acids. To mediate the catalytic electron transfer in both directions, these residues have to exist at equilibrium between the protonated and deprotonated states. Thus the surrounding pH should be close to their pKa values, which explains the requirement for an acidic environment for catalysis. The fundamental difference between TPP1 and other members of the sedolisin family of peptidases is the orientation of cleavage. Whereas all known prokaryotic members of the sedolisin family are putative carboxyl peptidases, TPP1 preferentially cleaves tripeptides from the N-terminal end of proteins. This preference can be explained by a unique hydrogen bond between Tyr325 and Asp327 (distance 3.24 Å) that can sterically constrain the P4 residue of the substrate (Fig. 8). Tyr325 interacts with Phe304 by π-stacking and is localized within a hydrophobic pocket with several stacked aromatic systems. All these interactions occlude the putative S4 subsite and thus explain the preference for substrates with P1-P3 residues and a free unsubstituted N terminus at P3. Crystallization of complexes between TPP1 and substrates/inhibitors might prove this hypothesis. More than 50% of the known TPP1 mutations represent single amino acid substitutions that result in the biosynthesis of TPP1 mutants. None of these missense mutants shows any measurable residual TPP1 activity, and all are associated with severe symptoms such as developmental regression, epileptic seizures, ataxia, and progressive loss of motor abilities, speech and vision. On the basis of the resolved TPP1 structure, we have described the molecular effects of all currently known missense mutations (Table 3 and Fig. 9). The majority of these mutations would disrupt folding leading to instability and rapid degradation. The amino acid substitutions V277M, Q248P, G284V, G473R, and S475L probably compromise the active center and result in loss of proteolytic activity. Only two mutations, G77R and S153P, are located within the prosegment and are likely to disturb processing of TPP1. The N286S substitution results in loss of one glycosylation site, which leads to almost complete loss of protease activity without obvious alterations. Also, no apparent conformational destabilization is observed for the missense mutations V216M, R266Q, and K428N. Further biochemical and structural analyses are underway to elucidate the mechanisms that explain the functional loss of TPP1. The thorough biochemical and structural analyses of these mechanisms are fundamental for the design of small molecule compounds that are meant to rescue TPP1 activity and hence to prevent or protract disease progression. The resolution of the TPP1 structure has not only extended our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis but could also lead to novel therapeutic options for this devastating disorder.TABLE 3Molecular effect of single amino acid substitutionsMutationStructural positionPutative functional consequenceG77RPosition in the last turn of α1, side chain is oriented outwardsDisturbed binding/interaction between mutant prosegment and catalytic domain (26Golabek A.A.

https://openalex.org/W2023301418,"Individual neurons express receptors for several different growth factors that influence the survival, growth, neurotransmitter phenotype, and other properties of the cell. Although there has been considerable progress in elucidating the molecular signal transduction pathways and physiological responses of neurons and other cells to individual growth factors, little is known about if and how signals from different growth factors are integrated within a neuron. In this study, we determined the interactive effects of nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, and epidermal growth factor on the activation status of downstream kinase cascades and transcription factors, cell survival, and neurotransmitter production in neural cells that express receptors for all three growth factors. We document considerable differences in the quality and quantity of intracellular signaling and eventual phenotypic responses that are dependent on whether cells are exposed to a single or multiple growth factors. Dual stimulations that generated the greatest antagonistic or synergistic actions, compared with a theoretically neutral summation of their two activities, yielded the largest eventual change of neuronal phenotype indicated by the ability of the cell to produce norepinephrine or resist oxidative stress. Combined activation of insulin-like growth factor 1 and epidermal growth factor receptors was particularly notable for antagonistic interactions at some levels of signal transduction and norepinephrine production, but potentiation at other levels of signaling and cytoprotection. Our findings suggest that in true physiological settings where multiple growth factors are present, activation of one receptor type may result in molecular and phenotypic responses that are different from that observed in typical experimental paradigms in which cells are exposed to only a single growth factor at a time."
https://openalex.org/W2094294388,"Myotubularin-related protein 6 (MTMR6) is a catalytically active member of the myotubularin (MTM) family, which is composed of 14 proteins. Catalytically active myotubularins possess 3-phosphatase activity dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-3-phoshate and phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate, and some members have been shown to form homomers or heteromeric complexes with catalytically inactive myotubularins. We demonstrate that human MTMR6 forms a heteromer with an enzymatically inactive member myotubularin-related protein 9 (MTMR9), both in vitro and in cells. MTMR9 increased the binding of MTMR6 to phospholipids without changing the lipid binding profile. MTMR9 increased the 3-phosphatase activity of MTMR6 up to 6-fold. We determined that MTMR6 is activated up to 28-fold in the presence of phosphatidylserine liposomes. Together, MTMR6 activity in the presence of MTMR9 and assayed in phosphatidylserine liposomes increased 84-fold. Moreover, the formation of this heteromer in cells resulted in increased protein levels of both MTMR6 and MTMR9, probably due to the inhibition of degradation of both proteins. Furthermore, co-expression of MTMR6 and MTMR9 decreased etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas decreasing both MTMR6 and MTMR9 by RNA interference led to increased cell death in response to etoposide treatment when compared with that seen with RNA interference of MTMR6 alone. Thus, MTMR9 greatly enhances the functions of MTMR6."
