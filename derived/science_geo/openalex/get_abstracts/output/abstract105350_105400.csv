https://openalex.org/W2074705578,"To identify genes involved in cardiac arrhythmia, we investigated patients with long QT syndrome (LQT), an inherited disorder causing sudden death from a ventricular tachyarrythmia, torsade de pointes. We previously mapped LQT loci on chromosomes 11 (LQT1), 7 (LQT2), and 3 (LQT3). Here, linkage and physical mapping place LQT2 and a putative potassium channel gene, HERG, on chromosome 7q35-36. Single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses reveal HERG mutations in six LQT families, including two intragenic deletions, one splice-donor mutation, and three missense mutations. In one kindred, the mutation arose de novo. Northern blot analyses show that HERG is strongly expressed in the heart. These data indicate that HERG is LQT2 and suggest a likely cellular mechanism for torsade de pointes."
https://openalex.org/W2093214695,"Long QT syndrome (LQT) is an inherited disorder that causes sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias, specifically torsade de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. We previously mapped three LQT loci: LQT1 on chromosome 11p15.5, LQT2 on 7q35-36, and LQT3 on 3p21-24. Here we report genetic linkage between LQT3 and polymorphisms within SCN5A, the cardiac sodium channel gene. Single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses reveal identical intragenic deletions of SCN5A in affected members of two unrelated LQT families. The deleted sequences reside in a region that is important for channel inactivation. These data suggest that mutations in SCN5A cause chromosome 3-linked LQT and indicate a likely cellular mechanism for this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2011965698,"The neurotrophins are signaling factors important for the differentiation and survival of distinct neuronal populations during development. To test whether the neurotrophins also function in the mature nervous system, the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophic factor 3 (NT-3) on the strength of synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices were determined. Application of BDNF or NT-3 produced a dramatic and sustained (2 to 3 hours) enhancement of synaptic strength at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses; NGF was without significant effect. The enhancement was blocked by K252a, an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases. BDNF and NT-3 decreased paired-pulse facilitation, which is consistent with a possible presynaptic modification. Long-term potentiation could still be elicited in slices previously potentiated by exposure to the neurotrophic factors, which implies that these two forms of plasticity may use at least partially independent cellular mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2100869656,The binding of erythropoietin (EPO) to its receptor (EPO-R) activates the protein tyrosine kinase JAK2. The mechanism of JAK2 inactivation has been unclear. We show that the hematopoietic protein tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP1 (also called HCP and PTP1C) associates via its SH2 domains with the tyrosine-phosphorylated EPO-R. In vitro binding studies suggest that Y429 in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO-R is the binding site for SH-PTP1. Mutant EPO-Rs lacking Y429 are unable to bind SH-PTP1; cells expressing such mutants are hypersensitive to EPO and display prolonged EPO-induced autophosphorylation of JAK2. Our results suggest that activation of SH-PTP1 by binding to the EPO-R plays a major role in terminating proliferative signals.
https://openalex.org/W2050291003,"Murine cells homozygous for the severe combined immune deficiency mutation (scid) and V3 mutant hamster cells fall into the same complementation group and show similar defects in V(D)J recombination and DNA double-stranded break repair. Here we show that both cell types lack DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity owing to defects in DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of this enzyme. Furthermore, we demonstrate that yeast artificial chromosomes containing the DNA-PKcs gene complement both the DNA repair and recombination deficiencies of V3 cells, and we conclude that DNA-PKcs is encoded by the XRCC7 gene. As DNA-PK binds to DNA ends and is activated by these structures, our findings provide novel insights into V(D)J recombination and DNA repair processes."

https://openalex.org/W2118862408,"The bHLH-ZIP protein Mad heterodimerizes with Max as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor. Mad is rapidly induced upon differentiation, and the associated switch from Myc-Max to Mad-Max heterocomplexes seem to repress genes normally activated by Myc-Max. We have identified two related mammalian cDNAs that encode Mad-binding proteins. Both possess sequence homology with the yeast transcription repressor Sin3, including four conserved paired amphipathic helix (PAH) domains. mSin3A and mSin3B bind specifically to Mad and the related protein Mxi1. Mad-Max and mSin3 form ternary complexes in solution that specifically recognize the Mad-Max E box-binding site. Mad-mSin3 association requires PAH2 of mSin3A/mSin3B and the first 25 residues of Mad, which contains a putative amphipathic alpha-helical region. Point mutations in this region eliminate interaction with mSin3 proteins and block Mad transcriptional repression. We suggest that Mad-Max represses transcription by tethering mSin3 to DNA as corepressors and that a transcriptional repression mechanism is conserved from yeast to mammals."

https://openalex.org/W1973918689,"During the development of the visual system of higher mammals, axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) become segregated into eye-specific patches (the ocular dominance columns) within their target, layer 4 of the primary visual cortex. This occurs as a consequence of activity-dependent synaptic competition between axons representing the two eyes. The possibility that this competition could be mediated through neurotrophin-receptor interactions was tested. Infusion of neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into cat primary visual cortex inhibited column formation within the immediate vicinity of the infusion site but not elsewhere in the visual cortex. Infusion of nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), or vehicle solution did not affect column formation. These observations implicate TrkB, the common receptor for BDNF and NT-4/5, in the segregation of LGN axons into ocular dominance columns in layer 4. Moreover, they suggest that in addition to their better known roles in the prevention of cell death, neurotrophins may also mediate the activity-dependent control of axonal branching during development of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1967198448,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) act as signals in the developing limb and can maintain proliferation of limb bud mesenchyme cells. Remarkably, beads soaked in FGF-1, FGF-2, or FGF-4 and placed in the presumptive flank of chick embryos induce formation of ectopic limb buds, which can develop into complete limbs. The entire flank can produce additional limbs, but generally wings are formed anteriorly and legs posteriorly. FGF application activates Sonic hedgehog in cells with polarizing potential to make a discrete polarizing region. Hoxd-13 is also expressed in the ectopic bud, and an apical ectodermal ridge forms. A limb bud is thus established that can generate the appropriate signals to develop into a complete limb. The additional limbs have reversed polarity. This can be explained by the distribution of cells in the flank with potential polarizing activity. The results suggest that local production of an FGF may initiate limb development."

The pathogenesis of H. pylori infection in vivo was studied by adapting fresh clinical isolates of bacteria to colonize the stomachs of mice. A gastric pathology resembling human disease was observed in infections with cytotoxin-producing strains but not with noncytotoxic strains. Oral immunization with purified H. pylori antigens protected mice from bacterial infection. This mouse model will allow the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines against H. pylori infection in humans."

Because the morphology and embryology of lophophorates are phylogenetically ambiguous, their origin is a major unsolved problem of metazoan phylogenetics. The complete 18S ribosomal DNA sequences of all three lophophorate phyla were obtained and analyzed to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of this subkingdom. Sequence analyses show that lophophorates are protostomes closely related to mollusks and annelids. This conclusion deviates from the commonly held view of deuterostome affinity."

https://openalex.org/W2061629295,"Taking advantage of the restricted expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 6 (mGluR6) in retinal ON bipolar cells, we generated knockout mice lacking mGluR6 expression. The homozygous mutant mice showed a loss of ON responses but unchanged OFF responses to light. The mutant mice displayed no obvious changes in retinal cell organization nor in the projection of optic fibers to the brain. Furthermore, the mGluR6-deficient mice showed visual behavioral responses to light stimulation as examined by shuttle box avoidance behavior experiments using light exposure as a conditioned stimulus. The results demonstrate that mGluR6 is essential in synaptic transmission to the ON bipolar cell and that the OFF response provides an important means for transmitting visual information."

https://openalex.org/W2072247634,"The role of antimicrobial peptides in epithelial defense is not fully understood. An epithelial beta-defensin, lingual antimicrobial peptide (LAP), was isolated from bovine tongue and the corresponding complementary DNA cloned. LAP showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial and antifungal activities. LAP messenger RNA abundance was markedly increased in the epithelium surrounding naturally occurring tongue lesions. This increase coincided with the cellular hallmarks of acute and chronic inflammation in the underlying lamina propria, supporting a role for epithelial antimicrobial peptides as integral components of the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1981047025,"G-PROTEIN-COUPLED receptors are thought to have an inactive conformation (R), requiring an agonist-induced conformational change for receptor/G-protein coupling1–3. But new evidence suggests a two-state model4–19 in which receptors are in equilibrium between the inactive conformation (R), and a spontaneously active conformation (R*) that can couple to G protein in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1). Classic agonists have a high affinity for R* and increase the concentration of R*, whereas inverse agonists have a high affinity for R and decrease the concentration of R*. Neutral competitive antagonists have equal affinity for R and R* and do not displace the equilibrium, but can competitively antagonize the effects both of agonists and of inverse agonists. The lack of suitable in vivo model systems has restricted the evidence for the existence of inverse agonists to computer simulations7,8 and in vitro systems5,9–12,20–23. We have used a transgenic mouse model in which there is such marked myocardial overexpression of β2-adrenoceptors that a significant population of spontaneously activated receptor (R*) is present, inducing a maximal response without agonist24. We show that the β2-adrenoceptor ligand ICI-118,551 functions as an inverse agonist, providing evidence supporting the existence of inverse agonists and validating the two-state model of G-protein-coupled receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1979521848,"Posterior patterning in Drosophila embryos is governed by nanos (nos), which acts by repressing the translation of maternal transcripts of the hunchback (hb) gene. Sites in hb mRNA that mediate this repression, named nanos response elements (NREs), have been identified. However, we know of no evidence of a direct interaction between nos, or any other protein, and the NRE. Here, we show that two proteins present in embryonic extracts, neither one nos, bind specifically to the NRE in vitro. Furthermore, we show that binding in vitro correlates with NRE function in vivo. One of the NRE-binding factors is encoded by pumilio (pum), a gene that, like nos, is essential for abdominal segmentation. These and other observations suggest that pum acts by recognizing the NRE and then recruiting nos. Presumably, the resulting complex inhibits some component of the translation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2117610468,"Resistance to isoniazid in Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be mediated by substitution of alanine for serine 94 in the InhA protein, the drug's primary target. InhA was shown to catalyze the beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-specific reduction of 2-trans-enoyl-acyl carrier protein, an essential step in fatty acid elongation. Kinetic analyses suggested that isoniazid resistance is due to a decreased affinity of the mutant protein for NADH. The three-dimensional structures of wild-type and mutant InhA, refined to 2.2 and 2.7 angstroms, respectively, revealed that drug resistance is directly related to a perturbation in the hydrogen-bonding network that stabilizes NADH binding."
https://openalex.org/W2065314419,"MALARIAL parasites growing inside erythrocytes digest up to 80% of the host cell's haemoglobin within a lysosomal organelle, the digestive vacuole1,2. They sequester the potentially toxic haem (Fe (II) protohaematoporphyrin) that is released during this process into an insoluble pigment called haemozoin, which consists of polymerized Fe (III) protohaematoporphyrin subunits3. We have studied this process of haem polymerization, which was previously reported to be enzyme-mediated and the target of the quinoline antimalarial drugs chloroquine and quinine4. Here we show that, rather than being enzyme-mediated, haem polymerization is actually a chemical process, dependent only on the presence of haem-derived material associated with haemozoin and not on protein. This discovery does not invalidate haem polymerization as a target for drug intervention and the mechanism by which haemozoin formation is initiated is still not understood, but our view of this process and of the action of chloroquine must be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W1984903030,Documented interactions among members of the Myc superfamily support a yin-yang model for the regulation of Myc-responsive genes in which transactivation-competent Myc-Max heterodimers are opposed by repressive Mxi1-Max or Mad-Max complexes. Analysis of mouse mxi1 has led to the identification of two mxi1 transcript forms possessing open reading frames that differ in their capacity to encode a short amino-terminal alpha-helical domain. The presence of this segment dramatically augments the suppressive potential of Mxi1 and allows for association with a mammalian protein that is structurally homologous to the yeast transcriptional repressor SIN3. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the antagonistic actions of Mxi1 on Myc activity that appears to be mediated in part through the recruitment of a putative transcriptional repressor.

https://openalex.org/W1993678582,"Seven transmembrane receptors and their associated heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) have been proposed to play a key role in modulating the activities of neurons and muscles. The physiological function of the Caenorhabditis elegans G protein Go has been genetically characterized. Mutations in the goa-1 gene, which encodes an alpha subunit of Go (G alpha o), cause behavioral defects similar to those observed in mutants that lack the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT), and goa-1 mutants are partially resistant to exogenous 5-HT. Mutant animals that lack G alpha o and transgenic animals that overexpress G alpha o [goa-1(xs) animals] have reciprocal defects in locomotion, feeding, and egg laying behaviors. In normal animals, all of these behaviors are regulated by 5-HT. These results demonstrate that the level of Go activity is a critical determinant of several C. elegans behaviors and suggest that Go mediates many of the behavioral effects of 5-HT."
https://openalex.org/W2026068903,"The goa-1 gene encoding the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate-binding protein (G protein) Go from Caenorhabditis elegans is expressed in most neurons, and in the muscles involved in egg laying and male mating. Reduction-of-function mutations in goa-1 caused a variety of behavioral defects including hyperactive movement, premature egg laying, and male impotence. Expression of the activated Go alpha subunit (G alpha o) in transgenic nematodes resulted in lethargic movement, delayed egg laying, and reduced mating efficiency. Induced expression of activated G alpha o in adults was sufficient to cause these phenotypes, indicating that G alpha o mediates behavior through its role in neuronal function and the functioning of specialized muscles."

The arrest is mediated through interactions of various cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) and their inhibitors. We demonstrate that treatment with TGF-β induces increased levels of WAF1/Cip1/p21, a potent inhibitor of various cyclin-CDK kinase activities, in two colon cancer cell lines (LS1034 and LS513), which are sensitive to TGF-β-induced growth arrest. The induction in at least one of these cells lines (LS1034, p53-) is p53-independent. No WAF1 induction was observed after TGF-β treatment in a third cell line (HT-29), which is completely insensitive to the cytoinhibitory effect of TGF-β. In both LS513 and LS1034, WAF1 induction correlated with reduced cyclin E-associated kinase activity in vitro and suppression of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) protein phosphorylation in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1994019984,"An increase in fluorescence is observed upon light activation of bovine rhodopsin. The rate of increase is monoexponential (t1/2 = 15.5 min) at 20°C in 0.1% lauryl maltoside, pH 6.0, and parallels the rate of decay of metarhodopsin II. We show that the increase in fluorescence is due to the release of free retinal, which no longer quenches the tryptophan fluorescence. An extrinsic fluorescence reporter group, pyrene maleimide, attached to bovine rhodopsin also shows an increase in pyrene fluorescence on illumination. The rate of increase in pyrene fluorescence matches the rate of increase in tryptophan fluorescence. This result has been used to develop a micromethod, requiring on the order of 1 μg of rhodopsin, for measurement of metarhodopsin II decay.

Rhodopsin, the mammalian photoreceptor, undergoes, on illumination, isomerization of the retinal from the 11-cis to the all-trans form. This event causes the formation of a series of transient intermediates in the protein(2Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). One of these, metarhodopsin II, initiates a cascade of biochemical reactions which leads to the closing of the cation conductance channels in the plasma membrane of the rod cell(2Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 3Bennet N. Michel-Villaz M. Kuhn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The rate of metarhodopsin II decay is usually determined by measuring the decrease of the Schiff base linkage between retinal and the protein after acidification (4Blazynski C. Ostroy S.E. Vision Res. 1981; 21: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 5Blazynski C. Ostroy S.E. Vision Res. 1984; 24: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and not directly by absorption spectroscopy since the absorption maxima for metarhodopsin II (λmax 380 nm) and for free all-trans-retinal (λmax 387 nm) are similar. We show here that following illumination of rhodopsin there occurs an increase in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 1) and that the rate of this increase parallels the rate of decay of metarhodopsin II. That the increase in fluorescence is due to the release of free retinal has been confirmed by the following experiments. 1) Rhodopsin carrying the fluorescence reporter group, pyrene maleimide, at cysteine 140, on illumination shows an increase in pyrene fluorescence at a rate that matches the rate of increase of tryptophan fluorescence on metarhodopsin II decay. 2) The increase in tryptophan fluorescence is abolished when exogenously added 11-cis-retinal is present during metarhodopsin II decay. 3) The presence of hydroxylamine, which cleaves the Schiff base linkage in metarhodopsin II, during illumination of rhodopsin accelerates the increase in tryptophan fluorescence. The fluorescence increase provides a convenient method for measuring the rate of metarhodopsin II decay. The method is simple, sensitive, and requires only around 1 μg of rhodopsin.

The rate of retinal release on metarhodopsin II decay was determined by following the decrease in protonated retinyl Schiff base as measured at 440 nm after acidification(4Blazynski C. Ostroy S.E.

The cysteine mutant rhodopsin gene (C316S, C322S, C323S) containing Cys-140, the only reactive cysteine, has been described previously(8Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.-B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl.

It was expressed in COS cells, and the protein was purified on anti-rhodopsin 1D4-Sepharose(10Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A stock solution (23 mM) of PM was freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. A 1-μl aliquot of this solution was added to a suspension of 2 ml of 1D4-Sepharose containing 40 μg of bound cysteine mutant rhodopsin in 10 ml of buffer A (0.1% dodecyl maltoside, in 10 mM MES, pH. 6.0). The mixture was nutated overnight in the dark at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times (10 ml each time) with buffer A. The PM-derivatized rhodopsin mutant, now designated PM-rhodopsin, was eluted with the carboxyl-terminal octadecapeptide (300 μl of 40 μM solution in buffer A). The extent of labeling was 0.6 mol of PM/mol of rhodopsin as determined from the absorption spectrum using ∊max 500 nm, 40,600 and ∊max 340 nm, 36,000. These were performed on a SPEX 212x Fluorolog Instrument (Spex Industries Inc., Edison, NJ). Data manipulations were performed using the SPEX software or with Sigma Plot (Galactic Industries). Rhodopsin samples (150-200 μl of 0.1-1 μM) were used in temperature-controlled microfluorescence cuvettes. Low excitation light intensities were used throughout to prevent photolysis of rhodopsin. Slit settings for the fluorometer were 0.2 nm for the excitation and 12 nm for the emission measurements. Rhodopsin samples were excited at 295 nm to probe tryptophan fluorescence selectively. For the time base measurements, data were recorded at 330 nm for 2 s at 30-s intervals, with the excitation shutter closed between acquisitions to minimize exposure to the measuring beam. No detectable photobleaching of rhodopsin sample was observed under these conditions. The PM-rhodopsin was excited with 340 nm light, and emission was monitored at 384 nm. For conversion to metarhodopsin II, the samples were bleached as described(1Sakamoto T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The half-lives (τ1/2) of the fluorescence increases were fit to a single exponent using the computer program SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). All fits showed an r2 value >0.95. Fluorescence lifetimes were measured at the University of Nebraska with a time-correlated single photon counting Edinburgh Instruments 299T lifetime system(12Farrens D.L. Song P.-S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 54: 313-317Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Excitation was with a hydrogen flash lamp operated at 40 kHz. For tryptophan fluorescence, the excitation wavelength was selected as 292 nm using a monochromator, and fluorescence emission was monitored at 347 nm using an interference filter. Opsin was formed by bleaching rhodopsin with white light for 1 min and then waiting 2 h before measuring. The fluorescent N-retinylidene opsin species was produced by reduction of the Schiff base in rhodopsin with NaBH4 using the procedure of Bownds and Wald(13Bownds D. Wald G. Nature. 1965; 205: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), modified as follows. An ROS rhodopsin solution (400 μl of 0.5 μM rhodopsin in buffer A) containing 100 μl of 1 M KPO4, pH 7.0, was photobleached and then treated with 1 mg of NaBH4. The absorption spectrum showed that the reduction to the N-retinylidene opsin (λmax, 330 nm) was complete within a few min. Tryptophans in dark state rhodopsin exhibit only weak fluorescence, with an emission maximum centered at approximately 330 nm (Fig. 2A). Following illumination, there is a a small decrease in the fluorescence emission intensity (Fig. 2A), presumably because of a more efficient energy transfer from tryptophans to retinal in the metarhodopsin II state. Fluorescence then begins to increase; 2 h later when metarhodopsin II decay is complete, the tryptophan fluorescence is more than 4-fold over that observed in dark state rhodopsin (Fig. 2B). Similarly, Table 1 shows that the fluorescence lifetimes of tryptophans increase upon photoconversion of rhodopsin to opsin.Table I Open table in a new tab To confirm that the quenching of tryptophan emission in rhodopsin in the dark state is caused by energy transfer to retinal, we reduced the retinyl Schiff base linkage in rhodopsin to the fluorescent derivative. The excitation spectrum of the N-retinylidene opsin species monitored at 490 nm showed an excitation band at 330 nm and an extra excitation band at 280 due to energy transfer from the aromatic groups to the retinylidene group (not shown). This result is in agreement with the previous report by Ebrey(14Ebrey T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rate of increase in tryptophan fluorescence from photobleached rhodopsin is compared in Fig. 3 with the rate of decay of metarhodopsin II as measured by the decrease in the protonated Schiff base concentration. The two processes occur in parallel, with the τ1/2 of fluorescence increase at 15.5 min, whereas that of Schiff base hydrolysis at 15.9 min. Thus, the fluorescence increase occurs as a consequence of free retinal formation. Fig. 4 shows the effect of exogenously added 11-cis-retinal on fluorescence increase following photobleaching. Curve 1 is the control showing normal fluorescence increase as a function of time on metarhodopsin II decay. Curve 2 shows that the addition of 11-cis-retinal completely arrests the increase in fluorescence. As has been shown recently(1Sakamoto T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), when 11-cis-retinal is present during metarhodopsin II decay, the opsin formed binds 11-cis-retinal to regenerate the native rhodopsin. The formation of the latter ensures the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. As a consequence no increase in tryptophan fluorescence is seen in the experiment of curve 2 of Fig. 4. The increase in fluorescence is greatly accelerated when rhodopsin is bleached in the presence of 10 mM hydroxylamine (Fig. 5). Although rhodopsin in the dark is stable to hydroxylamine at neutral pH, the retinyl Schiff base in metarhodopsin II is accessible to hydroxylamine and is rapidly cleaved by it(15Wald G. Brown P.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This results in the rapid increase in fluorescence as seen in Fig. 5, in the presence of hydroxylamine. PM attached to rhodopsin has been reported to exhibit fluorescence energy transfer to retinal(16Borochov-Neori H. Montal M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Upon photobleaching of PM-rhodopsin, the pyrene fluorescence initially decreases (not shown), as for rhodopsin itself (Fig. 1). The fluorescence then increases as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6A shows the fluorescence increase from the tryptophan residues (295 nm excitation, 330 nm emission); Fig. 6B shows the fluorescence increase from the pyrene group (340 nm excitation, 384 nm emission). In both cases, fluorescence increases at virtually identical rates. Thus, the rate of metarhodopsin II decay as measured by the pyrene fluorescence increase is the same as measured by the increase of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The rate of fluorescence increase from photobleached ROS rhodopsin in buffer A was measured at nine different temperatures, ranging from 3 to 36°C. The rate of fluorescence increase was temperature-dependent (Fig. 7). The linear Arrhenius plot of the rates yielded an energy of activation for metarhodopsin II decay of 20.2 kcal/mol. We first confirmed the earlier conclusions of Ebrey (14Ebrey T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Kropf (17Kropf A. Vision Res. 1967; 7: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that fluorescence energy transfer occurs from tryptophan residues in rhodopsin to the retinal chromophore in the dark state rhodopsin molecule. Presumably, all five tryptophans located in different helices in the membrane-embedded domain (Fig. 1) are able to transfer fluorescence energy efficiently. Further, we found only a small change in the tryptophan fluorescence emission upon formation of metarhodopsin II per se, and the subsequent increase in fluorescence also observed previously (21Ebrey T.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1972; 15: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Chiba T. Asai H. Suuki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was a result of the release of free retinal. This increase occurred with a monoexponential rate that matched the rate of retinal release as determined by the surviving protonated Schiff base (Fig. 3). The conclusion that the release of free retinal is the cause of fluorescence increase was supported by additional observations. First, when 11-cis-retinal was present during metarhodopsin II decay, the increase in fluorescence was abolished. This is consistent with the observation that following the release of all-trans-retinal on metarhodopsin II decay, correctly folded opsin is formed which binds 11-cis-retinal to form the native rhodopsin(1Sakamoto T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, hydroxylamine, which is known to cleave the retinyl Schiff base linkage in metarhodopsin II, accelerated the increase in fluorescence on rhodopsin illumination (Fig. 4). To confirm that the increase in tryptophan fluorescence on photobleaching is due to the removal of the quencher, retinal, and not to some other change in the tryptophan environment, we attached to rhodopsin a pyrene fluorescence reporter group, also able to transfer energy to retinal. Upon photobleaching of the PM-rhodopsin, the pyrene fluorescence increased at a rate identical to the rate of tryptophan fluorescence increase from the same derivative (Fig. 6). The thermodynamics of the fluorescence increase were investigated by photobleaching rhodopsin samples at nine different temperatures (3-36°C) and measuring the rates of their fluorescence increase. The Arrhenius plot of the results (Fig. 7) indicates an activation energy of 20.2 kcal/mol. This value for metarhodopsin II decay is very similar to the activation energy of 20 kcal/mol determined previously for bovine rhodopsin in solution (18Hubbard R. Bownds D. Yoshizawa T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1965; 30: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and that of 16% 5 kcal/mol determined for rat rhodopsin in situ(19Ebrey T.G. Vision Res. 1968; 8: 965-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We anticipate a number of applications of the present method for measuring metarhodopsin II decay in the study of a variety of rhodopsin mutants currently under investigation in this laboratory. For example, some rhodopsin mutants are deficient in activating the G-protein transducin. The assay described here provides a rapid and convenient way to determine if these mutants are deficient due to an altered rate of metarhodopsin II decay. Further, tryptophan fluorescence measurement with and without exogenous retinal addition can be used as an alternate way to determine if retinal has been inserted into the retinal binding pocket. This is of particular advantage where retinal binding is accompanied by only slight opsin shifts(20Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We have greatly benefited from discussions with Professor U. L. RajBhandary (M. I. T.), Professor Mark Krebs (University of Wisconsin), and with our colleagues in this laboratory. We also thank Professor Pill-Soon Song, University of Nebraska, for discussions and for allowing us to measure the fluorescence lifetimes in his laboratory.

https://openalex.org/W1993941781,Philadelphia (Ph)-positive leukemias invariably contain a chromosomal translocation fusing BCR to ABL. The BCR-ABL protein is responsible for leukemogenesis. Here we show that exposure of bcr-null mutant mice to gram-negative endotoxin led to severe septic shock and increased tissue injury by neutrophils. Neutrophils of bcr (-/-) mice showed a pronounced increase in reactive oxygen metabolite production upon activation and were more sensitive to priming stimuli. Activated (-/-) neutrophils displayed a 3-fold increased p21rac2 membrane translocation compared with (+/+) neutrophils. These results connect Bcr in vivo with the regulation of Rac-mediated superoxide production by the NADPH-oxidase system of leukocytes and suggest a link between Bcr function and the cell type affected in Ph-positive leukemia.

These results provide the first direct measurement of trans-Golgi pH in living cells and demonstrate pH regulation by second messengers. INTRODUCTIONIt is well documented that a vacuolar-type proton pump maintains a relatively acidic pH in some organelles of the endosomal and secretory compartments(1Nelson N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An acidic pH relative to cytosol was demonstrated in trans-Golgi by accumulation of the lysosomotropic agent 3-(2,4-dinitroanilino)-3′-amino-N-methyl-dipropylamine(4Anderson R.G.W. Falck J.R.

Cell. 1985; 40: 635-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Two other lines of evidence suggest that trans-Golgi pH is >6.0, including analysis of pH-dependent fusion of viral spike proteins resulting in viral infectivity (6Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar) and pH-dependent ligand binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors(7White J. Kielan M. Helenius A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 151-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A mildly acidic pH in trans-Golgi may play an important role in the transport of secretory proteins into secretory granules and in the post-translational processing of newly synthesized proteins(3Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar).Cytosolic pH has been studied extensively by fluorescence methods over the past decade with the development of a variety of pH-sensitive dyes and cell-trapable acetoxymethylester derivatives(9Tsien R.Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 10Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Ed. 5. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1992: 159-171Google Scholar). New developments in fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy have enabled the mapping of pH in single cells (11Bright G.R. Fisher G.W. Rogowska J. Taylor D.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 157-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and in individual vesicles of the endosomal pathway(12Zen K. Biwersi J. Periasamy N.

Vol. 19: Endocytic Components: Identification and Characterization. Plenum Press, New York1993: 95-123Google Scholar). However, because the secretory compartments remain relatively inaccessible to fluid-phase fluorescent markers, there has been no method to selectively label in vivo the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and secretory vesicles for direct measurement of pH.We report here a novel method to deliver aqueous-phase fluorescent indicators into the lumen of the trans-Golgi compartment in living cells. Our strategy was inspired by a vesicle fusion method applied previously in semi-intact cells(14Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), where liposomes were shown to fuse selectively with the trans-Golgi. Here, trans-Golgi in living human skin fibroblasts was labeled by cytoplasmic microinjection of 70-nm diameter liposomes containing membrane-impermeable fluorophores. A pH-sensitive fluorophore (fluorescein sulfonate) and a pH-insensitive fluorophore (sulforhodamine 101) were introduced into the trans-Golgi for direct measurement of pH by ratio imaging confocal microscopy. Average trans-Golgi pH was found to be 6.17 ± 0.02, and an unexpected regulatory effect of second messengers was demonstrated.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and ReagentsNormal human skin fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection CCD 187 Sk) were grown at 37°C in DME-H21 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and used between passages 10 and 20. Fluorescein sulfonate (FS), ( 1The abbreviations used are: FSfluorescein sulfonateSRsulforhodamine 101C6-NBD-ceramideN-{6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl}-sphingosineTMR-PEN-(6-tetramethylrhodaminethiocarbamoyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineBSAdefatted bovine serum albuminCCCPcarbonyl cyaninide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneCPT-cAMP8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphateGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)PBSphosphate-buffered saline.) sulforhodamine 101 (SR), N-{6-[(7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl}-sphingosine (C6-NBD-ceramide), and N-(6-tetramethylrhodaminethiocarbamoyl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (TMR-PE) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Defatted bovine serum albumin (BSA), monensin, CCCP, bafilomycin A1, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (CPT-cAMP), N-ethylmaleimide, and GTPγS were obtained from Sigma, and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Polar (Alabaster, AL). Platelet-derived growth factor B/B was from Boehringer Mannheim.Preparation of LiposomesMultilamellar vesicles were prepared by dispersing dry dioleoylphosphatidylcholine in 25 mM HEPES, 115 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, (SR (5 mM) + FS (0 or 30 mM)) or TMR-PE (1 mol %), pH 7.2. Multilamellar vesicles were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 40°C for five cycles. Small uniform sized liposomes were obtained by extrusion through a series of polycarbonate filters (Nuclepore, Pleasanton, CA) of decreasing pore size (450 → 220 → 100 → 50 nm). External SR and FS were removed by Sephadex G-50 size-exclusion gel chromatography. Liposome diameter was measured to be 70 ± 1 nm (S.D.) by quasi-elastic dynamic light scattering (Coulter model N4, Hialeah, FL).Microinjection ProcedureCell microinjection was performed using glass needles prepared from thin-walled filament capillaries (FHC, Brunswick, ME) drawn to a fine tip (0.5-μm hole diameter) with a vertical needle puller (Kopf, Tujunga, CA) and back-filled with injection solutions. Filled needles were mounted in the holder of an Eppendorf micromanipulator (model 5170), and cells were injected using an automatic Eppendorf microinjector (model 5242) over 0.5 s. Cells used for microinjection were 2-day-old cultures (∼80% confluent) grown on 18-mm diameter glass coverslips.C6-NBD-ceramide LabelingTo stain the trans-Golgi membrane(15Pagano R.E. Sepanski M.A. Martin O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), 50 nmol of C6-NBD-ceramide was dissolved in 200 μl of ethanol and injected into 10 ml of 10 mM HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium containing 0.34 mg of BSA. The solution was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium. Cells were incubated with the C6-NBD-ceramide-BSA complex for 5 min at 37°C, washed with PBS, and mounted in the perfusion chamber for observation.Ratio Imaging Confocal MicroscopyFluorescence microscopy was carried out on a Leitz epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Nipkow wheel coaxial-confocal attachment (Technical Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Cells were mounted in a perfusion chamber and viewed with a Nikon Plan-Apo × 100 oil immersion objective (numerical aperture, 1.4). Confocal fluorescence images were detected by a cooled CCD camera (AT200; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) with a back-thinned 14-bit detector (TK512CB; Tektronix). (C6-NBD-ceramide or FS) and (SR or TMR-PE) were visualized with standard fluorescein and rhodamine filter sets, respectively. Image pairs (SR and FS) were acquired (exposure time, 500 ms) for the same field containing one or more cells. Dark current and shading corrections were applied. Analysis was performed using PMIS software (Photometrics) on each image pair; the trans-Golgi contour on the SR image was drawn, and the integrated pixel intensity (ISR) was calculated over the delimited area. The same area on the FS image was used for determination of integrated intensity, IFS. For calculation of the FS-to-SR signal ratio, (IFS - BFS)/(ISR - BSR), the background signals, BFS and BSR, were determined over a region of cytosol near the trans-Golgi contour.pH Calibration in SituAfter microinjection with liposomes containing FS and SR, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and then mounted in the perfusion chamber. Prior to calibration, cells were perfused for 20 min with 10 nM bafilomycin A1 in PBS at 23°C to inhibit the vacuolar proton pump. Cells were then incubated for 10 min with calibration solutions containing 10 nM bafilomycin A1, 10 μM monensin, 1 μM CCCP in 125 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2 titrated to specified pH values. FS-to-SR signal ratio was determined as a function of pH.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNormal human skin fibroblasts were microinjected with uniform-sized liposomes of 70 ± 1 nm diameter containing selected fluid-phase fluorescent probe(s). Liposomes containing 5 mM SR (a water-soluble fluorescent probe) fused with trans-Golgi and delivered their aqueous phase contents at 37°C with a half-time of ∼15 min. Maximum trans-Golgi fluorescence was observed at ∼30 min. Selective labeling of trans-Golgi was demonstrated with confocal microscopy by colocalization of SR (red) with the specific trans-Golgi lipid-phase stain C6-NBD-ceramide (green) (15Pagano R.E. Sepanski M.A. Martin O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A).After a 30-min cell incubation at 37°C, it was estimated that 30-50% of microinjected liposomes fused with trans-Golgi (based on the ratio of trans-Golgi specific to whole cell fluorescence using liposomes containing the lipid phase marker TMR-PE). Additional incubation at 37°C resulted in a progressive decline in trans-Golgi fluorescence (Fig. 1B) due to a combination of downstream and secretory traffic, and dye leakage. At 23°C, however, labeling was stable for >60 min. Liposome fusion was not detected when cells were incubated at 23°C instead of at 37°C after microinjection (Fig. 1C), and fusion was inefficient (relative efficiency ∼0.2) when ATP was not included in the microinjection buffer. The sensitivity of fusion efficiency to added ATP may result from increased cytoplasmic ATP concentration and/or from replacement of ATP loss associated with microinjection. Fusion was completely blocked by addition to the microinjection buffer of 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide but not by up to 1 mM GTPγS, suggesting that liposome fusion does not involve a GTP-dependent coating process(16Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Larger (200-nm diameter) and smaller (<40-nm diameter, prepared by probe sonication) liposomes did not fuse efficiently. Although we do not know the precise mechanism by which trans-Golgi is labeled selectively, the results above suggest that the liposomes introduced by microinjection may be misrecognized by the trans-Golgi as 70-nm diameter transport vesicles arising from an earlier compartment(16Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar).For measurement of pH, the combination of SR (pH insensitive, red fluorescence) and FS (pKa∼ 6.3, green fluorescence) was chosen based on their bright fluorescence, self-quenching at high concentrations(17Lee G.M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 443-447PubMed Google Scholar), non-overlapping fluorescence spectra, optimal pKa, and low membrane permeability(10Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Ed. 5. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1992: 159-171Google Scholar, 18Kuwahara M. Berry C.A. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1988; 54: 595-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After microinjection of liposomes containing SR and FS and a 30-min incubation at 37°C, pairs of confocal images were recorded by a cooled CCD camera (Fig. 2A). trans-Golgi pH was calculated by quantitative image analysis from the FS-to-SR signal ratio after background subtraction. Absolute pH determination required in situ calibration of trans-Golgi FS-to-SR signal ratio versus pH. trans-Golgi pH was set equal to extracellular pH using bafilomycin A1 (proton pump inhibitor, 10 nM) and the ionophore pair monensin (Na-H exchanger, 10 μM) + CCCP (protonophore, 1 μM) (Fig. 2B). The FS-to-SR signal ratio did not change when the concentrations of bafilomycin A1, monensin, and/or CCCP were increased by 3-fold or when incubation with ionophores was extended to 30 min. Monensin in the presence of bafilomycin A1 did not affect Golgi structure. Nigericin (K-H exchanger, 1 μM) could not be used for in situ calibration because it disrupted the Golgi structure, similar to results obtained using the Golgi-disrupting agents brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) and nocodazole (20 μg/ml). The apparent pKa of 6.3 measured in situ (Fig. 2C) was identical to that in cell-free aqueous solution. Time course studies indicated <5% indicator photobleaching or leakage occurred in 30 min under the conditions of our experiment.Figure 2:trans-Golgi pH in normal human skin fibroblasts measured at 23°C.

There was little pH variation in the lumen of the trans-Golgi compartment as shown by the representative pseudocolored ratio image in Fig. 2, right. Analysis of pH distributions obtained from separate cells indicated that mean trans-Golgi pH in 75% of cells was in the range 6.0-6.3. It is noted that the total intraliposomal volume microinjected into each cell (∼4 × 10−12 cm3) was much smaller than cell volume (∼5.2 × 10−10 cm3) or estimated Golgi volume (4 × 10−11 cm3(19Warren G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 439-443Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Taken together with the incomplete fusion efficiency (30-50%) and the low intraliposomal buffer capacity (∼6 mM/pH unit at pH 7.0) compared with that in Golgi (50 mM/pH unit, measured by NH4Cl pulse technique, see Fig. 3), it is unlikely that the liposome fusion process affects trans-Golgi pH.Figure 3:Effect of regulatory factors on trans-Golgi pH. Measurements were performed in microinjected cells after 30 min at 37°C and an additional 30 min in PBS containing indicated compounds at 23°C. Concentrations: 30 mM NH4Cl, 10 nM bafilomycin A1, 10 nM platelet-derived growth factor B/B (PDGF), 1 μM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 0.5 mM CPT-cAMP. Cl–-free buffer indicates replacement of Cl– by the membrane-impermeant anion isethionate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The influence of putative regulators of trans-Golgi pH was investigated (Fig. 3). As anticipated, inhibition of the vacuolar proton pump by bafilomycin A1 or addition of a weak base (NH4Cl) caused trans-Golgi alkalinization. trans-Golgi pH was mildly increased by protein kinase C activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and platelet-derived growth factor, whereas protein kinase A activation by forskolin or a cell-permeable cAMP analog (CPT-cAMP) remarkably elevated trans-Golgi pH to 6.8 ± 0.1. Interestingly, a smaller but significant cAMP-induced alkalinization was reported in early endosomes from Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts labeled with a fluorescent transferrin(12Zen K. Biwersi J. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine whether intracellular cAMP-stimulated Cl– channels (20Bae H.-R. Verkman A.S.

Cytosolic Cl– activity decreased from 55 to <5 mM by this maneuver as measured by SPQ fluorescence(23Chao A.C. Dix J.A. Sellers M. Verkman A.S. Biophys.

Cl– removal itself caused a small trans-Golgi alkalinization but did not abolish the large cAMP-dependent alkalinization.Our results establish an effective method to label the aqueous phase of trans-Golgi in living cells and provide the first direct measurement of trans-Golgi pH. The acidic lumenal pH is consistent with the identification of multiple pH-dependent events in the secretory pathway, including the sorting and storage of numerous secretory proteins(3Mellman I. J.

Biophys. 1983; 16: 151-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In addition, recent experiments on permeabilized cells suggest that pH between 6 and 6.2 in the trans-Golgi is optimal for enzymatic cleavage of prosomatostatin(29Xu H. Shields D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22875-22881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The introduction by liposome fusion of fluorescent indicators of calcium, monovalent ions, and membrane potential should enable measurements of trans-Golgi ion activities and mechanisms of protein processing and secretion. The strong alkalinization of trans-Golgi by cAMP agonists is an unexpected finding that may provide an explanation, when taken together with recent data on effects of lumenal pH on vesicular transport(30Clague M.J. Urbé S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol.

Last, the ability to quantify trans-Golgi pH should facilitate direct examination of the “defective organelle acidification hypothesis” proposed to be the cellular basis of cystic fibrosis(32Barasch J. Kiss B. Prince A. Saiman L. Gruenert D. Al-Awqati Q. Nature. 1991; 352: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). INTRODUCTIONIt is well documented that a vacuolar-type proton pump maintains a relatively acidic pH in some organelles of the endosomal and secretory compartments(1Nelson N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An acidic pH relative to cytosol was demonstrated in trans-Golgi by accumulation of the lysosomotropic agent 3-(2,4-dinitroanilino)-3′-amino-N-methyl-dipropylamine(4Anderson R.G.W. Falck J.R.

Cell. 1985; 40: 635-643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Two other lines of evidence suggest that trans-Golgi pH is >6.0, including analysis of pH-dependent fusion of viral spike proteins resulting in viral infectivity (6Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar) and pH-dependent ligand binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors(7White J. Kielan M. Helenius A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16: 151-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). A mildly acidic pH in trans-Golgi may play an important role in the transport of secretory proteins into secretory granules and in the post-translational processing of newly synthesized proteins(3Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar).Cytosolic pH has been studied extensively by fluorescence methods over the past decade with the development of a variety of pH-sensitive dyes and cell-trapable acetoxymethylester derivatives(9Tsien R.Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 10Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. Ed. 5. Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR1992: 159-171Google Scholar). New developments in fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy have enabled the mapping of pH in single cells (11Bright G.R. Fisher G.W. Rogowska J. Taylor D.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 157-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and in individual vesicles of the endosomal pathway(12Zen K. Biwersi J. Periasamy N.

Vol. 19: Endocytic Components: Identification and Characterization. Plenum Press, New York1993: 95-123Google Scholar). However, because the secretory compartments remain relatively inaccessible to fluid-phase fluorescent markers, there has been no method to selectively label in vivo the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and secretory vesicles for direct measurement of pH.We report here a novel method to deliver aqueous-phase fluorescent indicators into the lumen of the trans-Golgi compartment in living cells. Our strategy was inspired by a vesicle fusion method applied previously in semi-intact cells(14Kobayashi T. Pagano R.E. Cell. 1988; 55: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), where liposomes were shown to fuse selectively with the trans-Golgi. Here, trans-Golgi in living human skin fibroblasts was labeled by cytoplasmic microinjection of 70-nm diameter liposomes containing membrane-impermeable fluorophores. A pH-sensitive fluorophore (fluorescein sulfonate) and a pH-insensitive fluorophore (sulforhodamine 101) were introduced into the trans-Golgi for direct measurement of pH by ratio imaging confocal microscopy. Average trans-Golgi pH was found to be 6.17 ± 0.02, and an unexpected regulatory effect of second messengers was demonstrated."

Incubation of HEL-37 cells with dioctanoylglycerol (diC8) or SF 3155 cells with bradykinin caused translocation of calcium/phosphatidylserine-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) activity to particulate material. In both cell lines the translocation was blocked by SMase treatment of the cells or by incubation with the cell-permeable ceramide analogue N-acetylsphingosine (C2-Cer). Western blot analysis indicated that treatment of HEL-37 cells with diC8 or SF 3155 cells with bradykinin resulted in the translocation of both PKC-α and PKC-ε to particulate material. Treatment with SMase or C2-Cer specifically blocked the translocation of PKC-α but not that of PKC-ε. Pretreatment of cells with SMase or C2-Cer also inhibited the activation of phospholipase D activity induced by either diC8 (HEL-37 cells) or bradykinin (SF 3155 cells). The data provide strong evidence that ceramide can negatively regulate the translocation of PKC-α but not PKC-ε and further suggest that PKC-α may be involved in regulating phospholipase D activity.

https://openalex.org/W1963941717,"Through the application of new analytical techniques to high spatial resolution imaging spectrometer data, the ferrous mineralogy of major volcanic terrains on Mars is shown to consist of significant fractions of both low- and high-calcium pyroxene. Changes in the relative abundances of these pyroxenes are observed for units of different age and morphology, even in regions with higher degrees of alteration and contamination from dust. Volcanic rocks with these characteristics are uncommon on Earth but are typical of the basaltic SNC meteorites (shergottites, nakhlites, and chassignites) thought to be from Mars. Thus, it is possible to infer, even through the veil of dust, that the SNC meteorites have mineralogic affinities to major volcanic provinces on Mars and are therefore truly representative of the heterogeneity observed on the surface of the ""red planet""."

In exhaustive binding experiments, opsin activates transducin, with half-maximal exchange activity occurring at 0.8 mol of opsin/mol of transducin. The opsin activity was light-insensitive, hydroxylamine-resistant, unaffected by stoichiometric concentrations of retinaloxime, and more heat-labile than rhodopsin. The <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> of transducin activation in the presence of excess opsin was 8.5 min, compared with 0.7 min for metarhodopsin(II). The second-order rate constants were determined to be 0.012 pmol of guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) bound per min/nM opsin and 0.35 pmol of GTPγS bound per min/nM metarhodopsin(II). Opsin was able to activate more than one transducin, although there appeared to be a turnover-dependent inactivation of the apoprotein. Opsin showed a broad pH range (5.8-7.4) for optimal activity, with no activity in buffers of pH >9, whereas metarhodopsin(II) exhibited activity at pH >9. Regulation of opsin activity by stoichiometric amounts of retinal was observed, with inhibition by 11-<i>cis</i>-retinal and stimulation by all-<i>trans</i>-retinal.

Using small synthetic Holliday junctions in which the crossover point is confined near one end of the DNA molecule, we show that RuvAB-mediated branch migration occurs with a defined polarity. The assembly of RuvA and RuvB on the Holliday junction has been investigated by sedimentation analysis and by DNase I footprinting. We find that RuvA protein binds and protects all four strands of DNA at the crossover point, whereas RuvB protein binds the DNA asymmetrically. The polarity of branch migration is defined by the asymmetric assembly of the RuvAB branch migration complex relative to the junction and is consistent with a model in which RuvAB drives branch migration by passing the DNA through the hexameric rings of RuvB."

However, the effect of IL-13 on the reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) production, an important function of monocytes that are involved in infectious and inflammatory processes, has not yet been investigated. The NADPH-oxidase system is the key step in the regulation of ROI generation. The oxidase is normally dormant in resting phagocytes, but it can be rapidly activated by a number of stimuli such as protein kinase C agonists like phorbol esters, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). It is known that the oxidase requires interaction at the plasma membrane level between membrane and cytosolic components, these include flavocytochrome b558, the cytosolic proteins p47 and p67, and the small GTP-binding proteins Rap1A, Rac-1, and Rac-2 (for review, see (10Morel F.

Classically, protein kinase C phosphorylates specific proteins (p47, p67) that constitute the predominant regulatory mechanism governing the activation of the oxidase(13Dusi S. Della Bianca V.

While several studies have been oriented toward phosphorylation and activation of respiratory burst, the reversal of the event by dephosphorylation and inactivation of the active phagocyte to the normal resting state have not been fully elucidated. Agents that increase the intracellular concentration of cAMP have been shown to be negative modulators of TPA-triggered respiratory burst in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (14Savita G. Salimath B.P.

Signalling. 1992; 4: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The regulation of intracellular cAMP level involves at least two independent systems, a G protein pathway coupled with adenylate cyclase and the direct activation of catalytic subunits of adenylate cyclase. In particular, the Ca2+-calmodulin complex can activate specific I and III adenylate cyclase isozymes(16Wu Z. Wong S.T. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 268: 23766-23768Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). A coupling of phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase effector systems through Ca2+ has also been reported in leukocytes(17Verghese M.W. Fox K. Mc Phail L.C. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

In this study, we investigate the capacity of IL-13 to modulate respiratory burst in human monocytes and the signaling pathways used by the cytokine to modify this function. Our findings indicate that IL-13 inhibits TPA-triggered ROI production by a mechanism involving a rapid and transient phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ mobilization and the consequent protein kinase A activation. Purified recombinant human IL-13 (IL-13) was produced in transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified as described before(1Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M.

As optimal responses were obtained with 100 ng/ml, this concentration of IL-13 was used in all the experiments described. The lipopolysaccharide concentration (measured by Limulusamoebocyte lysate assay) was always less than 30 pg/μg of protein. The neutralizing anti-IL-13 antiserum was obtained in rabbits using the purified recombinant cytokine as immunogen. Briefly, 50 μg of IL-13 dissolved in 0.5 ml of saline and emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant were injected subcutaneously. Two, three, and four weeks after the first immunization, the same amount of IL-13 was injected in Freund's incomplete adjuvant.

N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89) was from France Biochem, Meudon, France. All other chemicals and solvents were reagent grade. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by a standard Ficoll-Hypaque (MSL, Eurobio, Les Ullis, France) gradient method. Human monocytes were isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by adherence to plastic for 2 h in special for macrophages medium, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, and antibiotics, at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing, and remaining adherent cells (monocytes purity was >95%) were cultured overnight. They were designated as monocytes according to CD14 antigen expression and nonspecific esterase staining(20Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Ströbel M. Kieper D. Fingerle G. Schlunck T. Petersmann I. Ellwart J. Blumenstein M. Haas J.G. Blood. 1992; 79: 503-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (6 × 105/assay) were seeded into luminometer sterile cuvettes, and ROI production was measured by chemiluminescence (CL) in the presence of luminol (60 μM), using a thermostatically (37°C) controlled luminometer 1251 LKB as described previously (21Forgue M.F. Pipy B. Beraud M. Pinelli E. Cambon C. Didier A. Souqual M.C. Vandaele J. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The generation of CL in human monocytes triggered with 100 nM TPA (time 0) was continuously monitored for 10 min, and the area under the curve (expressed in mV/s) was statistically analyzed using a Hewlett Packard 85 computer. Experiments were performed in Hanks' balanced salt solution medium with or without Ca2+. In some experiments, cells were incubated for 10 min before TPA in the presence of metabolic inhibitors such as Δ9-THC (1 μM), an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, H89 (10 μM), an inhibitor of protein kinase A, neomycin sulfate (10 μM), an inhibitor of phospholipase C, TMB8 (10 μM), an inhibitor of InsP3-induced calcium release from intracytoplasmic stores, and indomethacin (0.5 μM), an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway. In all cases IL-13 or vehicle (Hanks' balanced salt solution) was added 5 min before TPA. In parallel experiments, IL-13/anti-IL-13 antiserum complex was used alone at time 0 or added 5 min before TPA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (4 × 106/well) were seeded into 24-well culture plates. Adherent monocytes were incubated in RPMI 1640 inositol-free medium containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin in the presence of 7 μCi of myo-[2-3H]inositol/well, for 24 h at 37°C. The cells were washed 3 times and then stimulated by IL-13. The reaction was stopped at different times up to 5 min by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold methanol. Extraction of [3H]inositol phosphates was performed as described elsewhere(22Olivier M. Baimbridge K.G. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1188-1196PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 ml of chloroform and 0.3 ml of water were added to the methanol-treated cells in order to obtain a final chloroform/methanol/water ratio of 2:1:0.6. The top aqueous layer was collected, and [3H]inositol phosphates were reextracted from the chloroform/methanol phases using 0.6 ml of water. The inositol phosphates were separated using anion exchange SAX AmprepTM minicolumn (Amersham Corp.) and, successively eluted with ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid using ammonium formate increments from 0.1 to 1.2 M. In our conditions, [3H]InsP standards, InsP1, InsP2, InsP3, and InsP4 were eluted at 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid, respectively. Total eluate volume was mixed with complete phase-combining system scintillant, and radioactivity was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Intracellular calcium concentration was measured in single cells by a video digital microscopy technique using the fluorescent probe Fluo 3-AM. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (2 × 106 cells) were plated into 60-mm diameter plastic culture dishes, and adherent monocyte monolayers were loaded with 15 μM Fluo 3-AM for 1 h at 37°C(23Kao J.P.Y. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then washed 5 times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (with or without Ca2+). The time course of the intracytosolic Ca2+ level was recorded every 2 s for a total period of 2 min after the addition of IL-13. In parallel assays, cells were preincubated with 10 μM TMB8 for 10 min before the addition of IL-13. Ionomycine (2.5 μM) was added at the end of each experiment to assess the maximum intensity response. Cells were visualized with an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot 300). The light source was a xenon lamp XBO 100 watts (Osram, Munich, Germany). Excitation (488 nm) and emission (525 nm) wavelengths were selected by a XF23 filter block (Nikon). They were acquired by an intensified camera LHESA, LH 5038-STD (Cergy Pontoise, France). Images were digitized, and the fluorescence was analyzed using the Imstar starwise/fluo software system (Paris, France). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (4 × 106/well) were seeded into 24-well culture plates. Adherent cells were washed twice with incubation buffer (RPMI 1640, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM 1-isobutyl-3-methylxanthine) and incubated at room temperature with IL-13 for different periods of time (ranging from 1 to 15 min). Forskolin (10 μM) was used as positive control. To stop the reaction, the medium was discarded, and the cells were lysed with 95% cold ethanol. After an incubation of 5 min at 0°C, the lysate was removed, lyophilized, and finally dissolved in radioimmunoassay buffer(24Vita N. Laurent P. Lefort S. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Kaghad M. Le Fur G. Caput D. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). cAMP was quantified in triplicate using a cAMP 125I-labeled radioimmunoassay system from Amersham Corp. In parallel experiments, the kinetics of cAMP production were followed in cells preincubated for 10 min with neomycin sulfate (0.5 mM) or TMB8 (10 μM) before IL-13 addition. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and the multiple comparisons of each treatment were calculated applying the Tukey method(25Keppel G. Design and Analysis: A Researcher's Handbook. Prentise Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1973Google Scholar). TPA induces ROI production as measured by continuous CL kinetics generation. IL-13 had no effect on the basal oxidative response of unstimulated monocytes, whereas, when added 5 min before the protein kinase C agonist, the cytokine produced an inhibition of TPA-triggered ROI production (Fig. 1). The total CL emission, area under curve (Fig. 2), and CL maximum (data not shown) were both 35% lower compared with the TPA control. Moreover, we found that IL-13 antibody completely reversed the IL-13 inhibitory effect on oxidative burst. IL-13/anti-IL-13 antiserum complex per se was not able to induce ROI production (Fig. 1).Figure 2:Effect of IL-13 pretreatment on TPA-triggered chemiluminescence production in human monocytes in the absence (0Ca2+) or in the presence of extracellular calcium and metabolic inhibitors. Total CL emission (area under curve) was observed for 10 min after TPA (100 nM) () or IL-13 (100 ng/ml)+TPA () stimulation with or without (CONTROL) inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When inhibitors were used, monocytes were preincubated (10 min) with 1 μMΔ9-THC, 10 μMH89, 10 μM neomycin sulfate (NEO), 10 μMTMB8, 0.5 μM indomethacin (IND). Data are means ± S.E. of three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate.∗∗, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the possible involvement of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway in the inhibitory effect of IL-13 on TPA-triggered ROI production, cells were preincubated with Δ9-THC, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, or H89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A. The results obtained show that these inhibitors completely block the effect of IL-13 (Fig. 2). Moreover, forskolin (10 μM), a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, or dibutyryl cAMP (5 mM), a cell permeable analogue of cAMP, caused 50% inhibition of ROI production induced by TPA. These effects were reversed in the presence of H89 (10 μM). We also investigated Ca2+ mobilization as another candidate pathway in IL-13 modulation of the oxidative burst. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the effect of IL-13 on TPA-induced ROI production was maintained. In the presence of neomycin sulfate (inhibitor of phospholipase C) or TMB8 (inhibitor of InsP3-induced intracellular Ca2+ release from intracysternal stores), the IL-13 inhibitory effect was impaired, suggesting that phospholipase C and subsequent production of InsP3-induced intracellular Ca2+ release can be related to the inhibitory response (Fig. 2). The involvement of prostaglandin in this mechanism is not suggested. Indeed, in the presence of indomethacin (inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway), the effect of IL-13 on TPA-triggered ROI production was maintained. Since cAMP seems to be involved in the inhibitory effect of IL-13 on TPA-induced ROI production, we measured the time course of cAMP accumulation induced by IL-13. Results show a rapid (1 min) and significant increase for 15 min (maximum time of experimental observation) (Fig. 3). In parallel, forskolin (10 μM) produced a similar kinetic of cAMP accumulation (data not shown). In order to study whether cAMP accumulation is linked to phospholipase C activation, neomycin sulfate and TMB8 were tested. Both inhibitors were able to block cAMP accumulation induced by IL-13, suggesting that phospholipase C activation and subsequent intracellular calcium release are necessary for the pathway leading to cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3). The finding that the effect of IL-13 on ROI and cAMP production was reversed by neomycin suggests the involvement of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by phospholipase C. The results shown in Fig. 4 confirm this event. Indeed, a rapid (15 s for InsP2, InsP3, and InsP4, 30 s for InsP1), transient, and significant increase of all four inositol phosphate metabolites was observed when adherent monocytes prelabeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol were incubated in the presence of IL-13. At the single-cell level, a significant increase of the fluorescent Ca2+ signal was observed within 30 s after the addition of IL-13 (Fig. 5A). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the IL-13-induced Ca2+ response was maintained (Fig. 5B), suggesting that this increase is essentially a consequence of Ca2+ release from intracysternal stores. To test this hypothesis, similar experiments were performed in the presence of TMB8. In these conditions, the increase of intracytosolic Ca2+ induced by IL-13 was completely reversed (Fig. 5C). In the present study we determine the initial events induced by IL-13, which can regulate the protein kinase C-triggered respiratory burst in human monocytes. Classically, the activation of protein kinase C by TPA results in the activation of NADPH-oxidase, inducing the so-called respiratory burst(26Gennaro R. Florio C. Romeo D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Myers M.A. Mc Phail L.C. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wolfson M. Mc Phail L.C. Nasrallah V.N. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2057-2062PubMed Google Scholar). Probably, phosphorylation of cytosolic oxidase proteins, p47 and p67 by activated protein kinase C is a key step in this response(11Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 13Dusi S. Della Bianca V. Grzeskowiak M. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ROI and proinflammatory cytokines are likely to be involved in phagocyte antimicrobial activity and inflammatory responses. IL-13 produced by activated Th-2 cells is described to suppress the production of proinflammatory monokines(1Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.M. Dumont X. Guillemot J.C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P. Miloux B. Minty C. Casellas P. Loison G. Lupker J. Shire D. Ferrara P. Caput D. Nature. 1993; 362: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 6De Waal Malefyt R. Figdor C. Huijbens R. Mohan-Peterson S. Bennett B. Culpepper J. Dang W. Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). However, no information is available on the action of IL-13 on human ROI production. Our results demonstrate that IL-13 inhibits the TPA-induced oxidative burst in human monocytes when added 5 min before TPA and also for longer periods up to 18 h (data not shown). The nonspecific inhibition of ROI production is excluded since in the presence of anti-IL-13 antiserum the effect of IL-13 is cancelled. The IL-13 down-modulatory effect on human monocyte oxidative burst supports that described with another anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-4. Indeed, preexposure of human monocytes to IL-4 for 24 h decreases the respiratory burst induced by TPA(29Abramson S.L. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 625-630PubMed Google Scholar). IL-4 also inhibits this response when other stimuli such as zymosan, platelet-activating factor, chemotactic peptide and IFN-γ are used(29Abramson S.L. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 625-630PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lehn M. Weiser W.Y. Engelhorn S. Gillis S. Remold H.G. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3020-3024PubMed Google Scholar). An explanation for the similar biological activities displayed by IL-13 and IL-4 is that their receptors share a common subunit critical for cellular signal transduction(31Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).2 In contrast to the finding with human monocytes, the respiratory burst induced by TPA in murine resident peritoneal macrophages is enhanced by murine IL-4 used under similar experimental conditions (32Phillips W.A. Croatto M. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recent data show that P600 (murine IL-13) and murine IL-4 are unable to modify ROI response triggered by TPA in murine biogel-elicited macrophages(33Doyle A.G. Herbein G. Montaner L.J. Minty A.J. Caput D. Ferrara P. Gordon S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1441-14453Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These results suggest the necessity to be cautious when extrapolating data obtained with murine cells to the human system. As suggested for IL-4, the role of IL-13 in host defense and inflammation can be significant. ROI may damage various cells at high concentrations; however, their role is important in antimicrobial activity. The partial inhibition by IL-13 of TPA-triggered ROI production (35%) could reduce inflammatory reactions without completely abolishing the antimicrobial process. Having established that IL-13 induces an inhibitory effect on ROI production, we investigated the signal transduction pathways used by this cytokine to induce the deactivation of the ROI response. In leukocytes, agents which increase intracellular cAMP concentrations (prostaglandins E2 and E1, dibutyryl cAMP, forskolin, and 1-isobutyl-3-methylxanthine) have often been shown to inhibit various cellular functions such as respiratory burst(34Simchowitz L. Fischbein L.C. Spilberg I. Atkinson J.P. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 1482-1491PubMed Google Scholar, 35Takenawa T. Ishitoya J. Nagai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Mitsuyama T. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1117: 167-173Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Some authors have recently proposed a mechanism of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent activation of a specific phosphatase. This event results in dephosphorylation of NADPH-oxidase subunits and thus inactivation of the enzyme(14Savita G. Salimath B.P. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Salimath B.P. Savitha G. Cell. Signalling. 1992; 4: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our data suggest the involvement of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway in IL-13-induced inhibition of respiratory burst. Indeed, the direct involvement of cAMP in the IL-13 signaling pathway is demonstrated by a sustained increase of cAMP levels after cytokine stimulation. Furthermore, in the presence of adenylate cyclase (Δ9-THC) and protein kinase A (H89) inhibitors, the effect of IL-13 on ROI production is not observed. IL-13 seems to mimic the forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP inhibitory effect on TPA-triggered ROI production. Different studies show that the accumulation of cAMP can be subsequent to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization(17Verghese M.W. Fox K. Mc Phail L.C. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kolb J.P. Abadie A. Paul-Eugene N. Capron M. Sarfati M. Dugas B. Delespesse G. J.

Immunol. 1990; 20: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Coupling of phospholipase C and cAMP pathways through Ca2+ was reported in leukocytes (18Ishitoya J. Takenawa T. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1201-1207PubMed Google Scholar, 39Singh V.K. Leu S.C. Immunol. Lett. 1993; 35: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and human neuroblastoma cells(40Baumgold J. Paek R. Yasumoto T. Life Sci. 1992; 50: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A direct activation of type I and III adenylate cyclase by Ca2+ and calmodulin previously described (41Mac Neil S. Lakey T. Tomlinson S. Cell Calcium. 1985; 6: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) could be a possible mechanism. Our experiments show that cAMP production is markedly reduced by prior treatment of human monocytes with an inhibitor of phospholipase C (neomycin sulfate) or an inhibitor of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (TMB8). These observations suggest that IL-13 causes intracellular cAMP accumulation by Ca2+-dependent processes. It was of interest to verify the capacity of IL-13 to promote phospholipase C activation and intracellular Ca2+ rise. We demonstrate here that IL-13 induces immediate and transient hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels inhibited by TMB8. These results suggest that IL-13 causes phospholipase C activation and a release of Ca2+ from InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores. The regulation of phospholipase C is distinct for two of the known phospholipase families, the phospholipase C-β and phospholipase C-γ. The phospholipase C-β family is regulated by G proteins, while phospholipase C-γ1 and -γ2 are regulated by protein-tyrosine kinase (for review, see (43Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). The involvement of a protein-tyrosine kinase in the IL-13 signal transduction pathway was strongly suggested in a recent report. Indeed, genistein (one inhibitor of tyrosine kinase) completely blocked the IL-13-activated IL-4-dependent nuclear transcription factor in monocytic U937 cells(44Köhler I. Alliger P. Minty A. Caput D. Ferrara P. Höll-Neugebauer B. Rank G. Rieber E.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A study concerning the suggested activation of phospholipase C-γ through tyrosine phosphorylation induced by IL-13 has already been undertaken in our laboratory. Otherwise, we relate these initial events induced by IL-13 to the inhibition of the human monocyte biological response, the oxidative burst. Indeed, in the presence of TMB8 and neomycin sulfate, this inhibitory effect of IL-13 is impaired, whereas, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or in the presence of indomethacin (inhibitor of cyclooxygenase pathway), IL-13 still induces a significant inhibition of ROI production. This last observation strongly suggests that prostaglandins, classically described to increase intracellular cAMP levels and inhibit ROI production in activated phagocytes(35Takenawa T. Ishitoya J. Nagai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kolb J.P. Abadie A. Paul-Eugene N. Capron M. Sarfati M. Dugas B. Delespesse G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4798-4809PubMed Google Scholar), are not involved in IL-13 down-regulation of the biological response studied. Our results support the involvement of InsP3-dependent Ca2+ mobilization and subsequent cAMP accumulation in the IL-13 inhibitory effect on ROI production. In conclusion, we describe here for the first time the initial steps in the signaling pathway of IL-13 related to respiratory burst decrease. Indeed, direct measurement of second messengers and the use of metabolic inhibitors allowed us to establish a temporal sequence and a link between InsP3-dependent Ca2+ mobilization, the cAMP protein-kinase pathway and inhibition of the protein kinase C-triggered respiratory burst in human monocytes pretreated with IL-13. The modulation of this important human monocyte function strengthens the notion that IL-13 could play a central role in the inflammatory process without totally inhibiting the monocyte oxygen-dependent anti-infectious capacity. Furthermore, work will be required to evaluate if the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-13 displayed in in vitro models, could be of clinical significance in the future for the treatment of inflammatory human diseases."

Biochemical analysis indicates that this mutated receptor is constitutively internalized and recycled even in the absence of ligand. Quantitative electron microscope autoradiography analysis reveals that it does not preferentially associate with microvilli in its unoccupied form but is normally segregated in clathrin-coated pits through the preserved signal sequence(s) of exon 16. We conclude that (a) insulin receptor internalization is initiated through receptor kinase activation and autophosphorylation, which free the receptor from constraints maintaining it on microvilli; (b) the signal sequences contained in exon 16 are entirely sufficient to promote clathrin-coated pit-mediated internalization of insulin receptors; (c) these sequences are not uncovered by kinase activation; and (d) the “code” maintaining the unoccupied receptors on microvilli is contained within exons 17-21 of the receptor.

INTRODUCTIONMost plasma membrane receptors and their ligands undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis and are taken up by cells through the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles(1Goldstein J.L.

But, while transport protein receptors such as the receptors for low density lipoproteins or transferrin are rapidly and constitutively internalized, signaling receptors such as those for insulin and epidermal growth factor internalize at rapid rates only when ligand is bound(1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russel D.N. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 2Schmid S.L.

These two classes of receptors differ not only on the basis of their function (delivering of nutrients to the cells versus intracellular signaling) and of the ligand dependence or independence of the internalization process but also in their topography. Class I receptors, typified by the low density lipoprotein and the transferrin receptors, are present in clathrin-coated pits in their unoccupied form while class II receptors, like the insulin receptor, are preferentially found associated with surface microvilli in their unbound state(3Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1983; 32: 663-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Carpentier J.-L.

Following entry into the cells, the intracellular pathway followed by receptors of these two classes is similar; the ligand-receptor complex is cleaved at the acidic pH of endosomes and its two components are targeted in different directions: the ligand is generally routed to lysosomes while the receptor is classically recycled back to the cell surface where it can be reused(1Goldstein J.L.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis requires specific amino acid sequences found in the cytoplasmic tail (frequently the submembranous domains) of receptors. They have in common a propensity to form a tight β turn exposing an aromatic residue (preferentially a tyrosine)(2Schmid S.L.

In the case of the insulin receptor, however, these sequences are not sufficient for endocytosis; rapid internalization also requires activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, probably accounting for the observed ligand dependence of insulin receptor endocytosis(27Carpentier J.-L.

The tyrosine kinase of the epidermal growth factor receptor has also been shown to be required for its internalization(32Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C. Walton G.M. Der C.J.

Tyrosine kinase activation is involved in the surface redistribution of the insulin receptor from microvilli to the nonvillous surface of the cell(27Carpentier J.-L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J. Gilbert A. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 831-839Google Scholar, 28Carpentier J.-L. Paccaud J.P. Gorden P. Rutter W.J. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but how the receptor tyrosine kinase initiates this initial step of endocytosis is not clear. Tyrosine kinase activation could play an active role and initiate a controlled redistribution of the receptor in the direction of the clathrin-coated pits of the nonvillous domain of the cell surface. Conversely, tyrosine kinase activation could simply act to release receptors from microvilli, whereupon localization to clathrin-coated pits and endocytosis occurs without further kinase-dependent signaling.In the present study, we have addressed this question by examining in detail the endocytotic itinerary of an insulin receptor deleted of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain and COOH terminus, thus leaving only the juxtamembrane domain intact. Biochemical and ultrastructural analyses indicate that the truncated insulin receptor does not preferentially associate with microvilli and undergoes efficient constitutive endocytosis. We conclude that the signal allowing the anchoring of the unoccupied insulin receptor on microvilli is contained within the regulatory domain of the insulin receptor and that the tyrosine kinase activation of the insulin receptor initiates insulin receptor internalization through the release of a brake maintaining it on microvilli. Moreover, the submembranous endocytotic motifs of the insulin receptor, once available to the endocytotic machinery, appear sufficient for endocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Cell CultureRoutine reagents and porcine insulin were purchased from Sigma. 125I-insulin monoiodinated (300-400 μCi/μg) was purchased from Amersham Corp. Serum was purchased from Sigma. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum as described previously(23Thies R.S. Webster N.J. McClain D.A. J. Biol.

The characteristics of a Rat-1 cell line stably or transiently expressing a human insulin receptor with a premature stop codon at the end of the sequence encoding the juxtamembrane exon 16 (hIRΔex17-22) has been previously described(26Rajagopalan M.

Briefly, cells on ice in 35-mm culture dishes containing 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6, were exposed to the photoreactive 125I-NAPA-DP insulin (∼2 nM) in the dark for 2 h. While still on ice, the cells were exposed to UV light to cross-link the insulin to the receptor and washed as described. Medium at 37°C was added, and the cells were incubated at that temperature; at various times dishes were rinsed in ice-cold buffer and exposed to trypsin (1 mg/ml) for 1 h on ice. After neutralization of the trypsin with soybean trypsin inhibitor (2.5 mg/ml, Sigma) the cells were solubilized in boiling hot SDS sample buffer and analyzed by polyacrylamide electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (34Heidenreich K.A. Brandenburg D. Berhanu P. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6511-6515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Insulin internalization was measured as described(30McClain D.A. Maegawa H.

Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in 6-well dishes (∼106 cells/dish) were equilibrated at 37°C in Krebs-Ringer phosphate, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then exposed to 10 pM125I-insulin for various periods of time, after which the cells were rinsed rapidly three times in ice-cold saline (pH 7.6) and then exposed to 1 ml of incubation medium at pH 4.0 for 6 min on ice to remove surface-bound insulin. This plus a further 1 ml of rinse (pH 4.0) were combined, and radioactivity corresponding to surface-bound insulin was determined in a γ counter. The rinsed cells were solubilized in detergent, and radioactivity corresponding to internalized insulin was also determined. Counts bound and internalized in the presence of excess (300 nM) unlabeled insulin were less than 10% of the counts observed with labeled insulin only and were subtracted.Trypsinization of intact cells and the determination of insulin binding activity in solubilized extracts of untreated or trypsinized cells in order to determine the relative proportions of intracellular and cell surface receptors were performed as described(35Levy J.R.

Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Electron Microscope AutoradiographyFixed cells were dehydrated, processed for electron microscope autoradiography, and quantitated as described previously(27Carpentier J.-L.

For each time point studied, for each cell line, about 600-800 grains were analyzed from all cells judged to be morphologically intact. Grains within a distance of 1 ± 250 nm from the plasma membrane were considered associated with the cell surface; grains overlying the cytoplasm and >250 nm from the plasma membrane were considered internalized. Grains associated with the plasma membrane were divided into the following classes: 1) microvilli, 2) clathrin-coated pits, 3) nonvillous nonclathrin-coated pit segments, and 4) uninterpretable. Grains were considered associated with microvilli or clathrin-coated pits if their center was <250 nm from these surface domains; they were categorized in class 4 when the structures underlying the grain could not be unequivocally identified.RESULTSInternalization of an Insulin Receptor Deleted of the Kinase and COOH-terminal Domains Encoded by Exons 17-22 (hIRΔex17-22)We have previously engineered an insulin receptor cDNA truncated after the juxtamembrane domain encoded by exon 16, hIRΔex17-22. This receptor was deleted of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain and the COOH terminus but did express the juxtamembrane domain including the motifs required for rapid endocytosis(26Rajagopalan M. Neidigh J.L. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23068-23073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor was expressed at the cell surface and bound insulin with high affinity(26Rajagopalan M. Neidigh J.L. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23068-23073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We first examined the internalization of wild-type (WThIR) or truncated (hIRΔex17-22) receptors expressed in Rat-1 fibroblasts and labeled with an insulin photoaffinity probe. The cells were initially exposed to ligand in the cold so only the surface receptors would be labeled. The cells were then exposed to UV light to cross-link the ligand to the receptor and warmed at 37°C for various periods of time. At each time point studied, cells were trypsinized to degrade any receptors still at the cell surface. As the receptors internalized they became trypsin-resistant such that internalized receptors remained intact while the receptors remaining at the plasma membrane were degraded by trypsin. Intact labeled α-subunits of the receptor were then quantified after reducing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As can be seen in Fig. 1, before warming (time 0) greater than 95% of either normal or truncated hIR were at the cell surface and susceptible to trypsin degradation. With time at 37°C, normal insulin receptors so labeled undergo internalization such that after 40 min, 52.6% of the receptors were trypsin-resistant. The truncated receptors did internalize more slowly, but after 40 min a significant number of them (22.2%) were intracellular. By comparison, the intracellular fraction of a noninternalizing kinase-defective receptor did not exceed 8-9% even after 60 min(30McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of receptors using this technique was performed at relatively high but not saturating insulin concentrations (∼2 nM) where roughly 50% receptor occupancy would be expected. Thus, the proportion of labeled receptors could not exceed 50% even assuming only a minimal degree of inefficiency of covalent coupling of the photoprobe. If nonligand-occupied hIRΔex17-22 were internalizing as well as the receptors labeled by the ligand, the total internalization rate of the hIRΔex17-22 could be comparable with that of the WThIR. We therefore examined whether unoccupied hIRΔex17-22 might also be undergoing constitutive endocytosis.Resting Distribution of hIRΔex17-22 in Transfected Cells and the Effects of Insulin and ChloroquineIn cells expressing the normal insulin receptor, most (∼90%) of those receptors are at the plasma membrane, and very few receptors are intracellular(30McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since endocytosis is ligand-dependent, it is only in the presence of ligand that significant numbers of receptors can be found intracellularly. If the hIRΔex17-22 were undergoing constitutive internalization, it would be predicted that in the absence of insulin a greater fraction of these receptors would be intracellular compared with normal receptors. This was the case as depicted in Fig. 2A. The fraction of intracellular receptors was determined by trypsinizing cells in the resting state and comparing the fraction of insulin binding activity remaining after cell solubilization with the insulin binding activity in nontrypsinized solubilized cells. In hIRΔex17-22 cells in the absence of insulin 49.2 ± 4.2% of the receptors were intracellular, as compared with only 12.6 ± 1.1% of the normal receptors (p < 0.01). Insulin led to a large increase in the proportion of intracellular normal receptors but had no appreciable effect on the distribution of the truncated receptors (Fig. 2B). The hIRΔex17-22 also did not undergo ligand-induced down-regulation, that is, chronic exposure of the cells expressing the truncated receptors to saturating concentrations of insulin had no effect on total receptor number (not shown).Figure 2:A, distribution of wild-type and hIRΔex17-22 receptors in unstimulated cells. Cells expressing either WThIR (solid bar) or hIRΔex17-22 (dotted bar) were solubilized in the absence of insulin and total receptor number determined in solution as described(30McClain D.A. Maegawa H. Lee J. Dull T.J. Ullrich A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were also trypsinized to degrade cell surface receptors and the number of trypsin-resistant (intracellular) receptors determined in solubilized extracts. The percentages of intracellular receptors (trypsin resistant/total) are plotted and are the means of three experiments (±S.E.), each performed in triplicate. Insulin binding assays were performed as binding competition curves; these revealed no significant difference in affinity between the receptors from cells trypsinized or not, so the plotted results are of tracer (10 pM) insulin binding. B, change in intracellular receptor number after insulin treatment. Cells were treated for 60 min at 37°C with near saturating insulin (30 nM), and the cell receptor number (intracellular and total) was determined as above. Results are plotted as the percent increase in intracellular receptors shown in panel A and are the means of three experiments assayed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Receptor distribution after treatment of cells with the lysosomotropic drug chloroquine that blocks receptor recycling was also investigated and was also consistent with the truncated hIRΔex17-22 constitutively undergoing an endocytotic itinerary. As shown in Fig. 3, after exposure to chloroquine but no insulin for 24 h, hIRΔex17-22 cells had lost 20.3 ± 5.4% of their surface insulin binding compared with a negligible loss (1.0 ± 3.6%) of binding in cells expressing normal receptors. There was a concomitant increase in the fraction of intracellular trypsin-resistant receptors after chloroquine treatment of the truncated but not normal receptors, comparable with what was seen with cells expressing normal receptors but after insulin treatment (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Effect of chloroquine treatment on insulin receptor distribution in the absence of insulin. Left, cells expressing WThIR (solid bar) or hIRΔex17-22 (dotted bar) were exposed to 100 μM chloroquine for 1 h. Cell surface insulin binding was then assayed and compared with that of control cells incubated in the absence of chloroquine. Results are the means of two independent experiments, each assayed in triplicate. Right, cells treated with or without chloroquine were either trypsinized or not, and the percentage of intracellular (trypsin-resistant) receptors was determined in solubilized extracts of cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the means of two experiments, each assayed in quintuplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Morphological Tracking of 125I-insulin Internalization Pathway in hIRΔex17-22 CellsTo track insulin receptors morphologically, transfected cells were exposed to tracer concentration (3 × 10−11M) of 125I-insulin for various periods of time at 37°C and processed for electron microscope autoradiography, and 125I-insulin internalization was quantitated as described previously(27Carpentier J.-L. Paccaud J.P. Backer J. Gilbert A. Orci L. Kahn C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 118: 831-839Google Scholar).

These internalization curves are very similar to the ones obtained biochemically (data not shown).Figure 4:125I-insulin internalization in Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with WThIR or hIRΔes17-22.
