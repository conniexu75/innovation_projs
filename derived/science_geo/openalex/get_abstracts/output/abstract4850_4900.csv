https://openalex.org/W1592584230,"The binding of six physiologically important long chain fatty acids to defatted human plasma albumin was measured at 37 degrees in a calcium-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The data were analyzed in terms of multiple stepwise equilibria. With the saturated acids, the magnitude of the equilibrium (association) constants, Ki, increased as the chain length increased: laurate smaller than myristate smaller than palmitate smaller than stearate. Oleate was bound more tightly than stearate; by contrast, linoleate was bound less tightly than stearate. The equilibrium constants, K1 through K12, ranged from 2.4 times 10-6 - 3.5 times 10-3 m-1 for laurate to 2.6 times 10-8 - 3.5 times 10-5 m-1 for oleate. Successive values of Ki decrease for each of the acids, indicating that major cooperative binding effects do not occur over the physiological range of fatty acid concentrations. In no case could the Ki be segregated into distinct classes, suggesting that any grouping of albumin binding sites is somewhat arbitrary. The results were inconclusive concerning whether premicellar association of unbound fatty acid occurs. Although corrections for premicellar association produced very little change in the Ki values for myristate, they raised the Ki for palmitate and stearate by 300 to 700 per cent. A sigmoidal relationship was obtained when the logarithm of Ki was plotted against chain length for the saturated fatty acids containing 6 to 18 carbon atoms, indicating that the binding energy is not simply a statistical process dependent only on the fatty acid chain length. This selectivity that albumin contributes to the binding process may be due to varying degrees of configurational adaptability of its binding sites as the fatty acid increases in length."
https://openalex.org/W1575241865,"Addition of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) to high speed supernatant preparations obtained from rat brain caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (tyrosine hydroxylase) activity. The tyrosine 3-monooxygenase remained in an activated state upon removal of the cAMP by passing the enzyme through a Sephadex G-25 column. Substances which inhibit cAMP-dependent protein kinase, namely, EDTA, ADP, and adenosine, and protein kinase modulator, each antagonized the activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase produced by cAMP. Furthermore, addition of partially purified brain cAMP-dependent protein kinase caused a several-fold increase in tyrosin 3-monooxygenase activity. The activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase by added cAMP and protein kinase required the presence of ATP and Mg-2+. These data suggests that the cAMP activation of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase may be mediated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1599552422,"In order to solve the problem of an apparent discrepancy between the pH variance of oxygen equilibrium curve and the linear relation between the number of released Bohr protons and the degree of ligation, precise oxygen equilibrium curves of human hemoglobin were determined at a number of pH values from 6.5 to 8.8. From the equilibrium data individual steps (Adair constants), ki (i equals 1, 2, 3, 4), were obtained and the number of Bohr protons (deltaHi+) released on the ith stage of oxygenation was estimated. The pH dependence of k4 was very small, while the other ks strongly depended on pH over the pH range examined. As a consequence, the contribution of each step of oxygen binding to the alkaline Bohr effect nonuniform: deltaH4 was very small compared with deltaH1+, deltaH2+, and deltaH3+. In spite of this, calcuation has shown that the fractional number of released protons is essentially proportional to fractional oxygen saturation because of cooperative effects in hemoglobin. Thus, the present study indicates that the linear relationship between the fractional number of released protons and the degree of ligation, as obtained from titration experiments, is not necessarily incompatible with the pH variance of the shape of the oxygen equilibrium curve. The nonuniform pH depencence of the Adair constants implies that the two-state allosteric model of Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeus, J.P. (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118 is not adequate to describe the heterotropic effect caused by protons."
https://openalex.org/W1594905039,Ca-2+-ATPase purified from sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit muscle forms a phsophoeznyme when exposed to inorganic phosphate in the presence of Mg-2+. On addition of ADP and Ca-2+ virtually all of the phosphate bound to the enzyme is transferred to form ATP. It has been shown previously and confirmed by us that (a) the purified ATPase contains one major polypeptide and about 30% phospholipids; (b) on removal of residual detergent by passage through Sephadex the enzyme forms vesicular membranes; and (c) these vesicles are leaky and incapable of accumulating Ca-2+. Our findings therefore indicate that we have observed ATP generation from ADP and P-i without the formation of an ion gradient across a membrane. We propose that the energy derived from ion-protein interaction drives the formation of ATP.
https://openalex.org/W1534111033,"In the presence of Fe3+-ADP and NADPH, washed rat liver microsomes at 37 degrees and at pH 7.5 emitted ultraweak light with the peroxidative cleavage of endogenous lipid. The main light-emitting species of this system was analyzed spectroscopically in the visible region and estimated to be singlet oxygen. The addition of superoxide dismutase or catalase did not inhibit the light emission significantly. It is unlikely therefore that superoxide anion and OH are involved in the generation of singlet oxygen in the present system."
https://openalex.org/W1516072337,"NAD+ had a biphasic effect on the NADH oxidase activity in electron transport particles from Mycobacterium phlei. The oxidase was inhibited competitively by NAD+ at concentrations above 0.05 mM. NAD+ in concentrations from 0.02 to 0.05 mM resulted in maximum stimulation of both NADH oxidation and oxygen uptake with concentrations of substrate both above and below the apparent K-M. Oxygen uptake and cyanide sensitivity indicated that the NAD+ stimulatory effect was linked to the terminal respiratory chain. The stimulatory effect was specific for NAD+. NAD+ was also specific in protecting the oxidase during heating at 50 degrees and against inactivation during storage at 0 degrees. NAD+ glycohydrolase did not affect stimulation nor heat protection of the NADH oxidase activity if the particles were previously preincubated with NAD+. Binding studies revealed that the particles bound approximately 3.6 pmol of [14C1NAD+ per mg of electron transport particle protein. Although bound NAD+ represented only a small fraction of the total added NAD+ necessary for maximal stimulation, removal of the apparently unbound NAD+ by Sephadex chromatography revealed that particles retained the stimulated state for at least 48 hours. Further addition of NAD+ to stimulated washed particles resulted in competitive inhibition of oxidase activity. Desensitization of the oxidase to the stimulatory effect of NAD+ was achieved by heating the particles at 50 degrees for 2 min without appreciable loss of enzymatic activity. Kinetic studies indicated that addition of NADH to electron transport particles prior to preincubation with NAD+ inhibited stimulation. In addition, NADH inhibited binding of [14C]NAD+. The utilization of artificial electron acceptors, which act as a shunt of the respiratory chain at or near the flavoprotein component, indicated that NAD+ acts as at the level of the NADH dehydrogenase at a site other than the catalytic one resulting in a conformational change which causes restoration as well as protection of oxidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1509207355,"A strain of Arthrobacter aurescens which secretes a large amount of chondroitinase into a culture broth, was isolated from soil. The chondroitinase was purified 380-fold over culture broth in 24% yield and crystallized. Some properties of the purified enzyme were studied and described: thermal stability (below 45 degrees), pH stability (pH 4.9 to 7.4), optimum temperature (50 degrees), and optimum pH (pH 6.0). Chrondroitin sulfate A and C, chondroitin, and hyaluronic acid were split by the enzyme but dermatan sulfate could not be. The initial rates of enzymic degradation of chondroitin sulfate C, chondroitin, and hyaluronic acid were 1.1, 1.95, and 3.2, respectively, compared to that of chondroitin sulfate A. When the enzyme was allowed to act on chondroitin sulfate A and C, the reducing power and the ultraviolet absorption at 232 nm increased proportionally to the decrease in viscosity of the substrate solution. Finally these substrates were degraded to the extent of 100% to disaccharides. By the enzyme action the main products from chondroitin sulfate A and C were deta 4,5-unsaturated disaccharides, which were identified as 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(Beta-D-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-D-galactose and 2-acet-amido-2-deoxy-3-O-(Beta-D-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-6-O-sulfo-D-galactose by paper chromatography, ultraviolet absorption spectroscophy, and infrared spectroscopy. Thus it is suggested that the chondroitinase is a chondroitin sulfate A and C lyase, one of the hyaluronate lyases (EC 4.2.99.1)."
https://openalex.org/W1673925955,"DNase requires Ca2+ for activity against DNA with Mg2+. The Ca2+ selective chelating agent, ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N'-tetraacetic acid, (EGTA) inhibits DNase completely at pH 7 or 8, and subsequent addition of excess Ca2+ reverses inhibition in less than one second. DNase action can be stopped at any point by the addition of excess EGTA over Ca2+. Ca2+ is required for DNase to bind substrate. Gel filtration experiments fail to show DNase binding to 0.2 mg per ml of DNA at 5 mm Mg2+ and 10-4 M EGTA. The concentration of Ca2+ needed for half of maximum DNase activity decreases with increases DNA concentration, from 1.2 times 10-5 M Ca2+ at 2.3 times 10-5 M DNA-P to about 4 times 10-7 M Ca2+ at 2.3 DNA-P. Kinetic analysis by the titrametic assay of protons releases shows that V max is independent of Ca2+ concentration while Km increases from 7.7 times 10-5 M DNA-P at 5 times 10-4 M Ca2+ to 3.4 times 10-4 M DNA-P at 5 times 10-6 M Ca2+. Both of these results are predicted by a rate equation which is derived from the assumption that DNase must bind Ca2+ before it can bind DNA. The essential Ca2+ atom probably binds to the one of two high affinity Ca2+ binding sites on DNase which cannont bind Mg2+ or Mn2+. The only other divalent metal ions which can bind to this site, Sr2+ and Ba2+, are also the only metal ions which can substitute for Ca2+ in DNase action against DNA with Mg2+. Some DNase activity is obtained in the absence of added Ca2+ with Mg2+ at pH 6 or below and with Mn2+ or Co2+ at pH 8. These assay solutions are contaminated by 1 to 3 muM Ca2+, which may be sufficient to account for the observed activity."
https://openalex.org/W1566887656,"Transport of labeled folic acid (PteGlu), pteroylpolyglutamates (PteGlu3-5), 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl-H4PteGlu), and methotrexate in late-log phase cells of Lactobacillus casei was active, and subject to inhibition by unlabeled pteroylmonoglutamates, pteroylpolyglutamates, and iodoacetate, but not glutamate or glutamate dipeptides. Pteroylpolyglutamates were transported without prior hydrolysis and shared a common uptake system with pteroylmonoglutamates. The affinity and maximum velocity of PteGlun uptake decreased with increasing glutamate chin length (Km:PteGlu1, 0.03 mum; PteGlu3, 0.32 mum; PteGlu4, 1.9 mum; PteGlu5, 3.7 mum) and comparisons with growth response curves suggested that polyglutamates were more effectively utilized by L. casei, once transported, than monoglutamate. No concentration of 5-methyl-H4PteGlu3-8 inside the cells was observed. The major folate metabolites found in L. casei preloaded with high levels of [3H]PteGlu (0.5 mum) were 10-formyl-H4PteGlu2 and 10-formyl-PteGlu. Both compounds were released, the monoglutamate more rapidly. Pteroyltriglutamate formation appeared to be a rate-limiting step in intracellular metabolism. No 10-formyl-Pte-Glu was found in iodoacetate-treated cells and efflux was inhibited. Cells preloaded with low levels of [3H]PteGlu (7 nm) metabolized the vitamin to polyglutamate forms, the major derivatives being H4PteGlun. First order exit rates of labeled folate from preloaded L. casei indicated an inhibition of PteGlu uptake with time. Exit rates dropped from 0.05 min-1 to greater than 0.002 min-1 as intracellular folate was metabolized from monoglutamate to polyglutamate derivatives (n larger than or equal to 3). In the latter case, materials lost by efflux were breakdown products and no folate of glutamate chain length greater than two was released. Pediococcus cerevisiae actively transported 5-methyl-H4PteGlu but did not take up to 5-methyl-H4PTeGlu3-8. No active accumulation of 5-methyl-H4PteGlu was observed in Streptococcus faecalis."
https://openalex.org/W1498235500,"An obligatory role for barbonate (or other synergistic anions) in the specific binding of Fe3+ by transferrin has been a point of controversy for two decades. There are an equal number of confirmatory and negative reports of specific Fe3+-transferrin binary complexes. A criticism of previous studies is the use of only one synthetic route, and limited product testing. This study reports the development of several preparative routes aimed at the formation of a specific Fe3+-transferrin complex, and the characterization of the products by spectrophotometry and chemical reactivity. The preparative routes described include: (a) displacement of carbonate from Fe3+-transferrin-CO32- at low pH followed by removal of CO2 by several techniques; (b) addition of FeCl3 to apotransferrin under CO2-free conditions; (c) oxidation of Fe2+ in the presence of apotransferrin under CO2-free conditions; (d) reaction of apotransferrin with nonsubstituting Fe3+ complexes in the absence of CO2; and (e) attempts to displace anions from weak Fe3+-transferrin-anion complexes. The product were examined with regard to their visible spectra, and their examined with regard to their visible spectra, and their reactivity with: (a) NaHCO3, (b) Fe3+-nitrilotriacetic acid in NaHCO3, and (c) citrate. The results are compared with the characteristics of Fe3+-transferrin-anion complexes and nonspecific Fe3+, transferrin mixtures. The data indicate that in the absence of synergistic anions the affinity of the specific metal binding sites of transfe-rin for Fe3+ is so low as to not compete favorably with hydrolytic polymerization and nonspecific binding effects."

https://openalex.org/W1493862611,"A ribonuclease, purified some 2700-fold from human plasma, exhibited a strong predilection for the hydrolysis of internucleotide bonds containing cytidylic acid. Analysis of [3'-32P]- and [5'-32P]phosphoryl-terminal fragments obtained after enzymic digestion of rabbit liver and yeast RNA indicated that the nucleotide found at the 3' terminus of the fragments was invariably cytidylic acid. The nucleotide at the 5' terminus varied between cytidylic and uridylic acids in a ratio of 9:1. When characterized by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, approximately 70 per cent of the digest consisted of oligonucleotides from 4 to 8 nucleotides in length. Enzyme activity, when measured in low ionic strength buffer, could be increased severalfold above control levels by the addition of either of the polyamines, spermidine or spermine. These substances also restored nucleolytic activity to preparations inhibited by such ordered synthetic polyribonucleotides as polyguanylic acid. Estimations of the molecular weight of the enzyme, both by Sephadex gel filtration and sucrose density centrifugation, indicate that the weight may vary, depending on the presence or absence of certain cations. Of the cations examined, spermidine and spermine appear to have the greatest effect, causing an alteration in molecular weight from greater than 150,000 to approximately 32,000."
https://openalex.org/W1485547756,"A number of 8- and N6-SUBSTITUTED DERIVATIVES OF CYCLIC ADENOSINE 3':5'-MONOPHOSPHATE-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE, AND AS SUBSTRATES FOR RAT LIVER CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHODIESTERASE. All of the analogs tested were able to induce the transaminase. The induction by the analogs was shown to be the result of an actual increase in the amount of enzyme, and the mechanism of induction was an increase in the rate of synthesis of the transaminase. The induced enzyme appeared to be immunologically similar to the non-induced enzyme. A good correlation was found to exist between the dose that produced 50% of maximal induction and a combination of the activation constant for cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase by the analog and its susceptibility to hydrolysis by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of some site is involved in the mechanism by which cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate affects the rate of synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase."

Similarly, N-methyltryptamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine yield 1-methyltryptoline and 5-hydroxytryptoline, respectively. Neither in vitro nor in vivo formation of these compounds by human tissues has been described."
https://openalex.org/W1901776338,"Abstract The conformations of Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein (ACP) and acetylated ACP have been studied as a function of pH and salt concentration by circular dichroism measurements. The results show that the amino groups of ACP in their protonated form are important for maintaining the native conformation of the protein at physiological pH. However, externally added cations (divalent more effectively than monovalent ones) can substitute for the ammonium groups in maintaining the ordered structure pf ACP. It is suggested that both the ammonium groups of ACP and externally added cations reduce the repulsion between carboxylate groups of ACP and thereby prevent the unfolding of the protein. A reduction of the number of negatively charged carboxylate groups by either protonation or chemical modification abolished the requirement for either ammonium groups or other cations. A qualitative agreement between the effect of salt on the conformation and on the biological activity of acetylated ACP has been observed. The single arginine residue of acetylated ACP has been modified by treatment with a trimer of 2,3-butanedione with the resulting derivative of ACP retaining most of its biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W1579649067,Electrostatic binding of at least two anionic iron hexacyanides to cationic horse heart cytochrome c was demonstrated by equilibrium dialysis measurements. No binding was detected following trifluoroacetylation of all of the 19 lysine residues. Replacement of the natural heme iron ligand methionine 80 by the alternative intrinsic ligand lysine 79 but not the extrinsic ligand imidazole resulted in the loss of one hexacyanide binding site. It is proposed that this site is located at the exposed heme edge and is functional in electron exchange.
https://openalex.org/W1594458995,"The phosphorylation of two purified vaccinia virus proteins (Acceptors I and II) by a protein kinase isolated from vaccinia virus cores has been studied. Phosphorylation of viral acceptor proteins by the purified enzyme was dependent on the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and protamine or other basic proteins, and was maximal at alkaline pH values. Cyclic mononucleotides did not stimulate the vaccinia protein kinase under a variety of conditions. Protamine, however, was shown to function as an enzyme activator. In its presence, the purified vaccinia protein kinase phosphorylated mainly serine residues in Acceptor I, and predominantly threonine residues in Acceptor II. Phosphorylation of protamine accounted for less than 1% of the total 23P incorporation. Tryptic peptide maps prepared from 32P-labeled Acceptors I and II demonstrated that they contained different labeled peptide sequences and were, therefore, distinct protein species. From additional studies on both purified and virus-associated protein kinase it was concluded that various proteins affected the protein kinase reaction in one of three ways. One class of proteins served as phosphate acceptors, but only when another activator protein was present. A second class consisted of proteins that were strong activators but poor phosphate acceptors. The third class contained proteins that were fair phosphate acceptors, but which also activated the phosphorylation of other acceptor proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1541528560,"A macromolecular binder of folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) and folic acid derivatives has been identified in extracts of hog kidney. With partially purified preparations, binding of [3H]pteroylglutamate was competed for by unlabeled pteroylglutamate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid and its triglutamate derivative, by tetra- and dihydrofolic acid, and by N-10-formyltetrahydrofolic acid. The partially purified extract did not bine [3H]methotrexate nor could methotrexate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid compete for [3H]folic acid-binding sites. The rate of binding of pterolyglutamate at 37 degrees was approximately 3%/s, was independent of pteroylglutamate concentration, and was essentially irreversible between pH 6.0 and 9.0. Below pH 6.0 binding was reversible, and at pH 3.5 the folic acid-binder complex completely disassociated. Based upon Sephadex gel filtration, the molecular weight of the folate-binder complex is 35,000 to 40,000. Binding activity was unaffected by pretreatment with ribonuclease or deoxyribonuclease but was completely destroyed by trypsin. The initial, unfractionated extract showed gamma-glutamyl carboxypeptidase (conjugase) activity which was lost in subsequent steps of purification of the folate binder."
https://openalex.org/W1491598453,"Protein phosphokinase activity endogenous to rat ventral prostate chromatin was assayed by using edphosphophosvitin as an exogenous substrate. For maximal activity of the kinase reaction, the presence of 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol was essential. Two apparent pH optima were observed, a broad one between pH 7 and 7.4, and one at pH 7.89. At pH 7.4 the apparent Km for 31% dephosphophosvitin was 0.3 mg per ml. With respect to ATP, two apparent Km values (0.04 and 0.41 mM) were found. The kinase activity was minimal toward exogenous histones when used as substrates (3% for lysine-rich and 0.3% for arginine-rich (f3) histones, compared with dephosphophosvitin controls). The protein phosphokinases were not significantly stimulated by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) when histones used as substrate. With dephosphophosvitin as substrate, cyclic AMP produced a small inhibition (5 to 15%). Orchiectomy of adult rats resulted in a rapid decline in the chromatin-associated protein phosphokinase activity assayed using optimal experimental condition described above. At 9 hours postorchiectomy, a 30% decline in the activity was observed; this was further reduced to about 50% of the control by 18 hours. This decrease in the kinase activity (e.g. at 9 hours postorchiectomy) appears to precede measurable changes in the protein and RNA complements of chromatin. Testosterone replacement following orchiectomy abolished this decline in the chromatin-associated activity. The chromatin-associated protein phosphokinase activity toward lysine-rich and arginine-rich histones was also sensitive to androgenic status of the animals and declined rapidly postorchiectomy. The results suggest the presence of multiple and androgen-sensitive protien phosphokinases associated with rat ventral prostate chromatin, which may modulate the phosphorylation of nuclear nonhistone phosphoproteins with changing gene action mediated by testosterone in this target tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1530899465,"Kinetic studies on the pig heart cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase have been performed over a wide range of conditions using the full time course of the reaction and computer simulation to obtain the kinetic parameters. The maximum velocity and Michaelis constants for the oxidation of reduced coenzyme have been determined as a fundtion of pH in 0.05 M phosphate buffer at 15 degrees. At pH 7.5 and at low substrate concentrations, the kinetic data are consistent with a sequential addition of substrates, coenzyme binding first, and involving the formation of at least one ternary complex. No oxalacetate binding to the enzyme was observed. The rate constants for the dissociation of coenzyme from the enzyme-coenzyme complex are small enough to define the maximum velocity in either direction of the reaction. These data, plus data using deuterated reduced coenzyme, indicate that the chemical transformation step is not rate determining. It is also shown that DPNH binding can be tight enough to practically exclude the possibility of obtaining initial velocities when measuring the reduction of DPN. Kinetic abnormalities do appear at higher substrate or product concentrations, but these do not appear to be related to the formation of inactive abortice, complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1598012913,"The incubation of spinach chloroplasts with 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide in light for 60 to 90 s results in a partial, irreversible inhibition of photophosphorylation. The inhibition was not overcome at infinite light intensity or at infinite concentrations of the phosphorylation substrates. Although the inhibition diminished with decreasing concentrations of adenosine diphosphate in the assay of phosphorylation, the inhibition of guanosine diphosphate phosphorylation was independent of the concentration of this nucleotide. Although adenosine di- or triphosphate (10 to 30 muM) alone partially prevented the development of the N-ethylmaleimide inhibition of phosphorylation, these nucleotides were more effective when either 1 mM inorganic phosphate or arsenate was also present. The light-dependent incorporation of N-ethylmaleimide into chloroplast-bound coupling factor 1 was affected by adenosine triphosphate and inorganic phosphate in a manner similar to the onset of N-ethylmaleimide inhibition. Since guanosine diphosphate did not protect phosphorylation from N-ethylmaleimide inhibition but is phosphorylated at rapid rates, it is apparent that coupling factor 1 in chloroplasts has multiple nucleotide recognition sites."
https://openalex.org/W1538926935,"The effect of pH on steady state kinetic parameters for the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed reduction of aldehydes and oxidation of alcohols has been studied. The oxidation of p-CH3 benzyl alcohol-1,1-h2 and -1,1-d2 by NAD+ was found to be characterized by large deuterium isotope effects (kH/kD = 4.1 plus or minus 0.1) between pH 7.5 and 9.5, indicating a rate-limiting hydride trahsfer step in this pH range; a plot of kCAT versus pH could be fit to a theoretical titration curve, pK = 8.25, where kCAT increases with increasing pH. The Michaelis constnat for p-CH3 benzyl alcohol was independent of pH. The reduction of p-CH3 benzaldehyde by NADH and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide with deuterium in the 4-A position (NADD) cound not be studied below pH 8.5 due to substrate inhibition; however, between pH 8.5 and 9.5, kCAT was found to decrease with increasing pH and to be characterized by significant isotope effects (kH/kD = 3.3 plus or minus 0.3). In the case of acetaldehyde reduction by NADH and NADD, isotope effects were found to be small and exxentially invariant (kH/kD = 2.O plus or minus 0.4) between pH 7.2 and 9.5, suggesting a partially rate-limiting hydride transger step for this substrate; a plot of kCAT/K'b (where K'b is the Michaelis constant for acetaldehyde) versus pH could be fit to a titration curve, pK = 8.25. The titration curve for acetaldehyde reduction has the same pK but is opposite in direction to that observed for p-CH3 benzyl alcohol oxidation. The data presented in this paper indicate a dependence on different enzyme forms for aldehyde reduction and alcohol oxidation and are consistent with a single active site side chain, pK = 8.25, which functions in acid-base catalysis of the hydride transfer step."

Yeast and E. coli ketopantoic acid reductases are B-specific enzymes which transfer hydrogen from [4B-3H]-NADPH to ketopantoic acid to form [3H]pantoic acid. In contrast to the usual observations on the stereospecificity of functionally similar dehydrogenases from different species, yeast and E. coli ketopantoyl lactone reductases exhibit opposite stereospecificities. Both of two forms of yeast ketopantoyl lactone reductases are A-specific enzymes which form [3H]pantoyl lactone from ketopantoyl lactone and [4A-3H]NADPH, whereas, two forms of E. coli ketopantoyl lactone reductases are B-specific enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1573021080,"Incubation of cerebral cortical tissue from immature rats in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate resulted in similar rates of incorporation of radioactivity into the proteins of free and membrane-bound ribosomes. Incorporation of label into ribosomal proteins of both species continued actively for at least 3 hours. Since recovery of membrane-bound ribosomes from rat cerebral cortex is quite low, further analyses of the radioactive phosphoproteins were restricted to the free ribosome population. A significant fraction of the radioactivity which was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid was not removed by heating in trichloroacetic acid at 90 degrees or extracted with organic solvents and therefore was presumed to be covalently bound to protein. The radioactive phosphoryl groups present in the ribosomal proteins were mainly in ester linkages since they were readily removed by exposure to 1 N NaOH, relatively unaltered by 1N HCl, and unaffected by hydroxylamine. This conclusion was supported by the isolation of labeled o-phosphoserine and o-phosphothreonine residues from hydrolysates of ribosomal proteins. A significant fraction of the labeled phosphoproteins in the purified ribosomes appeared to be bound tightly to the ribosome structure since only 40% of the radioactivity could be removed by extraction of these ribosomes with 1 M KCl. Phosphorylation of proteins of cerebral monoribosomes was more rapid than the same process in polyribosomes from the same source. Eight radioactive phosphoprotein bands could be detected by electrophoresis of proteins obtained from unfractionated cerebral ribosomes on unidimensional polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The protein nature of these materials was confirmed by pronase digestion. Proteins of subribosomal particles isolated from the total free ribosomal population were labeled differentially. When dissociation was carried out in the presence of EDTA, the small subunit contained four radioactive phosphoprotein bands, whereas the large subunit contained five. Three of the radioactive phosphoprotein components of the small subunit were removed when dissociation of cerebral ribosomes which were previously washed with high salt media was carried out in the presence of puromycin and high salt. However, only the largest labeled phosphoprotein band of the large subunit was removed by this procedure. This component exhibited the same electrophoretic mobility as one of the radioactive phosphoprotein bands which was removed from the small subunit by high salt treatment.."

As expected, the anodic movement of ovalbumin increased and the isoionic point shifted to lower pH values with progressive acetylation of the protein. Measurements on ultraviolet absorption, fluorescence, tryptic digestion, intrinsic viscosity, gel filtration behavior, and immunological reactivity demonstrated that the native folded conformation of ovalbumin was appreciably altered by acetylation. However, even the maximally modified ovalbumin retained considerable residual structure consisting of regions of ordered structure containing antigenic determinants."
https://openalex.org/W1520715074,"The pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase complex (14 S) is dissociated in low ionic strength buffer containing dithiothreitol to form a half-molecular weight subunits (9 S) which are completely inactive for the synthesis of saturated fatty acids. The dithiothreitol-protected (reduced) subunits are rapidly reassociated and reactivated to form the active enzyme complex, not only by an increase in salt concentration but also by micromolar concentrations of NADP+ or NADPH. Increases in KCl or NADPH concentration result in an increase in the extent of reactivation (equilibrium) with no change in the over-all rate of the reaction or the half-life ofreactivation of the enzyme. The extent (equilibrium) of reactivation of the enzyme is the same in 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0; 0.2 M KCl in 5 mM Tris-35 mM glycine buffer, PH 8.3; and 50 muM NADP+ or NADPH in the Tris-glycine buffer. The extent and rate of reactivation of the enzyme is dependent not only on ionic strength and NADPH concentration, but also on pH and temperature. Reactivation with 0.2 M KCl is optimal between pH 7.3 and 8.5. At higher and lower pH values the rate and extent of reactivation are lowered. The rate and extent of reactivation are also decreased as the temperature is lowered below 10 degrees. At 0 degrees there is little reactivation of enzyme activity. However, in the presence of 0.2 M KCl containing 15 to 40% glycerol at 0 degrees, reactivation of the enzyme is about 50% complete. The rate of reactivation of enzyme in the presence of KCl or NADPH conforms to first order kinetics. This result suggests that the subunits first combine to form an inactive complex which is subsequently transformed to an enzymatically active complex. Evidence for the presence of inactive complex was obtained in experiments carried out in 0.2 M KCl at pH 6.0, and in 0.2 M KCl at pH 8.3, at both 6 and 3 degrees. Under these conditions the amount of complex observed upon ultracentrifugation was greater than expected from determinations of enzyme activity. The above findings suggest that ionic and hydrophobic interactions, and possibly the water structure surrounding the interacting sites, are of prime importance in reassociation and reactivation of enzyme. In addition, NADP+ and NADPH have very specific effects in bringing about reassociation and in maintaining the structural integrity of the multienzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1536435886,"Submission of a rat liver homogenate made in 250 mM sucrose-1 mM EDTA to centrifugation between 9,500 times g for 10 min and 105,000 times g for 60 min results in the sedimentation of 60 to 70% of the total cellular fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13). Under these conditions only about one-quarter of the total triose phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase appears in the microsomal fraction. Ultrastructural immunologic localization techniques have demonstrated that the aldolase is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, in situ. The binding of this enzyme to the membrane is sensitive to changes in pH with an optimum at 6.0, and to increasing concentrations of NaCl and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, being about 100-fold more sensitive to the ester than to the inorganic salt."
https://openalex.org/W1574664682,"Four of the membrane proteins from Acholeplasma laidlawii that are soluble in the nonionic detergent Tween 20 have been purified by preparative electrophoretic techniques utilizing different supporting media. The last purification step for two of the major proteins was a preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed in the absence of any detergent. The proteins were recovered by continuous elution. The purity of the fractions was examined by analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Two of the minor proteins were purified by dextran gel electrophoresis as the final step, which was also performed in a detergent-free buffer. The separation was followed by scanning the dextran gel in ultraviolet light. The proteins were recovered by slicing the gel and degrading the gel slices with dextranase. The homogeneity of the fractions was checked by electroimmunoassay."
https://openalex.org/W1592063717,"Poly(A) polymerase activity was first detected in yeast extracts, primarily in association with the ribosomal fraction, by Twu and Bretthauer in 1971 (Twu, J. S., and Bretthauer, RK. (1971) Biochemistry 10, 1576-1582). This activity has now been separated into three distinct enzymes by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Each of the three enzymes can catalyze the incorporation of adenylate residues from ATP into a polyadenylate (poly(A)) tract at the 3' terminus of a primer RNA. Enzyme I elutes at 0.07 M ammonium sulfate from the DEAE-cellulose column, utilizes the mixed polynucleotide poly(A,G,C,U) or ribosomal RNA most efficiently in vitro, and may be responsible in vivo for the initiation of the poly(A) tracts found on yeast messenger RNA. Enzyme II elutes from the column at 0.20 M ammonium sulfate, requires poly(A) itself or an RNA primer containing a 3'-oligo(A) tract, and may be responsible in the nucleus for the elongation of tracts initiated by enzyme I. Enzyme III elutes from the column at 0.56 M ammonium sulfate and is present in low amounts in nuclear extracts. It may be involved in adding poly(A) tracts to messenger RNA in mitochondria. These enzymes also have the intrinsic capacity for the incorporation of cytidylate residues from CTP, which correlates with the finding of cytidylate residues in the poly(A) tracts present in the yeast RNA which is rapidly labeled in vivo. About 75% of the total poly(A) polymerase activity of yeast is enzyme I, most of which is present in the soluble protein fraction of the whole yeast extract. About 20% of the total poly(A) polymerase is enzyme II, and 1 to 5% is enzyme III. All three of the yeast poly(A) polymerases require an RNA primer with a free 3'-hydroxyl group, show no requirement for a DNA template, require Mn-2+ for optimal activity, have pH optima of 8.5, and are inhibited by GTP, CTP, UTP, and native yeast DNA. Polymerases I and II have similar molecular weights by gel filtration."

At pH 6.8, where no dissociation is observed, the molecular weight was found to be 137,000 plus and minus 7,000. Between pH values 7.4 and 7.8 there is some dissociation. Using the data from this study and results in the literature, a model of 7 S nerve growth factor, (alpha beta gamma)2, in reversible equilibrium with a subunit complex, (alpha beta gamma), is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1482919823,"Light-induced proton uptake in bovine retinal outer segment (ROS) fragments was shown to be closely related to pH, salt concentration, membrane integrity, and perhaps secondarily to the volume of osmotic compartments. The principal findings were as follows: 1. As pH increased, both the discs and the plasmalemma swelled, and proton uptake markedly diminished. 2. As the discs were disrupted by increasing concentrations of Triton, proton uptake at slightly alkaline pH was supplanted by proton release. 3. Increasing the concentration of chloride salts caused increased H+ uptake roughly proportional to osmotic shrinkage of the ROS. Buffering by acetate prevented the measurement of proton uptake in the presence of acetate salts, although osmotic behavior of the ROS was similar to that observed in chloride salts. Although increasing the concentration of sucrose also resulted in osmotic shrinkage of the ROS, it was not accompanied by a systematic increase in the magnitude of proton uptake. 4. Light-induced H+ uptake was accompanied by small but reproducible changes in volume, probably of the discs. The magnitude and direction of these rapid volume changes were subject to influence by pH, solute, and other variables."
https://openalex.org/W1489788474,"A temperature-dependent conformational change of the active DPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase was observed. When initial reaction kinetic data were examined between 35 and 5 degrees, the Hill number (n) varied from 2 at higher to n approaching unity at lower temperatures, with an inflection point at 17 degrees. The presence of manganous isocitrate in the incubation media shifted the transition temperature for enzyme inactivation by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) from 8-16 degrees. These temperature-dependent transitions were paralleled by progressive changes in sedimentation velocities from s20, w of 10.4 at 25 degrees to 7.3 at 10 degrees as measured by active band centrifugation. The linear Arrhenius plot for apparent V max and the constancy of S0.5 for the substrate manganous isocitrate between 35 and 5 degrees suggest that this temperature-dependent conformational change may not be solely related to manganous isocitrate. Further indications of equilibria between different species of enzyme in solution and effects of substrates and cofactors on conformation came from studies of specific activity of enzyme diluted into buffers at 3 and 25 degrees. Dilution to concentrations between 10 and 25 mum enzyme resulted in relatively rapid protein concentration-dependent inactivation which could be prevented and fully reversed by manganous isocitrate. No further substantial inactivation was found subsequent to this phase at 25 degrees. Lowering the temperature of the dilution buffer to 3 degrees favored formation of enzyme species exhibiting a further time and pH-dependent loss of activity which became independent of protein concentration below 7 mum enzyme. The rate of cold inactivation was reduced by raising the ionic strength of the buffer and its progress could be arrested by manganous isocitrate; however, the substrate did not restore the original activity."
https://openalex.org/W2057920868,"ALTHOUGH eggshell thinning induced by 2,2-bis-(p-chloro-phenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (DDE)—has been studied in many species (see review by Cooke1), the long term effects of this pesticide have not been investigated. Its duration of action is of great environmental significance since it will determine the effect of any pesticide ingested before the breeding season. In this respect, the finding of continuing high levels of DDE and thin eggshells in the Alaskan peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) in areas free from direct spraying2 argues for a prolonged effect, but direct controlled studies have been lacking. In fact, 18 d is the longest period to date during which thinning has been monitored (in mallards given single oral doses of 500–2,000 mg DDE kg−1) and little recovery of shell thickness was observed3."
https://openalex.org/W1492425549,"A corrected method for the measurement of pyrrole-2-carboxylate in rat urine was used in studies of its excretion under various experimental conditions. The findings implicated administered hydroxy-L-proline as a relatively efficient source of urinary pyrrole-2-carboxylate and tended to exclude administered L-proline as a significant direct source. Removal of aerobic gut flora had no influence on the excretion of pyrrole-2-carboxylate either endogenously or following hydroxy-L-proline administration. Related studied showed that rat kidney L-amino acid oxidase catalyzes oxidation of hydroxy-L-proline to delta1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate, which is converted to pyrrole-2-carboxylate on acidification of reaction mixtures. All findings were consistent with hydroxy-L-proline as the source of endogenous pyrrole-2-carboxylate excretion. Excretion patterns and labeling patterns were compared after administration of pyrrole-2-carboxylate or of hydroxy-proline epimers. From these data, the true excretion product of hydroxy-L-proline oxidation by L-amino acid oxidase appeared to be the unstable oxidation product, delta1-pyrroline-4-hydroxy-2-carboxylate, which is converted to pyrrole-2-carboxylate in urine. The capacity of homogenates of guinea pig kidney and human kidney to carry out oxidation of hydroxy-L-proline to pyrrole-2-carboxylate was much less than that of rat kidney, consistent with the lower levels of urinary pyrrole-2-carboxylate in these species. Experiments designed to examine the modest increase of pyrrole-2-carboxylate excretion after proline loads led to new observations on tissue levels of hydroxy-L-proline following proline administration and on the inhibition by L-proline of hydroxy-L-proline oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1531084823,"Nanosecond fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the unique binding site of the retinol-binding protein (RBP) from human serum. At pH 7.4, the binding of retinol to RBP caused the following spectroscopic changes in the ligand: (a) an enhancement of the fluorescence decay time (gamma = 8 ns); and (b) an increase in the emission anisotropy (A = 0.29). Retinol in hexane has a fluorescent decay time of 4.2 ns and a low emission anisotropy (A = 0.02). The increase in the fluorescence decay time of bound retinol is not due to dielectric relaxation effects of polar groups, since nanosecond time-resolved emission spectra of either retinol in glycerol or retinol bound to RBP, failed to show any time-dependent shifts in emission maxima during the time period investigated 0 to 30 ns. The degree of rotational mobility of bound retinol was investigated by time emission anisotropy measurements. The observed rotational correlation time (theta = 7.2 ns) is consistent with a rigid compact macromolecule of 21,000 molecular weight."
https://openalex.org/W1555282684,"Preincubation of sea urchin sperm guanylate cyclase at 35, 37, 40, or 43 degrees resultedin inactivation. Various metals were able to protect guanylate cyclase against heat inactivation. Estimated binary enzyme-metal dissociation constants for Mn2+, Fe2+, La3+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ were 123, 361, 5.5, 692, 984, 335, 79, and 47 muM, respectively. Extrapolated rates of enzyme denaturation in the presence of saturating concentrations of metal divided by the rates of enzyme denaturation in the absence of metal gave values of 0.13, 0.08, minus 0.1, 0.30, 0.59, 0.66, 0.28, and 0.42 for Mn2+, Fe2+, La3+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Co2+, and Ni2+, respectively. GTP, MgGTP, and SrGTP protected the enzyme only slightly against heat inactivation, but CaGTP and MnGTP protected substantially. Neither CaGTP nor MnGTP protected maximally, however, unless the metal concentration exceeded that of GTP. At fixed free Mn2+ or free Ca2+ concentrations, protection curves as a function of MnGTP or CaGTP appeared to be sigmoidal, suggesting multiple nucleotide binding sites. MnATP also protected against heat, but CaATP was virtually ineffective. Sea urchin sperm guanylate cyclase was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide; CaGTP and MnATP were effective protectants with estimated binary enzyme-Me2+ nucleoside triphosphate dissociation constants of 40 and 170 muM, respectively. MnGTP protected only slightly or not at all against N-ethylmaleimide. These results suggest that: (a) sea urchin sperm guanylate cyclase binds free metal, (b) the binding of free metal is required for protection by nucleotides, and (c) the enzyme contains multiple nucleotide binding sites."

Experimental evidence is presented to show that the activity cannot be due to contaminating RNase A, or other RNase-type protein, to the presence of a mixed dimer between 12- and 119-substituted RNases, or to the presence of trace amounts of Ntau-carboxymethylhistidine-12 RNase.

https://openalex.org/W1537882955,"The reduction of enzyme-bound DPN constitutes a half-reaction of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and has been investigated fluorometrically. Serine was found to inhibit the half-reaction to the same extent and with the same degree of cooperation as the steady state reaction. This finding identifies the ternary complex conversion as the point in the reaction sequence at which serine inhibition occurs. Delta H determinations for the half-reaction showed no difference whether serine was or was not present and led to the conclusion that the inhibitory effect of serine could only manifest itself through the delta S term in the expression for the formation of the activated transition state complex. DL-3-P[2-2H]glyceric acid showed no primary isotope effect in the half-reaction. This result excludes hydrogen transfer as the rate-limiting step in the half-reaction and confirms that an isomerization step, affected by serine, exists in the ternary complex conversion scheme. The deuterated 3-P-glyceric acid shows an isotope effect of 2 in the steady state reaction."
