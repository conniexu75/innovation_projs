https://openalex.org/W3166766123,"Following its emergence in late 2019, the spread of SARS-CoV-21,2 has been tracked by phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences in unprecedented detail3–5. Although the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced. However, travel within Europe resumed in the summer of 2020. Here we report on a SARS-CoV-2 variant, 20E (EU1), that was identified in Spain in early summer 2020 and subsequently spread across Europe. We find no evidence that this variant has increased transmissibility, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variant’s success. Despite travel restrictions, we estimate that 20E (EU1) was introduced hundreds of times to European countries by summertime travellers, which is likely to have undermined local efforts to minimize infection with SARS-CoV-2. Our results illustrate how a variant can rapidly become dominant even in the absence of a substantial transmission advantage in favourable epidemiological settings. Genomic surveillance is critical for understanding how travel can affect transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes. Analysis of the spread of the 20E (EU1) variant of SARS-CoV-2 through Europe suggests that international travel and insufficient containment, rather than increased transmissibility, led to a resurgence of infections."
https://openalex.org/W3166262177,"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Although a number of vaccines have been deployed, the continual evolution of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus has challenged their efficacy. In particular, the emerging variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 (first detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively) have compromised the efficacy of sera from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and immunotherapies that have received emergency use authorization1-3. One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs (variable heavy chain domains of heavy chain antibody (also known as nanobodies)), which can recognize epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies4. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and from mice that we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and Bactrian camels. We identified two groups of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group 1 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group 2 is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry E484K or N501Y substitutions. However, nanobodies in group 2 retain full neutralization activity against these variants when expressed as homotrimers, and-to our knowledge-rival the most potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that have been produced to date. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2-binding domain and recognition of conserved epitopes that are largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, although new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised."
https://openalex.org/W3170166010,"Age is the dominant risk factor for infectious diseases, but the mechanisms linking age to infectious disease risk are incompletely understood. Age-related mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) detected from genotyping of blood-derived DNA, are structural somatic variants indicative of clonal hematopoiesis, and are associated with aberrant leukocyte cell counts, hematological malignancy, and mortality. Here, we show that mCAs predispose to diverse types of infections. We analyzed mCAs from 768,762 individuals without hematological cancer at the time of DNA acquisition across five biobanks. Expanded autosomal mCAs were associated with diverse incident infections (hazard ratio (HR) 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15–1.36; P = 1.8 × 10−7), including sepsis (HR 2.68; 95% CI = 2.25–3.19; P = 3.1 × 10−28), pneumonia (HR 1.76; 95% CI = 1.53–2.03; P = 2.3 × 10−15), digestive system infections (HR 1.51; 95% CI = 1.32–1.73; P = 2.2 × 10−9) and genitourinary infections (HR 1.25; 95% CI = 1.11–1.41; P = 3.7 × 10−4). A genome-wide association study of expanded mCAs identified 63 loci, which were enriched at transcriptional regulatory sites for immune cells. These results suggest that mCAs are a marker of impaired immunity and confer increased predisposition to infections. The burden of mosaic chromosomal alterations in blood-derived DNA, a type of clonal hematopoiesis, is associated with an increased risk for diverse types of infections, including sepsis and pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W3164646585,"Aims Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enabling entrance of the virus into cells and causing the infection termed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we investigate associations between plasma ACE2 and outcome of COVID-19. Methods and results This analysis used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes. The samples were run on the Olink® Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein. High admission plasma ACE2 in COVID-19 patients was associated with increased maximal illness severity within 28 days with OR = 1.8, 95%-CI: 1.4–2.3 ( P &lt; 0.0001). Plasma ACE2 was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with hypertension compared with patients without hypertension ( P = 0.0045). Circulating ACE2 was also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions ( P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). Conclusion This study suggests that measuring plasma ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Further, ACE2 could be a link between COVID-19 illness severity and its established risk factors hypertension, pre-existing heart disease and pre-existing kidney disease."

https://openalex.org/W3171852307,"People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have higher rates of certain comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular disease and cancer, than people without HIV1-5. In view of observations that somatic mutations associated with age-related clonal hematopoiesis (CH) are linked to similar comorbidities in the general population6-10, we hypothesized that CH may be more prevalent in people with HIV. To address this issue, we established a prospective cohort study, the ARCHIVE study (NCT04641013), in which 220 HIV-positive and 226 HIV-negative participants aged 55 years or older were recruited in Australia. Demographic characteristics, clinical data and peripheral blood were collected to assess the presence of CH mutations and to identify potential risk factors for and clinical sequelae of CH. In total, 135 CH mutations were identified in 100 (22.4%) of 446 participants. CH was more prevalent in HIV-positive participants than in HIV-negative participants (28.2% versus 16.8%, P = 0.004), overall and across all age groups; the adjusted odds ratio for having CH in those with HIV was 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.34-3.48, P = 0.002). The most common genes mutated overall were DNMT3A (47.4%), TET2 (20.0%) and ASXL1 (13.3%). CH and HIV infection were independently associated with increases in blood parameters and biomarkers associated with inflammation. These data suggest a selective advantage for the emergence of CH in the context of chronic infection and inflammation related to HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W3172189434,"The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study® is a 10-year longitudinal study of children recruited at ages 9 and 10. A battery of neuroimaging tasks are administered biennially to track neurodevelopment and identify individual differences in brain function. This study reports activation patterns from functional MRI (fMRI) tasks completed at baseline, which were designed to measure cognitive impulse control with a stop signal task (SST; N = 5,547), reward anticipation and receipt with a monetary incentive delay (MID) task (N = 6,657) and working memory and emotion reactivity with an emotional N-back (EN-back) task (N = 6,009). Further, we report the spatial reproducibility of activation patterns by assessing between-group vertex/voxelwise correlations of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation. Analyses reveal robust brain activations that are consistent with the published literature, vary across fMRI tasks/contrasts and slightly correlate with individual behavioral performance on the tasks. These results establish the preadolescent brain function baseline, guide interpretation of cross-sectional analyses and will enable the investigation of longitudinal changes during adolescent development. This paper reports activation patterns for fMRI tasks assessing response inhibition, working memory and reward processing obtained at baseline in the longitudinal ABCD Study, providing a reference for research into adolescent brain development."
https://openalex.org/W3169092661,"CIB2 is a Ca2+- and Mg2+-binding protein essential for mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) by cochlear hair cells, but not by vestibular hair cells that co-express CIB2 and CIB3. Here, we show that in cochlear hair cells, CIB3 can functionally substitute for CIB2. Using X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate that CIB2 and CIB3 are structurally similar to KChIP proteins, auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated Kv4 channels. CIB2 and CIB3 bind to TMC1/2 through a domain in TMC1/2 flanked by transmembrane domains 2 and 3. The co-crystal structure of the CIB-binding domain in TMC1 with CIB3 reveals that interactions are mediated through a conserved CIB hydrophobic groove, similar to KChIP1 binding of Kv4. Functional studies in mice show that CIB2 regulates TMC1/2 localization and function in hair cells, processes that are affected by deafness-causing CIB2 mutations. We conclude that CIB2 and CIB3 are MET channel auxiliary subunits with striking similarity to Kv4 channel auxiliary subunits."
https://openalex.org/W3171922606,"Animal interphase chromosomes are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs). How TADs are formed is not fully understood. Here, we combined high-throughput chromosome conformation capture and gene silencing to obtain insights into TAD dynamics in Xenopus tropicalis embryos. First, TAD establishment in X. tropicalis is similar to that in mice and flies and does not depend on zygotic genome transcriptional activation. This process is followed by further refinements in active and repressive chromatin compartments and the appearance of loops and stripes. Second, within TADs, higher self-interaction frequencies at one end of the boundary are associated with higher DNA occupancy of the architectural proteins CTCF and Rad21. Third, the chromatin remodeling factor ISWI is required for de novo TAD formation. Finally, TAD structures are variable in different tissues. Our work shows that X. tropicalis is a powerful model for chromosome architecture analysis and suggests that chromatin remodeling plays an essential role in de novo TAD establishment."
https://openalex.org/W3168260464,"Quadruplex structures have been identified in a plethora of organisms where they play important functions in the regulation of molecular processes, and hence have been proposed as therapeutic targets for many diseases. In this paper we report the extensive bioinformatic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and related viruses using an upgraded version of the open-source algorithm G4-iM Grinder. This version improves the functionality of the software, including an easy way to determine the potential biological features affected by the candidates found. The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for SARS-CoV-2. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, 512 potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over seventeen thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were then compared subsequently to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire viral realm. Sequences found in common with other viral species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the SARS-CoV-2 were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates were then confirmed experimentally. Using NMR and CD spectroscopy, we found several highly stable RNA quadruplexes that may be suitable therapeutic targets for the SARS-CoV-2."

https://openalex.org/W3168059834,"Spinal fusion surgery causes severe pain. Strong opioids, commonly used as postoperative analgesics, may have unwanted side effects. S-ketamine may be an effective analgesic adjuvant in opioid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). However, the optimal adjunct S-ketamine dose to reduce postoperative opioid consumption is still unknown.We randomized 107 patients at two tertiary hospitals in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of adults undergoing major lumbar spinal fusion surgery. Patients were randomly allocated to four groups in order to compare the effects of three different doses of adjunct S-ketamine (0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg ml-1) or placebo on postoperative analgesia in oxycodone PCA. Study drugs were administered for 24 hours postoperative after which oxycodone-PCA was continued for further 48 hours. Our primary outcome was cumulative oxycodone consumption at 24 hours after surgery.Of the 100 patients analyzed, patients receiving 0.75 mg ml-1 S-ketamine in oxycodone PCA needed 25% less oxycodone at 24 h postoperatively (61.2 mg) compared with patients receiving 0.5 mg ml-1 (74.7 mg) or 0.25 mg ml-1 (74.1 mg) S-ketamine in oxycodone or oxycodone alone (81.9 mg) (mean difference: -20.6 mg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -41 to -0.20; P = 0.048). A beneficial effect in mean change of pain intensity at rest was seen in the group receiving 0.75 mg ml-1 S-ketamine in oxycodone PCA compared with patients receiving lower ketamine doses or oxycodone alone (standardized effect size: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.013-0.32, P = 0.033). The occurrence of adverse events was similar among the groups.Oxycodone PCA containing S-ketamine as an adjunct at a ratio of 1: 0.75 decreased cumulative oxycodone consumption at 24 h after major lumbar spinal fusion surgery without additional adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W3171426392,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disease. Variants in MYBPC3, the gene encoding cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), are the leading cause of HCM. However, the pathogenicity status of hundreds of MYBPC3 variants found in patients remains unknown, as a consequence of our incomplete understanding of the pathomechanisms triggered by HCM-causing variants. Here, we examined 44 nontruncating MYBPC3 variants that we classified as HCM-linked or nonpathogenic according to cosegregation and population genetics criteria. We found that around half of the HCM-linked variants showed alterations in RNA splicing or protein stability, both of which can lead to cMyBP-C haploinsufficiency. These protein haploinsufficiency drivers associated with HCM pathogenicity with 100% and 94% specificity, respectively. Furthermore, we uncovered that 11% of nontruncating MYBPC3 variants currently classified as of uncertain significance in ClinVar induced one of these molecular phenotypes.

The two most frequent mechanisms of protein haploinsufficiency induced by putative nontruncating variants in monogenic diseases are RNA splicing defects that result in the appearance of premature stop codons (25Xiong H.Y.

However, how these molecular features cause disease remains unknown because of the lack of systematic comparison with nonpathogenic variants. For instance, mild changes in splicing may be better tolerated than full native splicing abrogation by a conserved splice site mutation (20Helms A.S. Davis F.M. Coleman D. Bartolone S.N. Glazier A.A.

In a recent report, Thompson et al. (22Thompson A.D. Helms A.S. Kannan A. Yob J. Lakdawala N.K. Wittekind S.G. Pereira A.C. Jacoby D.L. Colan S.D. Ashley E.A. Saberi S. Ware J.S. Ingles J.

These encouraging computational results call for experimental assessment of protein destabilization phenotypes induced by MYBPC3 variants. Here, in quest of molecular features that identify pathogenicity, we examined cMyBP-C haploinsufficiency drivers in missense and synonymous MYBPC3 variants. Our strategy builds on the characterization of variants for which cosegregation and population genetics data are available, providing information about their pathogenicity. We propose that experimentally testable variant-induced RNA splicing alteration and extensive protein destabilization provide functional evidence of pathogenicity in 11% of putative nontruncating MYBPC3 variants currently classified as VUS in ClinVar. We built a database containing 20 HCM-linked and 24 nonpathogenic putative synonymous and missense MYBPC3 variants covering the entire coding sequence of the gene (see Experimental procedures section, File S1). We classified as HCM-linked those variants showing minor allele frequency (MAF) <10−4 in the Genome Aggregation Database and showing evidence of pathogenicity based exclusively on cosegregation and population genetics criteria validated by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (32Richards S.

Our approach enables agnostic investigation and quantification of molecular pathomechanisms, since pathogenicity is not assigned according to functional or bioinformatics criteria. Interestingly, the majority of HCM-linked variants in our database target domains C3, C6, and C10, as observed in the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (21Helms Adam S. Thompson Andrea D.

Genomic Precision Med. 2020; 13: 396-405Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All nonpathogenic variants have MAF >10−4, which is incompatible with HCM prevalence (13Walsh R. Thomson K.L. Ware J.S.

We next investigated whether altered RNA splicing and protein stability are specific to HCM-linked variants, under the premise that molecular features related to disease should not appear in nonpathogenic variants. We first triaged variants using bioinformatics predictors and then assessed positive hits experimentally (Fig. 1B). RNA splicing is the process by which noncoding introns are removed from precursor mRNA, leading to exon-only–containing mature mRNA. Splicing involves specific recognition of the strictly conserved two first (donor site) and last (acceptor site) intron nucleotides. Mutations in these sequences impair canonical splicing, resulting in alternative mRNAs that contain premature stop codons, or lead to insertion/deletions in the polypeptide (33Lee Y. Rio D.C. Mechanisms and regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2015; 84: 291-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in MYBPC3 that affect conserved splicing sites are considered to lead to truncations and are classified as pathogenic (8Singer E.S. Ingles J. Semsarian C. Bagnall R.D.

However, the correct functioning of the splicing machinery also involves recognition of sequence features in the exons, particularly in regions close to exon–exon boundaries. As a consequence, variants in exonic sequences of MYBPC3 traditionally classified as missense can result in RNA splicing alterations that lead to truncated polypeptides (7Ito K. Patel P.N.

Indeed, we found that four HCM-linked variants in our database are predicted in silico to induce splicing site losses (Fig. 2A and Table 1). These variants target the first or last nucleotide of an exon (Note S1). Predictions also identified two HCM-linked variants that can lead to activation of new splicing sites. In contrast, all nonpathogenic variants target nucleotides outside exon–exon boundaries, and none of them is predicted to cause loss of native splicing sites.

https://openalex.org/W3168770460,"Background To investigate the excess of deaths by specific causes, in the first half of 2020 in the city of São Paulo-Brazil, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Ecological study conducted from 01/01 to 06/30 of 2019 and 2020. Population and mortality data were obtained from DATASUS. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) by age was calculated by comparing the standardized mortality rate in 2020 to that of 2019, for overall and specific mortality. The ratio between the standardized mortality rate due to COVID-19 in men as compared to women was calculated for 2020. Crude mortality rates were standardized using the direct method. Results COVID-19 was responsible for 94.4% of the excess deaths in São Paulo. In 2020 there was an increase in overall mortality observed among both men (SMR 1.3, 95% CI 1.17–1.42) and women (SMR 1.2, 95% CI 1.06–1.36) as well as a towards reduced mortality for all cancers. Mortality due to COVID-19 was twice as high for men as for women (SMR 2.1, 95% CI 1.67–2.59). There was an excess of deaths observed in men above 45 years of age, and in women from the age group of 60 to 79 years. Conclusion There was an increase in overall mortality during the first six months of 2020 in São Paulo, which seems to be related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chronic health conditions, such as cancer and other non-communicable diseases, should not be disregarded."

Aneurysm clips with different compression forces were applied extradurally around the spinal cord at T10. Motor plasticity was evaluated by examining the motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Long-term iTBS treatment was given at the post-SCI 5th week and continued for 2 weeks (5 consecutive days/week). Time-course changes in locomotor function and the axonal regeneration level were measured by the Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) scale, and growth-associated protein (GAP)-43 expression was detected in brain and spinal cord tissues. iTBS-induced potentiation was reduced at post-1-week SCI lesion and had recovered by 4 weeks post-SCI lesion, except in the severe group. Multiple sessions of iTBS treatment enhanced the motor plasticity in all SCI rats. The locomotor function revealed no significant changes between pre- and post-iTBS treatment in SCI rats. The GAP-43 expression level in the spinal cord increased following 2 weeks of iTBS treatment compared to the sham-treatment group. This preclinical model may provide a translational platform to further investigate therapeutic mechanisms of transcranial magnetic stimulation and enhance the possibility of the potential use of TMS with the iTBS scheme for treating SCIs."

Here, we report the design and development of a genome-mining approach for targeted discovery of biochemical transformations through the analysis of co-occurring enzyme domains (CO-ED) in a single protein. CO-ED was designed to identify unannotated multifunctional enzymes for functional characterization and discovery based on the premise that linked enzyme domains have evolved to function collaboratively. Guided by CO-ED, we targeted an unannotated predicted ThiF–nitroreductase di-domain enzyme found in more than 50 proteobacteria. Through heterologous expression and biochemical reconstitution, we discovered a series of natural products containing the rare oxazolone heterocycle and characterized their biosynthesis. Notably, we identified the di-domain enzyme as an oxazolone synthetase, validating CO-ED-guided genome mining as a methodology with potential broad utility for both the discovery of unusual enzymatic transformations and the functional annotation of multidomain enzymes. A genome-mining approach targeted to enzyme domains that co-occur in a single protein (CO-ED) facilitates the discovery and characterization of an oxazolone synthetase involved in the biosynthesis of a series of oxazolone-containing natural products."
https://openalex.org/W3165003251,"Reperfusion therapy, the standard treatment for acute myocardial infarction, can trigger necrotic death of cardiomyocytes and provoke ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, signaling pathways that regulate cardiomyocyte necrosis remain largely unknown. Our recent genome-wide RNAi screen has identified a potential necrosis suppressor gene PRKAR1A, which encodes PKA regulatory subunit 1α (R1α). R1α is primarily known for regulating PKA activity by sequestering PKA catalytic subunits in the absence of cAMP. Here, we showed that depletion of R1α augmented cardiomyocyte necrosis in vitro and in vivo, resulting in exaggerated myocardial I/R injury and contractile dysfunction. Mechanistically, R1α loss downregulated the Nrf2 antioxidant transcription factor and aggravated oxidative stress following I/R. Degradation of the endogenous Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 through p62-dependent selective autophagy was blocked by R1α depletion. Phosphorylation of p62 at Ser349 by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a critical step in p62-Keap1 interaction, was induced by I/R, but diminished by R1α loss. Activation of PKA by forskolin or isoproterenol almost completely abolished hydrogen-peroxide-induced p62 phosphorylation. In conclusion, R1α loss induces unrestrained PKA activation and impairs the mTORC1-p62-Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant defense system, leading to aggravated oxidative stress, necrosis, and myocardial I/R injury.

Our findings uncover a novel role of PKA in oxidative stress and necrosis, which may be exploited to develop new cardioprotective therapies. Despite the advances in treatment strategies, acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major cause of death worldwide (1Virani S.S. Alonso A. Benjamin E.J. Bittencourt M.S. Callaway C.W. Carson A.P. Chamberlain A.M. Chang A.R. Cheng S. Delling F.N. Djousse L. Elkind M.S.V. Ferguson J.F. Fornage M. Khan S.S. et al.Heart disease and stroke statistics-2020 update: A report from the American Heart Association.Circulation. 2020; 141: e139-e596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). MI is characterized by myocardial ischemia owing to coronary artery occlusion. Restoration of blood flow by timely reperfusion can salvage ischemic myocardium and has been widely adopted in clinical MI treatment. Unfortunately, reperfusion therapy itself is associated with excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which provokes cardiac cell death and contributes to the extent of MI (2Heusch G. Myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and cardioprotection in perspective.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2020; 17: 773-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As a major form of cell death in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, necrosis has great potential to be targeted in MI therapies. However, pharmacologic necrosis inhibitors have rarely progressed to clinical trials, and the translation into better outcomes in patients has been disappointing (3Davidson S.M. Ferdinandy P. Andreadou I. Botker H.E. Heusch G. Ibanez B. Ovize M. Schulz R. Yellon D.M. Hausenloy D.J. Garcia-Dorado D. Action C.C. Multitarget strategies to reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury: JACC review topic of the week.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2019; 73: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The poor clinical translation of cardioprotective therapies might be due to our incomplete understanding of the signaling pathways underlying regulated necrosis (4Del Re D.P. Amgalan D. Linkermann A. Liu Q. Kitsis R.N. Fundamental mechanisms of regulated cell death and implications for heart disease.Physiol. Rev. 2019; 99: 1765-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To search for novel necrosis regulators, we recently performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and showed that PRKAR1A is a highly scored necrosis inhibitory gene (5Cheng Z. Combs M. Zhu Q. Xia P. Opheim Z. Parker J. Mack C.P. Taylor J.M. Genome-wide RNAi screen identifies regulators of cardiomyocyte necrosis.ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2019; 2: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). PRKAR1A encodes the protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit 1α (R1α), which is constitutively expressed in all cell types including cardiomyocytes. In the absence of the second messenger 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), R1α sequesters the PKA catalytic subunits and restrains kinase activity. Upon binding with cAMP, R1α undergoes conformational change, resulting in release of the PKA catalytic subunit and subsequent kinase activation. The canonical PKA pathway is initiated by stimulation with catecholamines including epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol (6Liu Y. Chen J. Fontes S.K. Bautista E.N. Cheng Z. Physiological and pathological roles of protein kinase A in the heart.Cardiovasc. Res. 2021; cvab008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Catecholamines bind β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) to induce Gs-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), resulting in cAMP synthesis and PKA activation. Activation of PKA increases cardiac contractility and heart rate through phosphorylating Ca2+-handling proteins (6Liu Y. Chen J. Fontes S.K. Bautista E.N. Cheng Z. Physiological and pathological roles of protein kinase A in the heart.Cardiovasc. Res. 2021; cvab008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains elusive whether PKA modulates necrosis. In response to oxidative and electrophilic stresses, the body launches the antioxidant defense system mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (7Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Motohashi H. The KEAP1-NRF2 system: A Thiol-based sensor-effector apparatus for maintaining redox homeostasis.Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98: 1169-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The Nrf2 transcription factor binds the antioxidant response element (ARE) to induce expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is rapidly degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway following polyubiquitination mediated by kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). In the presence of ROS or electrophiles, Keap1 is oxidized at the cysteine residues, leading to p62-dependent Keap1 degradation and Nrf2 stabilization (8Taguchi K. Fujikawa N. Komatsu M. Ishii T. Unno M. Akaike T. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Keap1 degradation by autophagy for the maintenance of redox homeostasis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that disruption of R1α suppresses Keap1 degradation and impairs Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response. Mechanistically, R1α depletion inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-mediated p62 phosphorylation at Ser349, resulting in diminished p62-Keap1 interaction and degradation. Following myocardial I/R challenge, R1α loss aggravates oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte necrosis, leading to exaggerated cardiac dysfunction. Our findings suggest that PKA plays a critical role in the regulation of oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte necrosis. Based on unbiased genome-wide RNAi screening, we previously reported that the PRKAR1A gene was a potential necrosis suppressor (5Cheng Z. Combs M. Zhu Q. Xia P. Opheim Z. Parker J. Mack C.P. Taylor J.M. Genome-wide RNAi screen identifies regulators of cardiomyocyte necrosis.ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2019; 2: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To validate this finding, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) were transfected with Prkar1a siRNAs prior to incubation with increasing concentrations of H2O2. Loss of plasma membrane integrity, a hallmark of necrosis, was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Treatment with H2O2 (50–100 μM) for up to 4 h increased LDH release in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Unlike the apoptosis-inducing agent doxorubicin, H2O2 did not increase the level of cleaved PARP (Fig. S1, A and B), a widely used marker of apoptosis. These results suggested that stimulation with H2O2 in our experimental conditions induced necrosis but not apoptosis in NRCMs. Knockdown of the R1α-encoding gene Prkar1a further augmented H2O2-induced LDH release (Fig. 1A) without enhancing PARP cleavage (Fig. S1, A and B), suggesting that disruption of R1α exacerbated necrosis but not apoptosis. Prkar1a gene silencing also reduced cell viability at baseline and following incubation with H2O2 (Fig. 1B). To further validate the antinecrotic role of R1α, adult mouse cardiomyocytes (AMCMs) were isolated from control or cardiac-specific Prkar1a heterozygous deficient (Prkar1aflox/+/Mlc2v-Cre+/−, hereafter referred to as cPRKAR1A+/−) mice (9Liu Y.

Endocrinol. 2011; 25: 1786-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Again, deletion of Prkar1a significantly augmented H2O2-induced LDH release in AMCMs (Fig. 1C). Prkar1a deficiency also increased propidium iodide (PI) incorporation, another marker of membrane rupture (Fig. 1D). Together, these results suggested that depletion of R1α exacerbated oxidative-stress-induced cardiomyocyte necrosis in vitro. To determine whether R1α also antagonizes calcium-overload-induced necrosis, NRCMs transfected with Prkar1a siRNAs were challenged with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Knockdown of Prkar1a significantly increased ionomycin-induced LDH release (Fig. S2A) and reduced cell viability (Fig. S2B). The increase in LDH release resulting from Prkar1a silencing was attenuated by treatment with the PKA inhibitor PKI, suggesting PKA activation was necessary for necrosis (Fig. S2C). In line with these findings, depletion of Prkar1a in H9c2 cardiac myoblasts also augmented ionomycin-induced LDH release (Fig. S2D) and decreased cell viability (Fig. S2E). Necrosis is a major form of cell death in MI with reperfusion (4Del Re D.P. Amgalan D. Linkermann A. Liu Q. Kitsis R.N. Fundamental mechanisms of regulated cell death and implications for heart disease.Physiol. Rev. 2019; 99: 1765-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that Prkar1a deficiency exaggerates necrosis in vivo, cPRKAR1A+/− or control mice were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Necrotic cardiomyocytes were delineated with Evans blue, a red fluorescent dye for the assessment of sarcolemmal integrity in vivo (14Song M. Mihara K. Chen Y. Scorrano L. Dorn 2nd., G.W. Mitochondrial fission and fusion factors reciprocally orchestrate mitophagic culling in mouse hearts and cultured fibroblasts.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 273-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Evans blue signal was not detectable in normal hearts from either genotype (data not shown), indicating the absence of necrosis at baseline. By contrast, Evans-blue-positive cardiomyocytes were clearly visible post I/R and were significantly increased by Prkar1a ablation (Fig. 2A). Prkar1a deficiency also increased infarct size as measured by the percentage of infarct area to area at risk or the total left ventricle (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we repeatedly observed a smaller area at risk in cPRKAR1A+/− hearts (Fig. 2B), possibly due to exaggerated penetration of Evans blue through the permeabilized sarcolemma. In agreement with our previous study (9Liu Y. Xia P. Chen J. Bandettini W.P. Kirschner L.S. Stratakis C.A. Cheng Z. PRKAR1A deficiency impedes hypertrophy and reduces heart size.Physiol. Rep. 2020; 8e14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), basal heart function was comparable between both groups of mice (Fig. 2C). At 1 week post I/R, however, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) were significantly lower in cPRKAR1A+/− than in control mice (Fig. 2C). At baseline, myocardial fibrosis was minimal and comparable in both genotypes (Fig. S3). Notably, fibrotic area was significantly larger in cPRKAR1A+/− hearts than in controls at 8 weeks post I/R (Fig. 2D). Collectively, Prkar1a deficiency exacerbated cardiomyocyte necrosis following I/R, leading to increased infarct size, reduced cardiac function, and aggravated fibrotic remodeling. Since reperfusion-induced ROS generation is a major cause of necrotic cell death (2Heusch G. Myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury and cardioprotection in perspective.Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2020; 17: 773-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we examined whether both genotypes were under similar levels of oxidative stress following I/R challenge. In control hearts, I/R rapidly increased the fluorescence intensity of 4-hydroxynoneal (4-HNE), a product of lipid peroxidation and a widely used biomarker for oxidative stress (Fig. 3A). When compared with controls, cPRKAR1A+/− hearts displayed higher levels of 4-HNE both in basal conditions and after I/R. To determine whether Prkar1a deficiency aggravates oxidative stress in a cardiomyocyte autonomous fashion, AMCMs were isolated from control or cPRKAR1A+/− hearts prior to incubation with H2O2. As shown in Figure 3B, ablation of Prkar1a significantly augmented H2O2-induced 2ʹ,7ʹ-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (H2DCFDA) fluorescence, an indicator of overall oxidative stress. Moreover, silencing of Prkar1a in NRCMs also increased H2DCFDA fluorescence following H2O2 stimulation (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, disruption of R1α augmented oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes. Intracellular redox homeostasis is maintained by a variety of antioxidant defense systems including the Nrf2 pathway (7Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Motohashi H. The KEAP1-NRF2 system: A Thiol-based sensor-effector apparatus for maintaining redox homeostasis.Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98: 1169-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Under basal conditions, Nrf2 was expressed at low level in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4A). Stimulation with H2O2 dramatically increased Nrf2 protein level as an adaptive response to protect against oxidative damage. Intriguingly, lack of R1α provoked PKA kinase activation at baseline (as determined by the levels of phosphorylated PKA substrates) and blunted H2O2-induced upregulation of Nrf2 (Fig. 4A). In addition, H2O2 treatment increased the mRNA levels of established Nrf2 transcriptional targets Nqo1 and p62, which were diminished by Prkar1a depletion (Fig. 4, B and C). Lack of R1α also reduced Nqo1 protein level after H2O2 challenge (Fig. 4D). To further validate these findings in vivo, control and cPRKAR1A+/− mice were subjected to I/R and hearts were collected at 1 h. Deficit of R1α again reduced Nrf2 and Nqo1 protein levels in mouse heart (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, Nrf2 was detected at ∼100 kDa in NRCMs (Fig. 4A) and ∼67 kDa in mouse heart (Fig. 4E). When compared with controls, cPRKAR1A+/− hearts exhibited lower mRNA levels of Nrf2 targets Nqo1, Gstm1, and p62 (Fig. 4F). These results suggested that lack of R1α repressed the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 and thus impaired the endogenous defense response against oxidative stress. In nonstressed conditions, Nrf2 undergoes rapid proteasomal degradation that is dependent on Keap1 (7Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Motohashi H. The KEAP1-NRF2 system: A Thiol-based sensor-effector apparatus for maintaining redox homeostasis.Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98: 1169-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). R1α deficit-related Nrf2 repression during oxidative stress (Fig. 4) was associated with increased Keap1 protein at baseline (Fig. 5A). Incubation with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide revealed that lack of R1α dramatically elongated the half-life of Keap1 protein from 5.2 h to 17.4 h (Fig. 5B), indicating increased protein stability. Since Keap1 is mainly degraded through autophagy (8Taguchi K. Fujikawa N. Komatsu M. Ishii T. Unno M. Akaike T. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Keap1 degradation by autophagy for the maintenance of redox homeostasis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), stabilization of Keap1 could be caused by a defect in autophagy. Indeed, disruption of R1α also increased the protein level and stability of p62, a well-known autophagy substrate and a reporter of autophagic activity (Fig. 5, A and B). Since Prkar1a depletion did not increase p62 mRNA level (Fig. 4C), the upregulation of p62 protein was primarily mediated by increased p62 protein stability. Surprisingly, lack of R1α failed to reduce the level of lipidated microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II), a widely used autophagosome marker (Fig. S4A). The rate of LC3-II turnover, evaluated with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine as described previously (15Cheng Z. Zhu Q. Dee R. Opheim Z. Mack C.P. Cyr D.M. Taylor J.M. Focal adhesion kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin1 protein suppresses cardiomyocyte autophagy and initiates hypertrophic growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 2065-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was comparable between control and Prkar1a-depleted cells (Fig. S4B), suggesting that knockdown of R1α did not inhibit autophagic flux. Therefore, lack of R1α did not block the nonselective general autophagy, but specifically inhibited autophagic degradation of Keap1 and p62. To further determine whether the effects of R1α loss on autophagy are recapitulated by pharmacological PKA activation, NRCMs were incubated with the adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin or the β-AR agonist isoproterenol. Both forskolin and isoproterenol dramatically increased p62 level in a dose-dependent manner, without reducing LC3-II level (Fig. S4C). Moreover, treatment with forskolin or isoproterenol did not inhibit LC3-II turnover, indicating unaltered autophagic flux (Fig. S4D). Conversely, treatment with the PKA inhibitor H89 markedly accelerated p62 degradation (Fig. S5), suggesting that PKA activation stabilizes p62. Importantly, loss of R1α also increased p62 protein level in mouse heart (Fig. 5C). As an autophagy adaptor, p62 recruits a selective group of substrates to autophagosomes for degradation. For example, Keap1 degradation occurs through p62-dependent selective autophagy (8Taguchi K. Fujikawa N. Komatsu M. Ishii T. Unno M. Akaike T. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Keap1 degradation by autophagy for the maintenance of redox homeostasis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The binding affinity of p62 for Keap1 is increased by p62 phosphorylation at Ser349 (16Ichimura Y. Waguri S. Sou Y.S. Kageyama S. Hasegawa J. Ishimura R. Saito T. Yang Y. Kouno T. Fukutomi T. Hoshii T. Hirao A. Takagi K. Mizushima T. Motohashi H. et al.Phosphorylation of p62 activates the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway during selective autophagy.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51: 618-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown whether cardiac ROS stimulates p62 phosphorylation to trigger Keap1 degradation and Nrf2 activation. As shown in Figure 6A, treatment with H2O2 induced p62 phosphorylation at Ser349 in a time-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of p62 was accompanied by a decline in Keap1 level, as well as upregulation of Nrf2 and its transcriptional targets p62, Nqo1 and Ho-1 (Fig. 6A). These data were in agreement with previous findings that p62 phosphorylation played a causal role in Keap1 degradation and Nrf2 activation (16Ichimura Y. Waguri S. Sou Y.S. Kageyama S. Hasegawa J. Ishimura R. Saito T. Yang Y. Kouno T. Fukutomi T. Hoshii T. Hirao A. Takagi K. Mizushima T. Motohashi H. et al.Phosphorylation of p62 activates the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway during selective autophagy.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51: 618-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Similar to R1α (Fig. 4A), knockdown of p62 increased Keap1 level and markedly diminished H2O2-induced Nrf2 upregulation (Fig. 6B), suggesting that p62 is necessary for Nrf2 activation. Moreover, myocardial I/R time-dependently induced p62 phosphorylation at Ser349, which was also associated with Nrf2 upregulation (Fig. 6C). Together, these results suggested that phosphorylation of p62 at Ser349 was a key cardiac defense mechanism against oxidative stress. It is known that p62 competes with Nrf2 to bind Keap1, resulting in Nrf2 stabilization and activation (17Komatsu M. Kurokawa H. Waguri S. Taguchi K. Kobayashi A. Ichimura Y. Sou Y.S. Ueno I. Sakamoto A. Tong K.I. Kim M. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Ueno T. et al.The selective autophagy substrate p62 activates the stress responsive transcription factor Nrf2 through inactivation of Keap1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). We were intrigued by our findings that R1α loss increased p62 protein but repressed Nrf2. Therefore, we interrogated whether lack of R1α inactivated p62. Indeed, disruption of R1α abrogated H2O2-induced p62 phosphorylation at Ser349 (Fig. 7A) and p62-Keap1 interaction (Fig. 7B). These results suggested that loss of R1α compromised the adaptor function of p62, which was necessary for Keap1 degradation by p62-dependent selective autophagy (7Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Motohashi H. The KEAP1-NRF2 system: A Thiol-based sensor-effector apparatus for maintaining redox homeostasis.Physiol. Rev. 2018; 98: 1169-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Importantly, cPRKAR1A+/− hearts exhibited significantly lower level of phospho-p62 (Ser349) following I/R (Fig. 7C). We next examined whether pharmacologic PKA activation also recapitulates the effect of R1α loss. As expected, treatment with forskolin or isoproterenol almost completely abolished H2O2-induced p62 phosphorylation at Ser349 (Fig. 7D). Therefore, activation of PKA suppressed ROS-induced p62 phosphorylation, leading to repression of the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant axis. Since the Ser349 site of p62 is phosphorylated by mTORC1 (16Ichimura Y. Waguri S. Sou Y.S. Kageyama S. Hasegawa J. Ishimura R. Saito T. Yang Y. Kouno T. Fukutomi T. Hoshii T. Hirao A. Takagi K. Mizushima T. Motohashi H. et al.Phosphorylation of p62 activates the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway during selective autophagy.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51: 618-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), we next determined whether cardiac ROS exposure induces mTORC1 activation. Treatment of NRCMs with H2O2 transiently increased the levels of phospho-S6K1 (Thr389) and phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37/46), two well-established mTORC1 substrates (Fig. 8A). Intriguingly, knockdown of Prkar1a abolished H2O2-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4EBP1 (Fig. 8B). In line with our in vitro findings, I/R also induced cardiac S6K1 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, indicating mTORC1 activation (Fig. 8C). Ablation of Prkar1a significantly reduced the level of phospho-S6K1 (Thr389) in mouse heart post I/R (Fig. 8D). Collectively, these results suggested that disruption of R1α abrogated ROS-induced mTORC1 activation, thereby impaired the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant defense system (Fig. 8E). Necrotic cell death is a key mediator of tissue damage in various ischemic, inflammatory, and degenerative diseases. Studies over the past decades suggest that necrosis can be a highly organized process that is amenable to pharmacological interventions (4Del Re D.P. Amgalan D. Linkermann A. Liu Q. Kitsis R.N. Fundamental mechanisms of regulated cell death and implications for heart disease.Physiol. Rev. 2019; 99: 1765-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Hence, exploring the necrosis signaling pathways may open new avenues for the development of novel therapies. In the present study, we demonstrated that loss of R1α exacerbated cardiomyocyte necrosis in vitro and in vivo, leading to aggravated myocardial I/R injury. Mechanistically, disruption of R1α abolished mTORC1-mediated p62 phosphorylation at Ser349, thereby inhibited the endogenous Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant activity and augmented oxidative stress (Fig. 8E). Our results suggest that elevated PKA activity may contribute to myocardial I/R injury through increasing oxidative stress and necrosis. In agreement with our findings, a most recent study reveals that R1α localizes at the lysosome to inhibit Ca2+ release and protect against ex vivo I/R injury (18Simon J.N. Vrellaku B. Monterisi S.

Catecholamine stimulation induces activation of the AC/cAMP/PKA pathway (6Liu Y. Chen J. Fontes S.K. Bautista E.N. Cheng Z. Physiological and pathological roles of protein kinase A in the heart.Cardiovasc. Res. 2021; cvab008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, acute exposure to high level of catecholamine increases sarcolemmal permeability and provokes cardiomyocyte necrosis (19Ellison G.M. Torella D. Karakikes I. Purushothaman S. Curcio A.

It is believed that catecholamines induce necrosis via triggering intracellular Ca2+ overload, owing to PKA-dependent increases in Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 and SR Ca2+ leak through ryanodine receptor 2 (19Ellison G.M. Torella D. Karakikes I. Purushothaman S. Curcio A. Gasparri C. Indolfi C. Cable N.T. Goldspink D.F. Nadal-Ginard B.

In this study, we investigated the potential role of lncRNA TUG1 in regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-mediated apoptosis in high glucose induced renal tubular epithelial cells. Human renal tubular epithelial cell line HK-2 was challenged with high glucose following transfection with lncRNA TUG1, miR-29c-3p mimics or inhibitor expression plasmid, either alone or in combination, for different experimental purposes. Potential binding effects between TUG1 and miR-29c-3p, as well as between miR-29c-3p and SIRT1 were verified. High glucose induced apoptosis and ERS in HK-2 cells, and significantly decreased TUG1 expression. Overexpressed TUG1 could prevent high glucose-induced apoptosis and alleviated ERS via negatively regulating miR-29c-3p. In contrast, miR-29c-3p increased HK-2 cells apoptosis and ERS upon high glucose-challenge. SIRT1 was a direct target gene of miR-29c-3p in HK-2 cells, which participated in the effects of miR-29c-3p on HK-2 cells. Mechanistically, TUG1 suppressed the expression of miR-29c-3p, thus counteracting its function in downregulating the level of SIRT1. TUG1 regulates miR-29c-3p/SIRT1 and subsequent ERS to relieve high glucose induced renal epithelial cells injury, and suggests a potential role for TUG1 as a promising diagnostic marker of diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W3166187513,"Deuterium Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (DMRS) is a non-invasive technique that allows the detection of deuterated compounds in vivo. DMRS has a large potential to analyze uptake, perfusion, washout or metabolism, since deuterium is a stable isotope and therefore does not decay during biologic processing of a deuterium labelled substance. Moreover, DMRS allows the distinction between different deuterated substances. In this work, we performed DMRS of deuterated 3-O-Methylglucose (OMG). OMG is a non-metabolizable glucose analog which is transported similar to D-glucose. DMRS of OMG was performed in phantom and in vivo measurements using a preclinical 7 Tesla MRI system. The chemical shift (3.51 ± 0.1 ppm) and relaxation times were determined. OMG was injected intravenously and spectra were acquired over a period of one hour to monitor the time evolution of the deuterium signal in tumor-bearing rats. The increase and washout of OMG could be observed. Three different exponential functions were compared in terms of how well they describe the OMG washout. A mono-exponential model with offset seems to describe the observed time course best with a time constant of 1910 ± 770 s and an offset of 2.5 ± 1.2 mmol/l (mean ± std, N = 3). Chemical shift imaging could be performed with a voxel size of 7.1 mm x 7.1 mm x 7.9 mm. The feasibility of DMRS with deuterium labelled OMG could be demonstrated. These data might serve as basis for future studies that aim to characterize glucose transport using DMRS."
https://openalex.org/W3166401947,"Unbalanced copper (Cu2+ ) homeostasis is associated with the developmental defects of vertebrate myogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, it was found that Cu2+ stressed zebrafish embryos and larvae showed reduced locomotor speed as well as loose and decreased myofibrils in skeletal muscle, coupled with the downregulated expression of muscle fiber markers mylpfa and smyhc1l and the irregular arrangement of myofibril and sarcomere. Meanwhile, the Cu2+ stressed zebrafish embryos and larvae also showed significant reduction in the expression of H3K4 methyltransferase smyd1b transcripts and H3K4me3 protein as well as in the binding enrichment of H3K4me3 on gene mylpfa promoter in skeletal muscle cells, suggesting that smyd1b-H3K4me3 axis mediates the Cu2+ -induced myofibrils specification defects. Additionally, whole genome DNA methylation sequencing unveiled that the gene smyd5 exhibited significant promoter hyper-methylation and increased expression in Cu2+ stressed embryos, and the ectopic expression of smyd5 in zebrafish embryos also induced the myofibrils specification defects as those observed in Cu2+ stressed embryos. Moreover, Cu2+ was shown to suppress myofibrils specification and smyd1b promoter transcriptional activity directly independent of the integral function of copper transporter cox17 and atp7b. All these data may shed light on the linkage of unbalanced copper homeostasis with specific gene promoter methylation and epigenetic histone protein modification as well as the resultant signaling transduction and the myofibrillogenesis defects."
https://openalex.org/W3167553352,"Aim To assess the prevalence of isolated teratozoospermia (iTZS) in a cohort of infertile and fertile men; explore the relationship between iTZS, inflammatory parameters and sperm DNA fragmentation index (SDF) in the same cohort. Materials and methods 1824 infertile men and 103 fertile controls. Semen analysis, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and serum hormones were investigated. DFI was tested in infertile men only. According to 2010 WHO semen analysis, patients were categorized in 3 sub-groups of isolated sperm defects: isolated oligozoospermia (iOZS), isolated asthenozoospermia (iAZS) and iTZS. Descriptive statistics and linear regression models tested the association between clinical variables and inflammatory markers. Results Among infertile men, iAZS, iTZS, and iOZS were found in 13.9%, 11.9% and 4.1% participants, respectively. iTZS was found in 37 (35.9%) fertile men. Infertile men with iTZS had higher NLR values than those with iOZS, iAZS and men with normal semen parameters (all p&lt;0.001). FSH and LH were higher and inhibin B lower in iOZS infertile men compared to all other groups (p≤0.001). Hormonal characteristics were similar between iTZS infertile and fertile men. Similarly, iTZS infertile men had higher SDF than all other groups (all p&lt;0.001). Infertile men with iTZS had higher NLR values than fertile men with iTZS (p&lt;0.01). Linear regression analysis showed that, in infertile men, iTZS was associated with SDF and NLR (all p≤0.01). Conclusions iTZS was found in 11.9% of infertile men but it was even more prevalent in fertile controls. Infertile men with iTZS had higher NLR than fertile controls and increased SDF values than infertile participant with iAZS, iOZS, or normal semen parameters. No differences in hormonal characteristics were found between infertile and fertile men with iTZS."

Here, we investigated the kinetics of iNAD+ levels in different cell types challenged with prolonged exposure to extracellular NAD+ (eNAD+). Surprisingly, we found that after the initial increase, iNAD+ contents decreased back to control levels (iNAD+ resetting). Focusing our attention on HeLa cells, we found that oxygen and ATP consumption occurred with similar temporal kinetics after eNAD+ exposure. Using [3H]NAD+ and [14C]NAD+, we determined that NAD+ resetting was not due to increased dinucleotide extrusion but rather due to reduced uptake of cleaved NAD+ products. Indeed, eNAD+ exposure reduced the expression of the ecto-5′-nucleotidase CD73, the nicotinamide adenine mononucleotide transporter solute carrier family 12 member 8, and the nicotinamide riboside kinase. Interestingly, silencing the NAD+-sensor enzyme sirtuin 1 prevented eNAD+-dependent transcriptional repression of ecto-5′-nucleotidase, solute carrier family 12 member 8, and nicotinamide riboside kinase, as well as iNAD+ resetting. Our findings provide the first evidence for a sirtuin 1–mediated homeostatic response aimed at maintaining physiological iNAD+ levels in conditions of excess eNAD+ availability. These data may be of relevance for therapies designed to support the NAD+ metabolome via extracellular supplementation of the dinucleotide or its precursors. In the last several years, NAD+ supplementation has emerged as an innovative and safe therapeutic strategy for a wide spectrum of disorders, including diabetes and neuropathy.

These data may be of relevance for therapies designed to support the NAD+ metabolome via extracellular supplementation of the dinucleotide or its precursors. In the last several years, our understanding of the NAD+ metabolome extended from that of a mere electron-carrying cofactor for oxidation–reduction reactions to an essential enzymatic substrate involved in key signaling pathways (1Verdin E. NAD+ in aging, metabolism, and neurodegeneration.Science. 2015; 350: 1208-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) such as those brought about by polyADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), monoADP-ribosyltransferases, sirtuins (SIRTs), and the ADP-ribosyl hydrolase/cyclase (CD38). These enzymes play pivotal roles in DNA repair, gene expression, cell cycle regulation, and calcium signaling (2Cantó C. Menzies K.J. Auwerx J. NAD+ metabolism and the control of energy homeostasis: A balancing act between mitochondria and the nucleus.Cell Metab. 2015; : 2015Google Scholar). In keeping with the important roles of these functions in disease pathogenesis, a large body of evidence shows that impairment of NAD+ availability, due to either reduced biosynthesis or increased consumption, promotes aging (3Gomes A.P.

In this regard, it is worth noting that the temporal kinetics of these perturbations are currently unknown. Indeed, whether cells can prompt compensatory responses aimed at resetting iNAD+ homeostasis once the latter has been altered by increased extracellular availability of the dinucleotide waits to be investigated. This is an essential point in light of the therapeutic potential ascribed to various NAD+ boosting strategies in disorders typically characterized by a chronic pattern of progression that, by definition, would necessitate continuous exposure to NAD+ or its metabolic precursors. On this basis, in the present study, we attempted to understand whether and how iNAD+ homeostasis changes over time in cells challenged with a prolonged increase of eNAD+ availability. We previously reported that iNAD+ contents increase upon a brief exposure of HeLa cells to eNAD+ and that this increase confers significant cytoprotection from apoptosis triggered by staurosporine, C2 ceramide, or N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (32Pittelli M.

To our knowledge, however, the effects of prolonged exposure of resting cells to eNAD+ have never been investigated. To address this issue, we evaluated the effects of 1 mM eNAD+ on iNAD+ contents in HeLa cells during a 24-h incubation. We found that iNAD+ contents increased from 9.2 ± 1.3 to 19.5 ± 2.4 nmol/mg protein at 8 h and then, surprisingly, linearly decreased over time to return to basal levels after 24 h (Fig. 1A). Notably, the same results were obtained when cells were exposed to lower eNAD+ concentrations (Fig. S1A). Furthermore, to rule out that this finding was specific for HeLa cells, we also evaluated the effects of eNAD+ over time in SHSY-5Y (neuroblastoma), HT29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), and renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and found similar kinetics of iNAD+ contents upon NAD+ exposure (Fig. 1A). Given that eNAD+ exposure increases both cellular oxygen consumption and ATP content (32Pittelli M. Felici R. Pitozzi V. Giovannelli L. Bigagli E. Cialdai F. Romano G. Moroni F. Chiarugi A. Pharmacological effects of exogenous NAD on mitochondrial bioenergetics, DNA repair, and apoptosis.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 80: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we next attempted to understand whether these two bioenergetic parameters also showed a biphasic response upon a prolonged challenge to eNAD+. Indeed, the augmented oxygen consumption present in cells exposed to 1 mM NAD+ for 1 h vanished at 24 h, reaching values lower than those of resting cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In keeping with this, we found that ATP contents promptly increased in cells exposed to eNAD+, reaching a maximum at 3 h (from 72 ± 2.3 to 122.4 ± 8.4 nmol/mg protein) and then showed a slow decrease over time reaching the basal level after 30-h incubation (Fig. 1D). Notably, we found that cells exposed to lower eNAD+ concentration presented a lower increase of ATP contents (Fig. S1B) and oxygen consumption (Fig. S1C), which underlies that the changes of these metabolic parameters are linked to changes in NAD contents. We also found a small increase in the ADP pool probably because of a contribution of eNAD+ to the adenylate pool (Fig. S1D). The unexpected return of iNAD+ contents to control levels during eNAD+ exposure hereinafter referred to as “iNAD+ resetting,” prompted us to first hypothesize that it was merely due to its reduction to NADH. We, therefore, measured the cellular contents of NADH over time during eNAD+ exposure and found that they increased by 22.59 ± 3% after 24 h (Fig. 1E). Given that the extent of this increase was not consistent with that of NAD+ resetting (equaling a reduction of 112.28 ± 31% of peak values) (Fig. 1A), we reasoned that mechanisms in addition to NADH formation should be involved. Given that NAMPT and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) play a key role in the maintenance of iNAD+, we hypothesized that changes in their expression levels could contribute to NAD+ resetting. We found, however, that transcript levels for NAMPT, NMNAT1, and NMNAT3 did not change and those for NMNAT2 almost doubled, whereas those of nicotinamide riboside kinase (NRK1) decreased by 9-fold in cells exposed to eNAD+ for 24 h (Fig. 1F). In an attempt to identify additional mechanisms underlying iNAD+ resetting, we hypothesized involvement of the NAD+-consuming enzymes PARPs or/and mono (ADP-ribose) polymerases. We found, however, that a high concentration of two different PARP inhibitors PJ34 (10 μM) (51Goldfarb R.D. Marton A. Szabó É. Virág L. Salzman A.L. Glock D. Akhter I. McCarthy R. Parrillo J.E.

The risk and protective factors associated with high compliance to these preventive measures are critical to enhancing pandemic preparedness. Objective This survey aims to assess differences in mental health, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of preventive measures for COVID-19 amongst healthcare professionals (HCP) and non-healthcare professionals. Design Multi-national cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May-June 2020. Setting Multi-national survey was distributed across 36 countries through social media, word-of-mouth, and electronic mail. Participants Participants ≥21 years working in healthcare and non-healthcare related professions. Main outcome Risk factors determining the difference in KAP towards personal hygiene and social distancing measures during COVID-19 amongst HCP and non-HCP. Results HCP were significantly more knowledgeable on personal hygiene (AdjOR 1.45, 95% CI -1.14 to 1.83) and social distancing (AdjOR 1.31, 95% CI -1.06 to 1.61) compared to non-HCP. They were more likely to have a positive attitude towards personal hygiene and 1.5 times more willing to participate in the contact tracing app. There was high compliance towards personal hygiene and social distancing measures amongst HCP. HCP with high compliance were 1.8 times more likely to flourish and more likely to have a high sense of emotional (AdjOR 1.94, 95% CI (1.44 to 2.61), social (AdjOR 2.07, 95% CI -1.55 to 2.78), and psychological (AdjOR 2.13, 95% CI (1.59–2.85) well-being. Conclusion and relevance While healthcare professionals were more knowledgeable, had more positive attitudes, their higher sense of total well-being was seen to be more critical to enhance compliance. Therefore, focusing on the well-being of the general population would help to enhance their compliance towards the preventive measures for COVID-19."

MetS status included the following categories: MetS-chronic (n = 941,609), MetS-developed (n = 614,229), MetS-recovery (n = 455,835), and MetS-free (n = 4,745,375).With a median follow-up duration of 6.403 years, 1,350 subjects were newly diagnosed with laryngeal cancer. Compared to participants without MetS, adjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% confidence interval) for those with MetS were 1.320 (1.17-1.489) for laryngeal cancer. The HR of laryngeal cancer was found to be increased with increasing number of MetS components. The MetS-developed group had a significantly higher risk of laryngeal cancer than the MetS-free group (HR: 1.296; 95% CI: 1.093-1.537). The MetS-recovery group within two years also had an increased risk of laryngeal cancer compared with the MetS-free group (HR: 1.220; 95% CI: 1.008-1.476). Among MetS components, abdominal obesity had the highest risk of laryngeal cancer (HR: 1.374; 95% CI: 1.123-1.681).Changes in MetS status were associated with the risk of laryngeal cancer. Results of this study have implications for etiological investigations and prevention strategies."

In the present study, we examined the phosphorylation of DDHD1 and identified the responsible protein kinases.

The treatment of cells with a protein phosphatase inhibitor induced the hyperphosphorylation of DDHD1, suggesting that multisite phosphorylation occurred not only at these major, but also at minor sites. Site-specific kinase-substrate prediction algorithms and in vitro kinase analyses indicated that cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1/cyclin A2 phosphorylated Ser8, Ser11, and Ser727 in DDHD1 with a preference for Ser11 and that CDK5/p35 also phosphorylated Ser11 and Ser727 with a preference for Ser11. In addition, casein kinase CK2α1 was found to phosphorylate Ser104, although this was not a major phosphorylation site in cultivated HEK293 cells.

Posttranslational modifications play a key role in many cellular processes such as signaling and regulatory processes (28Deribe Y.L. Pawson T. Dikic I. Post-translational modifications in signal integration.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is the most common posttranslational modification and is involved in intracellular signaling through the regulation of individual enzymes. However, limited information is currently available on the posttranslational modifications and basal regulatory mechanisms of the PLA1 activity of human DDHD1. In addition to DDHD1 gene mutations, dysregulation of the PLA1 activity of DDHD1 may also correlate with the development of pathogenesis in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study, we examined an important posttranslational modification, the “phosphorylation” of human DDHD1. We identified multisite phosphorylated serine and threonine residues using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, and systematic alanine-substituted mutagenesis (Fig. S1). In addition, we demonstrated that the potential responsible protein kinases are cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) for the major phosphorylation sites Ser11 and Ser727. We also found that phosphorylation alters the subcellular localization of DDHD1 without large change of PLA1 activity. Based on the primary structure of human DDHD1, multiple phosphorylation sites were predicted by various software programs, such as NetPhos 3.1 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos/), and analyses revealed multiple phosphorylation sites in human DDHD1. Phosphoserines, S8, S11, S104, S130, S139, S332, S723, S727, S738, and S806 are predicted with a high score (over 0.500) (Table S1). CDK5 and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) were predicted to be involved in most of the phosphorylation sites, whereas casein kinase 1 (CK1) was predicted to be involved at S130 and S738. To confirm these predictions, we examined the phosphorylation of human DDHD by Zn2+-Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, which enables the separation of phosphorylated proteins based on their slower mobility relative to their unphosphorylated counterparts in gels containing a phosphate-binding tag (29Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Takiyama K. Koike T. Phosphate-binding tag, a new tool to visualize phosphorylated proteins.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). After FLAG-tagged human DDHD1 was expressed in HEK293 cells, cells were treated with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A in growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). As shown in Figure 1A, the inhibition of endogenous phosphatase activity with okadaic acid altered the mobility of DDHD1 in Phos-tag SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis; many slower bands were detected by the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. In addition, even when cells were cultivated in normal growth medium with 10% FBS and 25 mM glucose, DDHD1 was phosphorylated because treatment with lambda protein phosphatase (λPP) increased mobility (Fig. 1B, lane 1 versus 2, lane 8 versus 9). Therefore, human DDHD1 was suggested to be highly phosphorylated and may be reversibly regulated in phosphorylation–dephosphorylation states by protein kinases and phosphatases. We attempted to identify phosphorylation sites in human DDHD1 using MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis. FLAG-DDHD1-expressing HEK293 or PANC1 cells were treated with okadaic acid, and FLAG-DDHD1 was purified by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. After the in-gel digestion of purified FLAG-DDHD1 with trypsin or Asp-N, the resultant phosphopeptides were further purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) or titanium dioxide (TiO2), zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), or TiO2/ZrO2 affinity chromatography. Peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS/MS. The Mascot analysis using the database of the human SwissProt 2016_07 (551,705 sequences), 2016_08 (551,987 sequences), or 2017_04 (554,241 sequences), or FLAG-tagged human DDHD1 sequence revealed more than ten phosphopeptides of DDHD1 with significant scores (Table 1). These phosphorylation sites account for 11% (nine serines) and 2% (one threonines) of the total because human DDHD1 protein contains 82 serines and 50 threonines. Most phosphoserines or phosphothreonine, except S727, which were predicted by NetPhos 3.1 (Table S1), were detected by MALDI-TOF MS/MS (Table 1). Phosphothreonine 726 was detected by MS/MS, although the score of NetPhos 3.1 for threonine 726 was not high (0.448). The prediction also suggested that GSK3 is involved in the phosphorylation of threonine 726. Two representative MS/MS fragment spectra of DDHD1-derived phosphopeptides are shown in Figure 2 (the spectra of other peptides are shown in Fig. S2). The peptide DK2NY…GS28 was phosphorylated at serine 8 (Ser8) and Ser11 (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the peptide 708EP…SR732, containing six serines and three threonines, was phosphorylated at Ser723 and threonine 726 (Thr726) (Fig. 2B). Single-phosphorylated peptides at only Ser8, Ser11, or Ser723 were also detected, but not at Thr726 (Table 1, Fig. S2, A, B, and G). The phosphorylation of DDHD1 at Ser8, Ser11, and Ser723 was also predicted using a protein phosphorylation site predictor; however, the software implied a greater potential for phosphorylation at Ser727 than at Thr726 (Table S1). Therefore, we presumed that Ser727 was also a candidate residue for the phosphorylation of DDHD1. Evidence supporting the phosphorylation of Ser727 is described later (Fig. 1B). We considered the phosphorylation of Ser727 to be sensitive to dephosphorylation by phosphatase or the detection process of MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Alternately, we considered the possibility that Ser727 cannot be phosphorylated when Thr726 is already phosphorylated.Table 1Peptides with phosphorylation sites found in human DDHD1Theoretical DDHD1 phosphorylation sitesStartEndSequenceMascot ion scoreExpectation valueMD-scorem/z ratioChargeSourceSer8228DKNYPGRGpSPRSPEHNGRGGGGGAWELGS444.3 × 10−58.33033.04241+HEK293, Asp-N, ZrO2/TiO2Ser11228DKNYPGRGSPRpSPEHNGRGGGGGAWELGS609.6 × 10−7103033.04241+HEK293, Asp-N, ZrO2/TiO2Ser8, Ser11228DKNYPGRGpSPRpSPEHNGRGGGGGAWELGS243.6 × 10−38.53113.02231+HEK293, Asp-N, ZrO2/TiO2Ser104, Ser139102143YYpSEGESGGGGSSLSLHPPQQPPLVPTNSGGGGATGGpSPGER717.4 × 10−628.14144.08711+PANC1, Okadaic acid, Trypsin, TiO2Ser130102143YYSEGESGGGGSSLSLHPPQQPPLVPTNpSGGGGATGGSPGER1416.1 × 10−1311.54064.10721+HEK293, Trypsin, TiO2Ser139102143YYSEGESGGGGSSLSLHPPQQPPLVPTNSGGGGATGGpSPGER881.2 × 10−75.24064.10721+HEK293, Trypsin, TiO2Ser332318336GQQMQENFDIEVSKpSIDGK411.1 × 10−2122233.30631+PANC1, Okadaic acid, Trypsin, TiO2Ser723708732EPTSVSENEGISTIPpSPVTSPVLSR537.7 × 10−410.72663.77921+HEK293, Okadaic acid, Trypsin, ZrO2/TiO2Ser723, Thr726708732EPTSVSENEGISTIPpSPVpTSPVLSR792 × 10−624.92743.75911+HEK293, Trypsin, ZrO2/TiO2Ser738733744RHYGEpSITNIGK217.6 × 10−310.61454.48131+PANC1, Okadaic acid, Trypsin, TiO2Ser806783809DEKKPVASPSATTVGTQTLPHSSpSGFL942.2 × 10−892822.96711+HEK293, Okadaic acid, Asp-N, ZrO2/TiO2Underlined sequences are derived from the FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus of DDHD1. Open table in a new tab Underlined sequences are derived from the FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus of DDHD1. To confirm the phosphorylation sites of DDHD1, we created several site-directed mutants in which phosphorylation sites identified by MALDI-TOF MS/MS (Table 1) were changed to alanine (Fig. S1). The substitutions to alanine resulted in the creation of phosphorylation-resistant forms of DDHD1. These constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and changes in the mobility of DDHD1 mutants from that of wild-type DDHD1 (WT) were analyzed by Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. The WT enzyme and serine or threonine to alanine substitution enzymes had several bands that migrated slower than those of λPP-treated WT, suggesting that WT and the mutant enzymes were phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). With the mutant enzymes, S11A (the mutant of serine 11 to alanine), S723A, T726A, and S727A, there were faster migrating bands and fewer slower bands than with WT. This demonstrated that the amino acid residues Ser11, Ser723, and Thr726 were phosphorylated and confirmed the results of MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Although the phosphorylation of Ser727 was not observed by MALDI-TOF MS/MS, Phos-tag SDS-PAGE of the S727A mutant revealed its phosphorylation. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE of DDHD1 with multiple mutations revealed that its migration was generally faster than that of WT and the single and double/triple mutants (Fig. 1B). These results again indicated that Ser8, Ser11, Ser723, Thr726, and Ser727 were all phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of Ser8 is easily detectable based on comparison of the mobility of S11/727A (Fig. 1B, lane 10) and S8/11/727A (Fig. 1B, lane 14). The mobility of the bands of the S8/11/727A mutant was similar to that of the bands of the λPP-treated WT enzyme (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 14); however, doublet bands were observed with the S8/11/727A mutant. In addition, the mobility of the bands of the S8/11/727A mutant was similar to that of S8/11/723/727A (Fig. 1B, lanes 14 and 15), suggesting that the degree of phosphorylation at Ser723 was low. Therefore, Ser8, Ser11, and Ser727 are the major phosphorylation sites of DDHD1 in HEK293 cells. The fast migrating band was broader in the Phos-tag SDS-PAGE of S8/11/T726A (Fig. 1B, lane 13). Comparison with S8/11A (Fig. 1B, lane 12) revealed that the degree of phosphorylation at Thr726 is high because migration was increased by mutation at Thr726. In contrast, the fast migrating band of S8/11/T726A was broader upward than that of S8/11/727A (Fig. 1B, lane 14), suggesting a greater degree of phosphorylation at Ser727 than at Thr726, whereas Ser8 and Ser11 were not phosphorylated. The inhibition of phosphorylation at Thr726 may suppress that of other serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (or the activation of dephosphorylation) because very fast migrating bands were observed in the Phos-tag SDS-PAGE of the T726A mutant (Fig. 1B, lane 6). As the front of the broader bands migrated faster than that of λPP-treated WT, the mutation at T726 may affect not only the inhibition of phosphorylation, but also conformational changes in the 3D structure of DDHD1. However, detailed comparisons suggested that the degree of phosphorylation differed at each serine or threonine. The phosphorylation of Ser8 was not prominent because the mobility of S8A was not as affected as that of WT (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). However, based on comparison of the mobility of S727A (Fig. 1B, lane 7) and S8/727A (Fig. 1B, lane 11), the intensity of the fast migrating band decreased, whereas that of slower migrating ones, which were (hyper-) phosphorylated, markedly increased when Ser8 and Ser727 were not phosphorylated. Thus, the phosphorylation of Ser8 affected the phosphorylation of other sites. In contrast, there were more fast migrating bands and fewer slower bands in S8/11A (Fig. 1B, lane 12) than in S11A (Fig. 1B, lane 4); however, very slow migrating bands, which were (hyper-) phosphorylated, were also observed. These results again suggested that phosphorylation is increased when Ser8 and Ser11 are not phosphorylated. Similar results were observed in analyses employing other human cell lines such as HeLa, PANC1, and HepG2 cells (Fig. S3). Collectively, the main phosphorylation sites of human DDHD1 were Ser8, Ser11, Ser723, and Ser727 when these cells were cultivated in growth medium. However, hyperphosphorylated bands were observed when S8/11/723/727A mutant-expressing HEK293 cells were treated with okadaic acid (Fig. S4), suggesting that human DDHD1 is phosphorylated at multiple minor sites when protein phosphatase is inhibited. The phosphorylation of minor sites may be highly sensitive to dephosphorylation by phosphatase. The PLA1 activity of DDHD1 was measured by a method employing a fluorescent substrate (PED-A1). PED-A1 is a probe specific to PLA1 or lipase activities because the BODIPY FL acyl chain esterifies the sn-1 position and the short-chain alkyl moiety is ether-linked to the sn-2 position, which is resistant (noncleavable) to phospholipase A2.

https://openalex.org/W3172552827,"The cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP)-based P1 component acts as a biomarker for cochlear implantation (CI) outcomes in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). To date, early intervention primarily before the age of two years and six months of CI usage is necessary and sufficient to achieve age-appropriate cortical maturation and good prognosis. However, varying degrees of neural dyssynchrony, resulting from the etiological heterogeneity of ANSD, may preclude uniform application of this hypothesis to ensure auditory cortical maturation. Thus, a focused evaluation of those carrying OTOF variants, which may be the salient molecular etiology of prelingual ANSD, would circumvent the issue of heterogeneity. Here, we sought to provide a much better understanding of the brain perspectives (i.e., P1 maturation) in OTOF-associated ANSD subjects and set the stage for an optimal strategy to enhance language development. We conducted a preliminary study comprising 10 subjects diagnosed with OTOF-related ANSD who underwent CI by a single surgeon and subsequently underwent measurements of the P1 component. We observed that DFNB9 subjects who received CI after 2 years of age exhibited ""absent"" or ""anomalous"" P1 components that correspond to delayed language development. However, timely implantation, as early as 12 months of age per se, might be insufficient to achieve age-appropriate cortical maturation of DFNB9 in cases with six to seven months of device use. This suggests the importance of sustained rehabilitation in DFNB9 than in other etiologies. Indeed, an additional follow-up study showed that a reduction in P1 latency was linked to an improvement in auditory performance. Collectively, our results suggest that central auditory maturation and successful outcome of CI in DFNB9 may have more demanding requirements, that is, earlier implantation and more sustained rehabilitation. We believe that the current study opens a new path toward genome-based neuroimaging in the field of hearing research."

A single protein subunit contains two Mn-binding cupin domains, and catalysis depends on Mn(III) at the N-terminal site. The present study suggests a mechanistic function for the C-terminal Mn as an electron hole donor for the N-terminal Mn. The resulting spatial separation of the radical intermediates directs the chemistry toward decarboxylation of the substrate. A π-stacked tryptophan pair (W96/W274) links two neighboring protein subunits together, thus reducing the Mn-to-Mn distance from 25.9 Å (intrasubunit) to 21.5 Å (intersubunit). Here, we used theoretical analysis of electron hole-hopping paths through redox-active sites in the enzyme combined with site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography to demonstrate that this tryptophan pair supports effective electron hole hopping between the C-terminal Mn of one subunit and the N-terminal Mn of the other subunit through two short hops of ∼8.5 Å. Replacement of W96, W274, or both with phenylalanine led to a large reduction in catalytic efficiency, whereas replacement with tyrosine led to recovery of most of this activity. W96F and W96Y mutants share the wildtype tertiary structure. Two additional hole-hopping networks were identified leading from the Mn ions to the protein surface, potentially protecting the enzyme from high Mn oxidation states during turnover. Our findings strongly suggest that multistep hole-hopping transport between the two Mn ions is required for enzymatic function, adding to the growing examples of proteins that employ aromatic residues as hopping stations.

This mechanism involves the progress of the electron from donor to acceptor (or, equivalently, a hole from electron acceptor to electron donor), in a sequence of multiple electron transfer reactions. An electron hole is a quasi-particle and represents the lack of an electron from an orbital where it could exist. In 2015, Gray and Winkler showed that approximately one-third of the protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have putative redox chains of three or more residues linked to a surface-exposed tyrosine or tryptophan, and they suggested that hole hopping through these groups may serve as a protection mechanism from oxidative damage (10Gray H.B.

It is interesting to note that the occurrence frequency of tryptophan and tyrosine in these proteins, i.e., 1.1% to 2.4% for W and 2.6% to 4.8% for Y, is at or above the average across the tree of life (1.3% and 2.5% for W and Y, respectively) (16Moghadam S.A.

This kinetic analysis can be used to analyze many kinds of biological electron transfer hopping networks. In this article, we describe a combined theoretical and experimental study of potential electron transfer pathways in oxalate decarboxylase (OxDC) of Bacillus subtilis. Our calculations point toward an efficient hole-hopping pathway between the N- and C-terminal Mn ions through a π-stacked tryptophan pair (W96/W274) located at the interface between two subunits in the hexameric quaternary structure of the protein. Experimentally, our site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that these residues play a prominent role in catalysis, enabling electron transport between redox cofactors on a catalytically relevant time scale.

Heavy atom isotope effects on the reaction catalyzed by the oxalate decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The substrate is generally considered to be the mono-anion of oxalate, C2HO2−, which has a pKa of 4.3 (52Reinhardt L.A. Svedružić D. Chang C.H. Cleland W.W. Richards N.G.J. Heavy atom isotope effects on the reaction catalyzed by the oxalate decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1244-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Only about 16% of the Mn in enzyme preparations poised at low pH is in the +3 state, essentially all located at the N-terminal site (51Twahir U.T. Ozarowski A. Angerhofer A. Redox cycling, pH dependence, and ligand effects of Mn(III) in oxalate decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 6505-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the Mn(III) EPR signal closely follows the pH dependence of the catalytic activity, which suggests that Mn(III) is the driver of catalysis (51Twahir U.T. Ozarowski A. Angerhofer A. Redox cycling, pH dependence, and ligand effects of Mn(III) in oxalate decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis.Biochemistry. 2016; 55: 6505-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that dioxygen is needed for catalysis, and most mechanistic schemes in the literature presume it is bound directly to the N-terminal Mn as a superoxide, indicated by the letter X in Figure 1A (44Zhu W. Richards N.G.J. Biological functions controlled by manganese redox changes in mononuclear Mn-dependent enzymes.in: Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Bioinorganic Chemistry. Portland Press Ltd, London2017: 259-270Google Scholar). However, experimental evidence for the existence of a superoxide-bound Mn(III) in OxDC is still lacking. Moreover, the existence of such a complex under turnover conditions would interfere with the proposed intermediate oxalate radical, and one should expect it to lead to a two-electron oxidation of the substrate yielding two equivalents of carbon dioxide and one of hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide was indeed observed by EPR spin trapping during turnover, together with an intermediate carbon dioxide radical anion (53Twahir U.T. Stedwell C.N. Lee C.T. Richards N.G. Polfer N.C. Angerhofer A. Observation of superoxide production during catalysis of Bacillus subtilis oxalate decarboxylase at pH 4.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 80: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the trapping ratio of these two radicals distinctly changes in the T165V mutant that favors the open conformation and strongly suggests that the two radicals originate from two different locations in the protein (53Twahir U.T. Stedwell C.N. Lee C.T. Richards N.G. Polfer N.C. Angerhofer A. Observation of superoxide production during catalysis of Bacillus subtilis oxalate decarboxylase at pH 4.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 80: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We speculated, therefore, that oxygen might bind to the C-terminal Mn ion (see the gray part of the mechanism in Fig. 1A) (53Twahir U.T. Stedwell C.N. Lee C.T. Richards N.G. Polfer N.C. Angerhofer A. Observation of superoxide production during catalysis of Bacillus subtilis oxalate decarboxylase at pH 4.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2015; 80: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This would protect the oxalate radical at the N-terminal site from further oxidation and explain the rather low rate of oxidase activity of ∼0.2% of all turnovers (21Tanner A. Bornemann S. Bacillus subtilis YvrK is an acid-induced oxalate decarboxylase.J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5271-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Tanner A. Bowater L. Fairhurst S.A. Bornemann S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43627-43634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis requires a LRET pathway for the electron withdrawn from the substrate to make its way to a dioxygen bound at the C-terminal cupin domain. As we demonstrate here, such a hopping pathway does indeed exist via the π-stacked W96/W274 pair within the hexameric cluster found in the reported OxDC crystal structures (see Fig. 1B). To test the hypothesis of W-mediated hopping transport in OxDC, site-directed mutants were prepared for W96 and W274. In order to protect the quaternary structure, we used the aromatic amino acid phenylalanine, which we hypothesized would maintain a π-stacking interaction with the neighboring indole, while disrupting the hole-hopping chain due to its higher reduction potential (54Byrdin M. Eker A.P.M. Vos M.H. Brettel K. Dissection of the triple tryptophan electron transfer chain in Escherichial coli DNA photolyase: Trp382 is the primary donor in photoactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

B. 2018; 122: 3723-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We find, indeed, that the W→F mutations significantly depress catalytic activity while the corresponding W→Y mutations partially rescue catalysis. Replacement of the phenylalanine with tyrosine was used as a control experiment. Since tyrosine has a redox potential similar to that of tryptophan it was expected to rescue activity (56Glover S.D.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2018; 140: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hopping pathway calculations (using EHPath) were carried out on the mutants to analyze expected electron transfer rates in the proteins. Since W and Y occur at a slightly elevated frequency in OxDC of 1.6% and 3.7%, respectively, compared with the general average, we also explored other electron transfer paths in the protein. X-ray crystallography was carried out on single crystals of the W96F and W96Y forms to determine the structure of the W mutant proteins. The W274 mutant proteins and the double mutants did not produce X-ray quality single crystals. Intra- and intermolecular long-range electron hopping pathways within the hexameric quaternary assembly of OxDC were assessed using the EHPath program described in Experimental procedures (15Teo R.D.

https://openalex.org/W3167877429,"Earlier phylogenetic studies in the genus Pinguicua (Lentibulariaceae) suggested that the species within a geographical region was rather monophyletic, although the sampling was limited or was restricted to specific regions. Those results conflicted with the floral morphology-based classification, which has been widely accepted to date. In the current study, one nuclear ribosomal DNA (internal transcribed spacer; ITS) and two regions of chloroplast DNA (matK and rpl32-trnL), from up to ca. 80% of the taxa in the genus Pinguicula, covering all three subgenera, were sequenced to demonstrate the inconsistency and explore a possible evolutionary history of the genus. Some incongruence was observed between nuclear and chloroplast topologies and the results from each of the three DNA analyses conflicted with the morphology-based subgeneric divisions. Both the ITS tree and network, however, corresponded with the biogeographical patterns of the genus supported by life-forms (winter rosette or hibernaculum formation) and basic chromosome numbers (haploidy). The dormant strategy evolved in a specific geographical region is a phylogenetic constraint and a synapomorphic characteristic within a lineage. Therefore, the results denied the idea that the Mexican group, morphologically divided into the three subgenera, independently acquired winter rosette formations. Topological incongruence among the trees or reticulations, indicated by parallel edges in phylogenetic networks, implied that some taxa originated by introgressive hybridisation. Although there are exceptions, species within the same geographical region arose from a common ancestor. Therefore, the classification by the floral characteristics is rather unreliable. The results obtained from this study suggest that evolution within the genus Pinguicula has involved; 1) ancient expansions to geographical regions with gene flow and subsequent vicariance with genetic drift, 2) acquirement of a common dormant strategy within a specific lineage to adapt a local climate (i.e., synapomorphic characteristic), 3) recent speciation in a short time span linked to introgressive hybridisation or multiplying the ploidy level (i.e., divergence), and 4) parallel evolution in floral traits among lineages found in different geographical regions (i.e., convergence). As such, the floral morphology masks and obscures the phylogenetic relationships among species in the genus."
https://openalex.org/W3168893723,"Background Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to several countries including Ethiopia. Outside of Africa, kidney involvement in VL is frequent and associated with increased mortality. There is however limited data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in VL patients in East-Africa, particularly in areas with high rates of HIV co-infection. This study aims to determine the prevalence, characteristics and associated factors of AKI in VL patients in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A hospital based retrospective patient record analysis was conducted including patients treated for VL from January 2019 to December 2019 at the Leishmaniasis Research and Treatment Center (LRTC), Gondar, Ethiopia. Patients that were enrolled in ongoing clinical trials at the study site and those with significant incomplete data were excluded. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. P values were considered significant if &lt; 0.05. Results Among 352 VL patients treated at LRTC during the study period, 298 were included in the study. All were male patients except two; the median age was 23 years (IQR: 20–27). The overall prevalence of AKI among VL patients was 17.4% (confidence interval (CI): 13.6%-22.2%). Pre-renal azotemia (57%) and drug-induced AKI (50%) were the main etiologies of AKI at admission and post-admission respectively. Proteinuria and hematuria occurred in 85% and 42% of AKI patients respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed HIV co-infection (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 6.01 95% CI: 1.99–18.27, p = 0.001) and other concomitant infections (AOR: 3.44 95% CI: 1.37–8.65, p = 0.009) to be independently associated with AKI. Conclusion AKI is a frequent complication in Ethiopian VL patients. Other renal manifestations included proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria. HIV co-infection and other concomitant infections were significantly associated with AKI. Further studies are needed to quantify proteinuria and evaluate the influence of AKI on the treatment course, morbidity and mortality in VL patients."

ACE2 is on the X chromosome, and in mice, deletion of ACE2 leads to the development of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The relationship between sex and renal ACE2 expression in humans with kidney disease is a gap in current knowledge.We studied renal tubulointerstitial microarray data and clinical variables from subjects with FSGS enrolled in the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) study. We compared relationships between ACE2 expression and age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and genes implicated in inflammation and fibrosis in male and female subjects.ACE2 mRNA expression was lower in the tubulointerstitium of males compared to females (P = 0.0026). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that ACE2 expression was related to sex and eGFR but not to age or treatment with renin angiotensin system blockade. ACE2 expression is also related to interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy, in males but not in females. Genes involved in inflammation (CCL2 and TNF) correlated with ACE2 expression in males (TNF: r = -0.65, P < 0.0001; CCL2: r = -0.60, P < 0.0001) but not in females. TGFB1, a gene implicated in fibrosis correlated with ACE2 in both sexes.Sex is an important determinant of ACE2 expression in the tubulointerstitium of the kidney in FSGS.

To study the role of chemerin in adipocyte metabolism, we examined the function of chemerin in brown adipose tissue. Brown and white adipocyte precursors were differentiated into adipocytes in the presence of Chemerin siRNA. Chemerin-deficient (Chem−/−) mice were compared to wild-type mice when fed a high-fat diet. Chemerin is expressed during brown adipocyte differentiation and knock down of chemerin mRNA results in decreased brown adipocyte differentiation with reduced fatty acid uptake in brown adipocytes. Chem−/− mice are leaner than wild-type mice but gain more weight when challenged with high-fat diet feeding, resulting in a larger increase in fat deposition. Chem−/− mice develop insulin resistance when on a high-fat diet or due to age. Brown adipose depots in Chem−/− mice weigh more than in wild-type mice, but with decreased mitochondrial content and function. Compared to wild-type mice, male Chem−/− mice have decreased oxygen consumption, CO2 production, energy expenditure, and a lower respiratory exchange ratio. Additionally, body temperature of Chem−/− mice is lower than that of wild-type mice. These results revealed that chemerin is expressed during brown adipocyte differentiation and has a pivotal role in energy metabolism through brown adipose tissue thermogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3167531284,"The induction of nerve injury response genes in Schwann cells depends on both transcriptional and epigenomic reprogramming. The nerve injury response program is regulated by the repressive histone mark H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), deposited by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Loss of PRC2 function leads to early and augmented induction of the injury response gene network in peripheral nerves, suggesting H3K27 demethylases are required for derepression of Polycomb-regulated nerve injury genes. To determine the function of H3K27 demethylases in nerve injury, we generated Schwann cell–specific knockouts of H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b and double knockouts of Kdm6b/Kdm6a (encoding JMJD3 and UTX). We found that H3K27 demethylases are largely dispensable for Schwann cell development and myelination. In testing the function of H3K27 demethylases after injury, we found early induction of some nerve injury genes was diminished compared with control, but most injury genes were largely unaffected at 1 and 7 days post injury. Although it was proposed that H3K27 demethylases are required to activate expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a in response to injury, Schwann cell–specific deletion of H3K27 demethylases affected neither the expression of this gene nor Schwann cell proliferation after nerve injury. To further characterize the regulation of nerve injury response genes, we found that injury genes are associated with repressive histone H2AK119 ubiquitination catalyzed by PRC1, which declines after injury.

Mirsky R. Lloyd A.C. Schwann cells: Development and role in nerve repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2015; 7a020487Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The reprogramming is supported by an array of epigenetic changes converging into the overall response to simulate axon regeneration. After the nerve damage, substantial reshaping of the transcriptome occurs through dramatic changes in transcription factors as well as dynamic changes in acetylation and methylation of histones in Schwann cells (10Ma K.H.

For instance, glial derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) is one of the PRC2-regulated genes important for nerve regeneration (17Fontana X. Hristova M. Da Costa C. Patodia S. Thei L. Makwana M. Spencer-Dene B. Latouche M. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R. Klein R. Raivich G. Behrens A. c-Jun in Schwann cells promotes axonal regeneration and motoneuron survival via paracrine signaling.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 198: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is another highly induced gene that promotes regeneration (18Hashimoto M. Ishii K. Nakamura Y.

Neurochem. 2008; 107: 918-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we found that derepression of many nerve injury genes is accompanied by H3K27 demethylation after injury (12Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Svaren J.

Canonical PRC2 is composed of core subunits including the lysine methyltransferases EZH1/2, suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), and embryonic ectoderm development (EED) (19Blackledge N.P. Rose N.R. Klose R.J. Targeting Polycomb systems to regulate gene expression: Modifications to a complex story.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Conway E. Healy E. Bracken A.P. PRC2 mediated H3K27 methylations in cellular identity and cancer.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 37: 42-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there are a number of accessory subunits that play important roles. A Schwann cell–specific Eed conditional knockout mouse model exhibited premature induction of nerve injury genes in uninjured nerves (12Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Svaren J. Epigenomic regulation of Schwann cell reprogramming in peripheral nerve injury.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 9135-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the nerve injury experiment showed that Eed cKO mice had premature and/or augmented induction of nerve injury genes after injury (13Ma K.H. Duong P. Moran J.J. Junaidi N. Svaren J. Polycomb repression regulates Schwann cell proliferation and axon regeneration after nerve injury.Glia. 2018; 66: 2487-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), demonstrating the importance of H3K27me3 in repression of the injury-related program. In line with these findings, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies indicated that the promoters and gene bodies of many nerve injury genes in Schwann cells showed loss of H3K27me3 after injury (12Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Svaren J. Epigenomic regulation of Schwann cell reprogramming in peripheral nerve injury.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 9135-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), indicating that this histone mark acts as a switch for transcriptional induction. Given that the Schwann cell responses to nerve injury are accompanied by H3K27me3 reprogramming, this provides a novel system to test the requirements for activation of PRC2 repressed gene networks that support axonal regeneration and proliferation. We hypothesized that active removal of H3K27me3 by H3K27 demethylases JMJD3/KDM6B and UTX/KDM6A is required for induction of the nerve injury network in Schwann cells after injury. JMJD3 and UTX proteins belong to the Jumonji family containing the catalytic JMJC protein demethylase domain (21Arcipowski K.M. Martinez C.A. Ntziachristos P. Histone demethylases in physiology and cancer: A tale of two enzymes, JMJD3 and UTX.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2016; 36: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These H3K27 demethylases have been shown to be required for activation of Polycomb-repressed genes in other systems, including neural progenitor cell development and T cell differentiation (22Shan Y. Zhang Y. Zhao Y. Wang T. Zhang J. Yao J. Ma N. Liang Z. Huang W. Huang K. Zhang T. Su Z. Chen Q. Zhu Y. Wu C. et al.JMJD3 and UTX determine fidelity and lineage specification of human neural progenitor cells.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 382Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Estarás C. Fueyo R.

Histone H3 lysine 27 demethylases Jmjd3 and Utx are required for T-cell differentiation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, other demethylase-independent mechanisms for derepression have been characterized (25Sawarkar R. Paro R. Interpretation of developmental signaling at chromatin: The Polycomb perspective.Dev. Cell. 2010; 19: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and PRC2 repression is linked with PRC1 repression, which involves monoubiquitination of H2A (H2AK119ub1) (19Blackledge N.P. Rose N.R. Klose R.J. Targeting Polycomb systems to regulate gene expression: Modifications to a complex story.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have also more fully characterized the repressed state of nerve injury genes by profiling H2AK119ub1 made by Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Previous studies suggested that JMJD3-mediated demethylation of H3K27 limits Schwann cell proliferation after injury by activation of the Cdkn2a gene (26Gomez-Sanchez J.A. Gomis-Coloma C. Morenilla-Palao C. Peiro G. Serra E. Serrano M. Cabedo H. Epigenetic induction of the Ink4a/Arf locus prevents Schwann cell overproliferation during nerve regeneration and after tumorigenic challenge.Brain. 2013; 136: 2262-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cdkn2a encodes both INK4A/p16, which is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and tumor suppressor, and p19/ARF, an important regulator of p53 activation. Consistent with this model, the Schwann cell–specific knockout of Eed led to persistent Cdkn2a expression and a failure of Schwann cells to proliferate after injury (13Ma K.H. Duong P. Moran J.J. Junaidi N. Svaren J. Polycomb repression regulates Schwann cell proliferation and axon regeneration after nerve injury.Glia. 2018; 66: 2487-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Of interest, studies showed that neurofibromas caused by NF1 mutation most often transition to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor through the co-mutation of PRC2 subunit genes and CDKN2A (27Sohier P. Luscan A. Lloyd A. Ashelford K. Laurendeau I. Briand-Suleau A. Vidaud D. Ortonne N. Pasmant E. Upadhyaya M.

Legius E. et al.PRC2 loss amplifies Ras-driven transcription and confers sensitivity to BRD4-based therapies.Nature. 2014; 514: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that Jmjd3/Kdm6b and Utx/Kdm6a are required to activate Cdkn2a (p16 and p19) and other injury genes after injury. To test the involvement of H3K27 demethylases in activation of the Schwann cell injury program, we made a conditional deletion of Jmjd3/Kdm6b specifically in Schwann cells using the Mpz-cre driver (30Feltri M.L. D'Antonio M. Previtali S. Fasolini M. Messing A. Wrabetz L. P0-Cre transgenic mice for inactivation of adhesion molecules in Schwann cells.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 883: 116-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conditional allele (Jmjd3 f/f) has exons 14 to 20 of the Jmjd3 gene flanked by loxP sites (31Iwamori N. Iwamori T. Matzuk M.M. H3K27 demethylase, JMJD3, regulates fragmentation of spermatogonial cysts.PLoS One. 2013; 8e72689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This would result in deletion of the catalytic Jumonji domain, at E13.5 to 14.5 stage in Schwann cells, causing a frameshift in the C terminus of the protein. We validated the knockout of Jmjd3 gene using quantitative RT-PCR with primers located within the deleted exons. The results showed ~76% loss in Jmjd3 expression in mutant intact nerves compared with control intact nerves (Fig. 1C), which corresponds to the proportion of Schwann cells in peripheral nerve (12Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Svaren J. Epigenomic regulation of Schwann cell reprogramming in peripheral nerve injury.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 9135-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In order to test for potential redundancy in H3K27 demethylation, we also knocked out the other major H3K27 demethylase, Utx/Kdm6a, which is also expressed in RNA-Seq profiles of peripheral nerve (13Ma K.H.

Utx is an X-linked gene composed of 29 exons (34Miller S.A. Mohn S.E. Weinmann A.S. Jmjd3 and UTX play a demethylase-independent role in chromatin remodeling to regulate T-box family member-dependent gene expression.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 594-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and the conditional allele contains loxP sites surrounding exon 24 coding for the catalytic domain of Utx (35Wang C. Lee J.E. Cho Y.W. Xiao Y. Jin Q. Liu C. Ge K. UTX regulates mesoderm differentiation of embryonic stem cells independent of H3K27 demethylase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: 15324-15329Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). After breeding this allele to the Mpz-cre driver line, we found a similar loss of ~70% of Utx expression in peripheral nerve from single and double knockouts (Fig. 1C). As seen in previous studies using Mpz-cre (14Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Srinivasan R. Xie H. Orkin S.H. Svaren J. Regulation of peripheral nerve myelin maintenance by gene repression through Polycomb repressive complex 2.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8640-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the residual Jmjd3 and Utx expression is likely due to the presence of non-Schwann cell types in peripheral nerve. Before testing the involvement of Jmjd3 and Utx in nerve injury, we evaluated whether deletion of Jmjd3 and Utx affects Schwann cell development. In our previous analysis of the Eed knockout, peripheral nerve development was relatively normal up to 2 months of age, with development of hypermyelination and Remak bundle fragmentation at later time points (14Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Srinivasan R. Xie H. Orkin S.H. Svaren J. Regulation of peripheral nerve myelin maintenance by gene repression through Polycomb repressive complex 2.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8640-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, in the Jmjd3/Utx conditional knockouts, there are no obvious behavioral phenotypes typically found in peripheral neuropathy such as hindlimb clasping even up to 7 months of age, and visual inspection showed the normal opaque appearance of myelinated nerve. Despite the apparent lack of such behavioral phenotype, we examined nerve ultrastructure by performing electron microscopy analysis of sciatic nerve in the Schwann cell–specific double knockout of Jmjd3 and Utx. The electron microscopy images of mature myelin in sciatic nerves of ~2-month-old mutant mice showed a normal distribution of axon diameters and myelin sheaths compared with controls (Fig. 2A). Myelin thickness was measured using the g-ratio, which is axon diameter divided by outer diameter of myelin sheath, which is plotted against the axon diameter. The linear regressions of both distribution plots for both control and mutant mice are virtually aligned, indicating no significant difference in myelin thickness compared with control (Fig. 2B). The number of myelinated fibers is also comparable in both genotypes. Our previous analysis of the Eed knockout identified progressive defects in hypermyelination and Remak bundle integrity at later time points (14Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Srinivasan R. Xie H. Orkin S.H. Svaren J. Regulation of peripheral nerve myelin maintenance by gene repression through Polycomb repressive complex 2.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8640-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also harvested the sciatic nerves of 7-month-old double knockout mice and processed for electron microscopy imaging. The morphology is similar between mutant and control genotypes as no deformities were observed in the mutant nerve (Fig. 2A). Abnormalities like myelin outfolding and development of tomacula caused by excess myelin membranes were observed in the Eed knockout (14Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Srinivasan R. Xie H. Orkin S.H. Svaren J. Regulation of peripheral nerve myelin maintenance by gene repression through Polycomb repressive complex 2.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8640-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, no myelin pathology is seen in Schwann cell–specific knockout of the two H3K27 demethylases. Although we had observed some difference in Remak bundles in Eed cKO mice (14Ma K.H. Hung H.A. Srinivasan R. Xie H. Orkin S.H. Svaren J. Regulation of peripheral nerve myelin maintenance by gene repression through Polycomb repressive complex 2.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8640-8652Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), they appear to be intact in mutants, similar to those of controls and no major deformity is consistently observed in the double knockout nerves. Therefore, H3K27 demethylase activity is not required for myelin development or maintenance. It had been reported that JMJD3 is induced after injury (26Gomez-Sanchez J.A. Gomis-Coloma C. Morenilla-Palao C. Peiro G. Serra E. Serrano M. Cabedo H. Epigenetic induction of the Ink4a/Arf locus prevents Schwann cell overproliferation during nerve regeneration and after tumorigenic challenge.Brain. 2013; 136: 2262-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which was proposed to regulate Schwann cell proliferation after injury by removing H3K27 methylation from the Cdkn2a gene that encodes both p16 and p19 tumor suppressor proteins. However, examination of nerve injury RNA-Seq datasets did not show that Jmjd3 is induced at the transcript level (13Ma K.H. Duong P. Moran J.J. Junaidi N. Svaren J. Polycomb repression regulates Schwann cell proliferation and axon regeneration after nerve injury.Glia. 2018; 66: 2487-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Clements M.P. Byrne E.

The wound microenvironment reprograms Schwann cells to invasive mesenchymal-like cells to drive peripheral nerve regeneration.Neuron. 2017; 96: 98-114.e117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although there could be posttranscriptional induction of JMJD3, we found that JMJD3 protein is expressed even before injury in Schwann cells in contrast to the earlier findings (Fig. 3A). We tested the specificity of our antibody using siRNA for Jmjd3 in the cultured S16 cells (Fig. S1). In addition, the protein level of JMJD3 did not appear to significantly increase after nerve injury, as measured by the immunofluorescence and Western blot. Nonetheless, JMJD3 could regulate nerve injury gene induction at 1 day post injury (dpi) even in the absence of induced protein levels. The normal induction of Cdkn2a (p16 and p19 transcripts) occurs at 3 to 7 days after injury, and earlier data suggested that JMJD3 would be required for this induction (26Gomez-Sanchez J.A. Gomis-Coloma C. Morenilla-Palao C. Peiro G. Serra E. Serrano M. Cabedo H. Epigenetic induction of the Ink4a/Arf locus prevents Schwann cell overproliferation during nerve regeneration and after tumorigenic challenge.Brain. 2013; 136: 2262-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In partial support of this model, we had previously investigated the effect of H3K27me3 depletion in Schwann cell–specific Eed-cKO mice and found constitutively high Cdkn2a transcript expression (p19 and p16) along with reduced proliferation of Schwann cells after injury (13Ma K.H. Duong P. Moran J.J. Junaidi N. Svaren J. Polycomb repression regulates Schwann cell proliferation and axon regeneration after nerve injury.Glia. 2018; 66: 2487-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, this model would predict that loss of H3K27 demethylases in Schwann cells would result in increased proliferation owing to the inability to derepress Cdkn2a after injury. To test if Jmjd3 is required for Cdkn2a induction and regulation of cell proliferation after peripheral nerve injury, we performed immunofluorescence for p19 and Ki67 at 4 days after nerve crush. We quantitated the number of cells positive for p19 and Ki67 along with Schwann cell marker SOX10. In the Jmjd3/Utx double knockout, we found that there was no difference from control at the 4-dpi time point for both p19 induction and proliferation (Fig. 3, B and C). Since proliferation normally subsides by 14 days after injury, it is possible that the proliferation"

These recurrence plot methods: 1. identify short-term transient interactions; 2. identify long-lasting delayed interactions that are common in complex systems; 3. work with non-stationary blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data; 4. may study the relationship of centers with non-linear functional interactions; 5 may compare different experimental groups performing different tasks. These methods were applied to BOLD time-series obtained in 20 control subjects and 20 Parkinson´s patients during the execution of motor activity and body posture tasks (task-block design). The binary recurrence plot showed the task-block BOLD response normally observed in the primary motor cortex with functional magnetic resonance imaging methods, but also shorter and longer BOLD-fluctuations than the task-block and which provided information about the long-term dynamic of this center. The binary cross recurrence plot showed short-lasting and long-lasting functional interactions between the primary motor cortex and the primary somatosensory cortex, anterior motor thalamus and precuneous nucleus, interactions which changed with the resting and motor tasks. Most of the interactions found in healthy controls were disrupted in Parkinson's patients, and may be at the basis of some of the motor disorders and side-effects of dopaminergic drugs commonly observed in these patients."

Geiger O. Bacterial membrane lipids: Diversity in structures and pathways.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2016; 40: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Bacteria/Eukarya produce membrane lipids with hydrophobic fatty acid tails that are ester-bound to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), whereas Archaea synthesize membrane lipids with hydrophobic isoprenoid lipid tails that are ether-linked to glycerol-1-phosphate (G1P) with the opposite chirality. This stereochemical difference between Bacteria/Eukarya and Archaea is called the “lipid divide,” and at present, we do not have a good understanding of why this difference evolved (2Jain S. Caforio A. Fodran P. Lolkema J.S. Minnaard A.J. Driessen A.J.M. Identification of CDP-archaeol synthase, a missing link of ether lipid biosynthesis in Archaea.Chem. Biol. 2014; 21: 1392-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The structures of many bacterial and eukaryotic membrane lipids and the enzymes involved in their synthesis have been investigated mainly using Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3Raetz C.R. Dowhan W. Biosynthesis and function of phospholipids in Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1235-1238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Klug L. Daum G. Yeast lipid metabolism at a glance.FEMS Yeast Res. 2014; 14: 369-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Only in recent years have these aspects been studied in a wider variety of Bacteria/Eukarya model organisms. On the other hand, very little is known about the enzymes involved in membrane lipid synthesis in Archaea. Cardiolipin (CL) is an anionic membrane lipid almost ubiquitous in bacteria and throughout the eukaryotic kingdoms. Distinct from other phospholipids, it has four hydrophobic side chains and two phosphate groups. CL is present in energy-transducing membranes (for example, bacterial cytoplasmic membranes, mitochondrial inner membranes, and hydrogenosome membranes) in bacteria, plants, and animals and also as glycerol-di-archaetidyl-cardiolipin in archaea, most notably in halophiles (5Schlame M.

A promiscuous archaeal cardiolipin synthase enables construction of diverse natural and unnatural phospholipids.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In halophilic archaea, glycosyl-mono-archaetidyl-CL has been detected, but its function and synthesis are not known (7Corcelli A. The cardiolipin analogues of Archaea.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1788: 2101-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin synthases (Cls) have been identified in bacteria and eukaryotes, and they belong to the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily or to the CDP-alcohol phosphotransferase superfamily. Most Cls enzymes belonging to the PLD superfamily catalyze a reversible phosphatidyl group transfer from one phosphatidylglycerol (PG) molecule to another PG to form CL and glycerol. In contrast, Cls belonging to the CDP-alcohol phosphatidyltransferase superfamily use cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) as the donor of the phosphatidyl group, which is transferred to a molecule of PG to form CL (1Sohlenkamp C. Geiger O. Bacterial membrane lipids: Diversity in structures and pathways.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2016; 40: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In contrast to Eukaryotes and bacteria, the enzymes responsible for CL synthesis have not been previously identified in archaea (2Jain S. Caforio A. Fodran P. Lolkema J.S. Minnaard A.J. Driessen A.J.M. Identification of CDP-archaeol synthase, a missing link of ether lipid biosynthesis in Archaea.Chem. Biol. 2014; 21: 1392-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, Exterkate et al. (6Exterkate M. de Kok N.A.W. Andringa R.L.H. Wolbert N.H.J. Minnaard A.J. Driessen A.J.M. A promiscuous archaeal cardiolipin synthase enables construction of diverse natural and unnatural phospholipids.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) identified and characterized a cardiolipin synthase from the methanogen archaeon Methanospirillum hungatei (MhCls). The authors set out to identify candidate genes encoding putative Cls enzymes in archaea homologous to bacterial sequences. Homologs belonging to the PLD superfamily of Cls were found in halophilic and methanogenic archaea belonging to the phylum Euryarchaeota. The putative Cls from M. hungatei (MhCls) was selected for further study, because it was the only candidate present in this organism and because M. hungatei does not require extremophile growth conditions. The gene encoding MhCls was synthesized and recombinantly expressed in E. coli. In the absence of commercially available archaeal chiral substrate archaetidylglycerol (AG), both diastereomers were chemically synthesized and were found to be utilized by MhCls in vitro. Expression of MhCls in an E. coli Cls-null strain also led to CL formation. Based on this finding, further in vitro experiments using the bacterial substrates for CL synthesis were performed. One of the surprising findings of their study was that MhCls is not only able to use two molecules of AG to form glycerol-di-archaetidyl-cardiolipin (as expected), but also was able to use two molecules of PG to form CL, just like bacterial Cls. In the presence of both AG and PG, bacterial–archaeal hybrid species could even be formed. When testing MhCls activity in the presence of PG and AG, surprisingly in addition to CL and glycerol-di-archaetidyl-CL, similar amounts of a hybrid glycerol-archaetidyl-phosphatidyl-CL were formed, indicating that there is no clear preference between the two lipid substrates and that substrate recognition only involves the polar headgroup of AG and PG. Indeed, in the reverse reaction using CL as a substrate, either water or glycerol could serve as the second substrate within the cell, leading to synthesis of both AG and PG, respectively. Finally, the authors used a number of other substrates to demonstrate the promiscuity of MhCls for various headgroups. In vitro, MhCls could utilize other substrates in the reverse reaction, including primary alcohols, a two-carbon-diol, the six-carbon polyol mannitol, or 1,3- propanediol with bulky methyl groups in the 2 position, leading to the formation of PG and respective phosphatidylalcohols. Even phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine could be synthesized by the MhCls reverse reaction in the presence of choline and serine. Finally, although inefficiently, glycosyl-mono-archaetidyl-CL could be formed by MhCls from PG and monogalactosyl diacylglycerol, indicating that MhCls could form this naturally occurring lipid in archaea. The study by Exterkate et al. opens new and exciting directions for lipid research. Having identified the gene encoding a glycerol-di-archaetidyl-CL synthase in archaea should allow for the possibility to create mutants deficient in this gene to study the function of this lipid (and possibly other CL-related lipids) in archaea under different growth conditions. However, these types of studies are not easy to perform, because many archaea are extremophiles, and therefore not easy to culture. Additionally, molecular biology techniques will have to be developed to construct these mutants. Studies structurally comparing MhCls with other Cls of the PLD family could reveal why MhCls accepts bacterial and archaeal substrates. There is even a question as to whether well-studied Cls enzymes such as ClsA from E. coli would accept AG as a substrate. It is fascinating that one enzyme can synthesize both bacterial and archaeal lipids, indicating that the lipid divide might be less strict than previously thought. In this same direction, it was recently discovered that some bacteria encode a putative archaeal pathway for ether-bound isoprenoid membrane lipids in addition to the bacterial fatty acid membrane pathway. Recombinant expression of these enzymes in E. coli resulted in the formation of a “mixed archaeal/bacterial membrane” (8Villanueva L. von Meijenfeldt F.A.B. Westbye A.B. Yadav S. Hopmans E.C. Dutilh B.E. Damste J.S.S. Bridging the membrane lipid divide: Bacteria of the FCB group superphylum have the potential to synthesize archaeal ether lipids.ISME J. 2021; 15: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the presence of the appropriate substrates, MhCls can synthesize a surprising and impressive diversity of amphiphilic lipids. This promiscuity of MhCls could be further explored for bioengineering processes and could have applications in synthetic biology. New amphiphilic lipids with interesting and useful properties could be synthesized and characterized for various applications, such as the construction of synthetic membranes with engineered properties, taking advantage of the possibility to incorporate isoprene or fatty acid hydrophobic chains, and a plethora of functional headgroups.

Furthermore, its hyperactivity is considered responsible for some neurological defects in individuals with Down syndrome. We set out to establish a zebrafish model expressing human Dyrk1A that could be further used to characterize the interaction between Dyrk1A and neurological phenotypes. First, we revealed the prominent expression of <i>dyrk1a</i> homologs in cerebellar neurons in the zebrafish larval and adult brains. Overexpression of human <i>dyrk1a</i> in postmitotic cerebellar Purkinje neurons resulted in a structural misorganization of the Purkinje cells in cerebellar hemispheres and a compaction of this cell population. This impaired Purkinje cell organization was progressive, leading to an age-dependent dispersal of Purkinje neurons throughout the cerebellar molecular layer with larval swim deficits resulting in miscoordination of swimming and reduced exploratory behavior in aged adults. We also found that the structural misorganization of the larval Purkinje cell layer could be rescued by pharmacological treatment with Dyrk1A inhibitors. We further reveal the <i>in vivo</i> efficiency of a novel selective Dyrk1A inhibitor, KuFal194. These findings demonstrate that the zebrafish is a well-suited vertebrate organism to genetically model severe neurological diseases with single cell type specificity. Such models can be used to relate molecular malfunction to cellular deficits, impaired tissue formation, and organismal behavior and can also be used for pharmacological compound testing and validation."
https://openalex.org/W3172598249,"Background Little is known about the treatment burden experienced by patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) who use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Participants 18 patients (33.3% males, mean age 59.7±11.8 years) with OSA who use CPAP therapy were interviewed. Methods Patients treated with CPAP for OSA at a tertiary hospital outpatient clinic in Sydney, Australia, were invited to participate in an interview in person or via phone. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore the treatment burden associated with using CPAP. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using NVivo 12 qualitative analysis software. Results Four categories of OSA-specific treatment burden were identified: healthcare tasks, consequences of healthcare tasks, exacerbating and alleviating factors of treatment burden. Participants reported a significant burden associated with using CPAP, independently of how frequently they used their device. Common sources of their treatment burden included attending healthcare appointments, the financial cost of treatment, lifestyle changes, treatment-related side effects and general discomfort. Conclusions This study demonstrated that there is a significant treatment burden associated with the use of CPAP, and that treatment non-adherence is not the only consequence of treatment burden. Other consequences include relationship burden, stigma and financial burden. It is important for physicians to identify other negative impacts of treatment burden in order to optimise the patient experience."

Combining the group-based experience of microfinance and group medical visits is a novel approach to NCD care delivery. However, the contextual factors, facilitators, and barriers impacting wide-scale implementation of these approaches within a low- and middle-income country setting are not well known.Two types of qualitative group discussion were conducted: 1) mabaraza (singular, baraza), a traditional East African community gathering used to discuss and exchange information in large group settings; and 2) focus group discussions (FGDs) among rural clinicians, community health workers, microfinance group members, and patients with NCDs. Trained research staff members led the discussions using structured question guides. Content analysis was performed with NVivo using deductive and inductive codes that were then grouped into themes.We conducted 5 mabaraza and 16 FGDs. A total of 205 individuals (113 men and 92 women) participated in the mabaraza, while 162 individuals (57 men and 105 women) participated in the FGDs. In the context of poverty and previous experiences with the health system, participants described challenges to NCD care across three themes: 1) stigma of chronic disease, 2) earned skepticism of the health system, and 3) socio-economic fragility. However, they also outlined windows of opportunity and facilitators of group medical visits and microfinance to address those challenges.Our qualitative study revealed actionable factors that could impact the success of implementation of group medical visits and microfinance initiatives for NCD care. While several challenges were highlighted, participants also described opportunities to address and mitigate the impact of these factors. We anticipate that our approach and analysis provides new insights and methodological techniques that will be relevant to other low-resource settings worldwide."

The effects caused by nutrient omission in the plant nutritional efficiency in relation to the absorption and use of the missing nutrient, and the reasons why these damages reflect in other nutrients have not yet been reported in the culture of scarlet eggplant. A better understanding of the nutritional mechanisms involved may clarify why certain nutrients cause greater limitations than other during plants growth. Thus, this study was designed with the aim of evaluating the damages caused by macronutrients deficiency in the culture of scarlet eggplant in the accumulation of these nutrients, nutritional deficiency, plants growth and in visual symptoms. The experiment was carried out in a controlled environment where plants were cultivated in a hydroponic system. Treatments consisted of supplying a complete Hoagland and Arnon solution (CS), and other nutrient solutions with individual omissions of nitrogen (-N), phosphorus (-P), potassium (-K), calcium (-Ca), magnesium (-Mg) and sulphur (-S). When a nutrient deficiency arose, nutritional analyses, growth and visual symptoms were analyzed. The omissions of N, S and K in the nutrient solution resulted in lower accumulation of all macronutrients in both the above and below ground biomass. Individual omissions resulted in nutritional imbalances with reflexes in the absorption efficiencies and use of the missing nutrient, as well as of other nutrients, revealing that the metabolism involves multiple nutritional interactions. Losses of nutritional efficiencies of macronutrients caused detrimental effects on plants growth, with reduced height, stem diameter, number of leaves, leaf area, and biomass production in above ground and below ground. From the losses in production in above ground biomass, the order of macronutrients limitation was N, S, K, Ca, Mg, and P, with reductions of 99, 96, 94, 76, 51 and 46%, respectively, in comparison to plants cultivated in CS. The most limiting nutrients were N, S, and K, seen that its deficiencies affected the metabolism of all other nutrients. This study demonstrates the importance of an adequate nutritional management of N, S, and K in the cultivation of scarlet eggplant."

Ten-year risk predictions of a fatal/non-fatal cardiovascular event (CVE) in 2007 were calculated using WHO/ISH (SEAR-B) charts with and without cholesterol. The CVEs that occurred from 2007-2017 were ascertained. Risk predictions in 2007 were validated against observed CVEs in 2017.Of 2517 participants, the mean age was 53.7 year (SD: 6.7) and 1132 (45%) were males. Using WHO/ISH chart with cholesterol, the percentages of subjects with a 10-year CV risk <10%, 10-19%, 20%-29%, 30-39%, ≥40% were 80.7%, 9.9%, 3.8%, 2.5% and 3.1%, respectively. 142 non-fatal and 73 fatal CVEs were observed during follow-up. Among the cohort, 9.4% were predicted of having a CV risk ≥20% and 8.6% CVEs were observed in the risk category. CVEs were within the predictions of WHO/ISH charts with and without cholesterol in both high (≥20%) and low(<20%) risk males, but only in low(<20%) risk females. The predictions of WHO/ISH charts, with-and without-cholesterol were in agreement in 81% of subjects (ĸ = 0.429; p<0.001).WHO/ISH (SEAR B) risk prediction charts with-and without-cholesterol may be used in Sri Lanka. Risk charts are more predictive in males than in females and for lower-risk categories. The predictions when stratifying into 2 categories, low risk (<20%) and high risk (≥20%), are more appropriate in clinical practice."

Arg124 of the FAS1-1 domain and Arg555 of the FAS1-4 domain have been classified as mutational hot spots owing to the frequency of individual pathogenic mutations observed in patients at these sites. It is unclear how mutations at opposite ends of TGFBIp cause similar phenotypic outcomes, as seen for both LCD and GCD, although hypotheses involving several molecular pathways have been proposed (1Nielsen N.S.

A small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) study found that TGFBIp is a monomer at low concentrations but is prone to form dimers and trimers at high concentrations (11 μM). More dilute TGFBIp purified from human and porcine corneas was shown to be monomeric when analyzed by calibrated size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (17Basaiawmoit R.V. Oliveira C.L. Runager K.

However, the oligomeric state of TGFBIp within the cornea is unknown, as are the potential effects of pathogenic mutations on TGFBIp multimerization. It has been suggested that mutations associated with LCD lead to a structural destabilization of TGFBIp. This is reflected by an altered proteolytic turnover of TGFBIp in LCD (19Korvatska E. Henry H. Mashima Y. Yamada M. Bachmann C. Munier F.L. Schorderet D.F. Amyloid and non-amyloid forms of 5q31-linked corneal dystrophy resulting from kerato-epithelin mutations at Arg-124 are associated with abnormal turnover of the protein.J. Biol.

On the other hand, GCD-associated mutations decrease TGFBIp’s solubility and affect its interactions with corneal stroma components (1Nielsen N.S. Poulsen E.T. Lukassen M.V. Chao Shern C.

Poulsen E.T. Kennedy S. Moore J.E. Atkinson S.D. Maurizi E. Nesbit M.A. Moore C.B. Enghild J.J.

Composition and proteolytic processing of corneal deposits associated with mutations in the TGFBI gene.Exp. Eye Res. 2012; 96: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we used limited proteolysis to evaluate the stability of wildtype TGFBIp and eight mutants. GCD-associated mutants were cleaved similarly to wildtype TGFBIp, whereas all but one of the LCD-associated mutants were more susceptible to proteolysis. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structures of the three TGFBIp variants R124H (GCD2), R555W (GCD1), and A546T (LCD). None of the three mutations had significant effects on either the overall conformation of TGFBIp or fold of the FAS1-1 and FA1-4 domains. However, residues 540 to 575 have higher average B-factors in the crystal structure of A546T, suggesting increased flexibility of these residues. In addition, a crystal packing interface present in the structures of both R124H and R555W that involves residue 124 in one molecule and 555 in another molecule may represent an intermolecular interaction that contributes to the aggregation of these mutants in GCD. This crystal packing interface explains why the R124H and R555W mutations, positioned at opposite ends of TGFBIp, lead to similar early-onset formation of amorphous aggregates of TGFBIp. Altogether, the present study shows that altered proteolytic processing and intermolecular interactions are likely to underlie the pathogenic mechanisms of LCD- and GCD-associated TGFBI mutations, respectively, rather than any major structural rearrangement of TGFBIp. We recombinantly expressed and purified wildtype TGFBIp (residues 45–632) and eight mutants without the N- and C-terminal regions for crystallization screening. The eight TGFBIp mutants included R124C and R124H located in the FAS1-1 domain of TGFBIp, P501T found in the linker region between the FAS1-3 and FAS1-4 domain, and A546D, A546T, R555W, V624M, and H626R situated in the FAS1-4 domain (Fig. 1A). Two of the mutants, R124H and R555W, are associated with GCD2 and GCD1, respectively, whereas the rest of the mutants are linked to different LCD types (21Kannabiran C. Klintworth G.K. TGFBI gene mutations in corneal dystrophies.Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Prior studies revealed differences in the proteolytic stability of TGFBIp mutants depending on their CD phenotype, where LCD mutants (except R124C) were less stable than wildtype TGFBIp and GCD mutants were as stable as or more stable than wildtype TGFBIp (13Nielsen N.S.

To determine whether the truncated TGFBIp constructs used in this study showed the same correlation, wildtype TGFBIp and mutants were subjected to a titration series of two proteases with nonoverlapping substrate preferences, trypsin (Fig. 1B) and chymotrypsin (Fig. S1), and the extent of cleavage was evaluated by reducing SDS-PAGE. The mutants associated with GCD were as resistant to proteolysis as wildtype TGFBIp. On the other hand, five of the six LCD-linked mutants were more susceptible to proteolysis than wildtype TGFBIp, most likely due to a destabilization of the FAS1-4 domain, as demonstrated previously (13Nielsen N.S.

The only exception is the LCD-associated mutant R124C, which seemed as resistant as wildtype TGFBIp to proteolysis. Arg124 is surface exposed in the wildtype structure and located in the compact N-terminal half of TGFBIp (16García-Castellanos R. Nielsen N.S. Runager K. Thøgersen I.B. Lukassen M.V. Poulsen E.T. Goulas T. Enghild J.J. Gomis-Rüth F.X.

Edman degradation of the major initial cleavage products of wildtype and P501T TGFBIp demonstrated an intact N terminus (i.e., with the sequence: GPNVCAVQKVI), suggesting they are initially cleaved at sites located toward the C terminus of TGFBIp (Fig. 1B). The localization of Arg124 in the three-dimensional structure as well as trypsin’s preferential cleavage in the C terminus of TGFBIp might explain why the R124C mutation does not seem to change the proteolytic stability of TGFBIp. To investigate whether structural changes might explain the aggregation of TGFBIp mutants, we pursued structure determination of the eight TGFBIp mutants by X-ray crystallography. However, only the structures of the TGFBIp mutants R124H, A546T, and R555W could be determined (Table 1). The structures of R124H and R555W were determined at a resolution of 2.7 Å and 2.0 Å, respectively, and therefore accurately revealed details in changes around the mutated residues. As a lower resolution of 4.8 Å was obtained for the A546T mutant, structural differences between this mutant and wildtype TGFBIp may not be significant.Table 1Data collection and refinement statistics prepared with phenix.table_oneStructureR124HA546TR555WPDB entry code7AS77ASC7ASFResolution range45.85–2.65 (2.745–2.65)60.94–4.801 (4.973–4.801)49.24–2.0 (2.071–2.0)Space groupC 2 2 21P 41 21 2C 2 2 21Unit cell77.37 93.87 214.02 90 90 90206.76 206.76 127.54 90 90 9078.06 98.49 207.84 90 90 90Unique reflections23,038 (2262)14,000 (1376)54,442 (5356)Multiplicity6.9 (7.1)13.0 (14.1)10.4 (10.5)Completeness (%)99.77 (99.60)99.69 (100.00)99.82 (99.61)Mean I/σ(I)7.71 (0.88)11.10 (0.83)8.38 (0.79)R-merge0.2056 (2.021)0.1385 (2.901)0.1883 (2.57)CC1/20.996 (0.365)0.999 (0.388)0.998 (0.531)Reflections used in refinement23,008 (2254)13,979 (1376)54,362 (5338)Reflections used for R-free1998 (196)1400 (138)1998 (197)R-work0.2402 (0.4111)0.2546 (0.3737)0.2059 (0.4583)R-free0.2867 (0.4333)0.2685 (0.3721)0.2470 (0.4790)Protein residues5841176592RMS bonds (Å)0.0090.0070.016RMS angles (°)1.261.411.47Ramachandran favored, allowed, outliers (%)95.595.796.63.63.53.40.90.80.0Clash score2.562.092.08Statistics for the highest-resolution shell are shown in parentheses.

The unit cell parameters of R124H and the R555W are highly related, reflecting very similar crystal packing in these structures with one TGFBIp molecule in the asymmetric unit. In contrast, the asymmetric unit of the A546T structure contains two molecules, and the unit cell parameters are not related to those of the two other mutants or the unit cell for the wildtype structure. The overall conformations of the three TGFBIp mutants are close to one of the two conformations present in the crystal structure of wildtype TGFBIp (16García-Castellanos R. Nielsen N.S. Runager K. Thøgersen I.B. Lukassen M.V. Poulsen E.T. Goulas T. Enghild J.J. Gomis-Rüth F.X.

The root-mean-square deviations between the three mutant structures and this wildtype conformation (chain B in Protein Data Bank [PDB] entry 5NV6) is 1.0 to 1.6 Å for 577 Cα atoms (Fig. 2A). In summary, none of the three mutations appears to have significant, crystal packing-independent effects on either the overall conformation of TGFBIp or the fold of the FAS1-1 and FAS1-4 domains harboring the three studied mutations. Mutations of Arg124 in FAS1-1 and Arg555 in FAS1-4 are the most frequent pathogenic mutations (22Lakshminarayanan R. Chaurasia S.S. Anandalakshmi V. Chai S.M. Murugan E. Vithana E.N. Beuerman R.W. Mehta J.S. Clinical and genetic aspects of the TGFBI-associated corneal dystrophies.Ocul. Surf. 2014; 12: 234-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A striking feature found in both the R124H and R555W structures and involving their mutated residues is a crystal packing interface between the FAS1-1 and FAS1-4 domains of different TGFBIp molecules, where residue 124 interacts with residue 555 in a second TGFBIp molecule (i.e., His124 and Arg555 in R124H, Arg124 and Trp555 in R555W). The dimensions of the resulting dimer are 226 × 73 × 62 Å as compared with average dimensions of 125 × 68 × 41 Å for the monomer structures, due to the head-to-tail arrangement of the banana-shaped TGFBIp monomers (Fig. 2B). In the crystal packing, an infinite arrangement of R124H or R555W monomers resulted in linear chains of monomers running parallel to a crystallographic 21 axis, in which neighboring mutant TGFBIp molecules are related by a 180° rotation and a translation of 107 or 104 Å along the symmetry axis. Such linear monomer chains form antiparallel layers in both the horizontal and the vertical direction (Fig. 2C). Interface analysis with PISA (23Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6103) Google Scholar) showed that the buried surface in the intermolecular FAS1-1:FAS1-4 interface described above is 574 Å2 in R124H and 808 Å2 in R555W and is not present in either the A546T or the wildtype structures. The FAS1-1:FAS1-4 interface in the R555W structure is significantly more hydrophobic than in the R124H structure, with a ΔiG p-value of 0.11 and 0.40, respectively. This R555W FAS1-1:FAS1-4 interface is also by far the most hydrophobic in all the four TGFBIp crystal structures determined to date and has a calculated ΔiG of −9 kcal/mol, which is also the most favorable value of all the intermolecular contacts present in these structures. Of note, the three structures of R124H, A546T, and R555W share another larger (>1500 Å2) crystal packing interface, but this interface is quite polar, is split into two patches, and does not involve residue 124 or 555. Furthermore, the largest intermolecular interfaces in the original wildtype structure are not present in our structures of mutant TGFBIp. A comparison of all available structures reveals that the R124H mutation has no influence on the structure for the FAS1-1 domain (Fig. S2A), whereas in both the R124H and the R555W structures, the α-helix harboring residue 555 is shifted relative to the position of the helix in the wildtype structure (Fig. S2B). Since both wildtype and R124H structures have an arginine residue at position 555, the shift of the α-helix is not due to the R555W mutation. Instead, the position of the α-helix is likely to be determined by the intermolecular contact with the FAS1-1 domain. For both R124H and R555W, the electron density around the mutated side chain is well defined (Fig. 2, D and E). This allows an unambiguous modeling of how the mutated side chain interacts with its surroundings, including the neighboring monomer and water molecules. In the R124H structure, the FAS1-1 His124 is in direct contact with Arg555 through a side-chain hydrogen bond (Fig. 2F). His124 also engages in a second water-bridged interaction with the main chain of Met517. The side chain of Tyr121 also forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain of Leu559 in the second TGFBIp molecule. In addition, multiple hydrophobic interactions invol"

However, the diagnosis of small size melanoma might be particularly difficult, not only clinically but also dermoscopically. This study aimed to define clinical and dermatoscopic parameters in the diagnosis of suspicious pigmented cutaneous lesions with a diameter of ≤ 6mm and determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values as well as the accuracy of each clinical and dermatoscopic criterion. This is a transversal, descriptive and analytical study of dermatoscopic analysis with the gold standard being the pathologic examination obtained from the excisional biopsy of suspicious melanocytic lesions with a diameter of ≤ 6mm. Trunk and limb lesion data from a public health service and a private clinic were prospectively collected from 2011 to 2017 by a unique observer. In total, 481 melanocytic lesions were included, with 73.8% being ≤ 4mm in diameter. Overall, 123 were diagnosed as melanoma, 56.0% in situ and 22.0% as thin melanomas (Breslow index 0.1 to 1.0mm). Melanoma presented symmetry in 53.7% of cases, regular borders in 54.5% and a single color in 60.2%. Regarding evolution, 13.8% of melanomas versus 10.9% of benign lesions (p = 0.116) were new by comparing photos from baseline with photos from the follow-up. The majority of melanomas (65%) were found on the limbs compared to 37.2% of the benign lesions at this location (p<0.001). A multiple logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender and location was created. The independent variables associated with the diagnosis of melanoma ≤ 6mm, adjusted for age, gender and location, were: streaks (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 2.5; 95% CI 1.3-4.7; p = 0.006), and the presence of a structureless area (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.0, p = 0.011). Conversely, a symmetric typical pigment network was a protection variable (aOR 0.4, 95% 0.7-0.9, p = 0.040). In conclusion, dermatoscopic criteria have been identified which help to diagnose cases of small size melanoma. These include streaks and structureless areas that can be taken, particularly in consideration for the diagnosis of this subset of small difficult melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W3169859285,"The prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is vastly higher than that of tuberculosis (TB) disease and this enormous reservoir of individuals with LTBI impacts the global TB control strategy. Adolescents are at greatest risk of TB infection and are thus an ideal target population for a potential effective TB vaccine to be added to the current BCG programme as it could reduce the number of latent infections and consequently the number of adults with TB disease. However, LTBI rates are often unknown for this population. This study aims to estimate the magnitude of LTBI and to determine if Tanzanian adolescents would be a good population for a prevention of TB infection trial.This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that recruited 193 adolescents aged 12 and 16 years from government schools and directly from the community in Mwanza Region, Tanzania. Socio-demographic characteristics were collected for all enrolled participants. Blood was drawn and tested using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT), and Early Secretory Antigenic Target-6-Free Interferon-gamma Release Assay (ESAT-6 free IGRA). Concordance between QFT-GIT and ESAT-6 free IGRA was evaluated using the McNemar's test.Overall estimates of LTBI prevalence were 19.2% [95%CI, 14.1; 25.2] and 18.6% [95%CI, 13.6; 24.6] as measured by QFT-GIT IGRA and ESAT-6 free IGRA, respectively. The 16-year-old cohort had a higher LTBI prevalence (23.7% [95%CI, 16.1; 32.9]) as compared to 12-year-old cohort (14.6% [95%CI, 8.6; 22.7]) as measured by QFT-GIT IGRA. When measured by ESAT-6 Free IGRA, LTBI prevalence was 24.7% (95%CI, 16.9; 34.0) for the 16-year-old cohort and 12.5% (95%CI, 7.0; 20.3) among the 12-year-old cohort. According to both tests the prevalence of TB infection and the corresponding annual risk of tuberculosis infection (ARTI) and force of infection were high and increased with age. Of all enrolled participants, 97.4% had concordant results for QFT-GIT IGRA and ESAT-6 free IGRA (p = 0.65).The prevalence of LTBI and the associated ARTI and force of infection among adolescents is high and increases with age in Mwanza Region. There was a high concordance between the QFT-GIT and the novel ESAT-6 free IGRA assays. These findings suggest Mwanza is a promising area to conduct novel TB vaccine research prevention of infection (POI) studies targeting adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3170821989,"Survey researchers hope that respondents will provide high-quality data, but evidence suggests that social desirability bias may be commonplace. Social desirability can lead to significant underreporting or overreporting of sensitive behaviors. With better understanding of the cognitive processes that respondents use to prepare and deliver their responses, survey designers could hope to minimize social desirability bias or at least detect settings that lessen its impact. The primary objective of this study was to use survey paradata to understand the psychology of responding to certain types of survey questions. More specifically, we sought to determine how emotional triggering can alter response latencies to cognitively demanding and sensitive survey questions on induced abortion, which is underreported. We hypothesize that having had a prior abortion might lengthen response times to an indirect question about abortion among respondents who have experienced this sensitive reproductive outcome as they hesitate in deciding whether and how to respond to the question. Data come from a representative survey of 6,035 reproductive age women in Rajasthan, India. We used list experiment question active screen time paradata in conjunction with responses from direct questions on abortion to assess our hypothesis. Our final model was a multivariate linear regression with random effects at the level of the interviewer, including adjustments for respondent, community, and interviewer characteristics to estimate within-respondent effects. Results suggest that women who reported an abortion on the direct abortion questions took 5.11 (95% CI 0.21, 10.00) seconds longer to respond to the list experiment treatment list compared to the control list in comparison to women who did not report an abortion on the direct abortion questions. This study demonstrates the additional insights gained when focusing on response latencies to cognitively demanding questions involved in the measurement of sensitive behaviors."

CITA provides sufficient local antibiotic concentrations to heavily infected cavities while avoiding systemic toxicity.In-vitro confirmation of the efficacy of the CITA treatment approach in simulated compartmentalized infections.A rapid automated bacterial culture analyzing system) Uro4 HB&L™ (was applied to compare the efficacy of selected antibiotics at a standard minimal inhibitory concentration (1MIC), 4MIC, and CITA at 103MIC, for growth inhibition of high bacterial loads (106 colony-forming-units/ml) of ATCC strains of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus.The addition of gentamicin and amikacin at 1MIC concentrations only temporarily inhibited the exponential growth of E. coli and P. aeruginosa. 4MIC level extended the delay of exponential bacterial growth. Increasing concentrations of vancomycin similarly temporarily delayed S. aureus growth. All tested antibiotics at CITA of 103MIC totally inhibited the exponential growth of the tested bacteria through 72 hours of exposure. (P<0.001).In this in-vitro model, CITA at 103MIC effectively inhibited exponential bacterial growth of high loads of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. This model offers preliminary laboratory support for the benefit of the in-situ antibiotic treatment, providing ultra-high concentrations directly at the compartmentalized infection site, not achievable by the conventional intravenous and oral routes."
https://openalex.org/W3171478700,"Active contour models driven by local binary fitting energy can segment images with inhomogeneous intensity, while being prone to falling into a local minima. However, the segmentation result largely depends on the location of the initial contour. We propose an active contour model with global and local image information. The local information of the model is obtained by bilateral filters, which can also enhance the edge information while smoothing the image. The local fitting centers are calculated before the contour evolution, which can alleviate the iterative process and achieve fast image segmentation. The global information of the model is obtained by simplifying the C-V model, which can assist contour evolution, thereby increasing accuracy. Experimental results show that our algorithm is insensitive to the initial contour position, and has higher precision and speed."

As the core system to guarantee the properties of self-decision and trajectory tracking of the unmanned vehicles, a new kind of trajectory tracking method based on the circulation of feasible path planning for the unmanned vehicles are proposed in this article which considered the dynamics and kinematics characteristics of vehicles. The multi-trace-points cooperative trajectory tracking control strategy on the basis of the circulation of feasible path generation method is proposed and the lateral controller is designed for trajectory tracking. The process of feasible path generation is conducted once the tracking error exceeded. A simulation platform of the trajectory tracking simulation of unmanned vehicles is built considering the mechanical properties of system elements and the mechanical characteristics. Finally, the proposed trajectory tracking method is verified. The tracking error would be reduced to make sure the vehicles move along the pre-set virtual track."

This article provides the history of the Brain Bee initiative, the recent formation of the IBB organization, the IBB World Championship, and how scientists, educators, and other organizations can contribute. Brain Bees are neuroscience competitions for teenagers (age 13 through 19) hosted around the world. This article provides the history of the Brain Bee initiative, the recent formation of the IBB organization, the IBB World Championship, and how scientists, educators, and other organizations can contribute. Thirteen-year-old Yatish Aryal from Nepal wore a white lab coat as he stood in front of an interactive display at the Brain Museum. Since the age of five, he had been fascinated with medicine and neuroscience, in particular brain disorders like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Yatish and Igor Arefiev, a fellow teenager from Ukraine who wants to be a neuroscientist and study artificial intelligence, are trying to figure out how data collected during human brain surgery informs current research on neural networks and brain function (Figure 1B). The display is part of the Brain Museum located in the lobby of the Korea Brain Research Institute (KBRI). Yatish found a translation of the Korean characters on Google (“I think I read this paper,” he said as he shared his phone with Igor). They spend about five more minutes debating what they think the caption on one of the figures says before being called away. Dr. Yoo-hun Suh, the founding president of the KBRI, had asked to have his picture taken with them. Both the KBRI and Dr. Suh were hosting Yatish, Igor, and 26 other teenagers from around the world for the week in Daegu, South Korea. They were all there for the 2019 International Brain Bee (IBB) World Championship, a neuroscience competition that takes place each year at different locations around the globe. The IBB World Championship sits at a unique intersection of science outreach and the global expansion in neuroscience. It is one of many initiatives such as Backyard Brains (Gage, 2019Gage G.J. The case for neuroscience research in the classroom.Neuron. 2019; 102: 914-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and Frontiers for Young Minds (Kastner and Knight, 2017Kastner S. Knight R.T. Bringing kids into the scientific review process.Neuron. 2017; 93: 12-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) that aim to generate and maintain interest in neuroscience for high-school-aged students. Over its 20-plus years, however, the IBB’s growth from a regional US-Canada event into a global initiative that has almost 50 countries hosting Brain Bees mirrors the decades-long increase in international scientific collaboration and how scientists from around the world work together (Csomós et al., 2020Csomós G. Vida Z.V. Lengyel B. Exploring the changing geographical pattern of international scientific collaborations through the prism of cities.PLoS ONE. 2020; 15: e0242468Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For this NeuroView, we will provide a brief background of the Brain Bee and some examples of the ways individual countries have developed their own Brain Bee competitions; outline some of the ways the new IBB organization aims to provide infrastructure to align the local, national, and International Brain Bee efforts; and close with opportunities for individuals to get involved in the Brain Bee initiative. The Brain Bee is the brainchild of Dr. Norbert Myslinski, a professor in the University of Maryland’s Department of Neural Pain Sciences with a passion for teaching about the human brain. He founded the Brain Bee as a high school competition to inspire teenagers to learn more about clinical and behavioral brain sciences and to encourage them to enter a career in neuroscience or medicine. The first Brain Bee had both US and Canada representation and was held in 1999 in Baltimore. The Brain Bee Championship continued to be held as a US-Canada competition in Baltimore, then moved off US soil to Montreal, Canada in 2008. This first international competition had four national champions from the US, Canada, India, and Australia/New Zealand. That event was held in conjunction with the Canadian Annual Neuroscience Meeting and was hosted by the Canadian Association for Neuroscience and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). Over the next 10-year period, other countries started hosting their own national Brain Bees to select representatives to compete at the World Championship. Today, the local, national, and international Brain Bee competitions engage over 25,000 high-school-aged students from around the world each year. As more countries held Brain Bees, the World Championships began traveling the globe, occurring in conjunction with major neuroscience meetings throughout the world. The organizing committees are mostly comprised of volunteer college and university neuroscientists, graduate students, and high school teachers. Since the first IBB World Championship in Canada in 2008, the event has been held in multiple countries, including South Africa (International Congress of Psychology), Australia (International Society for Neurochemistry-Australasian Neuroscience Society Annual Meeting), Austria (World Congress of Neurology), Denmark and Germany (FENS Forum of Neuroscience), and Italy and South Korea (IBRO World Congress of Neuroscience). The American Psychological Association has hosted four IBB World Championships at its annual convention in Canada and the US. Brain Bees are an important educational and outreach tool that impacts individuals far beyond the national champions that make it to the World Championship. In many instances, high schools and other youth-oriented groups (scouting troops or local clubs) organize teams where students find a community to study and get guidance from teachers and other adult leaders to prepare for local and national competitions. Some high schools have Brain Bee content integrated into curriculum and use it to help teach about science careers. In Australia and New Zealand (where it is known as the Brain Bee Challenge), the Brain Bee plays a role in general scientific knowledge and helping to dispel myths around neurological and mental illnesses. It also serves as an opportunity for outreach to students living in remote and rural areas. In the United States, most local and national competitions are hosted by colleges, typically through psychology, biology, or neuroscience departments. They are key outreach opportunities for institutions and ways to promote their academic programs. Quite often, Brain Bees involve both undergraduate and graduate students, providing opportunities to develop important organizational, teaching, and science communication skills in the process. Established faculty and younger researchers (postdoctoral fellows) are recruited as judges and interact directly with competitors. Many research societies, foundations, and governmental agencies provide needed support for local and national Brain Bees. For example, the Canadian National Brain Bee is supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and hosted at McMasters University. It is the culmination of numerous local Brain Bees throughout the Canadian provinces, where students compete and qualify. Another example is the Mongolian Brain Bee, which is relatively new and receives support from The Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, and Sport; The Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences; and the Mongolian Neuroscience Society. The growth of Brain Bees around the world and the annual hosting of a World Championship is impressive, given that in the past, all the work was done by an informal global network of volunteers. In 2018, the IBB celebrated its 20th anniversary, and in that same year, five major brain research and science organizations (the American Psychological Association, the Dana Foundation, the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies [FENS], the International Brain Research Organization [IBRO], and the Society for Neuroscience [SfN]) came together to establish a registered educational non-profit known as the International Brain Bee (https://thebrainbee.org/). The IBB Board is comprised of representatives of the five organizations plus Dr. Myslinski. All five governing partners renewed their initial 3-year commitment at the end of 2020 and recently welcomed the Alzheimer’s Association as an additional partner. Currently there are two part-time staff members (an Executive Director and an Academic Director) responsible for the coordination with national Brain Bees and the organization of the annual IBB World Championships. The goal of the new organization is to build upon the past success and momentum of Brain Bees and ensure the longevity of the IBB World Championships as an international platform for educators and scientists from around the world to introduce young minds to neuroscience. In 2020, the Board created two standing committees, one that focuses on partnership development and fundraising and a second that oversees the competition rules, regulations, and academic content of the IBB World Championship. Efforts are underway to establish partnerships with scientific research institutes, research societies/associations, and technology-based educational companies to create resources that will serve as preparation materials for IBB World Championship qualifiers. The creation of a deep test-bank of questions and use of cloud-based practice materials will allow for the tracking of which questions students master and ongoing learning analytics. Probably of greater impact to the actual competitors is the establishment of two broad learning outcomes for the World Championships: to create an academic competition that exposes participants to the cutting edge and diverse applications of neuroscience research, along with encouraging ongoing study and careers in neuroscience, and to integrate a social program that provides opportunities for competitors to share and learn about their different cultures. The academic competition takes about two days to complete and follows a standard format with five subsections that test students’ knowledge and understanding of neuroanatomy, histology (Figure 1A), clinical applications through patient diagnosis, a written multiple-choice and short-answer exam, and a final live-answer Q&A session, which is usually held at the hosting conference and open to the public. Currently, content is primarily drawn from three sources (BrainFacts from the Society for Neuroscience; Essential Neuroscience by Siegel and Sapru; and The Brain: An Introduction to Functional Neuroanatomy by Watson, Paxinos, and Kirkcaldie). For each World Championship, the organizing committee must pass along what worked well from year-to-year, what questions were used, and how competitors fared on each question. For many competitors, the IBB World Championship is the first time they have traveled outside their country, and the IBB organizers have taken advantage of this opportunity to create a cultural exchange and unique friendship experience. The social program provides time for students to socialize and learn from one another: for example, it has become a tradition for each competitor to bring a souvenir from his or her country and explain why they think it represents the history and culture of their country. Interspersed between the academic components of the competition, participants get to tour their host city, attend scientific sessions of the host meeting, and have unstructured social time and gather for an awards ceremony and dinner before heading home (Figure 1C). Past Brain Bee competitors stay connected with one another through various forums such as dedicated Facebook groups and other social media platforms. Many former Brain Bee competitors join the International Youth Neuroscience Association (INYA), a separate nonprofit with 175 chapters in 80 countries that is organized and led mainly by high school and college students. The INYA is an active partner of the IBB and provides assistance in numerous ways, from helping to recruit IBB interns, helping prepare Brain Bee competitors, and assisting with the creation of study materials that can be provided to local and national Brain Bees. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some of the local and national Brain Bees being held virtually, while other Brain Bees and the 2020 IBB World Championship were cancelled altogether. For 2021, most national Brain Bees and the IBB itself are planning virtual events. Hosting a completely virtual IBB World Championship presents unique challenges (e.g., securing the questions and competition content when delivered asynchronously across multiple time zones and delivering an engaging, virtual social program). Doing so, however, will advance the development of an interactive, online platform that can be used by Brain Bees in the future to complement their own competitions and as a study and practice platform for competitors. The IBB Board anticipates and is currently planning a fully in-person IBB World Championship in Paris, France to be hosted by the 2022 FENS Forum of Neuroscience. The growth and success of the entire Brain Bee program—from local chapters to the production of the annual IBB World Championship—relies upon a network of highly committed volunteers from around the world. Chances are there is a Brain Bee near you, and if you are a scientist, educator, or an advocate of science education, we welcome your involvement! Volunteer opportunities range from being judges for competitions, hosting and organizing a competition, or starting a new Brain Bee. You can find local and national Brain Bees online through Facebook or other social media. The IBB website (https://thebrainbee.org/) maintains a list of countries that host Brain Bee competitions and their contact information. Several new national Brain Bees are currently in development, and we look to further expand our global reach by increasing the number of countries that send their champions to the annual IBB World Championship and by recruiting new countries. With thousands of students participating in local, national, and international competitions every year, Brain Bee alumni represent a valuable source of advocates. Former contestants are enthusiastic spokespeople for the Brain Bee initiative, and many have continued in careers of medicine and neuroscience research, policy, and education. Tracking and connecting Brain Bee alumni is a priority for the IBB, and we have created an alumni category on the IBB website. If you are a national Brain Bee coordinator, you can provide a list of your Brain Bee alumni. If you are a former competitor, we encourage you to sign up and answer a few questions about your experience and how the Brain Bee has influenced your career trajectory. We have several interns who assist with alumni tracking who may reach out to you to conduct an interview. Alumni stories will be featured and communicated in a variety of ways to help promote the impact of the IBB and to assist with partnership development and fundraising. Other organizations provide financial and in-kind support of the IBB World Championships. For example, Leadership Initiatives (DC) provides fully paid scholarships to IBB Champions to participate in their neuroscience internship programs hosted in collaboration with Georgetown University, offering further exposure to neuroscience research. Elsevier has provided national champions with copies of one of the study books. We welcome other organizations, companies, and foundations to explore future sponsorship or partnerships that extend the Brain Bee community or help support the development of the IBB World Championship. To learn more about any of these ways to be involved in Brain Bees, whether you’re an alumnus, an educator looking to volunteer, or an organization or foundation seeking partnership ideas, please contact Astrid Eberhart, IBB Executive Director, at [email protected] . However, the simplest way to support the Brain Bee initiative is to help us spread the word. If you are a science educator, we encourage you to let others know about the IBB, including students who may wish to participate. If you are a science advocate, come see a Brain Bee in action. As mentioned earlier, most competitions—including the IBB World Championships—allow spectators to attend the live judging component. Whether you are an active member of the Brain Bee community or taking your first step into the Brain Bee world, we hope to see you at a future Brain Bee competition. Garth A. Fowler is a Board member of the IBB and current Chair of the Academic and Competition Advisory Committee of the IBB. Astrid Eberhart is the Executive Director of the IBB."
https://openalex.org/W3167590139,"Neonatal deaths represent around half the deaths of children less than five-years old in Cambodia. The process from live birth to neonatal death has not been well described. This study aimed to identify problems in health care service which hamper the reduction of preventable neonatal deaths in rural Cambodia.This study adopted a method of qualitative case study design using narrative data from the verbal autopsy standard. Eighty and forty villages were randomly selected from Kampong Cham and Svay Rieng provinces, respectively. All households in the target villages were visited between January and February 2017. Family caregivers were asked to describe their experiences on births and neonatal deaths between 2015 and 2016. Information on the process from birth to death was extracted with open coding, categorized, and summarized into several groups which represent potential problems in health services.Among a total of 4,142 children born in 2015 and 2016, 35 neonatal deaths were identified. Of these deaths, 74% occurred within one week of birth, and 57% were due to low-birth weight. Narrative data showed that three factors should be improved, 1) the unavailability of a health-care professional, 2) barriers in the referral system, and 3) lack of knowledge and skill to manage major causes of neonatal deaths.The current health system has limitations to achieve further reduction of neonatal deaths in rural Cambodia. The mere deployment of midwives at fixed service points such as health centers could not solve the problems occurring in rural communities. Community engagement revisiting the principle of primary health care, as well as health system transformation, is the key to the solution and potential breakthrough for the future."
