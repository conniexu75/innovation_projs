Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human γ-secretase bound individually to two GSI clinical candidates, Semagacestat and Avagacestat, a transition state analog GSI L685,458, and a classic GSM E2012, at overall resolutions of 2.6–3.1 Å.

The membrane-embedded γ-secretase cleaves the transmembrane domain (TM) of multiple signaling proteins exemplified by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch (Beel and Sanders, 2008Beel A.J.

APP is first cleaved by β-secretase in the extracellular space. The resulting C-terminal 99-residue fragment (APP-C99) is further proteolyzed by γ-secretase to generate an intracellular domain (AICD) and a 48- or 49-residue transmembrane peptide (Aβ48 or Aβ49) (Takami et al., 2009Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13042-13052Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Aβ48 and Aβ49 are then trimmed every three or four residues by γ-secretase, generating Aβ peptides of varying lengths and byproducts of diverse tri- and tetra-peptides (Takami et al., 2009Takami M. Nagashima Y. Sano Y. Ishihara S. Morishima-Kawashima M. Funamoto S.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13042-13052Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Accumulation of Aβ peptides leads to formation of β-amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Kidd, 1964Kidd M. Alzheimer’s Disease–an Electron Microscopical Study.Brain. 1964; 87: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase contains four subunits: the catalytic subunit PS1 or PS2, Pen-2, APH-1, and nicastrin (NCT). The vast majority of familial AD-derived (FAD) mutations target PS1 and to a lesser extent PS2 and APP (Citron et al., 1992Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P.

Nearly all mutations result in aberrant proteolysis of APP (Borchelt et al., 1996Borchelt D.R. Thinakaran G. Eckman C.B. Lee M.K. Davenport F. Ratovitsky T. Prada C.M. Kim G. Seekins S.

These observations engendered the amyloid hypothesis (Hardy and Higgins, 1992Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Alzheimer’s disease: the amyloid cascade hypothesis.Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4535) Google Scholar), which suggests the Aβ oligomers and plaques to be a causative factor for AD development (Cleary et al., 2005Cleary J.P. Walsh D.M. Hofmeister J.J. Shankar G.M. Kuskowski M.A. Selkoe D.J. Ashe K.H. Natural oligomers of the amyloid-beta protein specifically disrupt cognitive function.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that inhibition of γ-secretase, which presumably reduces Aβ production and decreases accumulation of Aβ oligomers and plaques, may constitute an effective treatment for AD (Golde et al., 2010Golde T.E.

Gamma-secretase inhibition and modulation for Alzheimer’s disease.Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2008; 5: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Semagacestat, developed and code-named LY-450139 by Eli Lily (Henley et al., 2009Henley D.B. May P.C. Dean R.A. Siemers E.R. Development of semagacestat (LY450139), a functional gamma-secretase inhibitor, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2009; 10: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was the first γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) that entered phase III clinical evaluation. In contrast to the encouraging earlier results (Siemers et al., 2007Siemers E.R. Dean R.A. Friedrich S. Ferguson-Sells L. Gonzales C. Farlow M.R. May P.C. Safety, tolerability, and effects on plasma and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta after inhibition of gamma-secretase.Clin. Neuropharmacol. 2007; 30: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), Semagacestat failed to show cognitive improvement in phase III but produced severe side effects (Doody et al., 2013Doody R.S. Raman R. Farlow M. Iwatsubo T. Vellas B. Joffe S. Kieburtz K. He F. Sun X. Thomas R.G. et al.Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Steering CommitteeSemagacestat Study GroupA phase 3 trial of semagacestat for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 369: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The side effects are attributed to cleavage inhibition of other substrates such as Notch (Aster et al., 2017Aster J.C. Pear W.S. Blacklow S.C. The Varied Roles of Notch in Cancer.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2017; 12: 245-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar; Doody et al., 2015Doody R.S. Raman R. Sperling R.A. Seimers E.

Ther. 2015; 7: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To address this problem, substrate-specific GSIs have been developed as exemplified by the Notch-sparing GSIs (Gillman et al., 2010Gillman K.W. Starrett Jr., J.E. Parker M.F. Xie K. Bronson J.J. Marcin L.R. McElhone K.E. Bergstrom C.P. Mate R.A. Williams R. et al.Discovery and Evaluation of BMS-708163, a Potent, Selective and Orally Bioavailable γ-Secretase Inhibitor.ACS Med. Chem.

Chem. 2008; 51: 7348-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A representative clinical candidate Avagacestat (known as BMS-708163) preferentially inhibited the cleavage of APP over Notch (Gillman et al., 2010Gillman K.W. Starrett Jr., J.E. Parker M.F. Xie K. Bronson J.J. Marcin L.R. McElhone K.E. Bergstrom C.P. Mate R.A. Williams R. et al.Discovery and Evaluation of BMS-708163, a Potent, Selective and Orally Bioavailable γ-Secretase Inhibitor.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 1: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, high doses of Avagacestat still inhibit Notch cleavage and exhibit toxicity (Coric et al., 2012Coric V. van Dyck C.H. Salloway S. Andreasen N. Brody M. Richter R.W. Soininen H. Thein S. Shiovitz T. Pilcher G. et al.Safety and tolerability of the γ-secretase inhibitor avagacestat in a phase 2 study of mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.Arch.

Shiovitz T. et al.Targeting Prodromal Alzheimer Disease With Avagacestat: A Randomized Clinical Trial.JAMA Neurol. 2015; 72: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). GSIs are classified into transition state analog (TSA) and non-TSA based on mechanisms of inhibition (Esler et al., 2000Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Moore C.L. Tsai J.Y.

Neurochem. 2012; 120: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Semagacestat and Avagacestat are both non-competitive non-TSA inhibitors (Karran and Hardy, 2014Karran E. Hardy J.

Neurochem. 2012; 120: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast, the small molecule L685,458 is a widely studied competitive TSA (Gillman et al., 2010Gillman K.W. Starrett Jr., J.E. Parker M.F. Xie K. Bronson J.J. Marcin L.R. McElhone K.E. Bergstrom C.P. Mate R.A.

L685,458 directly binds the active site of PS1 (Esler et al., 2000Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Moore C.L. Tsai J.Y. Rahmati T. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S.

Biol. 2010; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to GSIs, γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) have also been recognized as an attractive class of small molecules for alleviating the symptoms of AD (Crump et al., 2013Crump C.J. Johnson D.S.

GSMs may promote further cleavage of Aβ42, thus reducing the amount of aggregation-prone Aβ peptides (Pozdnyakov et al., 2013Pozdnyakov N. Murrey H.E. Crump C.J. Pettersson M. Ballard T.E. Am Ende C.W. Ahn K. Li Y.M. Bales K.R. Johnson D.S. γ-Secretase modulator (GSM) photoaffinity probes reveal distinct allosteric binding sites on presenilin.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 9710-9720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unlike GSIs, GSMs are recognized at a distinct allosteric site away from the active site of γ-secretase (Pozdnyakov et al., 2013Pozdnyakov N. Murrey H.E. Crump C.J. Pettersson M. Ballard T.E. Am Ende C.W. Ahn K. Li Y.M. Bales K.R. Johnson D.S. γ-Secretase modulator (GSM) photoaffinity probes reveal distinct allosteric binding sites on presenilin.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 9710-9720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, a specific GSI may work with a GSM to achieve substrate-selective inhibition. The small molecule E2012 is a widely used classic member of the heterocyclic GSM family (Kimura et al., 2005Kimura T. Kawano K. Doi E. Kitazawa N. Shin K. Miyagawa T. Kaneko T. Ito K. Takaishi M. Sasaki T. Hagiwara H. Preparation of cinnamide, 3-benzylidenepiperidin-2-one, phenylpropynamide compounds as amyloid β production inhibitors. PCT Int. Appl. 2005, WO 2005115990 A1 20051208.2005Google Scholar). The development of more specific GSIs necessitates mechanistic understanding of the general inhibition as well as substrate-selective inhibition. Improvement of GSMs requires structural information on their recognition by γ-secretase. Unfortunately, such information has remained largely unknown. To date, there is no atomic model on the recognition of any GSI or GSM by γ-secretase (Bai et al., 2015aBai X.C. Rajendra E. Yang G. Shi Y. Scheres S.H. Sampling the conformational space of the catalytic subunit of human γ-secretase.eLife. 2015; 4: e11182Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar; Li et al., 2014Li Y. Lu S.H. Tsai C.J. Bohm C.

Chen F. et al.Structural interactions between inhibitor and substrate docking sites give insight into mechanisms of human PS1 complexes.Structure. 2014; 22: 125-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the structural mechanism of γ-secretase inhibition by three distinct GSIs: Semagacestat, Avagacestat, and L685,458. We also report the atomic structure of γ-secretase bound to the GSM E2012 (Kimura et al., 2005Kimura T. Kawano K. Doi E. Kitazawa N. Shin K. Miyagawa T. Kaneko T. Ito K. Takaishi M. Sasaki T. Hagiwara H. Preparation of cinnamide, 3-benzylidenepiperidin-2-one, phenylpropynamide compounds as amyloid β production inhibitors. PCT Int. Appl. 2005, WO 2005115990 A1 20051208.2005Google Scholar). Recombinant human γ-secretase was prepared as described (Lu et al., 2014Lu P. Bai X.C. Ma D. Xie T. Yan C. Sun L. Yang G. Zhao Y. Zhou R. Scheres S.H.W. Shi Y. Three-dimensional structure of human γ-secretase.Nature. 2014; 512: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We first examined inhibition of γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP-C99 and Notch by the GSIs (Figure 1). In an in vitro assay, Semagacestat exhibited a similar potency for the cleavage inhibition of both APP-C99 and Notch (Figure 1A). Using the AlphaLisa assay, Semagacestat was found to display an inhibitory constant (IC50) of 2.7 ± 0.9 μM for Aβ40 production (Figure 1B). In contrast, the other non-TSA inhibitor Avagacestat shows a clear preference for the cleavage inhibition of APP-C99 over Notch (Figure 1C), with an IC50 of 16.7 ± 2.2 nM for Aβ40 production (Figure 1D). The TSA inhibitor L685,458 (hereafter referred to as L458) behaves similarly as Semagacestat (Figure 1E) but has a more potent IC50 (Figure 1F). An excess amount of Semagacestat was incubated with purified γ-secretase prior to cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) sample preparation. 1,978 micrographs were recorded using a K2 Summit detector mounted on a Titan Krios microscope, yielding 1,044,389 particles (Figure S1A). Following two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) classifications, 323,861 particles yielded a final reconstruction of Semagacestat-bound γ-secretase at an average resolution of 3.0 Å (Figures 2A and S1B; Table S1). An isolated density lobe, which is located next to the β2 strand of PS1, was assigned to Semagacestat (Figures 2B and S1C).Figure 2Structural basis of Semagacestat recognition by human γ-secretaseShow full caption(A) Overall cryo-EM map of Semagacestat-bound human γ-secretase.

Remarkably, Semagacestat occupies exactly the same location as the β strand of APP-C99 or Notch-100 (Yang et al., 2019Yang G. Zhou R. Zhou Q. Guo X. Yan C. Ke M. Lei J. Shi Y. Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase.Nature. 2019; 565: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Zhou et al., 2019Zhou R. Yang G. Guo X. Zhou Q. Lei J. Shi Y. Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase.Science. 2019; 363: eaaw0930Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). This structural finding provides an immediate and satisfactory explanation to γ-secretase inhibition by Semagacestat. Because formation of a hybrid β sheet between PS1 and the substrate is essential for its cleavage (Yang et al., 2019Yang G. Zhou R. Zhou Q. Guo X. Yan C. Ke M. Lei J. Shi Y. Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase.Nature. 2019; 565: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Zhou et al., 2019Zhou R. Yang G. Guo X. Zhou Q. Lei J. Shi Y. Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase.Science. 2019; 363: eaaw0930Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), occupation of this site by Semagacestat may hinder formation of the hybrid β sheet and thereby inhibits substrate cleavage. Semagacestat is located in a deep cavity on the intracellular side of PS1 (Figure 2C). This cavity is surrounded by strand β2, TM6a, the C-terminal portion of TM8, and the ensuing PAL motif (Pro433-Ala434-Leu435) that is important for substrate binding (Sato et al., 2008Sato C. Takagi S. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. The C-terminal PAL motif and transmembrane domain 9 of presenilin 1 are involved in the formation of the catalytic pore of the gamma-secretase.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6264-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Semagacestat makes four specific hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) to the main chain groups of Lys380 on strand β2 and Leu432 just preceding the PAL motif (Figure 2D, left panel). These two residues are similarly involved in recognition of the APP-C99 or Notch β strand (Yang et al., 2019Yang G. Zhou R. Zhou Q. Guo X. Yan C. Ke M. Lei J. Shi Y. Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase.Nature. 2019; 565: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Zhou et al., 2019Zhou R. Yang G. Guo X. Zhou Q. Lei J. Shi Y. Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase.Science. 2019; 363: eaaw0930Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this regard, Semagacestat acts just like the substrate β strand. Semagacestat uses its hydroxyl group to donate an H-bond to the carboxylate oxygen of Asp385 (Figure 2D, left panel). Intriguingly, the carboxylate side chains of the catalytic residues Asp257 and Asp385 are separated by a distance of only 4.8 Å. This distance is close to that of an activated aspartate protease, suggesting preservation of an activated conformation of PS1 in the inhibitor-bound state. Semagacestat also makes a number of van der Waals contacts to surrounding hydrophobic residues (Figure 2D, right panel). Specific coordination of Semagacestat leaves several small crevices that may accommodate additional chemical groups (Figure S1D). For example, additional small hydrophobic groups might fill the hydrophobic space around Val261 and Val272 (Figure S1E). Such modification is likely to result in improved specificity and inhibition potency. In contrast to Semagacestat, Avagacestat prefers the cleavage inhibition of APP-C99 over Notch, with the reported preference of inhibition ranging from 3-fold to 193-fold (Chávez-Gutiérrez et al., 2012Chávez-Gutiérrez L.

Notably, the chemical identity of Avagacestat is quite different from that of Semagacestat (Figure 3A, left panel), raising the possibility that Avagacestat may bind to a location that is different from that by Semagacestat. We prepared Avagacestat-bound human γ-secretase and collected 6,266 micrographs.

https://openalex.org/W3116367215,"Flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in perivascular spaces (PVS) is one of the key concepts involved in theories concerning clearance from the brain. Experimental studies have demonstrated both net and oscillatory movement of microspheres in PVS (Mestre et al. (2018), Bedussi et al. (2018)). The oscillatory particle movement has a clear cardiac component, while the mechanisms involved in net movement remain disputed. Using computational fluid dynamics, we computed the CSF velocity and pressure in a PVS surrounding a cerebral artery subject to different forces, representing arterial wall expansion, systemic CSF pressure changes and rigid motions of the artery. The arterial wall expansion generated velocity amplitudes of 60–260 μ m/s, which is in the upper range of previously observed values. In the absence of a static pressure gradient, predicted net flow velocities were small (&lt;0.5 μ m/s), though reaching up to 7 μ m/s for non-physiological PVS lengths. In realistic geometries, a static systemic pressure increase of physiologically plausible magnitude was sufficient to induce net flow velocities of 20–30 μ m/s. Moreover, rigid motions of the artery added to the complexity of flow patterns in the PVS. Our study demonstrates that the combination of arterial wall expansion, rigid motions and a static CSF pressure gradient generates net and oscillatory PVS flow, quantitatively comparable with experimental findings. The static CSF pressure gradient required for net flow is small, suggesting that its origin is yet to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W3114225594,"Interspecies organ generation via blastocyst complementation has succeeded in rodents, but not yet in evolutionally more distant species. Early developmental arrest hinders the formation of highly chimeric fetuses. We demonstrate that the deletion of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r) in mouse embryos creates a permissive ""cell-competitive niche"" in several organs, significantly augmenting both mouse intraspecies and mouse/rat interspecies donor chimerism that continuously increases from embryonic day 11 onward, sometimes even taking over entire organs within intraspecies chimeras. Since Igf1r deletion allows the evasion of early developmental arrest, interspecies fetuses with high levels of organ chimerism can be generated via blastocyst complementation. This observation should facilitate donor cell contribution to host tissues, resulting in whole-organ generation via blastocyst complementation across wide evolutionary distances."
https://openalex.org/W3114923562,"Coagulation factor V (FV) plays an anticoagulant role but serves as a procoagulant cofactor in the prothrombinase complex once activated to FVa. At the heart of these opposing effects is the proteolytic removal of its central B-domain, including conserved functional landmarks (basic region, BR; 963–1008 and acidic region 2, AR2; 1493–1537) that enforce the inactive FV procofactor state. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor α (TFPIα) has been associated with FV as well as FV-short, a physiologically relevant isoform with a shortened B-domain missing the BR. However, it is unclear which forms of FV are physiologic ligands for TFPIα. Here, we characterize the binding and regulation of FV and FV-short by TFPIα via its positively charged C-terminus (TFPIα-BR) and examine how bond cleavage in the B-domain influences these interactions. We show that FV-short is constitutively active and functions in prothrombinase like FVa. Unlike FVa, FV-short binds with high affinity (Kd ∼1 nM) to TFPIα-BR, which blocks procoagulant function unless FV-short is cleaved at Arg1545, removing AR2. Importantly, we do not observe FV binding (μM detection limit) to TFPIα. However, cleavage at Arg709 and Arg1018 displaces the FV BR, exposing AR2 and allowing TFPIα to bind via its BR. We conclude that for full-length FV, the detachment of FV BR from AR2 is necessary and sufficient for TFPIα binding and regulation. Our findings pinpoint key forms of FV, including FV-short, that act as physiologic ligands for TFPIα and establish a mechanistic framework for assessing the functional connection between these proteins.

The proteolytic conversion of factor V (FV) to activated FV (FVa) is central to the amplification of coagulation and necessary for blood clot formation (1Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Factor V: A combination of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Blood. 2003; 101: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). FV circulates in the blood as a single-chain, inactive procofactor in which the N-terminal heavy chain (HC; domains A1-A2) and C-terminal light chain (LC; domains A3-C1-C2) are situated between a central B-domain (Fig. 1A) (1Mann K.G.

Proteolysis of FV at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 by thrombin or factor Xa (FXa) releases the B-domain and activates it to FVa (3Suzuki K. Dahlback B. Stenflo J.

Cleavage requirements for activation of factor V by factor Xa.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As a cofactor, FVa binds membrane-bound FXa with high affinity forming the prothrombinase complex, which converts prothrombin to thrombin (9Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Cofactor proteins in the assembly and expression of blood clotting enzyme complexes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). FVa is essential for thrombin generation as it increases the rate at which FXa acts on prothrombin by several orders of magnitude (10Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Surface-dependent reactions of the vitamin K-dependent enzyme complexes.Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insights into the mechanism by which FV is kept as a procofactor and how proteolysis in the B-domain affects FV activation have been made (2Camire R.M. Bos M.H.

Evolutionary conserved regions in the B-domain called the basic region (BR; residues 963–1008) and acidic region 2 (AR2; residues 1493–1537) work together by blocking the FXa binding site on the HC/LC (Fig. 1A) (15Zhu H.

The BR+AR2 make up the minimal sequences necessary to keep FV inactive. For example, elimination of most of the B-domain, except the BR+AR2, yields a FV derivative that is maintained as a procofactor (16Bos M.H. Camire R.M. A bipartite autoinhibitory region within the B-domain suppresses function in factor V.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26342-26351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, removal of either the BR or AR2 by recombinant deletion produces a constitutively active derivative, which functions like FVa (15Zhu H. Toso R. Camire R.M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 15033-15039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Bos M.H. Camire R.M.

Consistent with this model, an exogenous FV-BR fragment binds with high affinity to B-domainless forms of FV that retain AR2, but lack the BR (e.g., FV-810; Δ811–1491). The binding of this FV-BR fragment to FV-810 restricts FXa binding and blocks procoagulant activity (17Bunce M.W. Bos M.H. Krishnaswamy S. Camire R.M.

Chem. 2013; 288: 30151-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The importance of these functional landmarks in the B-domain goes beyond maintaining FV as a procofactor. For example, tissue factor pathway inhibitor alpha (TFPIα) binds to an exposed AR2 on partially proteolyzed forms of FV and inhibits procoagulant function by preventing assembly in prothrombinase (18Wood J.P. Bunce M.W. Maroney S.A. Tracy P.B. Camire R.M. Mast A.E. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-alpha inhibits prothrombinase during the initiation of blood coagulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiological concentrations of tissue factor pathway inhibitor do not inhibit prothrombinase.Blood. 1996; 87: 1845-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the positively charged C-terminal tail of TFPIα (TFPIα-BR) is homologous to FV-BR and mediates binding to AR2 (18Wood J.P. Bunce M.W. Maroney S.A. Tracy P.B. Camire R.M. Mast A.E. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-alpha inhibits prothrombinase during the initiation of blood coagulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(Landmark Ed.). 2012; 17: 262-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived FV, which is proteolyzed in the B-domain and secreted from α-granules, and plasma FV, partially cleaved by FXa or thrombin, represent potential physiologic forms that may be regulated by TFPIα (18Wood J.P. Bunce M.W. Maroney S.A. Tracy P.B. Camire R.M. Mast A.E. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-alpha inhibits prothrombinase during the initiation of blood coagulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biology of tissue factor pathway inhibitor.Blood. 2014; 123: 2934-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These forms of FV lack the BR yet retain AR2 (herein referred to as FVAR2) and are likely present during the initiation phase of coagulation. Thus, in addition to inhibiting FXa and FVIIa-tissue factor (TF) (22Mast A.E. Alternatively spliced tissue factor pathway inhibitor: Functional implications.Front. Biosci.(Schol. Ed.). 2011; 3: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TFPIα may also contribute to regulating thrombin generation at the level of prothrombinase (18Wood J.P. Bunce M.W. Maroney S.A. Tracy P.B. Camire R.M. Mast A.E. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-alpha inhibits prothrombinase during the initiation of blood coagulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rethinking events in the haemostatic process: Role of factor V and TFPI.Haemophilia. 2016; 22 Suppl 5: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additional connections between FV and TFPIα have been made with potentially important implications. Duckers et al. (24Duckers C. Simioni P. Spiezia L. Radu C. Gavasso S. Rosing J. Castoldi E. Low plasma levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor in patients with congenital factor V deficiency.Blood. 2008; 112: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) found that the variable and milder than expected bleeding phenotype associated with FV deficiency is likely related to low levels of TFPIα found in FV-deficient plasma. In that study, plasma concentrations of FV and TFPIα were found to correlate and immunoadsorption of FV from plasma-depleted TFPIα suggesting they form a complex. Consistent with this, FV and TFPIα interact using ligand blot methods, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies found that plasma-derived FV (PD-FV) bound immobilized TFPIα with an estimated affinity of 13 nM (24Duckers C. Simioni P. Spiezia L. Radu C. Gavasso S. Rosing J. Castoldi E.

Haemost. 2012; 10: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that PD-FV enhances TFPIα-mediated inhibition of membrane-bound FXa (19Mast A.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Physiological concentrations of tissue factor pathway inhibitor do not inhibit prothrombinase.Blood. 1996; 87: 1845-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Peraramelli S. Thomassen S.

Haemost. 2016; 115: 580-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, this effect was not seen with recombinant FV (rFV) (27Santamaria S. Reglinska-Matveyev N. Gierula M. Camire R.M. Crawley J.T.B. Lane D.A. Ahnstrom J. Factor V has an anticoagulant cofactor activity that targets the early phase of coagulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 9335-9344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Lastly, TFPIα via its BR impedes FV activation by thrombin or FXa by delaying cleavage at Arg1545 (28van Doorn P. Rosing J. Wielders S.J. Hackeng T.M. Castoldi E. The C-terminus of tissue factor pathway inhibitor-alpha inhibits factor V activation by protecting the Arg(1545) cleavage site.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2017; 15: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There is also some evidence that FVa interacts with TFPIα as it enhances TFPIα inhibition of membrane-bound FXa (19Mast A.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Physiological concentrations of tissue factor pathway inhibitor do not inhibit prothrombinase.Blood. 1996; 87: 1845-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Huang Z.F. Wun T.C.

TFPIalpha interacts with FVa and FXa to inhibit prothrombinase during the initiation of coagulation.Blood Adv. 2017; 1: 2692-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A fascinating advance in the TFPIα-FV axis came from the identification of a splicing isoform of FV (31Dahlback B. Novel insights into the regulation of coagulation by factor V isoforms, tissue factor pathway inhibitoralpha, and protein S.J. Thromb. Haemost. 2017; 15: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recognized in a family with a moderately severe bleeding disorder (East Texas bleeding disorder), the mutation in the F5 gene (A2440G; S756G) activates a weak splice site in exon 13 resulting in an abundant, alternatively spliced transcript (32Kuang S.Q. Hasham S. Phillips M.D. Wolf D. Wan Y. Thiagarajan P. Milewicz D.M.

Invest. 2013; 123: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It encodes for a new FV isoform called FV-short, which lacks 702 amino acids (Δ756–1458) in the B-domain including the BR but retains AR2 (Fig. 1A). Family members with the mutation have high plasma levels of FV-short (∼2–5 nM) and remarkably have elevated TFPIα (tenfold) (33Vincent L.M. Tran S. Livaja R. Bensend T.A. Milewicz D.M. Dahlback B. Coagulation factor V(A2440G) causes east Texas bleeding disorder via TFPIalpha.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was shown that FV-short and TFPIα form a complex in plasma, likely via the exposed AR2 on FV-short (33Vincent L.M. Tran S. Livaja R. Bensend T.A. Milewicz D.M. Dahlback B. Coagulation factor V(A2440G) causes east Texas bleeding disorder via TFPIalpha.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The increase in plasma TFPIα is thought to contribute to the bleeding phenotype and likely results from a change in the way TFPIα is cleared from the circulation when bound to FV-short (34Dahlback B. Pro- and anticoagulant properties of factor V in pathogenesis of thrombosis and bleeding disorders.Int. J. Lab. Hematol. 2016; 38 Suppl 1: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At least two other genetic changes in exon 13 from different families have been identified that enhance splicing and produce a FV-short protein with parallel increases in TFPIα (35Cunha M.L. Bakhtiari K. Peter J. Marquart J.A. Meijers J.C. Middeldorp S.

Importantly, in normal controls splicing occurs within exon 13 at a low level, as FV-short is present in normal plasma at subnanomolar concentration (33Vincent L.M. Tran S. Livaja R. Bensend T.A. Milewicz D.M. Dahlback B. Coagulation factor V(A2440G) causes east Texas bleeding disorder via TFPIalpha.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The importance of FV-short on normal hemostasis is not known, but a recent report found it enhances the TFPIα-cofactor activity of protein S with respect to FXa inhibition (37Dahlback B. Guo L.J. Livaja-Koshiar R. Tran S. Factor V-short and protein S as synergistic tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPIalpha) cofactors.Res. Pract. Thromb. Haemost. 2018; 2: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, there are inconsistencies making it unclear which forms of FV are true physiologic ligands for TFPIα. This is an important question to answer as it has a bearing on understanding key regulatory points in coagulation impacted by FV/TFPIα. This information could guide potential strategies targeting this molecular interaction for therapeutic benefit. Additionally, despite its potential significance in the coagulation system, FV-short and its binding to TFPIα have yet to undergo biochemical characterization. Here, we assess the binding and regulation of FV and FV-short by TFPIα and examine how cleavage in the B-domain influences these interactions. Our findings show that FV and FVa are not physiologic ligands for TFPIα. Rather, TFPIα binds and regulates forms of FV that lack the internal BR such as FV cleaved at Arg709/Arg1018 and FV-short. The studies provide new mechanistic insight into the regulation of coagulation and uncover the necessary transformation that FV must undergo to interact with TFPIα. A schematic representation of FV species used is shown in Figure 1A. FV was purified from the plasma while other FV species were expressed and purified in milligram quantities. Due to its robust expression compared with rFV, a FV derivative with a shortened B-domain, FV-1033 (Δ1034–1491), and a variant FV-1033-RQR (Arg1018 changed to Gln) were prepared. FV-short and mutants with Gln at one or both thrombin cleavage sites (Arg709 and/or Arg1545; FV-short-RQ, FV-short-QR, and FV-short-QQ) were also purified. The mutations render those cleavage sites uncleavable. Proteins migrated at the expected position on reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Thrombin cleavage of PD-FV, FV-1033, FV-1033-RQR, and FV-short yielded the expected HC and LC similar to FVa. FV-short-RQ and FV-short-QR were proteolytically processed only at Arg709 and Arg1545, respectively, while FV-short-QQ was not cleaved by thrombin (Fig. 1B). Using a prothrombin time (PT)-based clotting assay, we found that FV-short and FV-short mutants exhibit specific activities similar to FVa (Table 1). Precleavage of FV-short-RQ at Arg709 with thrombin (FV-short-RQ∗) or FV-short-QR at Arg1545 with RVV-V (FV-short-QR∗) prior to addition into the clotting assay did not alter their activity. Further, FV-short, FV-short-QQ, and FVa exhibited similar thrombin generation profiles in a thrombin generation assay (TGA; Fig. 2A). As expected, the procofactors, PD-FV and FV-1033, have low specific activities in the clotting assay, which was similar to the FV activity contained in pooled normal plasma (PNP)† ††FV activity in normal plasma is 1 Unit/ml = 50 Units/nmol.† (Table 1). Using a purified component assay, the kinetic constants for prothrombin activation using FV-short, FV-short-QQ, and cleaved FV-short mutants were similar to FVa (Fig. 2B and Table 2). Together, these data show that FV-short is constitutively active like FVa and does not require cleavage at Arg709 or Arg1545 to express any further activity making it distinct from FV.Table 1Specific activity of FV speciesFV speciesSpecific activity (Units/nmol)Buffer+ TFPIα-BR+ FV-BRFVa325.3 ± 59.2336.8 ± 32.5342.3 ± 38.1FV-short282.7 ± 23.853.6 ± 7.172.1 ± 10.3FV-short-QQ324.2 ± 28.958.3 ± 10.876.0 ± 9.4FV-short-RQ289.9 ± 29.856.3 ± 8.199.2 ± 16.1FV-short-QR289.3 ± 22.171.4 ± 5.987.7 ± 11.0FV-short-RQ∗285.2 ± 15.083.0 ± 19.9135.9 ±14.9FV-short-QR∗316.6 ± 41.6291.2 ± 28.8287.1 ± 52.3PNP55.9 ± 4.35.0 ± 0.79.2 ± 1.3PD-FV79.0 ± 6.46.7 ± 1.011.8 ± 3.8FV-103338.1 ± 4.115.1 ± 3.221.2 ± 3.9FV-1033-RQR8.8 ± 0.91.9 ± 0.42.7 ± 0.2The specific activity of FV species was determined using a PT-based clotting assay in FV-DP as described in “Experimental procedures.” The concentration of FV in PNP was assumed to be 20 nM, and the theoretical specific activity was calculated to be 50 U/nmol.

FV-short is structurally distinct from FVa as a small region of the B-domain remains between the HC and LC, which includes AR2 (Fig. 1A). We first used clotting assays and TGA to examine the impact of TFPIα-BR on FV-short function in plasma. Since full-length TFPIα has multiple modes of inhibition in the plasma, we first used a recombinant TFPIα-BR fragment to simplify data interpretation. TFPIα-BR had no effect on the specific activity of FVa in a clotting assay (Table 1). In contrast, the specific activities of FV-short and uncleaved mutants were decreased in the presence of TFPIα-BR. Prior cleavage of FV-short at Arg709 (FV-short-RQ∗) had only a weak effect on the ability of TFPIα-BR to inhibit FV-short cofactor function. However, TFPIα-BR had no effect on cofactor function if FV-short was precleaved at Arg1545 (FV-short-QR∗). Similar results were obtained using the homologous FV-BR fragment (Table 1). These data show that TFPIα-BR regulates FV-short function but only if AR2 is attached to the LC. The TGA was used to gain additional insight into how TFPIα-BR impacts FV-short function. Consistent with the clotting assay, FVa was unaffected by TFPIα-BR (Fig. 3, A and B). FV-short was quite sensitive to TFPIα-BR inhibition (Fig. 3, C and D) using a TF trigger of 0.4 pM; however, TFPIα-BR had a more prominent inhibitory effect on FV-short-QQ (Fig. 3, E and F). We speculate that FV-short is less sensitive to TFPIα-BR compared with the QQ mutant because once coagulation is initiated, thrombin or FXa produced in the assay cleaves FV-short removing its B-domain, thereby relieving inhibition by TFPIα-BR. This relief of inhibition is related to cleavage at Arg1545, as FV-short precleaved at Arg1545 (FV-short-QR∗) was insensitive to TFPIα-BR while precleavage at Arg709 (FV-short-RQ∗) maintained inhibition (Fig. 3G). Further, if strong initiator conditions were used (TF, 5 pM), FV-short was less sensitive to TFPIα-BR compared with the results using a weaker initiator (FXa, 200 pM) (Fig. 3H). We speculate that TGA conditions, which promote robust thrombin generation, result in more rapid feedback proteolysis of FV-short at Arg709 and Arg1545, which eliminates binding to the C-terminal end of TFPIα. We next assessed the sensitivity of FV-short cofactors to full-length TFPIα or TFPIα-BR in a prothrombin activation assay. In this assay, the FXa inhibitory activity of TFPIα was blocked with an anti-Kunitz domain 2 (K2) antibody. FV-short or FV-short-QQ was strongly inhibited by TFPIα-BR with a Ki of ∼25 nM while FVa and FV-short-QR∗ were not (Fig. 4A, Table 2). Interestingly, FV-short-RQ∗ had a threefold reduced sensitivity toward TFPIα-BR (Table 2). Using full-length TFPIα, similar trends in the data were seen except the inhibition constants were lower (Fig. 4B and Table 2). Like TFPIα-BR, full-length TFPIα did not inhibit prothrombinase when using FVa as the cofactor. We speculate the difference in inhibitory potential for TFPIα-BR and full-length TFPIα could relate to some TFPIα not being fully inhibited by the anti-K2 antibody and/or to steric/structural differences between the two proteins, which impact inhibition of thrombin generation. Prior work found that TFPIα and FV interact and form a complex in plasma (24Duckers C. Simioni P. Spiezia L. Radu C. Gavasso S. Rosing J. Castoldi E.

The CRC-AIM microsimulation model was used to estimate the impact of imperfect adherence on the relative benefits and burdens of guideline-endorsed, stool-based screening strategies. Methods Predicted outcomes of multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA), fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), and high-sensitivity guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (HSgFOBT) were simulated for 40-year-olds free of diagnosed CRC. For robustness, imperfect adherence was incorporated in multiple ways and with extensive sensitivity analysis. Analysis 1 assumed adherence from 0%-100%, in 10% increments. Analysis 2 longitudinally applied real-world first-round differential adherence rates (base-case imperfect rates = 40% annual FIT vs 34% annual HSgFOBT vs 70% triennial mt-sDNA). Analysis 3 randomly assigned individuals to receive 1, 5, or 9 lifetime (9 = 100% adherence) mt-sDNA tests and 1, 5, or 9 to 26 (26 = 100% adherence) FIT tests. Outcomes are reported per 1000 individuals compared with no screening. Results Each screening strategy decreased CRC incidence and mortality versus no screening. In individuals screened between ages 50–75 and adherence ranging from 10%a-100%, the life-years gained (LYG) for triennial mt-sDNA ranged from 133.1–300.0, for annual FIT from 96.3–318.1, and for annual HSgFOBT from 99.8–320.6. At base-case imperfect adherence rates, mt-sDNA resulted in 19.1% more LYG versus FIT, 25.4% more LYG versus HSgFOBT, and generally had preferable efficiency ratios while offering the most LYG. Completion of at least 21 FIT tests is needed to reach approximately the same LYG achieved with 9 mt-sDNA tests. Conclusions Adherence assumptions affect the conclusions of CRC screening microsimulations that are used to inform CRC screening guidelines. LYG from FIT and HSgFOBT are more sensitive to changes in adherence assumptions than mt-sDNA because they require more tests be completed for equivalent benefit. At imperfect adherence rates, mt-sDNA provides more LYG than FIT or HSgFOBT at an acceptable tradeoff in screening burden."
https://openalex.org/W3117871417,"Determination of what is the specificity of subunits composing a protein complex is essential when studying gene variants on human pathophysiology. The pore-forming α-subunit KCNQ1, which belongs to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily, associates to its β-auxiliary subunit KCNE1 to generate the slow cardiac potassium IKs current, whose dysfunction leads to cardiac arrhythmia. Using pharmacology, gene invalidation, and single-molecule fluorescence assays, we found that KCNE1 fulfils all criteria of a bona fide auxiliary subunit of the TMEM16A chloride channel, which belongs to the anoctamin superfamily. Strikingly, assembly with KCNE1 switches TMEM16A from a calcium-dependent to a voltage-dependent ion channel. Importantly, clinically relevant inherited mutations within the TMEM16A-regulating domain of KCNE1 abolish the TMEM16A modulation, suggesting that the TMEM16A-KCNE1 current may contribute to inherited pathologies. Altogether, these findings challenge the dogma of the specificity of auxiliary subunits regarding protein complexes and questions ion channel classification."
https://openalex.org/W3115099558,"Background Carboplatin is a potent cytoreductive agent for a variety of solid tumors. However, when delivered systemically, clinical efficacy for the treatment of high grade gliomas is poor due to limited penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Direct intracerebral (IC) convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of carboplatin has been used to bypass the BBB and successfully treat the F98 rat glioma. Based on these studies, we initiated a Phase I clinical trial. Objective This Phase I clinical trial was conducted to establish the maximum tolerated dose and define the toxicity profile of carboplatin delivered intracerebrally via convection enhanced delivery (CED) for patients with high grade glial neoplasms. Methods Cohorts of 3 patients with recurrent WHO grade III or IV gliomas were treated with escalating doses of CED carboplatin (1–4 μg in 54mL over 72 hours) delivered via catheters placed at the time of recurrent tumor resection. The primary outcome measure was determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and radiographic correlation. Results A total of 10 patients have completed treatment with infusion doses of carboplatin of 1μg, 2μg, and 4μg. The total planned volume of infusion was 54mL for each patient. All patients had previously received surgery and chemoradiation. Histology at treatment include GBM (n = 9) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (n = 1). Median KPS was 90 (range, 70 to 100) at time of treatment. Median PFS and OS were 2.1 and 9.6 months after completion of CED, respectively. A single adverse event possibly related to treatment was noted (generalized seizure). Conclusions IC CED of carboplatin as a potential therapy for recurrent malignant glioma is feasible and safe at doses up to 4μg in 54mL over 72 hours. Further studies are needed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and potential efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3116767662,"Sixteen specimens of the Early Triassic cynodont Galesaurus planiceps (including eight that were scanned using micro-computed tomography) representing different ontogenetic stages were assembled to study the dental replacement in the species. The growth series shows that the incisors and postcanines continue to develop and replace, even in the largest (presumably oldest) specimen. In contrast, replacement of the canines ceased with the attainment of skeletal maturity, at a basal skull length of ~90 mm, suggesting that Galesaurus had a finite number of canine replacement cycles. Additionally, the functional canine root morphology of these larger specimens showed a tendency to be open-rooted, a condition not previously reported in Mesozoic theriodonts. An alternating pattern of tooth replacement was documented in the maxillary and mandibular postcanine series. Both postcanine series increased in tooth number as the skull lengthened, with the mandibular postcanine series containing more teeth than the maxillary series. In the maxilla, the first postcanine is consistently the smallest tooth, showing a proportional reduction in size as skull length increased. The longer retention of a tooth in this first locus is a key difference between Galesaurus and Thrinaxodon , in which the mesial-most postcanines are lost after replacement. This difference has contributed to the lengthening of the postcanine series in Galesaurus , as teeth continued to be added to the distal end of the tooth row through ontogeny. Overall, there are considerable differences between Galesaurus and Thrinaxodon relating to the replacement and development of their teeth."

This paper proposes a localization framework, which integrates a region-based convolutional network and a fully convolutional network, to locate specific anatomical points on skulls of rodents. Experiment results show that the proposed localization framework is capable of identifying and locatin bregma and lambda in rodent skull anatomy images with mean errors less than 300 μm . This method is robust to different lighting conditions and mouse orientations, and has the potential to simplify the procedure of locating injection sites."
https://openalex.org/W3116186103,"Species distribution monitoring and biomass assessment are crucial for fishery management and resource conservation. However, traditional methods such as motor trawling are costly and less effective than the novel environmental DNA (eDNA) approach. This study employs eDNA approach to investigate horizontal and vertical distributions of small yellow croaker ( Larimichthys polyactis ), an economically important species, in the East China Sea. The analysis of 171 eDNA samples collected from 44 stations using the species-specific primers and Taqman probe suggests a presence of small yellow croaker at 28 sampling layers in 44 stations. Significant differences in croaker eDNA concentrations were revealed among sampling stations and layers, consistent with previous findings through motor-trawl capture offshore and nearshore ichthyoplakton surveys, indicating small yellow croaker exhibits strong regional distribution and layer preference. In addition, we found a high eDNA concentration of small yellow croaker in the surface waters beyond the motor-trawl prohibition line, which confirms spawning grounds have been expanded from nearshore to offshore areas. Such expansion of spawning grounds could be a response by small yellow croaker to stressors such as overfishing, climate change, and nearshore environment contamination. To identify environmental variables potentially associated with small yellow croaker presence and absence, we conducted a correlation analysis between eDNA concentration and environmental variables, and the results provide a guideline for further investigation of fishery resources in the future. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the power of the eDNA approach in monitoring small yellow croaker at extensive geographic scales. The developed protocols and the findings are expected to assist in long-term monitoring and protection programs and benefit sustainable fishery in small yellow croaker."
https://openalex.org/W3116480803,"Somatic embryogenesis (SE), which is in vitro regeneration of plant bodies from somatic cells, represents a useful means of clonal propagation and genetic engineering of forest trees. While protocols to obtain calluses and induce regeneration in somatic embryos have been reported for many tree species, the knowledge of molecular mechanisms of SE development is still insufficient to achieve an efficient supply of somatic embryos required for the industrial application. Cryptomeria japonica , a conifer species widely used for plantation forestry in Japan, is one of the tree species waiting for a secure SE protocol; the probability of normal embryo development appears to depend on genotype. To discriminate the embryogenic potential of embryonal masses (EMs) and efficiently obtain normal somatic embryos of C . japonica , we investigated the effects of genotype and transcriptome on the variation in embryogenic potential. Using an induction experiment with 12 EMs each from six genotypes, we showed that embryogenic potential differs between/within genotypes. Comparisons of gene expression profiles among EMs with different embryogenic potentials revealed that 742 differently expressed genes were mainly associated with pattern forming and metabolism. Thus, we suggest that not only genotype but also gene expression profiles can determine success in SE development. Consistent with previous findings for other conifer species, genes encoding leafy cotyledon, wuschel, germin-like proteins, and glutathione-S-transferases are likely to be involved in SE development in C . japonica and indeed highly expressed in EMs with high-embryogenic potential; therefore, these proteins represent candidate markers for distinguishing embryogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W3116585449,"Worldwide, Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB) remains a big problem; the diagnostic capacity has superseded the clinical management capacity thereby causing ethical challenges. In Sub-Saharan Africa, treatment is either inadequate or lacking and some diagnosed patients are on treatment waiting lists. In Uganda, various health system challenges impeded scale-up of DR-TB care in 2012; only three treatment initiation facilities existed, with only 41 of the estimated 1010 RR-TB/MDR-TB cases enrolled on treatment yet 300 were on the waiting list and there was no DR-TB treatment scale-up plan. To scale up care, the National TB and leprosy Program (NTLP) with partners rolled out a DR-TB mixed model of care. In this paper, we share achievements and outcomes resulting from the implementation of this mixed Model of DR-TB care. Routine NTLP DR-TB program data on treatment initiation site, number of patients enrolled, their demographic characteristics, patient category, disease classification (based on disease site and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status), on co-trimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) statuses, culture results, smear results and treatment outcomes (6, 12, and 24 months) from 2012 to 2017 RR-TB/MDR-TB cohorts were collected from all the 15 DR-TB treatment initiation sites and descriptive analysis was done using STATA version 14.2. We presented outcomes as the number of patient backlog cleared, DR-TB initiation sites, RR-TB/DR-TB cumulative patients enrolled, percentage of co-infected patients on the six, twelve interim and 24 months treatment outcomes as per the Uganda NTLP 2016 Programmatic Management of drug-resistant Tuberculosis (PMDT) guidelines (NTLP, 2016). Over the period 2013–2015, the RR-TB/MDR-TB Treatment success rate (TSR) was sustained between 70.1% and 74.1%, a performance that is well above the global TSR average rate of 50%. Additionally, the cure rate increased from 48.8% to 66.8% (P = 0.03). The Uganda DR-TB mixed model of care coupled with early application of continuous improvement approaches, enhanced cohort reviews and use of multi-disciplinary teams allowed for rapid DR-TB program expansion, rapid clearance of patient backlog, attainment of high cumulative enrollment and high treatment success rates. Sustainability of these achievements is needed to further reduce the DR-TB burden in the country. We highly recommend this mixed model of care in settings with similar challenges."

Objectives Our aim is to compare and analyze the efficacy and safety profile of four biological agents (etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab and secukinumab) in a real-world setting in Taiwan. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of all patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥ 10) who received etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab or secukinumab between January 2011 and December 2018 in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan. Results A total of 119 treatment episodes in 75 patients were included in this study. Ustekinumab was used in 49 treatment episodes, followed by secukinumab in 46 treatment episodes, adalimumab in 14 treatment episodes and etanercept in 10 treatment episodes. The proportion of the biologic-naïve was highest in etanercept (100%) and lowest in secukinumab (23.9%). The PASI-75, -90 and -100 were the highest in secukinumab (91.3%, 82.6%, 41.3%, respectively), followed by ustekinumab (79.6%, 44.9%, 16.3%), adalimumab (64.3%, 28.6%, 7.1%) and etanercept (50.0%, 30.0%, 0%). The rate of adverse events that required treatment was highest for secukinumab (15.2%), followed by adalimumab (14.3%), ustekinumab (8.2%), and etanercept (0%), including 4 cases of infections, 2 cases of cardiovascular diseases and 4 cases of cancers.

https://openalex.org/W3113768752,"Background Catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) is frequently used as an indicator of financial protection. CHE exists when health expenditure exceeds a certain threshold of household consumption. Although CHE is reported to have declined in Kenya, it is still unacceptably high and disproportionately affects the poor. This study examines the socioeconomic factors that contribute to inequalities in CHE as well as the change in these inequalities over time in Kenya. Methods We used data from the Kenya household health expenditure and utilisation (KHHEUS) surveys in 2007 and 2013. The concertation index was used to measure the socioeconomic inequalities in CHE. Using the Wagstaff (2003) approach, we decomposed the concentration index of CHE to assess the relative contribution of its determinants. We applied Oaxaca-type decomposition to assess the change in CHE inequalities over time and the factors that explain it. Results The findings show that while there was a decline in the incidence of CHE, inequalities in CHE increased from -0.271 to -0.376 and was disproportionately concentrated amongst the less well-off. Higher wealth quintiles and employed household heads positively contributed to the inequalities in CHE, suggesting that they disadvantaged the poor. The rise in CHE inequalities overtime was explained mainly by the changes in the elasticities of the household wealth status. Conclusion Inequalities in CHE are persistent in Kenya and are largely driven by the socioeconomic status of the households. This implies that the existing financial risk protection mechanisms have not been sufficient in cushioning the most vulnerable from the financial burden of healthcare payments. Understanding the factors that sustain inequalities in CHE is, therefore, paramount in shaping pro-poor interventions that not only protect the poor from financial hardship but also reduce overall socioeconomic inequalities. This underscores the fundamental need for a multi-sectoral approach to broadly address existing socioeconomic inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W3117528531,"Despite being a priority population in malaria elimination, there is scant literature on malaria-related behavior among gold miners. This study explores the prevalence and factors influencing malaria prevention, care seeking and treatment behaviors in Guyana gold mining camps. A cross sectional survey was conducted among adult gold miners living in mining camps in the hinterland Regions 1 (Barima-Waini), 7 (Cuyuni-Mazaruni), and 8 (Potaro-Siparuni). Multivariable logistic regressions explored factors associated with miners’ self-report of mosquito net use, prompt care-seeking; self-medication; and testing for malaria. A third of miners used a mosquito net the night preceding the survey and net use was higher among those who believed that net use was the norm in their camp (aOR: 3.11; 95% CI:1.65, 5.88). Less than half (45%) of miners had a fever in the past 12 months, among whom 36% sought care promptly, 48% tested positive for malaria while 54% self-medicated before seeking care. Prompt care-seeking was higher among miners with high malaria knowledge (aOR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.05). Similarly, testing rates increased with secondary education (aOR: 1.71; 95% CI: (1.16, 2.51), high malaria knowledge (aOR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.05), positive beliefs regarding malaria transmission, threat, self-diagnosis, testing and treatment, and, trust in government services (aOR: 1.59; 95% CI (1.12, 2.27) and experience of a prior malaria episode (aOR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.71, 4.00). Self-medication was lower among male miners (aOR: 0. 52; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.86). Malaria prevention and care seeking behaviors among miners are somewhat low and influenced by mosquito net usage, perceived norms, malaria knowledge and prior episode of confirmed malaria. Study findings have implications for malaria interventions in the hinterland regions of Guyana such as the mass and continuous distribution of insecticide treated nets as well as community case management initiatives using trained malaria testing and treatment volunteers to curb malaria transmission among remote gold mining populations. These include efforts to identify and address gaps in distributing mosquito nets to miners and address miners’ barriers to prompt care seeking, malaria testing and treatment adherence. Targeted social and behavior change messaging is needed on net acquisition, use and care, prompt care-seeking, malaria testing and treatment adherence. Additional efforts to ensure the overall sustainability of the community case management initiative include increased publicity of the community case management initiative among miners, use of incentives to promote retention rates among the community case management volunteer testers and public private partnerships between the Guyana Ministry of Health and relevant mining organizations."

However, no clinical trial has investigated changes in the abdominal fat tissue by 12 weeks after cryolipolysis. Therefore, in this split-body trial, we explored whether a single session of unilateral cryolipolysis could change visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue over a period of 12 weeks. We compared the cross-sectional areas of the abdominal adipose tissue of 15 subjects (9 women; 38.3 [10.8] years) by computed tomography before and at 12 weeks after a single treatment of cryolipolysis to the left abdomen and used the right abdomen as untreated control. In addition, we measured participants’ waist circumference, percentage of body fat (by bioelectrical impedance analysis) at baseline and at 6- and 12-weeks post-treatment. Single unilateral cryolipolysis tended to reduce the cross-sectional areas of visceral adipose tissue, by 8.4 cm 2 (9.9%), the waist circumferences, and the percent body fat, by 2.8 cm 2 (0.6%), overall. The cross-sectional area of visceral adipose tissues on the treated side significantly decreased, by 6.8 cm 2 (15.6%; P = 0.003), and that of the untreated side tended to decrease by 1.2 cm 2 (3.6%). Thus, a single unilateral session of noninvasive selective cryolipolysis can be considered as a safe and effective treatment for reduction of visceral adipose tissue over a period of 12 weeks, which should result in metabolic improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3115067460,"Mitochondrial fission and fusion play an important role not only in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis but also in preserving overall cellular viability. However, quantitative analysis based on the three-dimensional localisation of these highly dynamic mitochondrial events in the cellular context has not yet been accomplished. Moreover, it remains largely uncertain where in the mitochondrial network depolarisation is most likely to occur. We present the mitochondrial event localiser (MEL), a method that allows high-throughput, automated and deterministic localisation and quantification of mitochondrial fission, fusion and depolarisation events in large three-dimensional microscopy time-lapse sequences. In addition, MEL calculates the number of mitochondrial structures as well as their combined and average volume for each image frame in the time-lapse sequence. The mitochondrial event locations can subsequently be visualised by superposition over the fluorescence micrograph z-stack. We apply MEL to both control samples as well as to cells before and after treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). An average of 9.3/7.2/2.3 fusion/fission/depolarisation events per cell were observed respectively for every 10 sec in the control cells. With peroxide treatment, the rate initially shifted toward fusion with and average of 15/6/3 events per cell, before returning to a new equilibrium not far from that of the control cells, with an average of 6.2/6.4/3.4 events per cell. These MEL results indicate that both pre-treatment and control cells maintain a fission/fusion equilibrium, and that depolarisation is higher in the post-treatment cells. When individually validating mitochondrial events detected with MEL, for a representative cell for the control and treated samples, the true-positive events were 47%/49%/14% respectively for fusion/fission/depolarisation events. We conclude that MEL is a viable method of quantitative mitochondrial event analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3116438930,"In this work, the effect of the inoculation of silver-incorporated titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Ag-TiO 2 NPs) in spinach seeds was evaluated on certain growth, physiology and phytotoxicity parameters of the plants. This is an important crop for human consumption with high nutritional value due to their low calorie and fat content, providing various vitamins and minerals, especially iron. These NPs were obtained by means of the sol-gel method and heat treatment; the resulting powder material was characterized using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy and the influence of these NPs on plants was measured by estimating the germination rate, monitoring morphological parameters and evaluating phytotoxicity. The photosynthetic activity of the spinach plants was estimated through the quantification of the Ratio of Oxygen Evolution (ROE) by the photoacoustic technique. Samples of TiO 2 powder with particle size between 9 and 43 nm were used to quantify the germination rate, which served to determine a narrower size range between 7 and 26 nm in the experiments with Ag-TiO 2 NPs; the presence of Ag in TiO 2 powder samples was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The analysis of variance showed that the dependent variable (plant growth) could be affected by the evaluated factors (concentration and size) with significant differences. The statistical trend indicated that the application of the Ag-TiO 2 NPs suspension of lowest concentration and smallest particle size could be a promoting agent of the growth and development of these plants. The inoculation with NPs of 8.3 nm size and lowest concentration was related to the highest average ROE value, 24.6 ± 0.2%, while the control group was 20.2 ± 0.2%. The positive effect of the Ag-TiO 2 NPs treatment could be associated to the generation of reactive oxygen species, antimicrobial activity, increased biochemical attributes, enzymatic activity or improvements in water absorption."
https://openalex.org/W3117750614,"In order to understand and represent the importance of nodes within networks better, most of the studies that investigate graphs compute the nodes’ centrality within their network(s) of interest. In the literature, the most frequent measures used are degree, closeness and/or betweenness centrality, even if other measures might be valid candidates for representing the importance of nodes within networks. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a methodology that allows one to understand, compare and validate centrality indices when studying a particular network of interest. The proposed methodology integrates the following steps: choosing the centrality measures for the network of interest; developing a theoretical taxonomy of these measures; identifying, by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), latent dimensions of centrality within the network of interest; verifying the proposed taxonomy of centrality measures; and identifying the centrality measures that best represent the network of interest. Also, we applied the proposed methodology to an existing graph of interest, in our case a real friendship student network. We chose eighteen centrality measures that were developed in SNA and are available and computed in a specific library (CINNA), defined them thoroughly, and proposed a theoretical taxonomy of these eighteen measures. PCA showed the emergence of six latent dimensions of centrality within the student network and saturation of most of the centrality indices on the same categories as those proposed by the theoretical taxonomy. Additionally, the results suggest that indices other than the ones most frequently applied might be more relevant for research on friendship student networks. Finally, the integrated methodology that we propose can be applied to other centrality indices and/or other network types than student graphs."
https://openalex.org/W3114676136,"During racing, injury is more likely to occur on a bend than on a straight segment of track. This study aimed to quantify the effects of galloping at training speeds on large radius curves on stride parameters and limb lean angle in order to assess estimated consequences for limb loading. Seven Thoroughbred horses were equipped with a sacrum-mounted inertial measurement unit with an integrated GPS, two hoof-mounted accelerometers and retro-reflective markers on the forelimbs. Horses galloped 2–4 circuits anticlockwise around an oval track and were filmed at 120 frames per second using an array of ten cameras. Speed and curve radius were derived from GPS data and used to estimate the centripetal acceleration necessary to navigate the curve. Stride, stance and swing durations and duty factor (DF) were derived from accelerometer data. Limb markers were tracked and whole limb and third metacarpus (MCIII) angles were calculated. Data were analysed using mixed effects models with a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. For horses galloping on the correct lead, DF was higher for the inside (lead) leg on the straight and on the curve. For horses galloping on the incorrect lead, there was no difference in DF between inside and outside legs on the straight or on the curve. DF decreased by 0.61% of DF with each 1 m s -2 increase in centripetal acceleration (p &lt; 0.001). Whole limb inclination angle increased by 1.5° per 1 m s -1 increase in speed (p = 0.002). Limb lean angles increase as predicted, and lead limb function mirrors the functional requirements for curve running. A more comprehensive understanding of the effects of lean and torque on the distal limb is required to understand injury mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3115087046,"Yeast Eco1 (ESCO2 in humans) acetyltransferase converts chromatin-bound cohesins to a DNA tethering state, thereby establishing sister chromatid cohesion. Eco1 establishes cohesion during DNA replication, after which Eco1 is targeted for degradation by SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. SCF E3 ligase, and sequential phosphorylations that promote Eco1 ubiquitination and degradation, remain active throughout the M phase. In this way, Eco1 protein levels are high during S phase, but remain low throughout the remaining cell cycle. In response to DNA damage during M phase, however, Eco1 activity increases—providing for a new wave of cohesion establishment (termed Damage-Induced Cohesion, or DIC) which is critical for efficient DNA repair. To date, little evidence exists as to the mechanism through which Eco1 activity increases during M phase in response to DNA damage. Possibilities include that either the kinases or E3 ligase, that target Eco1 for degradation, are inhibited in response to DNA damage. Our results reveal instead that the degradation machinery remains fully active during M phase, despite the presence of DNA damage. In testing alternate models through which Eco1 activity increases in response to DNA damage, the results reveal that DNA damage induces new transcription of ECO1 and at a rate that exceeds the rate of Eco1 turnover, providing for rapid accumulation of Eco1 protein. We further show that DNA damage induction of ECO1 transcription is in part regulated by Yap5—a stress-induced transcription factor. Given the role for mutated ESCO2 (homolog of ECO1 ) in human birth defects, this study highlights the complex nature through which mutation of ESCO2 , and defects in ESCO2 regulation, may promote developmental abnormalities and contribute to various diseases including cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3115960039,"Advances in additive manufacturing enable the production of tailored lattice structures and thus, in principle, coronary stents. This study investigates the effects of process-related irregularities, heat and surface treatment on the morphology, mechanical response, and expansion behavior of 316L stainless steel stents produced by laser powder bed fusion and provides a methodological approach for their numerical evaluation. A combined experimental and computational framework is used, based on both actual and computationally reconstructed laser powder bed fused stents. Process-related morphological deviations between the as-designed and actual laser powder bed fused stents were observed, resulting in a diameter increase by a factor of 2-2.6 for the stents without surface treatment and 1.3-2 for the electropolished stent compared to the as-designed stent. Thus, due to the increased geometrically induced stiffness, the laser powder bed fused stents in the as-built (7.11 ± 0.63 N) or the heat treated condition (5.87 ± 0.49 N) showed increased radial forces when compressed between two plates. After electropolishing, the heat treated stents exhibited radial forces (2.38 ± 0.23 N) comparable to conventional metallic stents. The laser powder bed fused stents were further affected by the size effect, resulting in a reduced yield strength by 41% in the as-built and by 59% in the heat treated condition compared to the bulk material obtained from tensile tests. The presented numerical approach was successful in predicting the macroscopic mechanical response of the stents under compression. During deformation, increased stiffness and local stress concentration were observed within the laser powder bed fused stents. Subsequent numerical expansion analysis of the derived stent models within a previously verified numerical model of stent expansion showed that electropolished and heat treated laser powder bed fused stents can exhibit comparable expansion behavior to conventional stents. The findings from this work motivate future experimental/numerical studies to quantify threshold values of critical geometric irregularities, which could be used to establish design guidelines for laser powder bed fused stents/lattice structures."
https://openalex.org/W3118099886,"While death is universal, reactions to death and ways of dealing with the dead body are hugely diverse, and archaeological research reveals numerous ways of dealing with the dead through time and across the world. In this paper, findings are presented which not only demonstrate the power of archaeology to promote and aid discussion around this difficult and challenging topic, but also how our approach resulted in personal growth and professional development impacts for participants. In this interdisciplinary pilot study, archaeological case studies were used in 31 structured workshops with 187 participants from health and social care backgrounds in the UK, to explore their reactions to a diverse range of materials which documented wide and varied approaches to death and the dead. Our study supports the hypothesis that the past is a powerful instigator of conversation around challenging aspects of death, and after death care and practices: 93% of participants agreed with this. That exposure to archaeological case studies and artefacts stimulates multifaceted discourse, some of it difficult, is a theme that also emerges in our data from pre, post and follow-up questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. The material prompted participants to reflect on their biases, expectations and norms around both treatment of the dead, and of bereavement, impacting on their values, attitudes and beliefs. Moreover, 87% of participants believed the workshop would have a personal effect through thinking differently about death and bereavement, and 57% thought it would impact on how they approached death and bereavement in their professional practice. This has huge implications today, where talk of death remains troublesome, and for some, has a near-taboo status–‘taboo’ being a theme evident in some participants’ own words. The findings have an important role to play in facilitating and normalising discussions around dying and bereavement and in equipping professionals in their work with people with advanced illness."
https://openalex.org/W3113911427,"Signal transducers and transcriptional activation 1 (Stat1) is a member of the STATs family, and its role in various biological responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and immune regulation has been extensively studied. We aimed to investigate its role in pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which is currently poorly understood. Experiments using H9C2 cardiomyocytes, Stat1, and IfngR cardiomyocyte-specific knockout mice revealed that Stat1 had a protective effect on cardiac hypertrophy. Using transverse aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice, we analyzed the degree of hypertrophy using echocardiography, pathology, and at the molecular level. Mice lacking Stat1 had more pronounced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis than wild-type TAC mice. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms suggested that Stat1 downregulated the mRNA levels of hypertrophy and fibrosis markers to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy, and promotes mitochondrial fission through the Ucp2/P-Drp1 pathway, enhancing mitochondrial function, and increasing compensatory myocardial ATP production in the compensatory phase for cardiac hypertrophy inhibition. Overall, this comprehensive analysis revealed that Stat1 inhibits cardiac hypertrophy by downregulating hypertrophic and fibrotic marker genes and enhancing the mitochondrial function to enhance cardiomyocyte function through the Ucp2/P-Drp1 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3114762053,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system is an efficient genome editing tool that possesses the outstanding advantages of simplicity and high efficiency. Genome-wide identification and specificity analysis of editing sites is an effective approach for mitigating the risk of off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 and has been applied in several plant species but has not yet been reported in pepper. In present study, we first identified genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 editing sites based on the ‘Zunla-1’ reference genome and then evaluated the specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 editing sites through whole-genome alignment. Results showed that a total of 603,202,314 CRISPR/Cas9 editing sites, including 229,909,837 (~38.11%) NGG-PAM sites and 373,292,477 (~61.89%) NAG-PAM sites, were detectable in the pepper genome, and the systematic characterization of their composition and distribution was performed. Furthermore, 29,623,855 highly specific NGG-PAM sites were identified through whole-genome alignment analysis. There were 26,699,38 (~90.13%) highly specific NGG-PAM sites located in intergenic regions, which was 9.13 times of the number in genic regions, but the average density in genic regions was higher than that in intergenic regions. More importantly, 34,251 (~96.93%) out of 35,336 annotated genes exhibited at least one highly specific NGG-PAM site in their exons, and 90.50% of the annotated genes exhibited at least 4 highly specific NGG- PAM sites, indicating that the set of highly specific CRISPR/Cas9 editing sites identified in this study was widely applicable and conducive to the minimization of the off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 in pepper."
https://openalex.org/W3115091622,"The distribution and further range expansion of non-native blue catfish Ictalurus furcatus in coastal waters throughout the United States Atlantic slope depend, in part, on the salinity tolerance of the fish. However, temperature-mediated sublethal effects of increased salinities on blue catfish biology are not yet known. We assessed the effects of salinity and temperature on growth, body condition, body composition and food consumption of juvenile blue catfish in a controlled laboratory experiment. Temperature and salinity had an interactive effect on blue catfish biology, although most fish survived 112 days in salinities up to 10 psu. At salinities ≤7 psu, mean growth rate, body condition and consumption rates were higher at 22°C than at 12°C. Mean consumption rates declined significantly with increasing salinities, yet, salinities ≤7 psu were conducive to rapid growth and high body condition, with highest growth and body condition at 4 psu. Fish at 10 psu exhibited low consumption rates, slow growth, low body condition and lower proportions of lipids. Habitats with hyperosmotic salinities (&gt;9 psu) likely will not support the full lifecycle of blue catfish, but the fish may use salinities up to 10 psu for foraging, dispersal and even growth. Many oligohaline and mesohaline habitats in U.S. Atlantic slope drainages may thus be vulnerable to establishment of invasive blue catfish, particularly given the increasing temperatures as a result of climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W3116738193,"Background The supplemental screw technique was introduced for salvage of lateral hinge fracture in medial open-wedge high tibial osteotomy (owHTO). The efficacy of its use in protection of lateral hinge fracture and corresponding biomechanical behaviors remained unclear. The current study was aimed to clarify if a supplemental screw can provide better protection to lateral hinge in biomechanical perspective. Materials An in vitro biomechanical test was conducted. Tibial sawbones, commercial owHTO plates and a cannulated screw were utilized for preparing the intact, owHTO, and owHTO with cannulated screw insertion specimens. A “staircase” dynamic load protocol was adopted for axial compressive test with increasing load levels to determine structural strength and durability by using a material testing system, while a motion capture system was applied for determining the dynamic changes in varus angle and posterior slope of the tibia plateau with various specimen preparation conditions. Results Type II lateral hinge fracture were the major failure pattern in all specimens prepared with owHTO. The insertion of a supplemental cannulated screw in medial owHTO specimens reinforced structural stability and durability in dynamic cyclic loading tests: the compressive stiffness increased to 58.9–62.2% of an intact specimen, whereas the owHTO specimens provided only 23.7–29.2% of stiffness of an intact specimen. In view of tibial plateau alignment, the insertion of a supplemental screw improved the structural deficiency caused by owHTO, and reduced the posterior slope increase and excessive varus deformity by 81.8% and 83.2%, respectively. Conclusion The current study revealed that supplemental screw insertion is a simple and effective technique to improve the structural stability and durability in medial owHTO."
https://openalex.org/W3117143676,"Background In addition to the typical motor symptoms, a majority of patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease experience language impairments. Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus robustly reduces motor dysfunction, but its impact on language skills remains ambiguous. Method To elucidate the impact of subthalamic deep brain stimulation on natural language production, we systematically analyzed language samples from fourteen individuals (three female / eleven male, average age 66.43 ± 7.53 years) with Parkinson’s disease in the active (ON) versus inactive (OFF) stimulation condition. Significant ON-OFF differences were considered as stimulation effects. To localize their neuroanatomical origin within the subthalamic nucleus, they were correlated with the volume of tissue activated by therapeutic stimulation. Results Word and clause production speed increased significantly under active stimulation. These enhancements correlated with the volume of tissue activated within the associative part of the subthalamic nucleus, but not with that within the dorsolateral motor part, which again correlated with motor improvement. Language error rates were lower in the ON vs. OFF condition, but did not correlate with electrode localization. No significant changes in further semantic or syntactic language features were detected in the current study. Conclusion The findings point towards a facilitation of executive language functions occurring rather independently from motor improvement. Given the presumed origin of this stimulation effect within the associative part of the subthalamic nucleus, this could be due to co-stimulation of the prefrontal-subthalamic circuit."
https://openalex.org/W3114481212,"Healthcare workers concurrently may be at a higher risk of developing respiratory infections and allergic disease, such as asthma, than the general public. Increased incidence of allergic diseases is thought to be caused, in part, due to occupational exposure to chemicals that induce or augment Th2 immune responses. However, whether exposure to these chemical antimicrobials can influence immune responses to respiratory pathogens is unknown. Here, we use a BALB/c murine model to test if the Th2-promoting antimicrobial chemical triclosan influences immune responses to influenza A virus. Mice were dermally exposed to 2% triclosan for 7 days prior to infection with a sub-lethal dose of mouse adapted PR8 A(H1N1) virus (50 pfu); triclosan exposure continued until 10 days post infection (dpi). Infected mice exposed to triclosan did not show an increase in morbidity or mortality, and viral titers were unchanged. Assessment of T cell responses at 10 dpi showed a decrease in the number of total and activated (CD44 hi ) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at the site of infection (BAL and lung) in triclosan exposed mice compared to controls. Influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed using MHCI and MHCII tetramers, with reduced populations, although not reaching statistical significance at these sites following triclosan exposure. Reductions in the Th1 transcription factor T-bet were seen in both activated and tetramer+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lungs of triclosan exposed infected mice, indicating reduced Th1 polarization and providing a potential mechanism for numerical reduction in T cells. Overall, these results indicate that the immune environment induced by triclosan exposure has the potential to influence the developing immune response to a respiratory viral infection and may have implications for healthcare workers who may be at an increased risk for developing infectious diseases."

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of accessing ANC services by Indigenous women in the CHT and identify factors associated with knowledge of, and attendance at, ANC services. Methods Using a cross-sectional design three Indigenous groups in Khagrachari district, CHT, Bangladesh were surveyed between September 2017 and February 2018. Indigenous women within 36 months of delivery were asked about attending ANC services and the number who attended was used to estimate prevalence. Socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics were used to determine factors associated with knowledge and attendance using multivariable logistic regression techniques adjusted for clustering by village; results are presented as odds ratios (OR), adjusted OR, and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Of 494 indigenous women who met the inclusion criteria in two upazilas, 438 participated (89% response rate) in the study, 75% were aged 16–29 years. Sixty-nine percent were aware of ANC services and the prevalence of attending ANC services was 53% (n = 232, 95%CI 0.48–0.58). Half (52%; n = 121) attended private facilities. Independent factors associated with knowledge about ANC were age ≥30 years (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.1–4.6), monthly household income greater than 20,000 Bangladeshi Taka (OR 3.4, 95%CI 1.4–8.6); knowledge of pregnancy-related complications (OR 3.6, 95%CI 1.6–8.1), knowledge about nearest health facilities (OR 4.3, 95%CI 2.1–8.8); and attending secondary school or above (OR 4.8, 95%CI 2.1–11). Independent factors associated with attending ANC services were having prior knowledge of ANC benefits (OR 7.7, 95%CI 3.6–16), Indigenous women residing in Khagrachhari Sadar subdistrict (OR 6.5, 95%CI 1.7–25); and monthly household income of 20,000 Bangladeshi Taka or above (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.1–7.4). Conclusion Approximately half of Indigenous women from Chittagong Hill Tracts Bangladesh attended ANC services at least once.

Mosquito repellents, especially spatial repellents, have received much attention from industry. We attempted to simulate interactions between mosquitoes and repellents using a machine learning method, the Self-Propelled Particle (SPP) model, which we modified to include attractiveness/repellency effects. We simulated a random walk scenario and scenarios with insecticide susceptible/resistant mosquitoes against repellent alone and against repellent plus attractant (to mimic a human host). Simulation results indicated that without attractant/repellent, mosquitoes would fly anywhere in the cage at random. With attractant, all mosquitoes were attracted to the source of the odor by the end. With repellent, all insecticide-susceptible mosquitoes eventually moved to the corner of the cage farthest from the repellent release point, whereas, a high proportion of highly resistant mosquitoes might reach the attractant release point (the human) earlier in the simulation. At fixed concentration, a high proportion of mosquitoes could be able to reach the host when the relative repellency efficacy (compare to attractant efficacy) was &lt;1, whereas, no mosquitoes reached the host when the relative repellency efficacy was &gt; 1. This result implies that repellent may not be sufficient against highly physiologically insecticide resistant mosquitoes, since very high concentrations of repellent are neither practically feasible nor cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W3117412106,"Background Proteins with low complexity regions (LCRs) have atypical sequence and structural features. Their amino acid composition varies from the expected, determined proteome-wise, and they do not follow the rules of structural folding that prevail in globular regions. One way to characterize these regions is by assessing the repeatability of a sequence, that is, calculating the local propensity of a region to be part of a repeat. Results We combine two local measures of low complexity, repeatability (using the RES algorithm) and fraction of the most frequent amino acid, to evaluate different proteomes, datasets of protein regions with specific features, and individual cases of proteins with extreme compositions. We apply a representation called ‘low complexity triangle’ as a proof-of-concept to represent the low complexity measured values. Results show that proteomes have distinct signatures in the low complexity triangle, and that these signatures are associated to complexity features of the sequences. We developed a web tool called LCT ( http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~munoz/lct/ ) to allow users to calculate the low complexity triangle of a given protein or region of interest. Conclusions The low complexity triangle proves to be a suitable procedure to represent the general low complexity of a sequence or protein dataset. Homorepeats, direpeats, compositionally biased regions and globular regions occupy characteristic positions in the triangle. The described pipeline can be used to characterize LCRs and may help in quantifying the content of degenerated tandem repeats in proteins and proteomes."
https://openalex.org/W3117653313,"Background Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for patients with end stage renal disease. However, it is largely unavailable in many sub-Sahara African countries including Ghana. In Ghana, treatment for end stage renal disease including transplantation, is usually financed out-of-pocket. As efforts continue to be made to expand the kidney transplantation programme in Ghana, it remains unclear whether patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) would be willing to pay for a kidney transplant. Aim The aim of the study was to assess CKD patients’ willingness to pay for kidney transplantation as a treatment option for end stage renal disease in Ghana. Methods A facility based cross-sectional study conducted at the Renal Outpatient clinic and Dialysis Unit of Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital among 342 CKD patients 18 years and above including those receiving haemodialysis. A consecutive sampling approach was used to recruit patients. Structured questionnaires were administered to obtain information on demographic, socio-economic, knowledge about transplant, perception of transplantation and willingness to pay for transplant. In addition, the INSPIRIT questionnaire was used to assess patients’ level of religiosity and spirituality. Contingent valuation method (CVM) method was used to assess willingness to pay (WTP) for kidney transplantation. Logistic regression model was used to determine the significant predictors of WTP. Results The average age of respondents was 50.2 ± 17.1 years with most (56.7% (194/342) being male. Overall, 90 out of the 342 study participants (26.3%, 95%CI: 21.7–31.3%) were willing to pay for a kidney transplant at the current going price (≥ $ 17,550) or more. The median amount participants were willing to pay below the current price was $986 (IQR: $197 –$1972). Among those willing to accept (67.3%, 230/342), 29.1% (67/230) were willing to pay for kidney transplant at the prevailing price. Wealth quintile, social support in terms of number of family friends one could talk to about personal issues and number of family members one can call on for help were the only factors identified to be significantly predictive of willingness to pay (p-value &lt; 0.05). Conclusion The overall willingness to pay for kidney transplant is low among chronic kidney disease patients attending Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Patients with higher socio-economic status and those with more family members one can call on for help were more likely to pay for kidney transplantation. The study’s findings give policy makers an understanding of CKD patients circumstances regarding affordability of the medical management of CKD including kidney transplantation. This can help develop pricing models to attain an ideal poise between a cost effective but sustainable kidney transplant programme and improve patient access to this ultimate treatment option."

https://openalex.org/W3114480812,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) contribute to many physiological and pathological phenomena via the proteolysis of extracellular matrix components. Specific blocking of the active site of each MMP sheds light on its particular role. However, it remains difficult to acquire an active-site inhibitor with high specificity for only the target MMP due to the highly conserved structure around the active site of MMPs. Recently, we reported that potent and specific inhibitors of serine proteases were obtained from our proprietary engineered serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 2 (SPINK2) library. In this research, using this library, we succeeded in obtaining potent and specific MMP-9 inhibitors. The obtained inhibitors bound to the active site of MMP-9 and inhibited MMP-9 with low nanomolar K i values. The inhibitors did not cross-react with other MMPs that we tested. Further analysis using MMP-9 mutants demonstrated that the inhibitors recognize not only the residues around the conserved active site of MMP-9 but also different and unique residues in exosites that are distant from each other. This unique recognition manner, which can be achieved by the large interface provided by engineered SPINK2, may contribute to the generation of specific active-site inhibitors of MMPs."
https://openalex.org/W3114714815,"The state-of-the-art systems for most natural language engineering tasks employ machine learning methods. Despite the improved performances of these systems, there is a lack of established methods for assessing the quality of their predictions. This work introduces a method for explaining the predictions of any sequence-based natural language processing (NLP) task implemented with any model, neural or non-neural. Our method named EXSEQREG introduces the concept of region that links the prediction and features that are potentially important for the model. A region is a list of positions in the input sentence associated with a single prediction. Many NLP tasks are compatible with the proposed explanation method as regions can be formed according to the nature of the task. The method models the prediction probability differences that are induced by careful removal of features used by the model. The output of the method is a list of importance values. Each value signifies the impact of the corresponding feature on the prediction. The proposed method is demonstrated with a neural network based named entity recognition (NER) tagger using Turkish and Finnish datasets. A qualitative analysis of the explanations is presented. The results are validated with a procedure based on the mutual information score of each feature. We show that this method produces reasonable explanations and may be used for i) assessing the degree of the contribution of features regarding a specific prediction of the model, ii) exploring the features that played a significant role for a trained model when analyzed across the corpus."

One protein known to bind to myosin 18Aα is β-Pix, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1 and Cdc42 that has been shown to promote dendritic spine maturation by activating the assembly of actin and myosin filaments in spines. Here, we show that myosin 18A⍺ concentrates in the spines of cerebellar Purkinje neurons via co-assembly with myosin 2 and through an actin binding site in its N-terminal extension. miRNA-mediated knockdown of myosin 18A⍺ results in a significant defect in spine maturation that is rescued by an RNAi-immune version of myosin 18A⍺. Importantly, β-Pix co-localizes with myosin 18A⍺ in spines, and its spine localization is lost upon myosin 18A⍺ knockdown or when its myosin 18A⍺ binding site is deleted. Finally, we show that the spines of myosin 18A⍺ knockdown Purkinje neurons contain significantly less F-actin and myosin 2. Together, these data argue that mixed filaments of myosin 2 and myosin 18A⍺ form a complex with β-Pix in Purkinje neuron spines that promotes spine maturation by enhancing the assembly of actin and myosin filaments downstream of β-Pix's GEF activity."

Methods Retrospective analysis of 389 HIV-patients was conducted. Cardiovascular risk was determined by D:A:D, Framingham and SCORE scales. Patients were divided into risk groups as recommended by EACS 2019, PTN AIDS 2019 and ESC/EAS 2019 Guidelines and hypolipemic treatment was evaluated. Results In total, 389 HIV-positive patients took part in the study, most of whom were men (n = 312, 80.4%), mean age 41.69±10years. Mean lipid levels among all HIV patients: Tch:177.2±36mg/dl, HDL:48.9±18mg/dl, LDL:103.8±31mg/dl, TG:143.3±81mg/dl, AIP:0.45±0.3, non-HDL:129.2±36 mg/dl. Most of the participants (n = 360, 92.5%) were assigned to the high cardiovascular risk group according to ESC/EAS and PTN AIDS guidelines. The achievement of therapeutic LDLs according to ESC/EAS was 10.3% for those at very high cardiovascular risk (8.7% on lipid lowering treatment vs. 16.7% without hypolipemic drugs) and 12.0% (5.8% treated vs. 13.6% untreated) at high cardiovascular risk; according to PTN AIDS,17.2% achievement was noted by the very high-risk group (13% treated vs. 33.3% untreated), and 45.9% for the high-risk group (37.7% treated vs. 48.0% untreated); according to EACS Guidelines, 2.5% achievement in secondary prevention (3.8% treatedvs. 0% untreated) and 24.7% in primary prevention (22.2% treated vs. 26.1% untreated). Mean doses of statins were 8.75mg±6mg (Rosuvastatin) and 22.35±19mg (Atorvastatin). Conclusions The achievement of therapeutic LDLs by all recommendations is unsatisfactory, and generally worse in patients on lipid lowering therapy. Hypolipemic treatment of our HIV patients is based on low doses of statins, even in secondary prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3116731935,"A vocoder is used to simulate cochlear-implant sound processing in normal-hearing listeners. Typically, there is rapid improvement in vocoded speech recognition, but it is unclear if the improvement rate differs across age groups and speech materials. Children (8–10 years) and young adults (18–26 years) were trained and tested over 2 days (4 hours) on recognition of eight-channel noise-vocoded words and sentences, in quiet and in the presence of multi-talker babble at signal-to-noise ratios of 0, +5, and +10 dB. Children achieved poorer performance than adults in all conditions, for both word and sentence recognition. With training, vocoded speech recognition improvement rates were not significantly different between children and adults, suggesting that improvement in learning how to process speech cues degraded via vocoding is absent of developmental differences across these age groups and types of speech materials. Furthermore, this result confirms that the acutely measured age difference in vocoded speech recognition persists after extended training."
https://openalex.org/W3117580383,"Epigenetic mechanisms that alter heritable gene expression and chromatin structure play an essential role in many biological processes, including liver function. Human MOF (males absent on the first) is a histone acetyltransferase that is globally downregulated in human steatohepatitis. However, the function of MOF in the liver remains unclear. Here, we report that MOF plays an essential role in adult liver. Genetic deletion of Mof by Mx1-Cre in the liver leads to acute liver injury, with increase of lipid deposition and fibrosis akin to human steatohepatitis. Surprisingly, hepatocyte-specific Mof deletion had no overt liver abnormality. Using the in vitro coculturing experiment, we show that Mof deletion-induced liver injury requires coordinated changes and reciprocal signaling between hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, which enables feedforward regulation to augment inflammation and apoptotic responses. At the molecular level, Mof deletion induced characteristic changes in metabolic gene programs, which bore noticeable similarity to the molecular signature of human steatohepatitis. Simultaneous deletion of Mof in both hepatocytes and macrophages results in enhanced expression of inflammatory genes and NO signaling in vitro. These changes, in turn, lead to apoptosis of hepatocytes and lipotoxicity. Our work highlights the importance of histone acetyltransferase MOF in maintaining metabolic liver homeostasis and sheds light on the epigenetic dysregulation in liver pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3114756678,"Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors are powerful tools for studying complex signaling in the nervous system, and now both Ca 2+ and voltage sensors are available to study the signaling behavior of entire neural circuits. There is a pressing need for improved sensors, but improving them is challenging because testing them involves a low throughput, labor-intensive processes. Our goal was to create synthetic, excitable cells that can be activated with brief pulses of blue light and serve as a medium throughput platform for screening the next generation of sensors. In this live cell system, blue light activates an adenylyl cyclase enzyme (bPAC) that increases intracellular cAMP (Stierl M et al. 2011). In turn, the cAMP opens a cAMP-gated ion channel. This produces slow, whole-cell Ca 2+ transients and voltage changes. To increase the speed of these transients, we add the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1, the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NAVROSD, and Connexin-43. The result is a highly reproducible, medium-throughput, live cell system that can be used to screen voltage and Ca 2+ sensors."
https://openalex.org/W3115295525,"Caraway ( Carum carvi ) is a widespread and frequently used spice and medicinal plant with a long history of cultivation. However, due to ongoing climatic changes, the cultivation is becoming increasingly risky. To secure caraway cultivation in future, timely breeding efforts to develop adapted material are necessary. Analysis of genetic diversity can accompany this process, for instance, by revealing untapped gene pools. Here, we analyzed 137 accessions using genotyping by sequencing (GBS). Hence, we can report a broad overview of population structure and genetic diversity of caraway. Population structure was determined using a principal coordinate analysis, a Bayesian clustering analysis, phylogenetic trees and a neighbor network based on 13,155 SNPs. Genotypic data indicate a clear separation of accessions into two subpopulations, which correlates with the flowering type (annual vs . biennial). Four winter-annual accessions were closer related to biennial accessions. In an analysis of molecular variance, genetic variation between the two subpopulations was 7.84%. In addition, we estimated the genome size for 35 accessions by flow cytometry. An average genome size of 4.282 pg/2C (± 0.0096 S.E.) was estimated. Therefore, we suggest a significantly smaller genome size than stated in literature."
https://openalex.org/W3115833208,"Objective SPECT/CT with 99m Tc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) is generally used for diagnostic work-up prior to transarterial radioembolization (TARE) to exclude shunts and to provide additional information for treatment stratification and dose calculation. C-arm CT is used for determination of lobular vascular supply and assessment of parenchymal blood volume (PBV). Aim of this study was to correlate MAA-uptake and PBV-maps in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic metastases of the colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Materials and methods 34 patients underwent a PBV C-arm CT immediately followed by 99m Tc-MAA injection and a SPECT/CT acquisition after 1 h uptake. MAA-uptake and PBV-maps were visually assessed and semi-quantitatively analyzed (MAA-tumor/liver-parenchyma = MAA-TBR or PBV in ml/100ml). In case of a poor match, tumors were additionally correlated with post-TARE 90 Y-Bremsstrahlung-SPECT/CT as a reference. Results 102 HCC or CRC metastases were analyzed. HCC presented with significantly higher MAA-TBR (7.6 vs. 3.9, p&lt;0.05) compared to CRC. Tumors showed strong intra- and inter-individual dissimilarities between TBR and PBV with a weak correlations for capsular HCCs (r = 0.45, p&lt;0.05) and no correlation for CRC. The demarcation of lesions was slightly better for both HCC and CRC in PBV-maps compared to MAA-SPECT/CT (exact match: 52%/50%; same intensity/homogeneity: 38%/39%; insufficient 10%/11%). MAA-SPECT/CT revealed a better visual correlation with post-therapeutic 90 Y-Bremsstrahlung-SPECT/CT. Conclusion The acquisition of PBV can improve the detectability of small intrahepatic tumors and correlates with the MAA-Uptake in HCC. The results indicate that 99m Tc-MAA-SPECT/CT remains to be the superior method for the prediction of post-therapeutic 90 Y-particle distribution, especially in CRC. However, intra-procedural PBV acquisition has the potential to become an additional factor for TARE planning, in addition to improving the determination of segment and tumor blood supply, which has been demonstrated previously."
https://openalex.org/W3117302740,"Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations of the gamma passing rates (GPR) with the dose-volumetric parameter changes between the original volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans and the actual deliveries of the VMAT plans (DV errors). We compared the correlations of the TrueBeam STx system to those of a C-series linac. Methods A total of 20 patients with head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer were retrospectively selected for this study. For each patient, two VMAT plans with the TrueBeam STx and Trilogy (C-series linac) systems were generated under similar modulation degrees. Both the global and local GPRs with various gamma criteria (3%/3 mm, 2%/2 mm, 2%/1 mm, 1%/2 mm, and 1%/1 mm) were acquired with the 2D dose distributions measured using the MapCHECK2 detector array. During VMAT deliveries, the linac log files of the multi-leaf collimator positions, gantry angles, and delivered monitor units were acquired. The DV errors were calculated with the 3D dose distributions reconstructed using the log files. Subsequently, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients ( r s ) and the corresponding p values were calculated between the GPRs and the DV errors. Results For the Trilogy system, the r s values with p &lt; 0.05 showed weak correlations between the GPRs and the DV errors ( r s &lt;0.4) whereas for the TrueBeam STx system, moderate or strong correlations were observed ( r s ≥0.4). The DV errors in the V 20Gy of the left parotid gland and those in the mean dose of the right parotid gland showed strong correlations (always with r s &gt; 0.6) with the GPRs with gamma criteria except 3%/3 mm. As the GPRs increased, the DV errors decreased. Conclusion The GPRs showed strong correlations with some of the DV errors for the VMAT plans for H&amp;N cancer with the TrueBeam STx system."
https://openalex.org/W3118145342,"B ackground It is well known that it is more reliable to investigate the effects of several covariates simultaneously rather than one at time. Similarly, it is more informative to model responses simultaneously, as more often than not, the multiple responses from the same subject are correlated. This is particularly true in the analysis of Mozambique survey data from 2009 and 2018. M ethod A multiple response predictive model for testing positive for HIV and having sufficient HIV knowledge is modeled to 2009 and 2018 survey data with the use of Bayes estimates. These data are obtained through a hierarchical data structure. The model allows one to address the change in the response to HIV, as it relates to morbidity and to HIV knowledge in Mozambique in the fight against the disease in the last decade. Results A more affluent resident is more likely to test positive, more likely to be more knowledgeable about the disease. Whereas, individuals practicing the Islam faith are less likely to test positive but also less likely to be knowledgeable about the disease. Education, while still a factor, has declined in its impact on testing positive for HIV or being knowledgeable about HIV. Females are more likely to test positive but more likely to be knowledgeable about the disease than men. The rate of impact of affluence on knowledge has increased in the past decade. Marital status (cohabitating or married) showed no impact on the knowledge of the disease. Age had no impact on knowledge suggesting that the message is getting to resident. Conclusions A joint Bayes modeling of correlated binary (testing positive and knowledge about the disease) responses, while accounting for the hierarchy of the data collection, presents an opportunity to extract the extra variation before allocating the variation on the responses as the due of the covariates. The fight against HIV in Mozambique seems to be succeeding. Some knowledge is common among all ages, and Islam religion has a positive effect. While education still shows an influence on the binary responses, it has declined over the last decade."
https://openalex.org/W3117596618,"Mycobacterium ulcerans is a non-tuberculous environmental mycobacterium responsible for extensive cutaneous and subcutaneous ulcers in mammals, known as Buruli ulcer in humans. M . ulcerans has seldom been detected in the faeces of mammals and has not been detected in human faeces. Nevertheless, the detection and isolation of M . ulcerans in animal faeces does not fit with the current epidemiological schemes for the disease. Here, using an experimental model in which rats were fed with 10 9 colony-forming units of M . ulceran s, we detected M . ulcerans DNA in the faeces of challenged rats for two weeks and along their digestive tract for 10 days. M . ulcerans DNA was further detected in the lymphatic system including in the cervical and axillary lymph nodes and the spleen, but not in any other tissue including healthy and broken skin, 10 days post-challenge. These observations indicate that in some herbivorous mammals, M . ulcerans contamination by the digestive route may precede translocation and limited contamination of the lymphatic tissues without systemic infection. These herbivorous mammals may be sources of M . ulcerans for exposed populations but are unlikely to be reservoirs for the pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W3115380785,"Purpose To examine whether the amplitude of accommodation, the accommodative response, and the accommodative facility is affected and correlated with changes in higher-order aberrations for patients with high myopia surgically treated with small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). Methods 35 highly myopic eyes (myopic spherical equivalent of at least 6 diopters) of 35 patients treated with SMILE were included. Assessments were made before and 3 months after surgery. Donders push-up-method was used to measure the amplitude of accommodation. The accommodative response was assessed using an open-field autorefractor”Grand Seiko WAM-5500” (Grand Seiko Co. Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan) in combination with a Badal optometer and stimuli of accommodation at 0.0, 0.5, 1.25, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 D, respectively. Accommodative facility was measured at 40 cm with ±2,00D flipper lenses. All measurements of accommodation were performed monocularly with the refractive error corrected with soft contact lenses. Results The amplitude of accommodation did not change statistically significantly (mean difference -0.24 D (SD 0.98), 95% CI of mean difference -0.58 D to 0.11 D, paired-sample t (34) = -1.39; P = 0.17). The accommodative responses at 0.0, 0.5, 1.25, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 D did not statistically significantly change either ( F (6,29) = 1.15; P = .36). Finally, the accommodative facility was also unchanged with a mean difference of 1.11 cycles per minute (SD 5.11, 95% CI of mean difference -0.64 to 2.87, paired-sample t (34) = 1.29; P = 0.21). No clinically significant associations between changes in accommodation and higher-order aberrations were found. Conclusions SMILE does not alter the amplitude of accommodation, the accommodative response, nor the accommodative facility for highly myopic patients, and the surgically induced corneal higher-order aberrations do not affect the accommodative function."
