https://openalex.org/W2071311642,"Soft lithography is an alternative to silicon-based micromachining that uses replica molding of nontraditional elastomeric materials to fabricate stamps and microfluidic channels. We describe here an extension to the soft lithography paradigm, multilayer soft lithography, with which devices consisting of multiple layers may be fabricated from soft materials. We used this technique to build active microfluidic systems containing on-off valves, switching valves, and pumps entirely out of elastomer. The softness of these materials allows the device areas to be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude compared with silicon-based devices. The other advantages of soft lithography, such as rapid prototyping, ease of fabrication, and biocompatibility, are retained."

Typical polymeric and lithium niobate modulators operate with halfwave voltages of 5 volts. Sterically modified organic chromophores have been used to reduce the attenuation of electric field poling–induced electro-optic activity caused by strong intermolecular electrostatic interactions. Such modified chromophores, incorporated into polymer hosts, were used to fabricate EO modulators with halfwave voltages of 0.8 volts (at a telecommunications wavelength of 1318 nanometers) and to achieve a halfwave voltage-interaction length product of 2.2 volt-centimeters. Optical push-pull poling and driving were also used to reduce halfwave voltage. This study, together with recent demonstrations of exceptional bandwidths (more than 110 gigahertz) and ease of integration (with very large scale integration semiconductor circuitry and ultra-low-loss passive optical circuitry) demonstrates the potential of polymeric materials for next generation telecommunications, information processing, and radio frequency distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1988395319,"Somatostatin and dopamine are two major neurotransmitter systems that share a number of structural and functional characteristics. Somatostatin receptors and dopamine receptors are colocalized in neuronal subgroups, and somatostatin is involved in modulating dopamine-mediated control of motor activity. However, the molecular basis for such interaction between the two systems is unclear. Here, we show that dopamine receptor D2R and somatostatin receptor SSTR5 interact physically through hetero-oligomerization to create a novel receptor with enhanced functional activity. Our results provide evidence that receptors from different G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein)–coupled receptor families interact through oligomerization. Such direct intramembrane association defines a new level of molecular crosstalk between related G protein–coupled receptor subfamilies."
https://openalex.org/W1975290731,"In our previous study we showed that insulin-like growth factor-I induces a cAMP-response element (CRE) site-containing Bcl-2 promoter through a novel signaling pathway involving mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6/p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase/MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-3/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) (Pugazhenthi, S., Miller, E., Sable, C., Young, P., Heidenreich, K. A., Boxer, L. M., and Reusch, J. E.-B. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 27529–27535). In the present investigation, we define a second pathway contributing to CREB-dependent up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression as a novel anti-apoptotic function of Akt signaling. To examine the role of Akt on Bcl-2 expression, a series of transient transfections using a luciferase reporter gene driven by the promoter region of Bcl-2 containing a CRE were carried out. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, the upstream kinase of Akt, with LY294002 led to a 45% decrease in Bcl-2 promoter activity. The reporter activity was enhanced 2.3-fold by overexpression of active p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase and inhibited 44% by the dominant negative p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Cotransfection with 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK1), which is required for the full activation of Akt, resulted in enhanced luciferase activity. Insulin-like growth factor-I-mediated induction of Bcl-2 promoter activity was decreased significantly (p < 0.01) by the dominant negative forms of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, PDK1, and Akt. These data indicate that regulation of Bcl-2 expression by IGF-I involves a signaling cascade mediated by PI 3-kinase/PDK1/Akt/CREB. Furthermore, we measured the Bcl-2 mRNA in PC12 cells overexpressing Akt by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the TaqManTMfluorogenic probe system. We observed a 2.1-fold increase in Bcl-2 mRNA levels in the Akt cell line compared with control PC12 cells, supporting the observation that enhanced CREB activity by Akt signaling leads to increased Bcl-2 promoter activity and cell survival. In our previous study we showed that insulin-like growth factor-I induces a cAMP-response element (CRE) site-containing Bcl-2 promoter through a novel signaling pathway involving mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6/p38β mitogen-activated protein kinase/MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-3/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) (Pugazhenthi, S., Miller, E., Sable, C., Young, P., Heidenreich, K.

Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by translocation to plasma membrane when the PI 3-kinase-generated 3-phosphoinositides bind to its pleckstrin homology domain (2.Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). For its full activation it needs to be further phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase1 (PDK1)1 at Thr-308 and by PDK2 at Ser-473. The metabolic actions of insulin mediated by Akt include stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and activation of glycogen synthase and the glycolytic enzyme 6-phosphofructose-2-kinase (1.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar).In addition to its metabolic actions, Akt/protein kinase B has been shown to promote cell survival by growth factors against several apoptotic stimuli (3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 4.Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family of proteins consisting of pro-apoptotic Bad, Bik, Bid. Etc. and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are important regulators of mammalian apoptosis (5.Merry D.E. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Bcl-2/Bcl-xL prevents the activation of caspase-9 by Apaf-1 and cytochrome c (6.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bad heterodimerize and neutralize each other's function. The fate of cells exposed to apoptotic signal is determined by the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. One mechanism by which Akt prevents apoptosis is considered to proceed through phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad on Ser-136 (7.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Bad is sequestered by 14-3-3 protein, leading to its down-regulation. It has been also suggested that additional mechanisms might exist for the cell survival-promoting action of Akt (8.Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7002-7009PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).Up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression has been identified as a critical mechanism by which growth factors promote cell survival (10.Singleton J.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27529-27535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The promoter region of Bcl-2 contains a cAMP-response element (CRE) site, and the transcription factor CREB has been identified as a positive regulator of Bcl-2 expression (13.Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27529-27535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14.Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Akt, a target of IGF-I signaling, has been shown to activate CREB (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed possible that Akt activation through PI 3-kinase could mediate regulation of Bcl-2 expression by IGF-I.In our previous studies in PC12 cells, we identified that three post-receptor pathways activated by IGF-I through extracellular-regulated kinase, p38β MAPK, and PI 3-kinase are capable of mediating Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB (13.Pugazhenthi S.

However, in the context of CREB-driven Bcl-2 promoter, activation of the extracellular-regulated kinase pathway has been shown to have a negative regulatory effect through Ets domain transcription factors (14.Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We identified a novel IGF-I-mediated signaling cascade involving MAP kinase kinase 6/p38β MAPK/MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-3/CREB, leading to the induction of Bcl-2 promoter (13.Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27529-27535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, SB203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor blocked IGF-I-induced Bcl-2 promoter activity only partially. Earlier work in our laboratory demonstrated that IGF-I-mediated CREB phosphorylation and activation of CRE site-containing chromogranin A promoter requires PI 3-kinase (16.Pugazhenthi S. Boras T. O'Connor D. Meintzer M.K. Heidenreich K.A. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2829-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In that study, a dominant negative form of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase was able to block IGF-I-mediated induction of a CRE site-containing promoter of chromogranin A, a neuro endocrine-specific gene. Du and Montminy (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that Akt stimulates the phosphorylation and the transcriptional activity of the CREB in HEK 293 cells. These reports clearly raise the possibility that Akt could mediate part of the IGF-I-induced increase in the expression of Bcl-2 at the transcriptional level. The objective of the present study was to examine whether IGF-I mediated signaling through PI 3-kinase and Akt leads to a CREB-dependent increase in Bcl-2 promoter activity.DISCUSSIONGreat insight has been gained over the recent few years regarding the mechanism of neuronal programmed cell death and the ability of growth factors to serve as anti-apoptotic agents. The majority of the data has suggested post-translational modification of the apoptotic machinery (7.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). The importance of PI 3-kinase and Akt for these effects has been reported by a number of groups (3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 4.Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The present study defines an additional critical regulatory function for Akt involving transcriptional regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. We recently reported the induction of Bcl-2 by IGF-I through a novel signaling pathway mediated by MAP kinase kinase 6/p38β MAP kinase/MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-3 (13.Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27529-27535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Now we identify an additional pathway involving Akt for IGF-I-mediated activation of Bcl-2 promoter.Regulation of neuronal survival by growth factors is known to proceed through the PI 3-kinase-mediated signaling (3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Low potassium-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons has been shown to be prevented by synthetic lipid products of PI 3-kinase when added to the culture medium (24.Shimoke K. Yamada M. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Downstream of this kinase, two signaling pathways involving Akt and p70 s6k have been identified. Dudek et al.(3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar) show that dominant negative Akt is able to induce apoptosis in rat cerebellar granular neurons, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 s6 kinase, does not block insulin-mediated promotion of cell survival (3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Expression of a myristoylated Akt, the active form in immortalized rat hippocampal neuronal cells, leads to increased survival against apoptotic signal (25.Eves E.M. Xiong W. Bellacosa A. Kennedy S.G. Tsichlis P.N. Rosner M.R. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).Akt-mediated phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Bad is known to play a critical role in the regulation of metabolic pathways as well as prevention of cell death by insulin and growth factors (7.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that Akt can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level, suggesting a nuclear site of action. Akt increases the expression of GLUT1 in hepatoma cells (26.Barthel A. Okino S.T. Liao J. Nakatani K. Li J. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20281-20286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and leptin in adipocytes (27.Barthel A. Kohn A.D. Luo Y. Roth R.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3559-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interleukin-2-mediated Akt activation in BAF/3 cells results in increased expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, forkhead transcription factor has been identified as a nuclear target for Akt (28.Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 29.Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar). It is known to induce insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 by stimulating its promoter activity. Akt has been shown to phosphorylate forkhead transcription factor at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319, the consensus phosphorylation sites both in vitro and in vivo (29.Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). This covalent modification leads to the nuclear exclusion of forkhead transcription factor, leading to negative regulation of forkhead transcription factor -responsive genes by Akt (28.Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar).Studies have indeed shown that this protein kinase can translocate to nucleus (33.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 34.Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). Akt/protein kinase B is first translocated to the plasma membrane, where it is activated following phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473. Subsequently, Akt can be translocated to the nucleus. Meier et al. have demonstrated by confocal microscopy the nuclear translocation of Akt 20–30 min after mitogenic stimulation (34.Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Significant to our present study, it has been demonstrated that myristoylated Akt, which is membrane-directed, can also undergo partial nuclear localization (35.Ahmed N.N. Franke T.F. Bellacosa A. Datta K. Gonzalez-Portal M.-E. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Akt construct having both myristoylation and palmitoylation signals does not (34.Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The probable explanation for the difference seems to be that they anchor to the plasma membrane with different levels of affinity. We were able to observe increased CREB activity in PC12 cells expressing Akt with a myristoylation signal (Fig.3 C).The transcription factor CREB has also been identified as a target for several signaling pathways mediated by growth factors. Nerve growth factor is known to increase CREB phosphorylation through Ras/MAP kinase kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase/Rsk2 (36.Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor and IGF-I induce CRE site- containing promoters by activating p38 MAPK and MAPKAP-K2/3 (13.Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27529-27535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 37.Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). IGF-I-stimulated CREB phosphorylation in PC12 cells is decreased by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, but not by rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 s6k, suggesting that Akt is likely to be involved in CREB activation (16.Pugazhenthi S. Boras T. O'Connor D. Meintzer M.K. Heidenreich K.A. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2829-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In a recent study, Du and Montminy (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Akt/protein kinase B stimulates the phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133 and promotes the recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). They also showed that Akt-mediated induction of CRE-driven gene expression is blocked by a serine to alanine mutation at position 133 using the Gal4 CREB system. In the present investigation, we further demonstrate the physiological importance of this signaling pathway in the activation of an endogenous CRE site-containing Bcl-2 promoter. When the luciferase reporter construct driven by Bcl-2 promoter was cotransfected with p110, PDK1, and Akt, there was significant stimulation of basal and IGF-I-induced luciferase activity. The dominant negative forms of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, Δp85, and Akt were able to decrease the promoter activity, suggesting that growth factor-mediated signaling through PI 3-kinase/PDK1/Akt could be involved in the induction of Bcl-2 expression. Hence Akt seems to promote cell survival through inactivation of Bad by phosphorylation and up-regulation of Bcl-2 by transcriptional activation. The serine threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B is an important mediator of metabolic as well as survival responses to insulin and growth factors (1.Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by translocation to plasma membrane when the PI 3-kinase-generated 3-phosphoinositides bind to its pleckstrin homology domain (2.Downward J. Curr. Opin.

For its full activation it needs to be further phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase1 (PDK1)1 at Thr-308 and by PDK2 at Ser-473.

Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In addition to its metabolic actions, Akt/protein kinase B has been shown to promote cell survival by growth factors against several apoptotic stimuli (3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J.

The fate of cells exposed to apoptotic signal is determined by the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. One mechanism by which Akt prevents apoptosis is considered to proceed through phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad on Ser-136 (7.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Bad is sequestered by 14-3-3 protein, leading to its down-regulation. It has been also suggested that additional mechanisms might exist for the cell survival-promoting action of Akt (8.Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7002-7009PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression has been identified as a critical mechanism by which growth factors promote cell survival (10.Singleton J.R. Dixit V.M. Feldman E.L. J. Biol.

The promoter region of Bcl-2 contains a cAMP-response element (CRE) site, and the transcription factor CREB has been identified as a positive regulator of Bcl-2 expression (13.Pugazhenthi S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed possible that Akt activation through PI 3-kinase could mediate regulation of Bcl-2 expression by IGF-I. In our previous studies in PC12 cells, we identified that three post-receptor pathways activated by IGF-I through extracellular-regulated kinase, p38β MAPK, and PI 3-kinase are capable of mediating Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB (13.Pugazhenthi S.

However, in the context of CREB-driven Bcl-2 promoter, activation of the extracellular-regulated kinase pathway has been shown to have a negative regulatory effect through Ets domain transcription factors (14.Wilson B.E. Mochon E. Boxer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5546-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We identified a novel IGF-I-mediated signaling cascade involving MAP kinase kinase 6/p38β MAPK/MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-3/CREB, leading to the induction of Bcl-2 promoter (13.Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27529-27535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, SB203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor blocked IGF-I-induced Bcl-2 promoter activity only partially. Earlier work in our laboratory demonstrated that IGF-I-mediated CREB phosphorylation and activation of CRE site-containing chromogranin A promoter requires PI 3-kinase (16.Pugazhenthi S. Boras T. O'Connor D. Meintzer M.K. Heidenreich K.A. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2829-2837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In that study, a dominant negative form of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase was able to block IGF-I-mediated induction of a CRE site-containing promoter of chromogranin A, a neuro endocrine-specific gene. Du and Montminy (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that Akt stimulates the phosphorylation and the transcriptional activity of the CREB in HEK 293 cells. These reports clearly raise the possibility that Akt could mediate part of the IGF-I-induced increase in the expression of Bcl-2 at the transcriptional level. The objective of the present study was to examine whether IGF-I mediated signaling through PI 3-kinase and Akt leads to a CREB-dependent increase in Bcl-2 promoter activity. DISCUSSIONGreat insight has been gained over the recent few years regarding the mechanism of neuronal programmed cell death and the ability of growth factors to serve as anti-apoptotic agents. The majority of the data has suggested post-translational modification of the apoptotic machinery (7.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). The importance of PI 3-kinase and Akt for these effects has been reported by a number of groups (3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The present study defines an additional critical regulatory function for Akt involving transcriptional regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. We recently reported the induction of Bcl-2 by IGF-I through a novel signaling pathway mediated by MAP kinase kinase 6/p38β MAP kinase/MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-3 (13.Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M. Reusch J.E.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27529-27535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Now we identify an additional pathway involving Akt for IGF-I-mediated activation of Bcl-2 promoter.Regulation of neuronal survival by growth factors is known to proceed through the PI 3-kinase-mediated signaling (3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Low potassium-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons has been shown to be prevented by synthetic lipid products of PI 3-kinase when added to the culture medium (24.Shimoke K. Yamada M. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Downstream of this kinase, two signaling pathways involving Akt and p70 s6k have been identified. Dudek et al.(3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar) show that dominant negative Akt is able to induce apoptosis in rat cerebellar granular neurons, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 s6 kinase, does not block insulin-mediated promotion of cell survival (3.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Expression of a myristoylated Akt, the active form in immortalized rat hippocampal neuronal cells, leads to increased survival against apoptotic signal (25.Eves E.M. Xiong W. Bellacosa A. Kennedy S.G. Tsichlis P.N. Rosner M.R. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).Akt-mediated phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins such as glycogen synthase kinase-3 and Bad is known to play a critical role in the regulation of metabolic pathways as well as prevention of cell death by insulin and growth factors (7.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that Akt can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level, suggesting a nuclear site of action. Akt increases the expression of GLUT1 in hepatoma cells (26.Barthel A. Okino S.T. Liao J. Nakatani K. Li J. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20281-20286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and leptin in adipocytes (27.Barthel A. Kohn A.D. Luo Y. Roth R.A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3559-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Interleukin-2-mediated Akt activation in BAF/3 cells results in increased expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, forkhead transcription factor has been identified as a nuclear target for Akt (28.Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.-L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar). It is known to induce insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 by stimulating its promoter activity. Akt has been shown to phosphorylate forkhead transcription factor at Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319, the consensus phosphorylation sites both in vitro and in vivo (29.Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). This covalent modification leads to the nuclear exclusion of forkhead transcription factor, leading to negative regulation of forkhead transcription factor -responsive genes by Akt (28.Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar).Studies have indeed shown that this protein kinase can translocate to nucleus (33.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). Akt/protein kinase B is first translocated to the plasma membrane, where it is activated following phosphorylation on Thr-308 and Ser-473. Subsequently, Akt can be translocated to the nucleus. Meier et al. have demonstrated by confocal microscopy the nuclear translocation of Akt 20–30 min after mitogenic stimulation (34.Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Significant to our present study, it has been demonstrated that myristoylated Akt, which is membrane-directed, can also undergo partial nuclear localization (35.Ahmed N.N. Franke T.F. Bellacosa A. Datta K. Gonzalez-Portal M.-E. Taguchi T. Testa J.R. Tsichlis P.N. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Akt construct having both myristoylation and palmitoylation signals does not (34.Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The probable explanation for the difference seems to be that they anchor to the plasma membrane with different levels of affinity. We were able to observe increased CREB activity in PC12 cells expressing Akt with a myristoylation signal (Fig.3 C).The transcription factor CREB has also been identified as a target for several signaling pathways mediated by growth factors. Nerve growth factor is known to increase CREB phosphorylation through Ras/MAP kinase kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase/Rsk2 (36.Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor and IGF-I induce CRE site- containing promoters by activating p38 MAPK and MAPKAP-K2/3 (13.Pugazhenthi S. Miller E. Sable C. Young P. Heidenreich K.A. Boxer L.M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). IGF-I-stimulated CREB phosphorylation in PC12 cells is decreased by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, but not by rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 s6k, suggesting that Akt is likely to be involved in CREB activation (16.Pugazhenthi S.

In a recent study, Du and Montminy (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Akt/protein kinase B stimulates the phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133 and promotes the recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). They also showed that Akt-mediated induction of CRE-driven gene expression is blocked by a serine to alanine mutation at position 133 using the Gal4 CREB system. In the present investigation, we further demonstrate the physiological importance of this signaling pathway in the activation of an endogenous CRE site-containing Bcl-2 promoter. When the luciferase reporter construct driven by Bcl-2 promoter was cotransfected with p110, PDK1, and Akt, there was significant stimulation of basal and IGF-I-induced luciferase activity. The dominant negative forms of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, Δp85, and Akt were able to decrease the promoter activity, suggesting that growth factor-mediated signaling through PI 3-kinase/PDK1/Akt could be involved in the induction of Bcl-2 expression. Hence Akt seems to promote cell survival through inactivation of Bad by phosphorylation and up-regulation of Bcl-2 by transcriptional activation. Great insight has been gained over the recent few years regarding the mechanism of neuronal programmed cell death and the ability of growth factors to serve as anti-apoptotic agents. The majority of the data has suggested post-translational modification of the apoptotic machinery (7.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

In a recent study, Du and Montminy (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Akt/protein kinase B stimulates the phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133 and promotes the recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein (15.Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). They also showed that Akt-mediated induction of CRE-driven gene expression is blocked by a serine to alanine mutation at position 133 using the Gal4 CREB system. In the present investigation, we further demonstrate the physiological importance of this signaling pathway in the activation of an endogenous CRE site-containing Bcl-2 promoter. When the luciferase reporter construct driven by Bcl-2 promoter was cotransfected with p110, PDK1, and Akt, there was significant stimulation of basal and IGF-I-induced luciferase activity. The dominant negative forms of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, Δp85, and Akt were able to decrease the promoter activity, suggesting that growth factor-mediated signaling through PI 3-kinase/PDK1/Akt could be involved in the induction of Bcl-2 expression. Hence Akt seems to promote cell survival through inactivation of Bad by phosphorylation and up-regulation of Bcl-2 by transcriptional activation.

Individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules were first localized and then extracted from the membrane; the remaining vacancies were imaged again. Anchoring forces between 100 and 200 piconewtons for the different helices were found. Upon extraction, the helices were found to unfold. The force spectra revealed the individuality of the unfolding pathways. Helices G and F as well as helices E and D always unfolded pairwise, whereas helices B and C occasionally unfolded one after the other. Experiments with cleaved loops revealed the origin of the individuality: stabilization of helix B by neighboring helices."
https://openalex.org/W2052736701,"Large (about 5 per mil) millennial-scale benthic foraminiferal carbon isotopic oscillations in the Santa Barbara Basin during the last 60,000 years reflect widespread shoaling of sedimentary methane gradients and increased outgassing from gas hydrate dissociation during interstadials. Furthermore, several large, brief, negative excursions (up to -6 per mil) coinciding with smaller shifts (up to -3 per mil) in depth-stratified planktonic foraminiferal species indicate massive releases of methane from basin sediments. Gas hydrate stability was modulated by intermediate-water temperature changes induced by switches in thermohaline circulation. These oscillations were likely widespread along the California margin and elsewhere, affecting gas hydrate instability and contributing to millennial-scale atmospheric methane oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2065584680,"SOX9 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in chondrogenesis. Aggrecan is one of the major structural components in cartilage; however, the molecular mechanism of aggrecan gene regulation has not yet been fully elucidated. TC6 is a clonal chondrocytic cell line derived from articular cartilage. The purpose of this study was to examine whether SOX9 modulates aggrecan gene expression and to further identify molecules that regulateSox9 expression in TC6 cells. SOX9 overexpression in TC6 cells enhanced by ∼3-fold the transcriptional activity of the AgCAT-8 construct containing 8-kilobase (kb) promoter/first exon/first intron fragments of the aggrecan gene. SOX9 enhancement of aggrecan promoter activity was lost when we deleted a 4.5-kb fragment from the 3′-end of the 8-kb fragment corresponding to the region including the first intron. In TC6 cells, SOX9 enhanced the transcriptional activity of a reporter construct containing the Sry/Sox consensus sequence >10-fold. SOX9 enhancement of aggrecan gene promoter activity and SOX9 transactivation through the Sry/Sox consensus sequence were not observed in osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells (ROS17/2.8), indicating the dependence on the cellular background. Northern blot analysis indicated that TC6 cells constitutively expressSox9 mRNA at relatively low levels. To examine regulation of Sox9 gene expression, we investigated the effects of calciotropic hormones and cytokines. Among these, retinoic acid (RA) specifically enhanced Sox9 mRNA expression in TC6 cells. The basal levels of Sox9 expression and its enhancement by RA were observed similarly at both permissive (33 °C) and nonpermissive (39 °C) temperatures. Furthermore, RA treatment enhanced the transcriptional activity of a reporter construct containing the Sry/Sox consensus sequence in TC6 cells. Moreover, RA treatment also enhanced the transcriptional activity of another reporter construct containing the enhancer region of the type II procollagen gene in TC6 cells. These observations indicate that SOX9 enhances aggrecan promoter activity and that its expression is up-regulated by RA in TC6 cells.

Snopek B. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 744Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This region encodes a 79-amino acid motif that is known as a high mobility group box and is responsible for sequence-specific binding to DNA (2.Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R. Cell. 1992; 69: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 3.Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1500-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Several high mobility group box proteins are known to act as transcription factors (4.Jantzen H.M. Admon A. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Nature. 1990; 344: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and some of the Sox genes have been shown to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner during development. SOX9 is expressed predominantly in cells in mesenchymal condensations during the early development of skeletons in embryos (5.Wright E. Hargrave M.R. Christiansen J. Cooper L. Kun J. Evans T. Gangadharan U. Greenfield A. Koopman P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These SOX9-expressing regions coincide with those where deposition of cartilage matrix takes place, suggesting a role for SOX9 in skeletal formation (6.Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J.

In addition, mutations in human SOX9 have been observed in patients with campomelic dysplasia that is characterized by the presence of skeletal malformation and XY sex reversal (9.Wagner T. Wirth J. Meyer J. Zabel B. Held M. Zimmer J. Pasantes J. Bricarelli F.D. Keutel J. Hustert E. Wolf U. Tommerup N. Schempp W. Scherer G.

In mouse chimeras, SOX9−/− cells are excluded from all cartilaginous tissues during embryonic development and are present in juxtaposed mesenchyme that does not express chondrocyte-specific markers such as procollagen types II, IX, and XI and aggrecan (11.Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that SOX9 plays a key role in chondrogenesis and skeletogenesis. Aggrecan, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, is one of the major structural components in cartilage matrix (12.Muir H. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Mice with a phenotype known as cartilage matrix deficiency (Cmd) have been found to possess an autosomal recessive mutation in the aggrecan gene. These mice exhibit cleft palate and short limbs, tail, and snout, whereas their levels of type II collagen and link protein are normal (13.Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The presence of the mutation in the aggrecan gene in the Cmd mice confirms the critical role of aggrecan in cartilage formation; however, the molecular mechanism of aggrecan gene regulation has not yet been fully elucidated. TC6 cells are derived from articular cartilage of transgenic mice harboring a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T-antigen gene (14.Mataga N. Tamura M. Yanai N. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Obinata M. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TC6 cells express mRNAs of the genes encoding cartilage phenotype-related proteins such as type II procollagen, link protein, and aggrecan. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of SOX9 on the aggrecan gene promoter/enhancer and regulation of Sox9 gene expression in TC6 cells. We found that SOX9 enhances the promoter/enhancer activity of the aggrecan gene in TC6 cells. Furthermore, we also found that SOX9 expression is enhanced by RA1 in TC6 cells. TC6 cells were cultured at 33 °C in α-modified Eagle's medium (α-MEM; Sigma) supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.) (14.Mataga N. Tamura M. Yanai N. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Obinata M. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For temperature shift experiments, TC6 cells were cultured at 39 °C. ROS17/2.8 cells were cultured at 37 °C in modified Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% FBS (15.Majeska R.J. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Primary chondrocytes were prepared from rib cartilage of newborn ICR mice (16.Lefebvre V. Garofalo S. Zhou G. Metsaranta M. Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Chondrocytes were isolated from rib cage cartilage by digestion in 3 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) for 30 min and then by further digestion in 3 mg/ml collagenase for 5 h. Primary osteoblasts were isolated from newborn ICR mouse calvariae by five sequential enzymatic digestions using 1 mg/ml collagenase and 250 units/ml Dispase (Godo Shusei, Tokyo, Japan) (17.Wong G.L. Cohn D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3167-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The cells in the last three fractions were pooled. Primary fibroblasts were prepared from adult ICR mouse peritoneum. Peritoneum was incubated in 1 mg/ml collagenase and 250 units/ml Dispase for 1 h. Primary chondrocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and primary osteoblasts and primary fibroblasts were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) at 37 °C. CAT assay was performed as described previously (18.Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). TC6 cells were plated in six-well cluster plates (35-mm well diameter) at 6–7 × 104 cells/cm2. One day later, TC6 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of CAT reporter plasmids and a SOX9 expression plasmid containing a 1.9-kb Sox9 cDNA insert (5.Wright E. Hargrave M.R. Christiansen J. Cooper L. Kun J. Evans T. Gangadharan U. Greenfield A. Koopman P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) or a pSG5 vector plasmid as a negative control. The reporter constructs AgCAT-8, AgCAT-5, and AgCAT-6, containing 8-, 3.5-, and 1.1-kb promoter/first exon (encoding the 5′-untranslated region)/first intron fragments of the mouse aggrecan gene, respectively (19.Watanabe H. Gao L. Sugiyama S. Doege K. Kimata K. Yamada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were used. TC6 cells were also transfected with 1 μg of pCII4-C reporter plasmid containing a 1.6-kb intron fragment of the murine type II procollagen gene (20.Horton W. Miyashita T. Kohno K. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8864-8868Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 1 μm RA after transfection. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) to form DNA-lipid complexes (21.Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4388) Google Scholar). TC6 cells were exposed to the DNA solution for 3 h without FBS, and then the cells were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS. ROS17/2.8 cells were subjected to transfection with the SOX9 expression vector in combination with reporter plasmids as described above. The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. Cell extracts were prepared and used for the analysis of CAT activity. Protein concentrations in the cell lysates were determined according to the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G method as described (22.Spector T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of the cellular proteins were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in reaction buffer containing 0.25m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm acetyl-CoA (Sigma), and [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The levels of acetylation were estimated by TLC followed by autoradiography of the TLC plates. Quantitation of the acetylation levels was performed using a BAS 2000 bioimaging analyzer system (Fuji Film Inc., Tokyo). The effect of Sox9 promoter activity was estimated by measuring the conversion rate. Experiments were repeated two or three times in triplicate with independent preparations of cell extracts. To monitor transfection efficiency, CAT activity was normalized against the luciferase (LUC) activity of the pGL2-Control-LUC construct cotransfected with the reporter plasmids and SOX9 expression plasmid in part of the experiments. Such experiments gave results similar to those in which CAT activity was normalized against total protein contents. Transfection experiments were conducted as described above. The SOX9 effect on promoter activity was examined by measuring luciferase activity using a control empty vector plasmid (pSG5) as a reference. Luciferase assay was performed as described previously (23.Berthold A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 49: 1243-1245Google Scholar) using a Picagene kit (Tokyo Ink Co., Tokyo) and a luminometer (Berthold Autolumat LB953). TC6 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of LUC reporter construct that carries four tandem copies of the 30-mer (GATCAGACTGAGAACAAAGCGCTCTCACAC) derived from the enhancer region of CD3-ε (24.van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) containing the Sry/Soxconsensus sequence (AACAAAG) and the SOX9 expression vector or pSG5 vector plasmid. LUC activity was normalized against the total protein concentration measured by the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G method (22.Spector T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 86: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). In part of the experiments, the pSV2-CAT construct was cotransfected with LUC constructs to monitor transfection efficiency. These experiments gave results similar to those in which LUC activity was normalized against total protein contents. pGL2-Control-LUC (Promega) was used as a control. Total cellular RNA was prepared according to the acid/guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (25.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 μg of the total RNA/lane were electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde and transferred to nylon filters (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by electroblotting. Filters were prehybridized for 24 h at 42 °C. A 1.6-kb EcoRI-BglII fragment of the mouseSox9 cDNA was used as a probe (5.Wright E. Hargrave M.R. Christiansen J. Cooper L. Kun J. Evans T. Gangadharan U. Greenfield A. Koopman P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). A rat liver/bone/kidney-type alkaline phosphatase probe (0.6 kb) was prepared by digestion with EcoRI (26.Noda M. Yoon K. Thiede M. Buenaga R. Weiss M. Henthorn P. Harris H. Rodan G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A 1.2-kb EcoRI fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe was used as a control. Each cDNA was labeled using the BcaBEST random primer labeling kit (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Tokyo) and [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 24 h. Filters were washed in 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS for 20 min at room temperature and in 0.2× SSC and 0.5% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Filters were then exposed to x-ray films using intensifying screens at −80 °C. TC6 cells were seeded into four-well plates (2 cm2/well) and cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS in the absence or presence of RA. At the indicated time points, the cells were trypsinized and counted using a Coulter counter. Statistical evaluations of the data were conducted using unpaired Student's t test. Data are presented as means ± S.D. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. To examine whether SOX9 regulates the transcriptional activity of the aggrecan gene, a CAT reporter gene construct (AgCAT-8) containing an 8-kb mouse aggrecan gene fragment that includes the aggrecan gene promoter, the first exon, and part of the first intron (Fig. 1 A) was cotransfected (19.Watanabe H. Gao L. Sugiyama S. Doege K. Kimata K. Yamada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with a SOX9 expression vector into TC6 cells. SOX9 overexpression enhanced the transcriptional activity of the AgCAT-8 construct ∼3-fold (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). To further determine whether any particular region within the 8-kb aggrecan gene fragment responds to SOX9 overexpression, we also examined the CAT activities of the two deletion constructs AgCAT-5 (3.5 kb) and AgCAT-6 (1.1 kb) (Fig. 1 A). SOX9 enhancement was no longer observed when we deleted a 4.5-kb intron fragment from the 3′-end of the 8-kb fragment corresponding to the region including the first intron (AgCAT-5) (Fig. 1 B, upper panel), indicating that the 4.5-kb first intron fragment plays a major role in mediating the transcriptional activation effect of SOX9 on the aggrecan gene in TC6 cells. SOX9 reduced CAT activities by ∼30% when both the promoter and intron were deleted (AgCAT-6) (Fig.1 B, upper panel). As SOX9 is expressed specifically in cartilage but not in bone, it may require certain transcription factors or cofactors pertinent to a specific cellular background to enhance the 8-kb aggrecan gene fragment. To test this point, the AgCAT-8, AgCAT-5, and AgCAT-6 constructs were cotransfected with the SOX9 expression vector into osteoblast-like ROS17/2.8 cells. SOX9 overexpression decreased the transcriptional activity of the AgCAT-8 construct by ∼80% in ROS17/2.8 cells. SOX9 suppression of the transcriptional activity of AgCAT-8 was lost when the 4.5-kb intron region was deleted (AgCAT-6 and AgCAT-5) (Fig. 1 B, middle panel). Thus, SOX9 enhancement of aggrecan gene promoter activity was observed in TC6 cells, but not in ROS17/2.8 cells. To compare SOX9 effects on AgCAT-8 activity in primary cultures of chondrocytes versus those in TC6 cells, we carried out experiments using primary chondrocytes prepared from ribs of newborn mice (16.Lefebvre V. Garofalo S. Zhou G. Metsaranta M. Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), primary osteoblasts prepared from calvariae of newborn mouse (17.Wong G.L. Cohn D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3167-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and primary fibroblasts from adult mice. In contrast to the SOX9 enhancement of AgCAT-8 activities in TC6 cells, SOX9 suppressed AgCAT-8 activity in primary chondrocytes slightly (by 20%), although the effects were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and reproducible in two independent experiments (Fig. 1 B,lower panel). In primary cultures of osteoblasts and fibroblasts, SOX9 affected AgCAT-8 activity slightly again (with 10–20% suppression) in a similar direction as seen in primary chondrocytes, although these SOX9 effects in primary osteoblasts and fibroblasts were not statistically significant in both of the two independent experiments (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). SOX9 has been shown to enhance transcriptional activity via the Sry/Sox consensus sequence (6.Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 7.Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Koopman P. Dev.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether the SOX9 activation of transcription via such consensus sequences could also be affected by the cellular background. To address this issue, the LUC reporter construct that carries four tandem copies of a 30-mer containing theSry/Sox consensus sequence (AACAAAG) was cotransfected with the SOX9 expression vector into TC6 cells (24.van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). SOX9 overexpression enhanced the transcriptional activity of the LUC reporter construct containing the Sry/Sox consensus sequence >10-fold in TC6 cells (Fig. 2). To examine SOX9 enhancement of transcriptional activity via the Sry/Soxconsensus sequence in another cellular background, the LUC reporter construct containing the Sry/Sox consensus sequence was cotransfected with the SOX9 expression vector into ROS17/2.8 cells. The transcriptional activity of the Sry/Sox consensus sequence was not enhanced by SOX9 in ROS17/2.8 cells (Fig. 2). We next examined the endogenous levels of SOX9 expression in TC6 cells. As shown in Fig. 3,Sox9 mRNA was expressed, although at relatively low levels, in TC6 cells. To investigate the regulation of Sox9mRNA expression, we examined the effect of calciotropic hormones and cytokines. The Sox9 mRNA level was not affected by 48-h treatment with 4 ng/ml transforming growth factor β1, 10 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor, 10 ng/ml interleukin-1β, 100 nm vitamin D, or 100 nm parathyroid hormone. However, 1 μm RA specifically up-regulatedSox9 mRNA expression in TC6 cells (Fig. 3). GAPDH mRNA levels (serving as a control) were not altered by RA, suggesting the specificity of the RA effects on Sox9 gene expression in TC6 cells. The dose dependence of the RA effect on Sox9 mRNA expression in TC6 cells was examined at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μm. The effect of 48 h of treatment with 1 μm RA on Sox9 mRNA expression was investigated (Fig. 4). Again, RA at 1 μm did not affect GAPDH expression, indicating the specificity of the RA effect on Sox9 gene expression. TC6 cells are derived from articular cartilage of transgenic mice harboring the temperature-sensitive mutant tsA58 SV40 large T-antigen gene (14.Mataga N. Tamura M. Yanai N. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Obinata M. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of temperature shift on Sox9 mRNA expression in response to RA in TC6 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the basal levels of Sox9 mRNA expression were similar regardless of temperature (33 °C (permissive) and 39 °C (nonpermissive)) in TC6 cells. Furthermore, treatment with RA enhancedSox9 mRNA expression at 39 °C similarly to treatment at 33 °C (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the basal levels of SOX9 expression and the RA effects on its expression are similar between 33 and 39 °C. As SOX9 activates the 8-kb aggrecan gene fragment and RA enhances Sox9 gene expression in TC6 cells, we wished to test whether RA enhances the transcriptional activity of the 8-kb aggrecan gene fragment. Contrary to our prediction, RA suppressed the transcriptional activity of AgCAT-8 by ∼70%, although this was statistically not significant (p = 0.055). This suggests the parallel presence of RA-dependent suppressive pathway(s) that could overcome the RA-activated SOX9 activity on AgCAT-8 (Fig.6). As the entire 8-kb aggrecan gene fragment could be regulated by many pathways or transcription factors other than SOX9, we tested whether at least the Sry/Sox consensus sequence could be activated by RA in TC6 cells. To examine whether RA enhances the transcriptional activity if only Sry/Soxconsensus sequences are linked to the reporter gene in TC6 cells, we used the LUC reporter construct that carries four tandem copies of the 30-mer containing the AACAAAG consensus motif as described above. Treatment with RA at 1 μm enhanced by 12-fold the transcriptional activity of the LUC reporter construct containing theSry/Sox consensus sequence (Fig.7). As we observed that SOX9 activated the transcriptional activity of the aggrecan gene promoter/enhancer in TC6 cells, we wished to test whether any other gene fragment that has been well characterized can respond to SOX9. Among the genes encoding cartilage-specific molecules, SOX9 is known to enhance type II procollagen enhancer activity in chondrocytes (6.Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 7.Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 27.Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether RA enhances type II procollagen enhancer activity. In TC6 cells, treatment with RA at 1 μm enhanced the activity of the pCII4-C-CAT (Col2-CAT) reporter construct containing a 1.6-kb intron fragment of the murine type II procollagen gene where the chondrocyte-specific Sry/Sox consensus sequence has been located (28.Horton W.E. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). RA did not alter the activity of pSV2-CAT, indicating the specificity of its effect on the type II procollagen enhancer. As agents acting on the expression of the differentiation-related phenotype could reciprocally regulate proliferation, we examined the effect of RA on the proliferation of TC6 cells. The cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 1 μm RA for 1, 2, and 3 days. RA reduced TC6 cell numbers by 22% on day 2 and by 40% on day 3 (Fig.9 A). RA-mediated reduction of TC6 cell proliferation was observed in a dose-dependent manner after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 9 B). To further examine the specificity of SOX9 action in chondrocytes, SOX9 was overexpressed in ROS17/2.8 cells and primary osteoblasts to see its effect on alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression. Endogenous levels of SOX9 were not detectable in these cells. SOX9 overexpression was confirmed by the presence of theSox9 mRNA band (Fig.10), but it did not affect alkaline phosphatase mRNA expression in both ROS17/2.8 cells and primary osteoblasts. GAPDH mRNA levels served as a control and were not affected by SOX9 overexpression. We demonstrate here that SOX9 enhances the transcriptional activity of the 8-kb fragment of the aggrecan gene. Bi et al. (11.Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) reported that SOX9−/− cells do not express aggrecan in mouse chimeras, suggesting that SOX9 activates aggrecan gene expression in vivo as well. SOX9 has been shown to bind to chondrocyte-specific enhancer sequences in the first intron of the murine type II procollagen gene (6.Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 27.Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the murine type XI procollagen gene (29.Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14998-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) to activate transcription of these genes through these enhancers. Our observation predicts that binding site(s) of SOX9 would exist within the 4.5-kb first intron fragment of the aggrecan gene. As support for this prediction, we found that SOX9 transactivates gene expression via the Sry/Sox consensus sequence in TC6 cells using a LUC reporter construct that carries four tandem copies of a 30-mer containing AACAAAG sequence derived from the enhancer region of a gene encoding CD3-ε, one of the T-cell antigen receptor family (24.van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In this study, SOX9 enhancement of aggrecan gene promoter activity and SOX9 transactivation of gene expression via the Sry/Soxconsensus sequence were observed in the cartilage-derived cell line TC6, but not in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells. In situhybridization studies indicate that Sox9 is expressed in cells that express cartilage-specific phenotype-related genes such as aggrecan and the type II procollagen gene, but not in bone and other connective tissues (7.Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). This association of Sox9 expression and the aggrecan in in situ hybridization as well as our present study suggest that SOX9 is active in a specific cellular background. It is intriguing that SOX9 did not enhance, but suppressed gene transcription of the same reporter gene in osteoblastic ROS17/2.8 cells. It has been known that regulation of gene transcription is dependent on either tissue-specific positive or negative cofactors that modulate the functions of basic transcriptional machinery to render a variety of transcriptional regulation. It is intriguing to suspect that SOX9 will be functional in association with particular set(s) of transcriptional modulators in specific types of cells in different tissues. In fact, cells that do not express the type II procollagen gene such as those in genital ridges and a specific area in the embryonic heart also express Sox9 (7.Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Sox9 is also highly expressed in testicular Sertoli cells and is involved in differentiation of male gonads (30.Kent J. Wheatley S.C. Andrews J.E. Sinclair A.H. Koopman P. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2813-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). It is likely that SOX9 contributes to the function of these cells by controlling expression of diverse target genes. Kamachi et al. (32.Kamachi Y. Cheah K.S. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) proposed that the HMG domain of Sox genes is not sufficient to form a stable protein-DNA complex with SOX-binding DNA sequences by itself and that SOX proteins require binding partner factors unique to each SOX or SOX subfamily to achieve stable complex formation with the target DNA, which leads to transcriptional activation. Lefebvre et al.(33.Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) suggested that in addition to SOX9, L-SOX5 and SOX6 cooperate with each other in expression of chondrocyte-specific genes. The diversity in the SOX9-specific regulation may also be dependent on the small difference in the sequences flanking the Sry/Soxconsensus motif. Bell et al. (6.Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) reported that SOX9 fusion protein bound to the AACAAAG sequence derived from the enhancer region of a CD3-ε gene and that this complex was supershifted by anti-SOX9 antibody. Mertin et al. (34.Mertin S. McDowall S.G. Harley V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) reported that binding activity between SOX9 fusion protein and the AGAACAAAGC sequence derived from the enhancer region of CD3-ε was half of the binding activity between SOX9 fusion protein and the preferred DNA-binding site of SOX9 (AGAACAATGG), which was identified using a random oligonucleotide selection assay. Overall, a difference in SOX9 functions in the background of TC6 versus ROS17/2.8 cells may be due to such different sets of the partner factors, including L-SOX5, SOX6, and/or as yet unknown cofactors. Against our prediction, SOX9 slightly suppressed AgCAT-8 activity in primary chondrocytes (by 20%). These effects were small although statistically significant (p < 0.05) and reproducible in two independent experiments (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). We assume that this difference in the SOX9 regulation of AgCAT-8 in TC6 cells versus primary chondrocytes could be related to the difference in the endogenous levels of SOX9 expression. Northern blot analysis indicated that primary chondrocytes expressSox9 mRNA at severalfold higher levels than TC6 cells (data not shown). SOX9 overexpression enhanced AgCAT-8 activity in TC6 cells, possibly due to the low SOX9 background in these cells, whereas SOX9 overexpression in the presence of high levels of SOX9 may be suppressive, as competition against cofactors may exist. Although SOX9 decreased AgCAT-8 transcriptional activity by ∼80% in ROS17/2.8 cells, SOX9 virtually did not affect AgCAT-8 activity in primary osteoblasts. We could not detect Sox9 mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis in either ROS17/2.8 cells or primary osteoblasts. Therefore, diverse cellular backgrounds (primary osteoblasts versus ROS17/12.8 cells) may affect AgCAT-8 activity differently in response to SOX9 overexpression. Overall, certain differences exist between TC6 cells and primary chondrocytes with regard to the SOX9 regulation of aggrecan gene expression, possibly due to the diversities in cellular backgrounds that would include those in the sets of transcription factors and cofactors. RA plays an important role not only in pattern formation during embryogenesis (35.Lohnes D. Kastner P. Dierich A. Mark M. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Cell. 1993; 73: 643-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 36.Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dolle P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P.

RA treatment decreases expression of the type II procollagen gene in primary chondrocytes (28.Horton W.E. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 508-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38.Benya P.D. Padilla S.R. Dev. Biol. 1986; 118: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and suppresses the enhancer activity of pCII4-C reporter plasmid containing the promoter and enhancer regions of the type II procollagen gene in primary chondrocytes prepared from sterna of day 15 chickens (20.Horton W. Miyashita T. Kohno K. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8864-8868Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast, RA stimulated the enhancer activity of the pCII4-C reporter plasmid in TC6 cells, where RA enhanced mRNA levels of Sox9, which regulates the type II procollagen gene directly (6.Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 27.Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent diversity in the responses to RA could be due to several possibilities. For instance, responsiveness to RA may depend on chondrocyte subtypes; however, primary chondrocytes consist of heterogeneous subpopulations. On the other hand, TC6 cells consist of homogeneous population and represent one of the subpopulations in chondrocytes at a certain stage, but not all. RA may up-regulate chondrocytic phenotype-related genes such as Sox9 and type II procollagen in this subtype specifically. As another possibility, the apparent dissociation of RA effects on the 1.6-kb fragment of the type II collagen geneversus those on the transcriptional activity of the 8-kb fragment of the aggrecan gene in TC6 cells could be due to the diversities in the interaction of different sets of transcription factors that are binding to their cognate DNA elements present in various combinations within these two promoters. Temperature shift experiments indicate that basal levels ofSox9 expression and RA effects on its expression are similar between 33 and 39 °C, whereas at 39 °C, SOX9 did not affect AgCAT-8 activity in TC6 cells, in contrast to its enhancement at 33 °C (data not shown). These observations reveal that both a similarity and a difference exist between 33 and 39 °C cultures of TC6 cells. Chondrocytes at different maturation stages share certain common phenotypes, whereas chondrocytes at each of the specific stages such as proliferating chondrocytes or hypertrophic chondrocytes exhibit specific features. Our observations on the similarity and the difference between the TC6 cells cultured at 33 and 39 °C could represent these common and specific features, respectively. Altogether, we demonstrate in this study that SOX9 activates aggrecan promoter/enhancer transcription in TC6 cells. Our results also suggest that RA enhances Sox9 expression and, in turn, SOX9 transactivates the type II procollagen gene via the Sry/Soxconsensus sequence in TC6 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2040236732,"Two major classes of cells observed within the Drosophila hematopoietic repertoire are plasmatocytes/macrophages and crystal cells. The transcription factor Lz (Lozenge), which resembles human AML1 (acute myeloid leukemia- 1) protein, is necessary for the development of crystal cells during embryonic and larval hematopoiesis. Another transcription factor, Gcm (glial cells missing), has previously been shown to be required for plasmatocyte development. Misexpression of Gcm causes crystal cells to be transformed into plasmatocytes. The Drosophila GATA protein Srp (Serpent) is required for both Lz and Gcm expression and is necessary for the development of both classes of hemocytes, whereas Lz and Gcm are required in a lineage-specific manner. Given the similarities of Srp and Lz to mammalian GATA and AML1 proteins, observations in Drosophila are likely to have broad implications for understanding mammalian hematopoiesis and leukemias."

Video sequences of freely diving seals and whales wearing submersible cameras reveal a behavioral strategy that improves energetic efficiency in these animals. Prolonged gliding (greater than 78% descent duration) occurred during dives exceeding 80 meters in depth. Gliding was attributed to buoyancy changes with lung compression at depth. By modifying locomotor patterns to take advantage of these physical changes, Weddell seals realized a 9.2 to 59.6% reduction in diving energetic costs. This energy-conserving strategy allows marine mammals to increase aerobic dive duration and achieve remarkable depths despite limited oxygen availability when submerged."

G protein-coupled receptor high pressure liquid chromatography 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are a large family of receptors uniquely characterized by their ability to detect a diverse variety of extracellular signals such as single photons, odorants, inorganic ions, nucleotides, biogenic amines, chemokines, lipids, proteases, amino acids, and peptides. In recent years, a large number of DNA sequences have been identified that encode novel proteins with many of the sequence motifs characteristic of GPCRs but for which no natural ligand has been identified. These putative GPCRs have been termed “orphan” receptors. Recently, naturally occurring ligands have been identified for a number of orphans, using the recombinant orphan receptor as the specific sensor component of a bioassay. Tissue extracts have often provided the source of these ligands, but some orphans have been identified by mass screening of large libraries of known or putative GPCR ligands (1.Feighner S.D. Tan C.P.

Here, we describe how we have employed this latter strategy to identify a naturally occurring ligand for the orphan receptor KIAA0001 (4.Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawarabayasi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K.-I. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). KIAA0001 (GenBankTM accession number D13626) was originally cloned from an immature human myeloid cell line (4.Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawarabayasi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K.-I. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and contains a number of features typical of members of the GPCR superfamily, including a DRY motif at the boundary of transmembrane domain 3 and the second intracellular loop, consensus sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation on extracellular sequences, and consensus sites for protein kinases A and C phosphorylation on the third intracellular loop. Recently, a putative rat ortholog, termed VTR 15–20, with 81% amino acid identity to KIAA0001 and conserved substitutions was cloned from ventral tegmental tissue (5.Charlton M.E. Williams A.S. Fogliano M. Sweetnam P.M. Duman R.S. Brain Res. 1997; 764: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This orphan is expressed widely throughout the mammalian nervous system and in rat primary microglial and astrocyte cultures. Furthermore, expression of VTR 15–20 in the brain and spleen is regulated by immunologic challenge. These data have implicated this orphan in neuroimmune function (5.Charlton M.E. Williams A.S. Fogliano M. Sweetnam P.M. Duman R.S. Brain Res. 1997; 764: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that KIAA0001 and VTR 15–20 are likely to be orthologs and that KIAA0001, like VTR 15–20, is expressed widely throughout the brain and in many other regions of the body.

Identities and similarities were calculated from hand-adjusted alignments. Expression of KIAA0001 in yeast strains was carried out essentially as described previously (7.Klein C. Paul J.I. Sauve K.

Similar strains were created in which GPA1was replaced with human Gα sequences encoding Gαi2 (7.Klein C. Paul J.I. Sauve K. Schmidt M.M. Arcangeli L. Ransom J. Trueheart J. Manfredi J.P. Broach J.R.

Lawns of yeast were prepared by pouring 1 A 600 unit of cells resuspended in 10 ml of SD-Leu-Trp, pH 6.8, 0.7% agar, onto a solid base of SD-Leu-Trp, pH 6.8, growth media. 1-μl aliquots of 1 mm solutions of putative agonists were transferred from 96-well plates to yeast lawns. After an overnight incubation at 30 °C, the assay was developed by the addition of 10 ml of lysis/developer solution, pH 7.0 (0.5% agar, 0.58 m Na2HPO4, 0.42 mNaH2PO4, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.05% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside). The presence of an agonist among the test compounds was evidenced by the development of a blue color at the point of deposition of that compound. A library of over 700 known and putative natural GPCR agonists was assembled, mostly from commercial sources, and screened in this assay. The library included neuropeptides, bioactive lipids (leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor, etc.), steroids (aldosterone, testosterone, etc.), amines (catecholamines, etc.), cannabinoids (anandamide, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), all commonly occurringl-amino acids, and nucleotides (ATP, ADP, UDP, UTP, etc.) and chemically related substances. UDP-glucose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and CDP-glucose were obtained from Sigma and were a minimum of 98% pure by HPLC. UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, from the same source, were approximately 98% pure by HPLC. A quantitative assay was performed essentially as described (7.Klein C. Paul J.I. Sauve K.

Receptor expression in HEK-293 cells was carried out as follows. Receptors and Gα16 were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDN (9.Aiyar N. Baker E. Wu H.-L. Nambi P. Edwards R.M.

Thus, a mixture of 15 μg of receptor DNA and 15 μg of Gα16 DNA was used to transfect a single 175-cm2 culture flask of cells at 80% confluency. For transient transfection of receptor DNA alone, 30 μg of plasmid DNA was used. Stable, clonal cell lines were produced by serial dilution into selective media containing 400 μg/ml G418, and message-positive clones from Northern blot analysis were assayed further. A single clone responded most sensitively to UDP-glucose in a GTP-γ-S assay and was used in all other experiments. Stable clonal HEK-293 cells co-expressing Gα16 and KIAA0001 were generated by transfecting cells with a derivative of pCDN-Gα16 in which the neomycin coding sequence had been replaced with a histidinol selectable marker (10.Hartman S.C.

A single histidinol-resistant clone (mRNA-positive for Gα16 by Northern analysis) was transfected with KIAA0001 as described above, and a single G418-resistant clonal cell line most sensitive to UDP-glucose in an intracellular Ca2+ assay was used in all further work. Intracellular Ca2+ assays were carried out as follows. HEK-293 cells were seeded (50,000 cells/well) into poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well black-wall, clear-bottom microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson) 24 h prior to assay. Cells were loaded for 1 h with 1 μm Fluo-4-AM fluorescent indicator dye (Molecular Probes) in assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mmHEPES, 200 μm Ca2+, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm probenecid), washed three times with assay buffer, and then returned to the incubator for 10 min before assay on a fluorimetric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). The maximum change in fluorescence over baseline was used to determine agonist response. The same library of putative ligands used for screening with yeast cells was used for Ca2+ assays, except that peptides, lipids, steroids, and cannabinoids were screened at final concentrations of >100 nm and other ligands at >1 μm. GTP-γ-S binding was carried out essentially as described previously (11.Watson J.M. Burton M.J. Price G.W. Jones B.J. Middlemiss D.N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 314: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Concentration response curve data were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation using GraFit (Erithacus Software Ltd.). In saturation binding studies, increasing concentrations of uridine diphospho-d-6[3H]glucose (2.5–150 nm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, specific activity = 22.0 Ci/mmol) were added to membranes and incubated in a total volume of 200 μl (approximately 100 μg of membrane proteins/ml) for 60 min at 25 °C. Specific binding was defined as that displaced by excess (1 μm) unlabeled UDP-glucose and represented 85–90% of the total binding at a ligand concentration of 25 nm. In competition binding studies, the membranes were incubated with increasing concentrations (1 pm to 10 μm) of unlabeled competing ligand and 20–30 nm of uridine diphospho-d-6[3H]glucose for 60 min at 25 °C. Bound and free radioligand were separated using Skatron filters (FilterMat 11734), presoaked in 0.1% polyethylenimine. Bound radioactivity was quantitated in a beta scintillation counter. Protein was determined using BCA (Pierce). Analyses of all binding data (i.e. the determination of K d, Bmax, and K i values) were performed by computer-assisted nonlinear least square fitting using GRAPHPAD PRIZM (Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out essentially as described previously (12.Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Chambers J. Ellis C. Elshourbagy N. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Muccitelli R.M. Jenkins O. Murdock P.R. Herrity N.C. Halsey W. Sathe G. Muir A.I. Nuthulaganti P. Dytko G.M. Buckley P.T. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Hay D.W.P. Mol.

Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) showed that KIAA0001 is most closely related to the orphan receptors H963 (13.Jacobs K.A. Collins-Racie L.A. Colbert M. Duckett M. Golden-Fleet M. Kelleher K. Kriz R.

Lenoir G.M. Elliott K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that thrombin and platelet-activating factor receptors are the closest relatives with identified functions. Functionally identified receptors with nucleotide ligands (P2Y1,2,4,6,11) also appear to share a recent common ancestor with these receptors but are clearly more distantly related (Fig. 1). Phylogenetic analysis also placed KIAA0001 and VTR 15–20 as closest relatives, and a rigorous search of data bases revealed no other potential orthologs. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis using either the KIAA0001 or the VTR 15–20 coding regions under low stringency hybridization conditions revealed only one hybridization band in genomic samples from human, rat, and mouse that was identical with both probes (data not shown). These data are consistent with the notion that KIAA0001 and VTR 15–20 are orthologs and that no close paralogs of this receptor exist. As part of a large program to identify the natural ligands for orphan GPCRs, we expressed a number of known and orphan GPCRs, including KIAA0001, in yeast strains engineered to respond to agonist activation with increased expression of a pheromone signaling pathway-inducibleFUS1-lacZ reporter gene (7.Klein C. Paul J.I. Sauve K. Schmidt M.M. Arcangeli L. Ransom J. Trueheart J. Manfredi J.P. Broach J.R. Murphy A.J. Nat.

As one cannot predict the specific G protein that will transduce signals from a given orphan receptor, we expressed receptors in several yeast strains, each carrying a different G protein α-subunit. We then screened multiple receptors, each expressed in several such strains, in parallel, against a large library of over 700 known and putative natural GPCR agonists. UDP-glucose, which was included in this library because it has been reported to possess pharmacological activity (16.Connolly G.P. Harrison P.J. Br. J.

Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), was the only substance that specifically activated KIAA0001. Two yeast strains responded to UDP-glucose. The first expressed KIAA0001 in conjunction with the endogenous yeast Gα protein, Gpalp (21.Blumer K.J. Reneke J.E. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10836-10842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second expressed KIAA0001 and a hybrid of Gpalp and the promiscuous mammalian Gα protein, Gα16 (22.Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A control yeast strain transformed with empty vector did not respond to UDP-glucose nor did yeast strains transfected with the same G proteins and a number of other receptors. In a follow-up screen of substances related to UDP-glucose, it was discovered that UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, exhibited agonist activity (TableI). However, a large number of related substances were inactive as agonists (listed in Table I), including various other sugar-nucleotides and the naturally occurring nucleotides known to activate GPCRs of the P2Y class: ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP.Table INucleotides, nucleotide sugars, and related molecules tested for agonist activity on KIAA0001 expressed in yeastKIAA0001 agonistsNo agonist activityUDP-glucoseUDPCDPUridineUDP-galactoseUMPCTPThymidineUDP-glucuronic acidUTPTMPADP-glucoseUDP-N-acetylglucosaminedUDPIMPADP-riboseAMPIDPADP-mannoseADPXDPCDP-glucoseATPXTPGDP-glucosedATPA[5′]P3[5′]AGDP-mannosecAMPA[5′]P4[5′]AGDP-fucosecGMPA[5′]P5[5′]ATDP-glucoseA[5′]P6[5′]AAliquots of test compounds, ranging from 1 to 28 nmol, were spotted to lawns of yeast expressing KIAA0001.

Receptor activation was assessed in an agar-based assay of β-galactosidase activity resulting from stimulation of the yeast pheromone response pathway. We investigated the concentration dependence of UDP-glucose on KIAA0001-mediated activity using the Gpalp yeast strains with a modification to the original screen that permitted quantitative pharmacology. In this assay, UDP-glucose activated KIAA0001 with a potency of 67.9 ± 6.8 nm (± S.E., n= 3) (Fig. 2), but no significant response was detected when ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP were tested at concentrations up to 1 μm, demonstrating that this receptor exhibits a distinctly different pharmacology from that of the P2Y nucleotide receptor family. In addition, UDP-glucose was inactive at concentrations up to 1 μm when tested against control cells carrying an empty vector (Fig. 2). In parallel studies, we transiently co-transfected mammalian HEK-293 cells with both KIAA0001 and Gα16 to promote coupling to intracellular Ca2+. We screened these cells against the same ligand bank in an intracellular Ca2+ assay, and UDP-glucose was the only substance observed to clearly elicit KIAA0001-mediated Ca2+ responses. Furthermore, we observed that only cells transiently transfected with both KIAA0001 and Gα16 were responsive to UDP-glucose (Fig.3 A); cells transfected with either receptor or G protein alone were unresponsive to UDP-glucose in this assay (Fig. 3 A). Co-transfected cells responded to UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose with EC50 values (± S.E.,n = 3) of 104 ± 22 and 421 ± 43 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 B), but the related sugar-nucleotide, CDP-glucose, was inactive when tested at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 3 B). We carried out similar studies with the related human orphan receptors (Fig. 1) H963 (13.Jacobs K.A. Collins-Racie L.A. Colbert M. Duckett M. Golden-Fleet M. Kelleher K. Kriz R. LaVallie E.R.

Genome Res. 1996; 6: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but did not observe orphan-mediated responses to either UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose. The specificity of the interaction of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose with KIAA0001 was further confirmed by the observation that HEK-293 cells transiently co-transfected with Gα16, and a variety of GPCRs with known ligands (e.g.melanin-concentrating hormone (2.Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.-S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M.

A stable HEK-293 cell line expressing both recombinant Gα16 and KIAA0001 responded to UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine with large, concentration-dependent, transient, intracellular Ca2+ responses (Fig. 4) with EC50 values (± S.E., n = 3) of 80 ± 31, 124 ± 17, 370 ± 33, and 710 ± 27 nm, respectively. Control HEK-293 cell lines expressing Gα16alone were unresponsive to these ligands when tested at concentrations up to 10 μm, and none of the additional compounds listed in Table I exhibited detectable KIAA0001-mediated activity in this assay (data not shown). The presence of endogenous P2Y receptors coupled to Ca2+ mobilization in HEK-293 cells (24.Schachter J.B. Sromek S.M. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) prevented us from assessing in this assay whether nucleotides such as ATP and UTP interact with KIAA0001. To investigate the natural G protein coupling specificity of KIAA0001 in mammalian cells, we generated a clonal HEK-293 cell line expressing KIAA0001 without additional recombinant G proteins. Membranes prepared from these cells responded to UDP-glucose in a concentration-dependent way with increased binding of radiolabeled GTP-γ-S, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, with an EC50 value of 234 ± 17 nm (± S.E.,n = 3), but nontransfected control cells were unresponsive to UDP-glucose at concentrations up to 10 μm(Fig. 5 A). Overnight incubation of KIAA0001-expressing cells with pertussis toxin (25 ng/ml) abolished the response to UDP-glucose, suggesting that KIAA0001 is coupled to G proteins of the Gi/o class (Fig.5 B). In addition, freshly prepared ATP, ADP, UTP, UDP, and CDP-glucose exhibited no detectable KIAA0001-mediated increase in GTP-γ-S binding activity when tested at concentrations up to 10 μm (Fig. 5 B). Inhibition of basal levels of GTP-γ-S binding at higher concentrations of nucleotide triphosphates was identical in membranes prepared from pertussis toxin treated- and nontreated KIAA0001-transfected cells (Fig. 5 B), and an identical effect was also observed in nontransfected cells (data not shown). These data demonstrate that KIAA0001 exhibits a pharmacology distinct from that of the P2Y family, confirming our conclusions drawn from studies with yeast cells. We attempted to determine whether uridine diphospho-d-6[3H]glucose bound KIAA0001 with high affinity. Membranes prepared from clonal HEK-293 cells expressing KIAA0001 bound uridine diphospho-d-6[3H]glucose with an affinity of 8.1 nm and Bmax values of 7.8 pmol/mg protein. The specific binding was dependent on the protein concentration and was lost upon boiling membranes prior to assay. In competition assays, UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose competed for specific binding with K i values of 41.2 and 348 nm, respectively, whereas CDP-glucose, UTP, ATP, and ADP had little effect (K i > 10 μm). Essentially identical specific binding was also observed in nontransfected HEK-293, 1321N1, and Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting the presence of endogenous binding sites on these cells. These data suggest that this radiolabel may not be a suitable radioligand for KIAA0001. Indeed, one might expect that the receptor expression levels required to observe a specific binding signal in transfected cells above nontransfected cells would need to be at least of the same order of magnitude as the Bmax of the background specific binding (i.e.: 7.8 pmol/mg protein), a level of cloned receptor expression unlikely to be achieved in mammalian cells. Likewise, other workers investigating the use of radioactive forms of the structurally similar molecule ATP to radiolabel P2Y-like receptors report similar technical problems (25.Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate the physiological role of KIAA0001, we carried out studies to localize the expression of this receptor in the body. We performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis using KIAA0001-specific primers to determine the relative levels of KIAA0001 mRNA in a variety of human tissues from multiple individuals. We observed a widespread human tissue distribution (Fig. 6), with only some differences to that reported by Northern blot analysis for VTR 15–20 in the rat (5.Charlton M.E. Williams A.S. Fogliano M. Sweetnam P.M. Duman R.S. Brain Res. 1997; 764: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the highest levels of expression were observed in placenta, adipose tissue, stomach, and intestine, with moderate levels noted in a wide variety of brain regions, spleen, lung, and heart. Unlike with VTR 15–20 in the rat, we detected only relatively low amounts in the kidney. For many years the roles of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose have been considered to be primarily those of metabolic intermediates that act as activated carriers of sugar moieties for the enzymatic biosynthesis of carbohydrates. However, the data presented here suggest that they also serve a role as extracellular signaling molecules. A limited literature suggests that UDP-glucose may have pharmacological activity. Thus, UDP-glucose produces concentration-dependent depolarizations of the rat cervical ganglion (16.Connolly G.P. Harrison P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2764-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and contractions of the rat (17.Pastoris O. Raimondo S. Dossena M. Fulle D. Farm. Ed. Sci. 1981; 36: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar) and guinea pig (18.Pastoris O. Dossena M. Raimondo S. Farm. Ed. Sci. 1979; 34: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar) phrenic diaphragm and is effective in the treatment of certain liver ailments (19.Girotto T. Longo O. Clin. Ter. 1981; 96: 593-604Google Scholar), an effect that may result from interaction with cell surface receptors on hepatocytes (20.Yip L.C. Xu Y-L. Balis M.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, it is premature to conclude that these effects are mediated by KIAA0001, especially because KIAA0001 expression in liver appears to be relatively low (Fig. 6) and because definitive evidence of the role of KIAA0001 in any physiological system must await the development of specific antagonists and evaluation of null alleles (e.g. in the knockout mouse). Although the precise extracellular signaling roles of UDP-glucose and its related molecules is unknown at present, the similarity of these molecules to the natural ligands for the P2Y receptors encourages speculation. For example, the well established extracellular transmitter ATP is both co-released with neurotransmitters, and nonlytically released from mechanically agitated cells (26.Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Similarly, UTP is released from cells by this second mechanism (27.Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24348-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Such a release mechanism for UDP-glucose and its related molecules, perhaps to register local tissue stress to neighboring cells, would fit well alongside the widespread distribution of this receptor and the reported regulation of its message levels upon immune challenge and neuronal insult (5.Charlton M.E. Williams A.S. Fogliano M. Sweetnam P.M. Duman R.S. Brain Res. 1997; 764: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The authors thank J.

Once activated, NIK further activates two downstream kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, which form either homodimer or heterodimer complexes and directly phosphorylate IκBs (8.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P.

These early studies indicate that two independent TNF-R1 signaling pathways, leading to either apoptosis or NF-κB activation, bifurcate at TRADD.

A Casper deletion mutant lacking its C-terminal 45 amino acids protects TNF-R1-, Fas-, TRADD-, and FADD-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Casper functions downstream of FADD and is involved in TNF-R1- and Fas-induced apoptosis pathway (20.Shu H.B.

In this report, we show that FADD, Casper, and caspase-8 can activate the transcription factor NF-κB via a TRAF2-NIK-IKKs-dependent pathway, which contributes to TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation. In addition, we show that activation of caspase-8 can also negatively regulate TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation by proteolytically inactivating NIK. The recombinant human TNF and IL1 (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), the monoclonal antibodies against the Flag epitope (Sigma), the Myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), the rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal domain (aa 700–947) of NIK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the caspase inhibitor BD-fmk (Enzyme Systems, Livermore, CA) were purchased from the indicated manufacturers.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. Mammalian expression vectors for Myc-tagged NIK and its deletion mutants, and Flag-tagged caspase-8(C360S) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the corresponding cDNA fragments and subsequently cloning into a CMV promoter-based vector. The human embryonic kidney 293 and HeLa cell lines were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For reporter gene assays, ∼2 × 105 cells/well were seeded on 6-well (35 mm) dishes. Cells were transfected the following day by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (29.Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 0.5 μg of NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct and various amounts of testing plasmids. Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and where necessary, enough amount of empty control plasmid was added to keep each transfection receiving the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency and protein amount, 0.5 μg of RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid was added to all transfections. Luciferase reporter assays were performed using a luciferase assay kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) following the manufacture's protocols. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent kit (TROPIX Inc., Medford, MA). Luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase expression levels. Data shown are averages and standard deviations from one of the representative experiments in which each transfection was performed in triplicate. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting analyses were performed as described (20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). 293 cells (8 × 105) were transfected with 5 μg of expression plasmid for FADD, Casper, or NIK, in the presence or absence of 5 μg of expression plasmid for crmA or NIK(KK429/430AA). Where necessary, enough amount of empty control plasmid was added to keep each transfection receiving the same amount of total DNA (10 μg). 14 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (30.Shu H.B. Agranoff A.B. Nabel E.G. Leung K. Duckett C.S. Neish A.S. Collins T. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 10: 6283-6289Crossref Google Scholar). Aliquots of the nuclear extracts (20 μg) were incubated with 0.4 ng of a radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the following NF-κB binding sequence: 5′ GGGGACTTTCCC 3′. Each reaction was supplemented with 0.8 μg of poly(dI-dC) for blocking nonspecific binding. Nucleoprotein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel in Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer. Because Casper interacts with TRAF2 (20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), a signaling protein involved in NF-κB activation by TNF-R1 and several other members of the TNF receptor family (2.Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 31.Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), we determined whether Casper was capable of inducing NF-κB in luciferase reporter gene assays. We performed luciferase assays ∼14 h after transfection, a time point at which most transfected cells did not die. As shown in Fig.1 A, overexpression of Casper activated NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner. Casper contains two DEDs at its N terminus and a caspase-like domain at its C terminus (Fig. 1 B). Previously, it has been shown that the C-terminal caspase-like domain of Casper is responsible for its apoptotic activity (20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To determine which domain is required for Casper-induced NF-κB activation, we examined various Casper deletion mutants for their ability in activating NF-κB in reporter gene assays. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Casper(78–480) and Casper(192–480), two Casper deletion mutants lacking N-terminal 77 amino acids (the first DED) or 191 amino acids (both the first and second DEDs) respectively and which have been shown to be capable of inducing apoptosis (20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), did not activate NF-κB. Casper(1–435), a deletion mutant lacking C-terminal 45 amino acids that has been shown to function as a dominant negative mutant for TNF-R1- and Fas-induced apoptosis (20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 24.Inohara N. Koseki Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), weakly activated NF-κB (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that both the DEDs and the caspase-like domain of Casper are needed for its full NF-κB-inducing activity. We next determined whether FADD, which interacts with Casper and functions upstream of Casper in TNF-R1- and Fas-induced apoptosis pathways (20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 24.Inohara N. Koseki Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), could also activate NF-κB. We found that overexpression of FADD potently activated NF-κB in reporter gene assays (Fig. 1 C). The induction folds of NF-κB activity by Casper and FADD were comparable with those induced by TRADD and TRAF2, two signaling proteins previously shown to be involved in TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 C). An empty control plasmid or overexpression of TRAF1 did not activate NF-κB (Fig. 1 C). Gel shift experiments with nuclear extracts from Casper- and FADD-transfected cells further confirmed that Casper and FADD could activate NF-κB (Fig. 1 D). Because caspase-8 interacts with FADD and Casper and functions downstream of FADD in TNF-R1- and Fas-induced apoptosis pathways, we determined whether caspase-8 could also activate NF-κB. When overexpressed, caspase-8 potently and rapidly induces apoptosis of transfected cells, and this makes it impossible to measure potential NF-κB activation by caspase-8 (Ref. 20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar and data not shown). Previously, we have shown that the cowpox viral protein crmA can block caspase-8-induced apoptosis by physically interacting with and inhibiting processing of caspase-8 precursor (20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the presence of crmA, overexpression of caspase-8 potently activated NF-κB (Fig.2 A). In this experiment, crmA alone did not activate NF-κB (Fig. 2 A). These data suggest that caspase-8 can activate NF-κB, and this activation is independent of its proteolytic activity. To further confirm this conclusion, we determined whether a caspase-inactive mutant could activate NF-κB. Previously, it has been shown that a point mutation of caspase-8, C360S, abolishes the apoptotic activity of caspase-8 and functions as a dominant negative mutant for TNF-R1- and Fas-induced apoptosis (5.Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). We constructed such a mutant, caspase-8(C360S), and found that it had no detectable apoptotic activity when overexpressed in 293 or HeLa cells (data not shown). When transfected alone, however, caspase-8(C360S) could activate NF-κB to the same degree as that induced by wild-type caspase-8 in the presence of crmA. Taken together, these data suggest that caspase-8 can activate NF-κB as an unprocessed and caspase-inactive precursor. FADD and Casper induce apoptosis through activation of a downstream caspase cascade initiated at caspase-8 (5.Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

It has been shown that crmA interacts directly with caspase-8 but not with caspase-3 and that overexpression of crmA inhibits caspase-8-induced apoptosis (20.Shu H.B. Halpins D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).

To determine whether caspase-8 is involved in FADD- and Casper-induced NF-κB activation, we tested whether crmA could block FADD- and Casper-induced NF-κB activation. We found that both FADD- and Casper-induced NF-κB activation was inhibited by crmA in reporter gene assays (Fig. 2 A) and in gel shift experiments (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, activation of NF-κB by FADD and Casper, but not by RIP and NIK, was also inhibited by the caspase inhibitor BD-fmk (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that caspase-8 is involved in FADD- and Casper-induced NF-κB activation. Previously, it has been shown that the downstream signaling proteins of TNF-R1, including TRADD, TRAF2, RIP, NIK, IKKα, and IKKβ, are involved in TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation (1.Hsu H. Xiong J.

https://openalex.org/W2047397895,Laboratory experiments demonstrate that iron isotopes can be chemically fractionated in the absence of biology. Isotopic variations comparable to those seen during microbially mediated reduction of ferrihydrite are observed. Fractionation may occur in aqueous solution during equilibration between inorganic iron complexes. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of iron isotope fractionation and suggest that nonbiological processes may contribute to iron isotope variations observed in sediments.

Two major sites of proteolytic cleavage have been identified within the interglobular domain (IGD) of the aggrecan core protein, one between amino acids Asn341-Phe342 which is cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases and the other between Glu373-Ala374 that is attributed to aggrecanase. Although several potential aggrecanase-sensitive sites had been identified within the COOH terminus of aggrecan, demonstration that aggrecanase cleaved at these sites awaited isolation and purification of this protease. We have recently cloned human aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) (Tortorella, M. D., Burn, T. C., Pratta, M. A., Abbaszade, I., Hollis, J. M., Liu, R., Rosenfeld, S. A., Copeland, R. A., Decicco, C.

(1999) Science 284, 1664–1666) and herein demonstrate that in addition to cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond, this protease cleaves at four sites within the chondroitin-sulfate rich region of the aggrecan core protein, between G2 and G3 globular domains. Importantly, we show that this cleavage occurs more efficiently than cleavage within the IGD at the Glu373-Ala374 bond. Cleavage occurred preferentially at the KEEE1667–1668GLGS bond to produce both a 140-kDa COOH-terminal fragment and a 375-kDa fragment that retains an intact G1. Cleavage also occurred at the GELE1480–1481GRGT bond to produce a 55-kDa COOH-terminal fragment and a G1-containing fragment of 320 kDa. Cleavage of this 320-kDa fragment within the IGD at the Glu373-Ala374 bond then occurred to release the 250-kDa BC-3-reactive fragment from the G1 domain. The 140-kDa GLGS-reactive fragment resulting from the preferential cleavage was further processed at two additional cleavage sites, at TAQE1771-1772AGEG and at VSQE1871–1872LGQR resulting in the formation of a 98-kDa fragment with an intact G3 domain and two small fragments of ∼20 kDa.

Aggrecan monomers interact with hyaluronan and are usually found as part of a large aggregate containing 10–100 monomers per hyaluronan molecule. The primary role of aggrecan is to swell and hydrate the framework of cartilage collagen fibrils thus providing cartilage with its properties of compressibility and elasticity. The NH2 terminus of the aggrecan monomer core protein is comprised of two globular domains called G1 and G2 that are separated by an interglobular domain (IGD)1 that spans about 150 residues in length. The G2 region is followed by a long central glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment region and by a COOH-terminal globular domain, G3 (2.Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. Dudhia J. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R.

In cartilage degradation associated with diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, aggrecan is one of the first matrix components to undergo measurable loss that ultimately leads to a loss of cartilage function. Proteolytic cleavage within the IGD is believed to be responsible for the loss of aggrecan from cartilage. Two major sites of proteolytic cleavage have been identified within the IGD, one between amino acids Asn341 and Phe342and the other between Glu373 and Ala374. Matrix metalloproteinases, including MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -13 and MT1-MMP have been shown to cleave aggrecan at the Asn341-Phe342 site (4.Flannery C.R. Lark M.W. Sandy J.D. J. Biol.

However, homology comparison of this site with other regions within the aggrecan molecule indicates that there may be four additional aggrecanase-sensitive sites located in the chondroitin sulfate-rich region between the G2 and G3 globular domains. These sites all have a glutamic acid in the P1 position and a non-polar or uncharged polar residue (Ala, Leu, and Gly) residue in the P1′ position (10.Leulakis P. Shirkhanda A.V. Davis G.

However, confirmation that this cleavage was due to the same enzyme, aggrecanase, awaited its isolation.

Aggrecanase-1 and -2 are members of the adamalysin family of zinc-binding metalloproteases that exhibit a catalytic domain with the zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXNXXH, similar to that found in several MMPs, and cleave aggrecan at the Glu373-Ala374 bond. In the work reported herein, we identify the sites of cleavage and order of cleavage of aggrecan by recombinant human aggrecanase-1 using NH2-terminal sequence analysis and neo-epitope antibodies that recognize either the new COOH or NH2 terminus generated by cleavage at the putative aggrecanase-sensitive sites.

The monoclonal antibody, MAB2035, which recognizes chondroitin sulfate stubs on the core protein of aggrecan following deglycosylation, was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Polyclonal neo-epitope antibodies were prepared (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA) to the peptide sequences ATTAGELE and PTTFKEEE, that are present on the COOH terminus of aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu1480-Gly1481 bond and at the Glu1667-Gly1668 bond, respectively. Polyclonal neo-epitope antibodies were also prepared to the peptide sequences GLGSVELS, AGEGPSGI, and LGQRPPVT that are present on the NH2 terminus of aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu1667-Gly1668, Glu1771-Ala1772, and the Glu1871-Leu1872 bond, respectively. Intact, undigested aggrecan was not detected with any of the antibodies. Specificity of the antibodies was determined in competitive ELISA using synthetic peptide antigens as inhibitors (TableI). Only the immunizing peptide for each antibody blocked binding to the antigen, whereas the spanning peptide did not block binding indicating that the antibodies do not recognize the same sequence when present within the uncleaved protein. Equally important, peptides designed for one antibody did not block binding of the other antibodies, despite sequence similarity. In human (and rat) aggrecan, the GELE COOH-terminal neo-epitope of the bovine aggrecan fragment generated by cleavage at the Glu1480-Gly1481 bond is SELE with a single amino acid substitution of Ser for Gly (Fig. 1). Interestingly, an antibody raised against the SELE neo-epitope does not recognize the GELE COOH terminus on the bovine aggrecan fragment, illustrating the high degree of specificity of these antibodies.Table ISpecificity of aggrecan neoepitope antibodiesBlocking peptideAntibody reactivity (A405)KEEEGELEARGSGLGSAGEGLGQRNone0.580.750.370.830.540.65PTTFKEEEGLGSVELS0.560.740.340.820.590.67PTTFKEEE0.020.720.370.810.580.66GLGSVELS0.590.720.340.010.540.62ATTAGELEGRGTIDIS0.600.780.390.850.520.61ATTAGELE0.560.000.340.820.540.63RNITEGEARGSVIL0.520.710.350.820.550.62ARGSVIL0.590.730.000.810.550.67TQAPTAQEAGEGPSGI0.520.780.350.830.530.61AGEGPSGI0.570.690.320.840.000.63TEPTVSQELGQRPPVT0.610.720.330.820.520.65LGQRPPVT0.540.710.340.800.520.00Specificity of the neoepitope antibodies was evaluated by ELISA.

A rabbit IgG second antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added, and binding was assessed using ap-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and monitoring OD at 405 nm. Nasal septa were removed from bovine noses obtained fresh from slaughter. The cartilage was sliced and aggrecan was extracted by stirring at 4 °C for 48 h in 10 volumes of 4 m guanidine-HCl in 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, containing the protease inhibitors, 0.01 mEDTA, 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 2 mmphenymethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05 m benzamidine-HCl. Aggrecan monomers were isolated by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in cesium chloride (20.Hascall V.C. Sajdera S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2384-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the bottom of this gradient (d > 1.54 g/ml) containing aggrecan monomers was dialyzed at 4 °C against water, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Digestions were carried out in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2. Purified bovine aggrecan (500 nm) was incubated with recombinant human aggrecanase-1 at 37 °C for the indicated times. The reactions were quenched with EDTA and products analyzed by immunolocation in a Western blot analysis. Aggrecan fragments digested with aggrecanase-1 were NH2 terminally sequenced at Argo Bioanalytical Inc. (Morristown, NJ). The NH2-terminal sequence analyses were performed using a Hewlett-Packard G1005A NH2-terminal sequencer. These analyses of polyvinylidene difluoride-blotted protein were carried out using a modification of the Hewlett-Packard Routine 3.0 Sequencing Methods (21.Miller C.G. Methods. 1994; 6: 315-333Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For analysis of fragments by Western blot, aggrecan was enzymatically deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 units/10 μg of aggrecan) for 1 h at 37 °C and then with keratanase (0.1 units/10 μg of aggrecan) and keratanase II (0.002 units/10 μg of aggrecan) for 2 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 6.5. After digestion the aggrecan was precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone and reconstituted in 30 μl of Tris glycine-SDS sample buffer containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated for 3 min at 100 °C. 20 μg of glycosaminoglycan from each sample was loaded on a 4–12% Tris glycine gel and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunolocated with a 1:1000 dilution of one of the neo-epitope antibodies conditions or a 1:10,000 dilution of antibody mAB2035. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate as the secondary antibody. Products were visualized by developing the blots in nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color developing reagent. NITEGE Western analysis was performed as described previously (12.Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayaia J. Kimura J.H. Williams H.R. Mumford R.A. Flannery C.R. Carisoni S.S. Iwatai M. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2550-2556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Overnight transfer resulted in complete transfer of both low and high molecular fragments and the densitometric response was found to be linear over the density ranges required for the blots. The immunoreactive bands were quantified by scanning densitometry. For comparison of production of GELE- and KEEE-reactive fragments at early time points, conditions were adjusted to provide equal reactivity (i.e. intensity of staining) for equivalent amounts of antigen. The affinity of the antibodies was determined by ELISA. The immunizing peptide for each antibody was linked to biotin at the NH2 terminus and at a concentration of 10 nmwas immobilized on a 96-well streptavidin-coated plate. Varying concentrations of each antibody ranging from a 1:10 to a 1:100,000 dilution were added followed by a rabbit IgG second antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Binding was assessed using ap-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and monitoring OD at 405 nm. The antibodies exhibited different affinities for their respective antigen based on OD. Therefore, in order to attain equal reactivity for the Western analysis, the dilution of each antibody that yielded an OD of 0.5 was used. For the KEEE antibody a 1:20000 dilution and for the GELE antibody a dilution of 1:10000 was used. Three sites of cleavage by aggrecanase-1 were identified within bovine aggrecan (Fig. 2). We first examined the ability of aggrecanase-1 to cleave at the traditional aggrecanase site, between Glu373-Ala374. Aggrecanase-1 was incubated with bovine aggrecan monomers at 37 °C for various amounts of time ranging from 0 to 20 h. The products were then analyzed using both the anti-ARGS monoclonal antibody, BC-3, that recognizes the new NH2 terminus and the anti-NITEGE monoclonal antibody that recognizes the new COOH terminus, on aggrecan fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site. Western analysis showed the appearance of a 250-kDa BC-3-reactive fragment at 1 h that increased in band intensity over time (Fig.3 A). As expected, a NITEGE-reactive fragment was generated simultaneously with the BC-3 epitope (Fig. 3 B) supporting cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond by aggrecanase. The band of aggrecan fragments expressing the NITEGE epitope appeared as a doublet between 64 and 70 kDa, consistent with the G1-NITEGE products previously obtained following IL-1 treatment of bovine chondrocytes (12.Lark M.W.

Although faint NITEGE-reactive bands were visible at 15 and 30 min whereas the BC-3 band was not detected until 1 h, this is likely due to differences in sensitivity of the two antibodies.Figure 3Identification of aggrecan cleavage at the TEGE373–374ARGS bond and the KEEE1667–1668GLGS bond.

Following incubation the product was analyzed for by Western blot analysis for (A) BC-3-reactive fragments, (B) NITEGE-reactive fragments, (C) MAB2035-reactive fragments containing chondroitin sulfate stubs, and (D) KEEE-reactive fragments.

Within 15 min the 500-kDa fragment was converted to two major fragments, including a 375- and 140-kDa fragment. Over time the 375-kDa band was converted to a 250-kDa fragment corresponding with the BC-3-reactive 250-kDa band. By 20 h there was ∼50% conversion of the 375-kDa fragment to the 250-kDa fragment. Interestingly, neither the 375- nor the 140-kDa bands that appeared before the 250-kDa band reacted with the BC-3 antibody. These data indicate that aggrecanase-1 preferentially cleaves aggrecan at an alternative site within the aggrecan molecule. In order to determine the preferential site of cleavage, the three major fragments (375, 250, and 140 kDa) generated by aggrecanase-1 were assessed by NH2-terminal sequencing. As expected, the intact 500-kDa band was found to have the NH2 terminus VEVSE that corresponds to the NH2 terminus of native, intact bovine aggrecan (Fig. 3 C). The 375-kDa fragment was also found to have the NH2 terminus VEVSE, indicating that this fragment has an intact NH2 terminus, and thus the preferential site of cleavage by aggrecanase is within the COOH terminus of the aggrecan molecule. The 250-kDa fragment was found to have the NH2 terminus ARGSV indicating that this fragment is the result of aggrecanase-1 cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 site consistent with the BC-3 Western blot that shows the 250-kDa fragment reacts with the BC-3 antibody. Finally, the 140-kDa fragment, presumably generated by cleavage of aggrecan at the preferential site was found to have the NH2 terminus GLGS. This sequence is located within the chondroitin sulfate-rich region between the G2 and G3 globular domains. These data suggest that the preferential site of cleavage is between Glu1667-Gly1668 which would result in the formation of two large fragments, a 375-kDa fragment with an intact NH2 terminus and a new COOH terminus, KEEE, and a 140-kDa fragment with an intact COOH terminus and a new NH2terminus, GLGS. In order to confirm cleavage at the Glu1667-Gly1668 site, a neo-epitope antibody was generated to recognize the KEEE COOH terminus. This KEEE antibody was then used in a Western analysis to follow the aggrecanase-1-mediated cleavage of bovine aggrecan over time. The KEEE Western blot showed the appearance of a 375-kDa fragment within 15 min (Fig. 3 D) that corresponds to a 375-kDa fragment detected in the CSPG Western (Fig. 3 C). However, over time the 375-kDa fragment began to undergo conversion to a 55-kDa fragment. By 2 h the 375-kDa KEEE-reactive fragment was completely converted to the 55-kDa band. The 55-kDa fragment did not react with the BC-3 antibody, suggesting that there is another cleavage in addition to that at Glu1667-Gly1668 that occurs faster than at the Glu373-Ala374 bond. Based on molecular mass and the fact that this fragment reacts with the KEEE antibody, suggests that the other cleavage site is downstream from the Glu1667-Gly1668 cleavage site. Based on sequence homology, the most likely site of aggrecanase-1 cleavage would be at Glu1480-Gly1481. To confirm that this was the site of cleavage resulting in the production of the 55-kDa fragment, a neo-epitope antibody was produced to recognize the COOH terminus GELE that would be produced by cleavage at the Glu1480-Gly1481 bond. This antibody was then used in a Western blot analysis to follow cleavage of bovine aggrecan. The GELE Western blot showed the appearance of a 375-kDa fragment within 15 min (Fig.4 A) that corresponds to a 375-kDa fragment detected in the CSPG Western (Fig. 4 B). Over time, the 375-kDa fragment began to convert to a 250-kDa fragment that reacted with the GELE antibody, confirming that this fragment had undergone cleavage at the Glu1480-Gly1481 bond. By 8 h, 50% of the product represented the 375-kDa GELE-reactive fragment and 50% represented the 250-kDa GELE-reactive fragment. This 250-kDa fragment also reacted with the BC-3 antibody (Fig.4 C), indicating that the 250-kDa fragment has the NH2 terminus ARGS and the COOH terminus GELE. Thus, based on these data, aggrecanase-1 cleaves aggrecan preferentially at two sites within the COOH terminus of aggrecan. Cleavage results in the formation of a 140-kDa fragment with an intact COOH terminus and the new NH2 terminus, GLGS, a 55-kDa fragment with the new NH2 terminus, GRGT, and a new COOH terminus, KEEE, and a 375-kDa fragment with an intact NH2 terminus and a COOH terminus of either KEEE or GELE. Based on these data, it is clear that the 375-kDa fragment detected in the CSPG blot is a fine doublet containing two product species. The data also suggest that the 375-kDa KEEE fragment is a short-lived intermediate, based on its rapid conversion to the 55-kDa fragment (Fig. 3 D). The persistence of the 375-kDa GELE fragment for longer times (Fig. 4 A) suggests that it is a more stable intermediate, and most likely the major component of the bands detected with mAB 3025 in Figs.3 C and 4 B. In order to determine whether the greater rate of cleavage within the CS-rich region occurred at Glu1667-Gly1668 or Glu1480-Gly1481, aggrecanase-1-mediated cleavage was evaluated at early time periods. For these studies, antibody concentrations were used which resulted in equal reactivity of the KEEE and GELE antibodies with there respective antigens. The 375-kDa KEEE-reactive fragment appeared in less than 3 min (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the 375-kDa GELE-reactive fragment did not appear until 24 min (Fig.5 B), well after the appearance of the KEEE-reactive fragment. This was followed by cleavage of the 375-kDa fragment within the IGD at the Glu373-Ala374 site to form the 250-kDa GELE-reactive fragment (Fig. 5 B). These data collectively demonstrate that aggrecanase-1 cleaves faster at the Glu1667-Gly1668 than at the Glu1480-Gly1481 site (Fig. 2). We next evaluated processing of the 140-kDa G3 fragment with the NH2 terminus GLGS, formed by the preferential cleavage at the Glu1667-Gly1668 site (Fig.6). In order to determine the fate this fragment, a neo-epitope antibody to the NH2 terminus GLGS was used to follow cleavage. A 140-kDa GLGS-reactive fragment was detectable following digestion for 5 min (Fig.7 A). Band intensity increased over time, peaking at 30 min. However, after 60 min this fragment began to decrease in intensity and by 6 h no band was detected. The disappearance of the 140-kDa band did not correspond with the appearance of smaller molecular fragments using 4–12% Tris glycine gels, which have a molecular mass range between 400 and 36 kDa, suggesting that the resulting fragment(s) were les"

In mammalian cells, in Drosophila, and presumably in other multicellular eukaryotes, this temporal control of transcription is primarily regulated by the members of the E2F family of transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 1.Dyson N.

Among these genes, those coding for Cdc6, Mcm proteins, thymidine kinase, dehydrofolate reductase, Orc1, DNA polymerase α, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were demonstrated to be induced by exogenous E2F (5.Vigo E.

Furthermore, binding sites for E2F are present also in the promoters of several other important cell cycle regulators such as cdc-2 (8.Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), cyclin A (9.Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Berges J. Helin K. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

E2F was originally identified as a cellular transcription factor required for the transactivation of the adenovirus E2 promoter by the E1A oncoproteins (12.Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). E2F consists of a family of related proteins of which six distinct members have been found to date in mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar and 3.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific DNA recognition and interaction is mediated by a DNA binding domain conserved in E2F-1 to -6. All six E2Fs contain also a leucine zipper dimerization domain and bind DNA preferentially as heterodimers with a subunit encoded by the DP family of genes, which are distantly related to the E2F family; heterodimerization with DP-1 and DP-2 markedly enhances E2F affinity for DNA. In vivo studies have confirmed that the endogenous E2F activity is generated from the combined properties of multiple E2F-DP proteins (13.Wu C.L. Zukerberg L.R. Ngwu C. Harlow E. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2536-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 14.Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The E2F transactivation domain consists of about 60 amino acids located at the C terminus of E2F-1 to -5 but lacking in E2F-6, the most recently discovered E2F family member. Accordingly, E2F-6 appears to behave as an inhibitor of E2F transcription, apparently by competing for promoter binding with the other E2Fs (15.Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16.Morkel M. Wenkel J. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Hagemeier C.

E2F activity is controlled by members of the retinoblastoma protein (RB)1 family, namely the tumor suppressor pRB (18.Bagchi S. Weinmann R. Raychaudhuri P.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2392-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). A short, highly conserved domain embedded in the E2F transactivation domain mediates binding to the pRB family proteins, resulting in inhibition of E2F transactivation. This inhibitory effect is relieved in mid to late G1, when pRB family members become phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Phosphorylation of pRB determines dissociation from E2F, transcriptional activation of E2F-regulated genes, and consequent progression through the cell cycle (reviewed in Refs. 1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar, 2.Nevins J.R. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Leone G.

E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 appear to belong to a structurally and functionally distinct E2F subfamily. This partition is also corroborated by their pattern of expression during the cell cycle and their nuclear localization. Thus, E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 are induced in late G1 and, due to a N-terminal nuclear localization signal, are found exclusively in the nucleus when overexpressed (3.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In contrast, the levels of E2F-4 and E2F-5 do not undergo major fluctuations, and these factors do not have a nuclear localization signal. The behavior of E2F-6 is still not completely clear, but it does not appear to be regulated by pRB (15.Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17.Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Verona R. Moberg K. Andon N. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2850-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, a converging body of evidence suggests that histone-modifying enzymes may play a pivotal role in mediating and modulating E2F transactivation and inhibition by pRB. E2F was found to interact in vitro and to be synergistically activated by the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP; Ref. 24.Trouche D. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4139-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a transcriptional co-activator that, similar to the closely related p300 protein, has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (25.Ogryzko V.V.

Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of E2F-responsive promoters by pRB was recently shown to involve the recruitment of histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1; Refs. 27.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I.

Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). HATs and HDACs are thought to activate and repress transcription, respectively, by relaxing or compacting the chromatin scaffold at cellular promoters. Acetylated histones are a characteristic feature of transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas hypoacetylated histones accumulate within transcriptionally silenced domains (reviewed in Refs.30.Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 31.Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem.

Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In addition to histones, few non-histone proteins have recently been discovered to be targets for acetylation by HATs, including TFIIEβ and TFIIF (34.Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), p53 (35.Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar), GATA-1 (36.Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and the erythroid Krüppel-like factor (37.Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Also for these proteins, acetylation is specific for lysine residues. The transcription factor acetyltransferase (35.Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar) activity of HAT enzymes has opened an important new perspective to our current understanding of transcriptional regulation of gene expression and have suggested novel mechanisms for the fine tuning of transcription factor activity. By a combination of biochemical as well functional assays, here we show that E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 (but not E2F-4, E2F-5, and E2F-6) are acetylated by the p300/CBP acetyltransferases and that acetylation markedly increases the specific DNA binding activity of E2F-1 and stimulates its transcriptional activity. We also show that acetylation of E2F-1 can be reversed by HDAC-1, thus providing for the first time evidence that also non-histone proteins are substrates for histone deacetylase enzymes.

B, overexpression of CPB HAT enhances wild type E2F-1 transactivation. Transcriptional activation of an E2F-responsive promoter was studied in Saos-2 cells after transfection of different amounts of expression vectors for wild type E2F-1, E2F-1 K117R/K120R/K125R and E2F-4, in the presence or absence of an expression plasmid for CBP, as indicated.

To determine whether histone acetylation is indeed involved in the regulation of E2F functions, we investigated the ability of E2F-1 to associate with a nuclear HAT. Recombinant E2F-1 purified from bacteria as a GST fusion protein was used in in vitro binding experiments after incubation with Dignam nuclear extract. The E2F-1-bound proteins were subsequently incubated with purified histones in the presence of radioactive acetyl-CoA to determine their HAT activity. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig.1 A, an E2F-1-associated nuclear HAT activity acetylated all the four core histones (H3, H2b, H2a, and H4; Fig. 1 A, lower panel). Interestingly, also the band corresponding to GST-E2F-1 was significantly labeled, suggesting that E2F-1 is itself a target for acetylation (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). The site of acetylation within the 437 amino acids of E2F-1 was mapped using a panel of E2F-1 GST fusion fragments spanning the full-length protein. The fragments were incubated with Dignam nuclear extract and radioactive acetyl-CoA and treated as above (Fig. 1 B). Acetylation was detected in the N-terminal half of the protein and restricted to the region between amino acids 109 and 127 (Fig.1 C). Protein acetylation by HATs is specific for lysine residues (50.Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). Three lysines (Lys-117, Lys-120, and Lys-125) are present in the E2F-1 region encompassing amino acids 109–127. As shown in Fig. 1 D, arginine substitution at all three lysines abolished acetylation, whereas mutations of two out of the three residues still allowed acetylation, although to a lower extent. These results indicate that all three lysines can serve as substrate for acetylation and that these are the only acetylated residues in the protein. An alignment of the sequences of the other E2F proteins corresponding to aa 109–127 of E2F-1 revealed that lysines 117, 120, and 125 of E2F-1 are conserved also in E2F-2 and E2F-3 but not in E2F-4, E2F-5, and E2F-6 (Fig.2 A). This prompted us to investigate whether these other members of the E2F family were also acetylated. As shown in Fig. 2 B, and in agreement with the conservation of the three lysines in E2F-2 and E2F-3, these proteins were also acetylated. In contrast, we were not able to detect any acetylation of E2F-4, E2F-5, and E2F-6, suggesting that acetylation is restricted to a subset of E2F family members. In addition, we also found that DP-1 was not acetylated in this assay (data not shown). As apparent in thelower panel of Fig. 1 A, E2F-1 is acetylated by a HAT activity specific for all the four core histones. Among the nuclear HATs to date identified and characterized, p300 and the closely related CBP proteins are the only enzymes with this substrate specificity (reviewed in Ref. 51.Giles R.H. Peters D.J.M. Breuning M.H. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition, earlier studies using truncated proteins have shown that E2F-1 is able to bind CBP in vitro(24.Trouche D. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4139-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the ability of all six full-length E2F family members and lysine mutants to interact with p300 in vitro. Recombinant E2F proteins were incubated with35S-labeled p300, and the amount of bound p300 was detected by autoradiography after separation by electrophoresis (Fig.3 A). We discovered that only E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 were able to bind p300 efficiently, a finding in good agreement with the results of our acetylation studies. Interestingly, the triple lysine mutant that is not acetylated showed unaltered affinity for p300 as compared with wild type E2F-1. This demonstrates that the substitution of arginines for lysines has not destroyed the overall structure of the protein and that binding to p300 is not sufficient to induce modification of any other lysine residue present in the protein. To ascertain that endogenous p300/CBP HATs could acetylate E2F, we immunoprecipitated p300 and CBP from nuclear extract and showed that both immunoprecipitates contained proteins capable of acetylating E2F-1 as well as the four core histones (Fig. 3 B). Acetylation was substrate-specific, as unrelated proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) remained unmodified. Acetylation of E2F-1 was also obtained with a recombinant fragment of CBP containing the HAT domain, thus confirming the immunoprecipitation results (Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that E2F-1 is acetylated by p300/CBP. The p300 binding and acetylation results obtained for the different E2F members and for the E2F-1 mutants are summarized in Fig.4. The action of HATs on histones can be reversed by HDACs, the prototype of which is HDAC-1 (52.Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). So far, no evidence is available that HDACs can also act on non-histone substrates. Therefore, we set out to investigate whether E2F could be a substrate for this class of enzymes. A fragment of E2F-1 containing lysines 117, 120, and 125 (aa 41–127) was acetylatedin vitro by immunoprecipitated p300 and CBP in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA. Subsequently, the radioactive acetyl-CoA was removed, and the modified protein was incubated with HDAC-1 immunoprecipitated from Dignam nuclear extract. After separation by SDS-PAGE, acetylation was detected by autoradiography. Similar to histone acetylation, acetylation of E2F-1 by p300 and CBP could be reversed by a subsequent incubation with immunoprecipitated HDAC-1 (Fig. 5). The enzymatic activity of the latter enzyme was confirmed by its ability to deacetylate p300- and CBP-acetylated histones (data not shown). The fact that immunoprecipitated CBP appears to acetylate E2F-1 more strongly than immunoprecipitated p300 depends on the properties of the two antibodies used in the assay and does not reflect a better efficiency of acetylation. What is the functional relevance of E2F acetylation? To date, only few non-histone proteins have been demonstrated to be acetylated (34.Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). For some of these proteins, including p53 (35.Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar) and GATA-1 (36.Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), acetylation was shown to lead to increased DNA binding. Since the three acetylated lysines in E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 are located at the N-terminal boundary of the DNA-binding domain of these proteins (53.Zheng N. Fraenkel E. Pabo C.O. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that acetylation altered the affinity of E2F for its binding site. E2F-1 was incubated with recombinant CBP in the absence or presence of acetyl-CoA. The latter incubation was also carried out separately using [14C]acetyl-CoA to monitor acetylation efficiency (data not shown). After incubation, increasing amounts of the reactions were assayed for binding to a consensus E2F DNA-binding site. Fig.6 A shows that acetylation of E2F-1 led to a marked increase in the affinity for its binding site as compared with the mock-acetylated protein. To determine whether these in vitro observations are also relevant in vivo, we investigated the E2F DNA binding activity in nuclear extracts of cells overexpressing CBP. Both the binding activity of endogenous E2F and that of transfected E2F-1 were clearly augmented by transfection of an expression plasmid for CBP (Fig. 6 B). The functional consequences of the increased DNA binding were also tested on the transcriptional activation of an E2F-responsive promoter (Fig. 7 A). To prevent interference due to the recruitment of histone deacetylases to the promoter through pRB, these experiments were performed in the pRB-negative Saos-2 cell line. Co-transfection of a CBP expression plasmid in these cells resulted in a clear increase in E2F-1 transactivation (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, transactivation by the E2F-1 mutant with substitutions of lysines 117, 120, and 125 to arginines (which binds to but is not acetylated by p300/CBP) and of E2F-4 (which neither binds to nor is acetylated by p300/CBP) were both only minimally affected by CBP co-transfection (Fig. 7 B). Altogether, these data highlight the importance of E2F-1 acetylation in response to CBP co-activation. Interestingly, the triple mutant showed increased basal transactivation in the absence of CBP as compared with wild type E2F-1. This result is possibly related to the different stability of this mutant protein (54.Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.-M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The E2F family of transcription factors plays a critical role in the regulation of the cell proliferation by controlling transcription of several genes, whose timely expression is necessary for the ordered progression through the cell cycle. The responsiveness of their promoters to E2F ensures that this whole set of genes is simultaneously activated at the exact time their products are required in the cell cycle (reviewed in Refs. 1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar and 3.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Given this pivotal role, it is not surprising that E2F activity is strictly kept in check by a complex inhibitory mechanism that starts to be elucidated. Silencing of E2F transactivating potential is in part mediated by pRB proteins and is abrogated in mid to late G1 to ensure that the growth-suppressive properties of pRB become inactivated (reviewed in Ref. 55.Taya Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Since the pRB-binding domain of E2F is embedded in its transactivating domain, it has been proposed that inhibition by pRB is the consequence of a masking effect that negatively affects the physical interaction of E2F with the basal transcriptional machinery, in particular with TFIID and TFIIA (56.Hagemeier C. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 57.Emili A. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13674-13680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 58.Ross J.F. Liu X. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 195-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several data have suggested that pBR represses E2F activity also through an active mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar), which has been recently demonstrated to involve HDAC-1. Three independent studies have shown that HDAC-1 is associated with E2F-1 via pRB and that its deacetylase activity is required for inhibition of E2F activity (27.Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P. Troalen F. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. Nature. 1998; 391: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 28.Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The evidence that chromatin-modifying enzymes are involved in the regulation of E2F has led to a model according to which repression or activation of E2F-responsive genes is also dependent on the acetylation state of the nucleosomes at their promoters. Consistently, it has been earlier demonstrated that E2F-1 can interact in vitro with a fragment of CBP (24.Trouche D. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4139-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a general transcriptional co-activator having histone acetyltransferase activity (25.Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar, 26.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). The findings presented here add more complexity to the notion that acetylases and deacetylases are involved in the regulation of E2F function. In fact, they indicate that not only modification of chromatin by these enzymes but also modification of E2F itself is likely to play a role in the transcriptional regulation of E2F-controlled genes. E2F-1 is specifically acetylated at lysines at positions 117, 120, and 125 by p300 and CBP. The acetylation of E2F-1 by these enzymes is direct, since acetylation of a recombinant E2F-1 substrate containing the three lysines was detected both by using p300 and CBP immunoprecipitates and a recombinant fragment of CBP. Interestingly, substitution of lysines 117, 120, and 125 of E2F-1 with arginines abolishes its acetylation but not its binding to p300/CBP. Consistent with the binding and acetylation data, transfection of an expression vector for CBP in pRB-negative Saos-2 cells markedly increased transcriptional activation of an E2F-responsible promoter by E2F-1 but not by E2F-4. In the same assay, the construct in which the three lysines being the targets for acetylation were substituted with arginines did not respond to CBP co-transfection. The same mutant, however, was still proficient in the transactivation of the E2F-responsive promoter. This evidence suggests that E2F-1 acetylation is probably not required per se for transcriptional activation, whereas it is important to mediate p300/CBP co-activation. The three lysines acetylated by p300/CBP are located at the N-terminal boundary of the DNA-binding domain of E2F-1, and acetylation leads to a marked increase in affinity of E2F-1 for its DNA consensus binding site. This result is functionally similar to the findings reported for p53 and GATA-1. For p53, acetylation occurs in the C-terminal domain of the protein, a region that interacts with the DNA-binding domain and locks it in an active conformation (35.Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar). In GATA-1, the lysines acetylated by p300/CBP lie within the DNA-binding region of the factor (36.Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Similar to our results on E2F-1, the acetylation of p53 and GATA-1 dramatically increases their affinity to their respective consensus DNA-binding sites. In this respect, it is noteworthy that, although the net negative charge of these proteins is increased by acetylation, the overall functional consequence is a marked increase in DNA binding. It can be envisaged that the increase in DNA affinity results from a conformational change induced by the addition of acetyl groups, which in turn favors the formation of more stable protein-DNA interactions. The finding that only E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 bind to p300/CBP, contain the lysine residues at positions 117, 120, and 125, and are substrates for acetylation further highlights the notion that these three factors belong to a subgroup of the E2F family. Contrary to E2F-4 and E2F-5, these factors are not present in G0 or early G1; they bind directly to cyclin A; they only bind pRB and not p107/p130; and they display a different pattern of expression during development (reviewed in Refs. 1.Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar and 3.Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To what extent these functional differences could be related to the differential acetylation of these factors will clearly need further consideration. In this respect, it is interesting to observe that not only E2F-1 is a substrate for acetylation by p300/CBP but that acetylated E2F-1 is also a substrate for deacetylation for HDAC-1. This observation again supports and reinforces the notion that activation and suppression of E2F transcription by acetylation is likely to be a tunable process for the regulation of this DNA binding factor. Although this is the first, and so far the only (59.Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) demonstration that acetylation of non-histone proteins is in fact reversible and that HDAC enzymes can also act on a non-histone substrate, it might be envisaged that reversible acetylation will turn out to be a general mechanism for post-translational protein regulation. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that the distinct structural organization of the E2F family members determines a different susceptibility to acetylation by the p300/CBP acetyltransferases and that acetylation of E2F-1 markedly activates its biochemical function. This is a novel mechanism of regulation of E2F function, distinct both from the modulation of chromatin conformation mediated by histone acetylation and deacetylation (24.Trouche D. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4139-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

The main target cells activated by these bacterial components are monocytes and macrophages, which are activated through two pattern recognition receptors, CD14 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (1.Dziarski R.

So far, only bacterially induced expression of individual genes or of small groups of genes has been studied, and expression of a large number of genes induced by bacterial and nonbacterial activators has not been simultaneously compared. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the expression patterns of a large number of genes in human monocytes exposed to bacteria or to the main components of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (PGN and LPS, respectively), using a 600-cDNA gene array. This unbiased approach was then used to compare the gene expression patterns induced by bacterial and nonbacterial monocyte activators and to measure which genes are the most strongly induced by bacterial and nonbacterial activators. Since the highest induced genes were the genes for proinflammatory mediators, we then compared the amounts of different mediators induced by bacterial stimulants. Soluble PGN was purified by vancomycin affinity chromatography from Staphylococcus aureus Rb and contained <24 pg of endotoxin/mg of PGN (17.Takeuchi O. Hoshino K Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2780) Google Scholar). S. aureus Rb cells were killed with gentamicin (800 μg/ml, 37 °C, 2 h) and contained <10 pg of endotoxin/106 cells (18.Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). LPS fromSalmonella minnesota Re 595 (a minimal naturally occurring endotoxic structure of LPS) was from Sigma. Human recombinant interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was produced in baculovirus-infectedTrichoplusia ni cells (specific activity, 0.8–4 × 107 units/ml; endotoxin content, <0.15 ng/μg; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Human blood monocytes, obtained from healthy males (24–49 years old of Caucasian, Asian, or African-American origin) by Histopaque (density 1.077 g/ml; Sigma) centrifugation and adherence to plastic (19.Jin Y. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 1629-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (>95% pure by phagocytosis of Latex and nonspecific esterase), were cultured at 106cells/cm2 in Falcon 3003 plates (for RNA isolation) or 96-well plates (for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) in RPMI 1640 with 10% autologous or pooled human donor AB serum (Sigma). Stable CD14 transfectants of human monocytic cell line THP-1/CD14 (20.Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), obtained from Peter Tobias (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. Medium (control) or optimal stimulatory concentrations of PGN (10 μg/ml), S. aureus (4 × 108 cells/ml), LPS (10 ng/ml for monocytes and 100 ng/ml for THP-1/CD14 cells), or IFN-γ (100 ng/ml) were added for the lengths of time indicated under “Results.” Total RNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform method (21.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) and digested for 1 h at 37 °C with DNase I using the MessageClean kit (Gene Hunter, Nashville, TN). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography using the QIAGEN (Valencia, CA) Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit. To synthesize cDNA from poly(A)+ RNA, 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was mixed with 1 μl of 10× CDS primer mix, incubated in a preheated thermal cycler at 70 °C for 2 min and at 50 °C for 2 min and then incubated at 50 °C for 25 min with a mixture of 5× reaction buffer, 10× dNTP, 3000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]dATP, 0.5 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in a total volume of 10 μl. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 10× termination mix, and cDNA was purified on a Chroma Spin-200 column (CLONTECH). The Atlas human cDNA array membranes (CLONTECH) contained 588 inducible test genes (including oncogenes, tumor suppressors, cell cycle regulators, ion channels and transport, intracellular signal transduction modulators and effectors, stress response, apoptosis, DNA synthesis, repair and recombination, transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins, receptors, cell surface antigens, cell adhesins, and cell-cell communication proteins), nine housekeeping genes, and three negative controls (the list of genes, their position on the membrane, and their GenBankTM accession numbers can be obtained on the World Wide Web). Prehybridization was performed at 68 °C for 30 min in 10 ml of ExpressHyb buffer with 1.5 mg of sheared salmon sperm DNA for 30 min and hybridization was performed at 68 °C overnight with 1–5 × 107 cpm of denatured cDNA probe, as recommended by the manufacturer. The membranes were washed at 68 °C to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS, and subjected to autoradiography. Each spot was quantified by Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440CF and Image Analysis Software version 3.0. The results were then normalized based on hybridization to two housekeeping genes (actin and ribosomal protein S9) whose expression did not change upon stimulation (with the exception of IFN-γ, for which only S9 was used, because expression of actin mRNA was enhanced by IFN-γ), which allowed direct comparison of the results from different membranes and donors. Sets of human chemokine and cytokine template DNA probes (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), containing mixtures of linearized plasmids ready for use as templates for in vitrosynthesis of antisense RNA, were transcribed into antisense RNA for 6 h at 37 °C with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of unlabeled ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP using Ambion (Austin, TX) MAXIscript and MEGAscript kits. The probes were digested with DNase I (2000 units/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min, extracted with phenol, precipitated with LiCl and isopropyl alcohol, and purified by elution from 8m urea polyacrylamide gels and precipitation with ammonium acetate and ethanol. The purified antisense RNA probes were labeled with psoralen-biotin using the Ambion BrightStar Psoralen-Biotin Nonisotopic Labeling Kit. Briefly, 0.5 μg of RNA was incubated for 45 min under 365-nm UV light with psoralen-biotin on ice, and the labeled probes were purified by H2O-saturated n-butyl alcohol extraction and stored at −70 °C. The chemokine template set included eight chemokines, lymphotactin, RANTES, IP-10, MIP-1β, MIP-1α, MCP-1, IL-8, and I-309 and two housekeeping genes, L32 and GAPDH, with the following lengths of RNA transcripts: 433, 390, 349, 314, 256, 231, 204, 191, 141, and 125 bases, respectively. The cytokine template set included nine cytokines, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1Ra, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, IFN-γ, and two housekeeping genes, L32 and GAPDH, with the following lengths of RNA transcripts: 389, 349, 314, 283, 257, 230, 222, 211, 173, 141, and 125 bases, respectively. RNA from monocytes was hybridized to the labeled RNA probes using Ambion RPA III Ribonuclease Protection Assay kit (or Ambion Hybspeed RPA kit). Briefly, RNA (5 μg from monocytes or 10 μg from THP-1/CD14 cells) was mixed with 50 μg of yeast RNA and 10 ng of labeled antisense RNA probe set, precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol, dissolved in 10 μl of hybridization buffer, heated to 95 °C for 4 min, and incubated at 56 °C for 16 h (or at 68 °C for 3 h for Hybspeed kit). The hybridized RNAs were digested with RNase (T1, 500 units/ml; A, 0.25 units/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, and the undigested (protected) RNA was precipitated with ethanol, subjected to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 8m urea, transferred onto nylon membranes, cross-linked with UV, and air-dried. The protected RNA fragments were then detected with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and a BrightStar BioDetect nonisotopic detection kit (Ambion), as recommended by the manufacturer, and a Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440CF. Hybridization of cellular RNA with specific RNA probes protects labeled RNA probes from RNase digestion and yields protected probe fragments, which are 20–30 nucleotides shorter than the unprotected probes. RNA molecular weight markers of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, and 1000 bases were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase from Ambion RNA Century Marker Plus templates. The quantitative results were normalized based on two housekeeping genes (L32 and GAPDH). This allowed direct comparison of the results from different membranes and donors, including comparing the amounts of chemokine RNA with cytokine RNA. Chemokine and cytokine concentrations in culture supernatants were determined by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with monoclonal anti-human IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IL-1β (from R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), or MCP-1 (from Pharmingen) capture antibodies, and polyclonal biotinylated detection antibodies (from R&D Systems or Pharmingen, respectively), as recommended by the manufacturers. TNF-α concentrations were determined using the L929 cytotoxicity assay described previously (22.Gupta D. Jin Y. Dziarski R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2620-2630PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of human monocytes with PGN, S. aureus, or LPS resulted in activation of over 120 genes, out of 600 genes tested (Fig. 1). Quantification of the amount of RNA induced revealed that 12–15 genes were very strongly induced (10–50-fold increase over the control), 20–25 genes showed intermediate induction (5–10-fold increase), and the remaining 80–90 genes showed lower induction (2–5-fold increase) (Fig.2).Figure 2Chemokines are the highest induced genes in PGN -, S. aureus-, and LPS -, but not in IFN -γ-stimulated monocytes. Expression of the top 40 genes on Atlas cDNA arrays (prepared as in Fig. 1) was quantified and normalized based on two housekeeping genes. For IFN-γ, 20 of the same genes shown for bacterial stimulants are followed by the top 20 genes that were induced by IFN-γ. The results are means from three different donors and three lots of membranes (two donors and two membranes for IFN-γ). The S.E. values were less than 15% and are not shown.

Genes for chemokines IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-2α, MIP-1β, and MCP-1 were the five highest activated proinflammatory genes induced by PGN (higher than the cytokine genes). Genes for chemokines IL-8 and MIP-1α were also the two highest induced proinflammatory genes by S. aureus cells and LPS, and genes for other chemokines (MIP-2α, MIP-1β, and MCP-1) were also induced as high or higher than the cytokine genes (TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6, which are usually assumed to be the most highly induced proinflammatory mediators by bacterial products; see Refs. 1.Dziarski R.

Other genes highly induced by bacterial stimulants included HLA class I, MRP-14, MRP-8, thymosin β-10, and Y-box-binding protein-1 (Fig. 2). The gene expression patterns induced by PGN, S. aureus, and LPS were similar, but not identical, i.e. each stimulus induced a unique gene expression pattern that was reproducible in separate experiments on different donors. For example, the TNF-α gene was induced less by PGN than by LPS and S. aureus, DB-1 gene was induced more by LPS than by PGN and S. aureus, and the MCP-1 gene was induced more by PGN and LPS than by S. aureus(Figs. 1 and 2). A nonbacterial monocyte activator, IFN-γ, induced more than 200 genes in human monocytes. However, the gene expression pattern induced by IFN-γ was completely different from the gene expression pattern induced by the bacterial stimulants (Figs. 1 and 2). Out of the top five chemokine genes that were most strongly induced by the bacterial stimuli, IFN-γ strongly induced expression of only MCP-1, whereas other chemokine genes (IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-2α, and MIP-1β) were not induced or were much less induced by IFN-γ. These results are consistent with the previously reported high induction of MCP-1, but not IL-8, by IFN-γ in human macrophages (23.Bauermeister K. Burger M. Almanasreh N. Knopf H., P. Schumann R.R. Schollmeyer P. Dobos G. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1998; 13: 1412-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, cytokine genes (TNF-α and IL-6) or the gene for DB-1, which were highly induced by the bacterial stimulants, were also not induced or were much less induced by IFN-γ. Besides the high induction of the MCP-1 gene, IFN-γ also highly induced genes for two other chemokines (MIG and IP-10) and several other genes (natural killer cell-enhancing factor B (NKEFB), tyrosine kinase receptor related to TRK (TKT-R), IL-17, MARCKS-related protein (MacMARCKS), protein C inhibitor (PCI), guanine nucleotide-binding protein α-13 (GNA13), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4), etc.), which were not induced or were much less induced by the bacterial stimulants (Figs. 1 and 2). To verify the results obtained with the cDNA array, we used the RNase protection assay to quantify the amounts of chemokine and cytokine mRNA induced by PGN, S. aureus, and LPS. This method also showed that the amount of chemokine mRNA induced by these stimulants was higher than the amount of cytokine mRNA, and again IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-1 were the main chemokines highly induced by all three bacterial stimulants (Fig.3). Other chemokines (RANTES, lymphotactin, IP-10, and I-309) were not significantly induced by any of these stimulants (Fig. 3). Out of the cytokines, IL-1β mRNA was the highest induced by all three stimuli (Fig. 3). PGN also induced a moderate increase of IL-1α, TNF-α, IL-1Ra, and IL-6 mRNA and a small increase of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mRNA, whereas S. aureus also induced a high increase of TNF-α mRNA, a moderate increase of IL-1Ra and IL-1α mRNA, and a lower increase of IL-6 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mRNA (Fig. 3). LPS also induced a high increase in TNF-α mRNA; a moderate increase in IL-1α, IL-1Ra, and IL-6 mRNA; and a lower increase in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mRNA (Fig. 3). Neither of the bacterial stimulants induced significant increase in IL-12 p35, IL-12 p40, and IFN-γ mRNA (Fig. 3). We and others have previously shown that human monocytes stimulated with PGN, S. aureus, and LPS secrete several cytokines, including IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 (1.Dziarski R. Ulmer A.J. Gupta D. Chem.

Therefore, the next experiments were done to determine if PGN induces chemokine secretion and also to compare in the same culture supernatants the amounts of chemokines and cytokines induced by the three bacterial stimulants. All three stimulants (PGN, S. aureus, and LPS) induced secretion of very large amounts of IL-8 and MCP-1 (Fig.4). They also induced several hundred- to several thousand-fold increases in secretion of MIP-1α and MIP-1β, but the total amount of MIP-1α and MIP-1β released was 5–10 times lower than IL-8 and MCP-1 (Fig. 4). All three bacterial stimulants were equally potent in inducing IL-8 secretion, whereas PGN was the strongest inducer of MCP-1, and LPS was the strongest inducer of MIP-1α and MIP-1β. The total amounts of cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β induced by S. aureus and LPS were 5–10 times lower than the amount of IL-8 and MCP-1, and the amounts induced by PGN were approximately 10 times lower than the amounts induced by S. aureus and LPS (Fig. 4). Thus, PGN induced larger amounts of all four chemokines than cytokines, and S. aureus and LPS induced larger amounts of IL-8 and MCP-1, and similar amounts of MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNF-α, and IL-1β. These results confirm the gene expression data and show that also at the protein secretion level, IL-8 is the highest induced chemokine by all three bacterial stimuli. Chemokines were most likely induced directly by bacteria and bacterial products (rather than indirectly by bacterially induced TNF-α and IL-1), because the kinetics of induction of most chemokine genes and chemokine secretion (except MCP-1) was very rapid and usually preceded or paralleled the cytokine induction. Moreover, the level of induction of chemokine mRNA and protein was higher than the level of cytokine mRNA and protein, and the ability of various stimuli to induce chemokines did not correlate with their ability to induce cytokines. For example, PGN induced low levels of TNF-α mRNA and protein; yet, it induced as high levels of chemokine mRNA and protein as the other stimuli. Slower kinetics of induction of MCP-1 is consistent with its newly discovered anti-inflammatory properties (24.Zisman D.A. Kunkel S.L. Strieter R.M. Tsai W.C. Bucknell K. Wilkowski J. Standiford T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2832-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). MCP-1, in addition to its role in chemotaxis, also down-regulates production of proinflammatory cytokines (24.Zisman D.A. Kunkel S.L. Strieter R.M. Tsai W.C. Bucknell K. Wilkowski J. Standiford T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2832-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which would be beneficial at the later, rather than early, stages of bacterially-induced inflammatory process. Essentially similar results were obtained with human monocytic THP-1 cells stably transfected with CD14; i.e. genes for chemokines showed the highest expression in PGN-, S. aureus-, and LPS-stimulated cells using cDNA arrays (not shown) and an RNase protection assay (Fig.5), although few differences from monocytes were noted, such as lower expression of IL-8 mRNA, higher induction of TNF-α than IL-1β mRNA, relatively high expression of RANTES mRNA, and lower respon-siveness to LPS. These results further confirm high induction of chemokine mRNA in monocytes and demonstrate that for most chemokines and cytokines, THP-1 cells are a valid model for studying the mechanism of human monocyte responsiveness to bacterial stimuli. Our data demonstrate that bacterial products activate more than 120 genes in human monocytes and that chemokine genes are the main proinflammatory genes activated by cell wall components of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. By contrast, a nonbacterial monocyte activator, IFN-γ, induces expression of totally different genes. Secretion of chemokine proteins is also very highly induced by bacterial stimulants. The most strongly induced chemokine is IL-8. IL-8 and MIP-2α (which is also strongly induced) belong to the CXC chemokine subfamily, are chemotactic primarily for neutrophils (and also for T cells, NK cells, endothelial cells, basophils, and eosinophils) and stimulate neutrophil degranulation, adhesion, and microbicidal activity (7.Janeway C.A.

Other chemokines also strongly induced by bacterial cell wall components are MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-1. They belong to the CC chemokine subfamily, are chemotactic primarily for monocytes and T cells (and also for NK cells, dendritic cells, and basophils), and activate T cells and macrophages (7.Janeway C.A.

These results are consistent with highly inflammatory and pyogenic nature of bacterial infections and with extensive infiltration of the sites of bacterial infections with polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells (30.Samuelson J. Cortran R.S. Kumar V. Collins T. Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1999: 329-402Google Scholar). Together with other studies (31.Standiford T.J.

Kunkel S.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3847-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), they suggest that chemokines are the major factors recruiting all of these cells to the sites of infection. These results may also have implications for other pathophysiologic changes seen in bacterial infections, since chemokines have diverse effects on various other systems in the body, including hemopoiesis, angiogenesis, and central nervous system (26.Proost P.

Another gene highly induced by the bacterial stimuli was DB-1, which codes for a ubiquitous zinc finger protein that binds to the IL-3 promoter (34.Koyano-Nakagawa N. Nishida J. Baldwin D. Arai K.-I. Yokota T Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, because IL-3 is normally produced by T cells, and because we did not detect any increase in the expression of IL-3 mRNA in bacterially stimulated monocytes, DB-1 must have another as yet unidentified function in monocytes. In general, the genes activated by all three bacterial stimulants were similar, which is not surprising, because they all activate monocytes through CD14 and TLR2 receptors (1.Dziarski R. Ulmer A.J.

However, the specific gene expression patterns induced by each stimulus were different, which may be due to several differences in the function of CD14 as the PGN and LPS receptor (1.Dziarski R.

By contrast, IFN-γ, which activates cells through a different (Jak/signal transducers and activators of transcription-mediated) signal transduction pathway (36.Leonard W.J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1999: 741-774Google Scholar), induces activation of a totally different gene pattern (with the exception of one gene, MCP-1, which is strongly induced by both IFN-γ and bacterial stimulants). PGN was a much weaker inducer of TNF-α mRNA expression and protein secretion than S. aureus and LPS. This is consistent with the lack of toxicity of PGN in animals. For example, in galactosamine-treated mice, PGN is not toxic at 50 μg/mouse, whereas for LPS, LD50 = 4 ng/mouse and LD90 = 100 ng/mouse, 2R. Dziarski and J. T. Ulrich, unpublished observations. or in adrenalectomized mice, LD50 for PGN is >300 μg/mouse and for LPS is 0.1 μg/mouse (37.Dziarski R. Dziarski A. Infect. Immun. 1979; 23: 706-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high induction of TNF-α by the whole S. aureus cells, but not by PGN, is also consistent with the shock-inducing capacity of S. aureus infections (2.Dziarski R. Ulmer A.J. Gupta D. Doyle R.J.

Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10359-10363Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the notion that TNF-α, but not IL-1β, is the main determinant of toxicity (3.Parillo J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar, 4.Bone R.C. Arch. Intern. Med. 1994; 154: 26-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Young L.S. Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Polin R.

By contrast, expression of a different gene pattern is induced by a nonbacterial stimulus, IFN-γ. We are grateful to Peter S.

https://openalex.org/W1965961249,"The reactions of nitric oxide (⋅NO) and α-tocopherol (α-TH) during membrane lipid oxidation were examined and compared with the pair α-TH/ascorbate. Nitric oxide serves as a more potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation propagation reactions than α-TH and protects α-TH from oxidation. Mass spectrometry, oxygen and ⋅NO consumption, conjugated diene analyses, and α-TH fluorescence determinations all demonstrated that ⋅NO preferentially reacts with lipid radical species, with α-TH consumption not occurring until ⋅NO concentrations fell below a critical level. In addition, α-TH and ⋅NO cooperatively inhibit lipid peroxidation, exhibiting greater antioxidant capacity than the pair α-TH/ascorbate. Pulse radiolysis analysis showed no direct reaction between ⋅NO and α-tocopheroxyl radical (α-T⋅), inferring that peroxyl radical termination reactions are the principal lipid-protective mechanism mediated by ⋅NO. These observations support the concept that ⋅NO is a potent chain breaking antioxidant toward peroxidizing lipids, due to facile radical-radical termination reactions with lipid radical species, thus preventing α-TH loss. The reduction of α-T⋅ by ascorbate was a comparatively less efficient mechanism for preserving α-TH than⋅NO-mediated termination of peroxyl radicals, due to slower reaction kinetics and limited transfer of reducing equivalents from the aqueous phase. Thus, the high lipid/water partition coefficient of⋅NO, its capacity to diffuse and concentrate in lipophilic milieu, and a potent reactivity toward lipid radical species reveal how⋅NO can play a critical role in regulating membrane and lipoprotein lipid oxidation reactions.

The mechanism of reaction of α-TH with LOO⋅ involves the loss of an H atom during reduction of LOO⋅ to LOOH, yielding the α-tocopheroxyl radical (α-T⋅) at a rate constant of approximately 5 × 105m−1·s−1, depending on the alkyl chain length, degree of unsaturation, and esterified nature of the fatty acid undergoing peroxidation (4.Serbinova E.A. Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 5.Liebler D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 6.Niki E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). α-Tocopheroxyl radical has only limited capability to propagate further radical chain reactions in most biological conditions because of resonance stabilization of the phenoxyl radical and reduction by ascorbate, thiols, or enzyme-dependent mechanisms (7.Kagan V.E. Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The diffusible signaling molecule and inflammatory mediator nitric oxide (⋅NO) readily concentrates up to 20–25-fold in membrane and lipoprotein compartments, by virtue of a high lipid partition coefficient, charge neutrality, and small molecular radius (8.Malinski T.

There, ⋅NO can avidly react with lipid epoxyallylic and alkoxyl radical (LO⋅) and LOO⋅ species with rate constants of ∼2 × 109m−1·s−1, yielding both nitrogen oxide- and hydroperoxide-containing products (10.Padmaja S.

Based on relative rate constants, it is predicted that the reaction of⋅NO with LOO⋅ will predominate over both the reduction of LOO⋅ by α-TH and the initiation of secondary peroxidation propagation reactions by LOO⋅ with vicinal unsaturated lipids (k = 1.3 × 103m−1·s−1). In the present study, we demonstrate that biologically relevant concentrations of α-TH and ⋅NO can interact cooperatively to inhibit membrane lipid peroxidation, exhibiting greater antioxidant capacity than the pair α-TH/ascorbate. These inhibitory actions of⋅NO and α-TH toward lipid oxidation are a consequence of⋅NO preferentially terminating lipid radical-mediated chain propagation reactions, rather than prevention of α-TH loss by direct reduction of α-T⋅. Egg phosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and di-palmitoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL). Linoleic acid (18:2) was from Nu-Chek-Prep (Elysian, MI). Hexane and 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane were from Aldrich. Sodium azide was obtained from Merck. α-Tocopherol (>99%) was from Alexis (San Diego, CA). 2,2′-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (ABAP) was from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). Nitrous oxide (N2O, 99.999%) was from BOC Gases, and 1,3-propanediamineN- (4-[1-(3-aminopropyl)-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino]butyl] (SNN) and spermine were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). All other reagents were from Sigma. Solutions of⋅NO were prepared by bubbling ⋅NO gas (Matheson, Madison, WI) for 30 min into argon-saturated deionized H2O. Any nitrogen dioxide (⋅NO2) present was eliminated by first bubbling ⋅NO through 5 m NaOH. Before⋅NO solutions were made, 100 ml of deionized/doubly-distilled water was purged with N2 for 30 min to remove oxygen. The N2-saturated solution was placed in series with the purified ⋅NO stream and continuously bubbled for 20 min to produce a saturated solution having a final ⋅NO concentration of approximately 1.8 mm. ⋅NO production rates and solution concentrations were measured by electrochemical detection using a ⋅NO-selective electrode (WPI Instruments, Ann Arbor, MI) calibrated by measuring ⋅NO liberated from KNO2 in 0.1m KI 0.1 m 0.1, and 0.1 mH2SO4, using the following reaction performed under anaerobic conditions: 2KNO2 + 2KI + 2H2SO4 → 2NO + I2 + 2H2O + 2K2SO4.S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was synthesized by combining equimolar (200 mm) concentrations of reduced glutathione and sodium nitrite in 0.5 m HCl followed by recrystallization to eliminate contaminating nitrite (15.Stamler J.S. Loscalzo J. Anal. Chem. 1992; 64: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of SNN were prepared in degassed 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5. Either GSNO or SNN was added to buffer systems used for lipid oxidation reactions (100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 20 °C) to measure rates of⋅NO release. Phosphatidylcholine liposomes (PC) were prepared from 6 ml of a 25.4 mm (20 mg·ml−1) lipid stock solution in chloroform as described previously (11.Rubbo H. Radi R. Trujillo M. Telleri R.

The suspension was placed in a 4 °C water bath and sonicated 3 times for 30 s at 65 watts using a Branson sonifier. Liposomes were stored in the dark under argon and used within 24 h of preparation. Lipid peroxidation was performed with either 1 mg·ml−1 (2.5 mm) linoleic acid emulsified in 10 mm SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, or 6 mg of phospholipid·ml−1 PC liposomes. Oxidation was initiated by the addition of the organic peroxyl radical initiator ABAP in the presence and absence of α-TH and ⋅NO. Nitric oxide was generated by the addition of GSNO, SNN, or by controlled infusion of anaerobically dissolved ⋅NO. ABAP-dependent oxygen consumption was measured polarographically using a water-jacketed cell fitted with a Clark-type oxygen electrode, model YSI 4004 (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH). Reactions were performed at 37 °C in a 1.8-ml water-jacketed chamber. All incubations were continually stirred at 37 °C, and aliquots were removed at indicated time points for measurement of tribarbituric acid-reactive substances (ε = 150 mm−1·cm−1 at 532 nm) or diene conjugation (ε = 26 mm−1·cm−1 at 234 nm) (11.Rubbo H.

Linoleic acid, α-TH, and α-TH oxidation products were also assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). After oxidation reactions, methanol was added for a final concentration of 60% (v/v). Linoleic acid and its oxidation products were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a 10 cm × 2.1 mm inner diameter.

Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26066-26075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negative ions were generated by passing eluates through an IonSpray interface, with an orifice potential of −60 V. Negative mass spectra were recorded over the m/z range from 200 to 600. The linoleic acid oxidation products included [M − H]− ions for 9- and/or 12-hydroxylinolenate (m/z = 295) and 9 and/or 12-hydroperoxolinolenate (m/z = 311). The α-TH parent molecule and its oxidation products were detected as the acetate adducts atm/z = 489 (α-TH), 505 (α-tocopherylquinone or 8-α-hydroxytocopherone), and 521 (8-α-hydroperoxytocophenone). Analyses were performed on an API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with two MacIntosh Quadra 950 computers for data analysis. Radical reactions of α-TH or Trolox C were initiated by a short (20 ns), high energy electron pulse from a linear accelerator as described previously (19.Butler J. Land E.J. Prutz W.A. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 705: 150-162Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated in N2O-saturated phosphate-buffered solutions (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing either 100 μm Trolox C or 50 μm α-TH and 100 mm sodium azide. In the case of α-TH, either 2 mm SDS was added to aid solubilization or α-TH was incorporated into 1,2-palmitoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) liposomes. Liposomes were prepared by combining α-TH and DPPC (100 μm and 10 mm, respectively) in chloroform, brought to dryness in a rotary evaporator, reconstituted in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and subjected to vortexing followed by sonication. In some reactions, an aliquot (0.1–0.8 ml) of the ⋅NO stock solution was added with a gas-tight syringe through a rubber septum into the sealed experimental apparatus containing the reaction mixture. Pulse radiolysis experiments were conducted within 5 min of ⋅NO addition. Azide radicals (N3·) were formed in aqueous solutions of sodium azide (N3−) within about 0.1 μs after the pulse through the following Reactions 1–3.

The generated N3· rapidly oxidizes phenolic substances (AOH) such as tyrosine, Trolox C, and α-TH to the corresponding phenoxyl radical (AO⋅, Refs. 19.Butler J. Land E.J. Prutz W.A. Swallow A.J.

Dosimetry was performed by the thiocyanate method (22.Prutz W.A. Land E.J. Sloper R.W. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. 1981; 77: 281-292Crossref Google Scholar). Initial radical yields were taken to beG(N3·) =G(⋅OH) +G(eaq−) = 5.6 (100 eV)−1, corresponding to a molar concentration ofG(N3·) ×D × 1.035 × 10−7m and were kept between 1 and 2 μm to ensure pseudo-first-order kinetics. The optical path length of the cell was 2.5 cm. Transient absorbance changes in Trolox C and α-TH were detected by kinetic absorbance spectroscopy at 430 nm (or over the range 380–500 nm when absorbance spectra were obtained). The transient signals were recorded by a Tektronix digitizer. Addition of ABAP generates peroxyl radicals by spontaneous thermal decomposition at a constant rate and initiates lipid oxidation in phospholipid liposome membranes, a property essential for kinetic studies (6.Niki E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). An oxygen uptake rate of 0.3 ± 0.1 μm·min−1 at 37 °C was produced by 5 mm ABAP, corresponding to 300 nm·min−1 ABAP-derived peroxyl radicals (not shown). In the presence of linoleic acid (2.5 mm) the rate of oxygen uptake increased to 0.9 ± 0.1 μm·min−1 due to lipid peroxidation propagation reactions. Addition of ⋅NO from SNN prior to ABAP inhibited oxygen consumption during ABAP-initiated linoleic acid peroxidation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Under these conditions, SNN yielded 0–95 nm·min−1⋅NO. Similar results were obtained when ⋅NO was replaced with α-TH at higher concentrations (Fig. 1 B). When partially inhibitory concentrations of both ⋅NO and α-TH were incubated with linoleic acid, the extent of inhibition was almost complete (Fig.1 C). In order to compare the response of the length of the lag phase before onset of autocatalytic lipid oxidation upon addition of both α-TH and ⋅NO, the concentration of antioxidant required for inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation was determined. The extent of conjugated diene formation in linoleic acid incubated with ABAP was inhibited by both ⋅NO and α-TH in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2, A and B) and occurred in concert with a reduction of net yields of TBA-reactive oxidation products (not shown). Whereas no lag times were observed in the absence of antioxidants, induction periods obtained in the presence of α-TH and/or ⋅NO were calculated from the intersect of the slope of the linear portion of the induction phase with the slope of the linear portion of the propagation phase. A 50% inhibition of ABAP-catalyzed linoleic acid oxidation was induced by the addition of 1 μm SNN (but not spermine alone), corresponding to a⋅NO flux of 7 nm·min−1 for 1 h. By these same respective indices, 50 μm α-TH was required for 50% inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation. When α-TH and ⋅NO were added in combination, the increase in lag time was more than additive, inferring cooperative actions of α-TH and⋅NO (Fig. 2 C). More detailed dose-response studies showed that this interaction of ⋅NO and α-TH occurred at rates of ⋅NO production greater than 10 nm·min−1 (TableI). It is important to note that lag times correlated with ⋅NO steady state concentrations, with lipid oxidation chain propagation reactions not occurring until⋅NO concentrations fell below a critical level of ∼10 nm (Fig. 3).Figure 2Dose-dependent inhibition of ABAP-induced linoleic acid oxidation by ⋅NO and α-TH. ABAP (5 mm) was added to linoleic acid as before and incubated with stirring at 37 °C. Conjugated diene formation by linoleic acid was assessed spectrophotometrically at 234 where lag times were calculated for SNN (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 μm), corresponding to ⋅NO fluxes of 0, 5.2, 5.9, 7.0, 8.6, 10.0, 11.4, and 12.8 nm·min−1, respectively) (A), α-TH (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 μm) (B), or 50 μm α-TH, 7.0 nm·min−1⋅NO from 1 μmSNN, and a combination of α-TH plus ⋅NO (C).

Data represent mean ± S.D., n= 3. When comparing lipid oxidation inhibitory actions of the α-TH/ascorbate pair with α-TH/⋅NO, ⋅NO plus α-TH displayed greater antioxidant capacities toward ABAP-dependent liposome oxidation (TableII). Comparative extents of inhibition of lipid oxidation induced by 7 nm·min−1⋅NO plus 50 μm α-TH were only obtained when adding supra-physiological concentrations of ascorbate (300 μm) with α-TH.Table IIInhibition of ABAP-mediated liposome oxidation by ⋅NO, α-TH, and ascorbateConditionTBA reactive materialμmPC liposomes3.8 ± 0.4PC liposomes, ABAP14.6 ± 1.4+ Ascorbate13.7 ± 1.5+ α-TH7.8 ± 0.8+ SNN6.5 ± 0.5+ SNN, ascorbate6.4 ± 0.4+ SNN, α-TH4.2 ± 0.3PC liposomes (6 mg · ml−1) were oxidized for 120 min as in Fig. 1 and monitored by thiobarbituric acid reactivity at 532 nm.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of oxidation products of linoleic acid ([M − H]−ion = 279) induced by ABAP also revealed that ⋅NO and α-TH exert both independent and cooperative lipid antioxidant activities when present in concert (TableIII). The [M − H]−ions of principal oxidation products were m/z = 295 (LOH) and 311 (LOOH), representing 8 and 21% of the total linoleic acid present, respectively. In the presence of α-TH, 7 and 18% of the same respective oxidation products were observed. Similar inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation was also afforded by SNN at 2 μm, yielding 3 and 12% of LOH and LOOH, respectively. When both α-TH and SNN were added to ABAP-initiated linoleic acid oxidation reactions, synergistic inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation occurred, with only 0.5% of linoleic acid being oxidized to LOH and LOOH. Similar product distribution was observed when SNN was substituted for GSNO (100 μm, data not shown).Table IIIThe influence of ⋅NO on ABAP-initiated linoleic acid oxidation and α-tocopherol oxidation product yieldsPercent distribution18:2 (L)LOHLOOHα-THα-TOHα-TOOH% 18:2% α-THm/zCondition279295311430446462OxidizedOxidized18:210000018:2, ABAP3982129+ SNN6131215+ α-TH447182521362575+ SNN, α-TH920.20.3690230.531Linoleic acid (18:2, 3.6 mm) was emulsified in 10 mm SDS, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and oxidized by addition of 5 mm ABAP at 37 °C with constant stirring.

Open table in a new tab Linoleic acid (18:2, 3.6 mm) was emulsified in 10 mm SDS, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, and oxidized by addition of 5 mm ABAP at 37 °C with constant stirring.

In separate studies, the extent of α-TH oxidation to other species was proportional to the extent of ABAP-induced lipid hydroperoxide formation. Quantitative yields from a typical experiment are also summarized in Table III. Oxidation of α-TH was determined by LC-MS quantitation of α-TH loss and an accompanying increase in the major oxidation products having m/z = 446 (α-tocopherylquinone or 8-α-hydroxytocopherone) andm/z = 462 (8-α-hydroperoxytocophenone). Under conditions where ⋅NO produced by SNN inhibited ABAP-initiated linoleic acid oxidation, LC-MS analysis showed that α-TH oxidation was prevented by ⋅NO, as indicated by decreased yields in both the [M − H]− ions of α-TH oxidation products and the net extent of α-TH oxidation (from 75 to 31%) in the absence of ⋅NO. In addition to the LC-MS studies, the extent of oxidation of α-TH was also quantitated by fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 4). α-TH oxidation, as indicated by loss of characteristic fluorescence emission, did not occur until later stages of SNN decomposition, where steady state concentrations of ⋅NO fell below 10 nm. Either ⋅NO or ascorbate protected α-T⋅ from ABAP-mediated oxidation in a dose-dependent manner, with at least 1 order of magnitude lower concentrations of ⋅NO being required for comparable effects. To explore the potential reaction of ⋅NO with α-T⋅ and the reduction of α-T⋅ in an ascorbate-like reaction, as predicted from thermodynamic calculations, pulse radiolysis studies were performed to reveal whether ⋅NO directly reacts with the phenoxyl radical of α-TH or Trolox C (not shown), the later being a water-soluble analog of α-TH. As shown in Fig.5 A, the reaction of N3· with α-TH gave rise to characteristic phenoxyl radical absorbance spectra (λmax∼430 nm) through the following Reaction 4. AOH+N3·→N3−+AO⋅Equation EReaction_4 This reaction is fast at pH 7.4 (k = 6–8 × 108m−1·s−1) and gives approximately 100% phenoxyl radical yield, consistent with previous studies (21.Davies M.J. Forni L.G. Wilson R.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 513-522PubMed Google Scholar). Monitoring α-TH phenoxyl radicals at 430 nm revealed that these species are extremely stable, as no evidence of radical decay could be observed over a 10-ms time scale (Fig.5 B). When ⋅NO (1–100 μm) was added prior to pulse radiolysis, no observable changes in the absorbance spectra or rates of decay of the α-TH and Trolox C (not shown) phenoxyl radicals were observed (Fig. 5 C). These phenoxyl radicals were, however, reduced by ascorbate consistent with previous observations (22.Prutz W.A. Land E.J. Sloper R.W. J. Chem. Soc.

The principal mechanism underlying ⋅NO inhibition of lipid oxidation is a facile reaction with lipid alkoxyl or epoxyallylic and peroxyl radical intermediates, thus terminating lipid radical chain propagation reactions. Herein, we demonstrate the following: (a) ⋅NO represents a key lipid-soluble chain-breaking antioxidant protecting α-TH from oxidation; (b) α-TH and ⋅NO can act cooperatively to inhibit lipid peroxidation processes, exhibiting greater antioxidant capacity than the pair α-TH/ascorbate; and (c) contrary to the thermodynamically predicted outcome, ⋅NO does not directly react with and reduce α-T⋅.

Observed coseismic dilation suggests that hydrothermal or magmatic processes are directly triggering some of the seismicity in the region.

Purified rat Reg protein was labeled with 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (NEN Life Science Products). A λZAP II rat islet cDNA expression library (20.Koguma T. Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Karasawa T.

In brief, about 1.2 × 106 independent phages (approximately 5 × 104 phages on a 150-mm agar) were plated. After incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, the plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters that had been immersed with 10 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Incubation was continued for 4 h at 37 °C. The filters were then removed, washed with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v)) at room temperature, and blocked in PBST with 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) overnight at 4 °C. Following the blocking, filters were incubated for another 2 h at room temperature in the presence of125I-labeled rat Reg protein (1 × 106cpm/ml). After three washes with PBST, the filters were exposed to x-ray film. The positive phages were isolated, and cDNA inserts were sequenced in both directions after in vivoexcision. The rat islet cDNA library (20.Koguma T. Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Karasawa T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Biochim. Biophys.

The 8 clones largely overlapped each other and had complete nucleotide identity in the overlapping regions. The rat Reg receptor cDNA ligated with oligonucleotide encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) nonapeptide tag (YPYDVPDYA) at the N terminus was inserted into a pCI-neo mammalian expression vector (Promega) and expressed in COS-7 cells as described (22.Takasawa S.

The rat Reg receptor expression vector with HA tag was introduced into CHO cells and RINm5F cells. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker, Walersville, Maryland) and 250 μg/ml neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks (25.Takasawa S. Akiyama T. Nata K.

Stable transformants expressing high levels of the recombinant protein were screened by immunoblot analysis of HA and isolated. The Reg receptor expression vector and the control vector were electroporated into COS-7 cells and expressed transiently (22.Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto T. Yonekura H.

The cells (7.5 × 105 cells) were washed with RPMI 1640 and incubated on ice in the presence of 125I-labeled rat or human Reg protein in RPMI 1640 containing 1% fetal calf serum for 2 h. After washing with RPMI 1640 three times, the cells were lysed by 1 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100. The radioactivity of the lysate was determined by a γ-counter (Cobra, Packard). Stable transformants expressing the Reg receptor were cultured (5 × 104 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 with 1% fetal calf serum in the presence of increasing concentrations of rat Reg protein for 24 h. During the last 2 h, BrdUrd (10 μm) was added in the culture medium, and BrdUrd incorporation was measured using a colorimetric cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After a 24-h incubation of the stable transformants expressing the Reg receptor in RPMI 1640 with 1% fetal calf serum (5 × 104 cells/well) in the presence of increasing concentrations of rat Reg protein, a solution containing 4[-3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1) was added to the medium, and the cells were incubated for another 30 min. After a 24-h incubation of the stable transformants expressing the Reg receptor in RPMI 1640 with 1% fetal calf serum in the presence of increasing concentrations of rat Reg protein, apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL method (26.Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9155) Google Scholar) using an apoptosis screening kit (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan).

ThePstI/BglII fragment of rat Reg receptor cDNA (nucleotide residues 755–1,064) was subcloned into thePstI/BamHI site of pBluescript SK (-), linearized with HindIII, and transcribed in vitroby T3 RNA polymerase using [α-32P]CTP. The resultant 0.45-kilobase complementary RNA was used as a probe. RNase protection assay was performed using a Ribonuclease Protection Assay III kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To isolate the Reg receptor, we constructed a λZAP II rat islet cDNA expression library and screened the library by the binding to125I-labeled rat Reg protein. A cDNA clone with a 1.6-kbp cDNA insert was obtained. Using the cDNA as a probe, we isolated the full-length cDNA of Reg-binding protein from the rat islet cDNA library. The cDNA had a 2,760-base pair open reading frame encoding a 919-amino acid protein (Fig.1), and the amino acid sequence of the cDNA suggested that the protein is a type II transmembrane protein with a long extracellular domain (868 amino acid residues), a transmembrane domain (residues 29–51), and a short intracellular region at the N terminus. We then constructed an expression vector for the rat cDNA and expressed it transiently in COS-7 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the cDNA-encoded protein was expressed predominantly in the cell membrane fraction with an apparent molecular weight of 105,000 (Fig.2 A), showing good agreement with its calculated molecular weight (104,682) from the deduced amino acid sequence. The COS-7 cells into which the expression vector had been introduced bound 125I-labeled rat Reg protein, and the binding was attenuated by the addition of unlabeled Reg protein (Fig.2 B). A homology search against DNA/protein data bases revealed that the cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequences show significant homologies to those of multiple exostoses (EXT) family genes (28.Van Hul W.

Hori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (over 97% amino acid identity), indicating that the cDNA encodes a rat homologue to human EXTL3/EXTR1. The EXTL3/EXTR1 gene was isolated as a member of the EXT family genes by homology screening, but its physiological function and pathological significance have not yet been clarified. EXTL3/EXTR1 is thought to belong to the EXT family (28.Van Hul W. Wuyts W. Hendrickx J. Speleman F. Wauters J. De Boulle K. Van Roy N. Bossuyt P. Willems P.J. Genomics. 1998; 47: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29.Saito T. Seki N. Yamauchi M. Tsuji S. Hayashi A. Kozuma S. Hori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), because it shows homology to EXT2 and EXT1 at their C-terminal regions (52% in C-terminal 262 amino acids with EXT2 and 40% in C-terminal 247 amino acids with EXT1) (see Fig. 1). However, the N-terminal region (residues 1–656) of EXTL3/EXTR1 has no homology to any other members of the EXT family genes. Furthermore, the N-terminal region of EXTL3/EXTR1 contained the membrane-spanning domain, but the other members of the family lacked this domain and therefore were not thought to be cell surface proteins. In addition, the 1.6-kbp cDNA, which was initially isolated in the screening of the rat islet cDNA expression library as a Reg-binding protein, contained the N-terminal region alone (amino acid residues 1–332). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this region contains the Reg binding domain and that the EXT family members other than EXTL3/EXTR1 have no ability to bind to Reg protein. We introduced the expression vector into CHO cells, established cell lines overexpressing the Reg-binding protein (rat homologue to human EXTL3/EXTR1), and found that the CHO cells bound rat Reg protein with high affinity (K d = 4.41 nm). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the binding of 125I-labeled rat Reg protein was displaced by increasing the concentrations of unlabeled rat Reg protein (K i = 1.61 nm). The Hill coefficient (n H) was estimated to be 1.18, indicative of interactions with a single, homogenous population of binding sites. Human REG protein (7.Terazono K. Yamamoto H. Takasawa S. Shiga K. Yonemura Y. Tochino Y. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2111-2114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which shows a 70% amino acid identity to rat Reg protein, also bound to the CHO cells (K d = 14.0 nm), but higher concentrations of human REG protein were required for the displacement of the rat Reg protein binding to the CHO cells (K i= 7.41 nm). These results suggest that EXTL3/EXTR1 is a cell surface Reg receptor that binds to Reg protein.Figure 2The rat homologue to human EXTL3/EXTR1 is a cell surface Reg receptor.

The Reg receptor mRNA was expressed in normal pancreatic islets, regenerating islets, and RINm5F β-cells, a rat insulinoma-derived β-cell line. Reg protein increased the BrdUrd incorporation (1.5–2-fold, data not shown) and the number (Fig.4 A) of RINm5F cells in response to Reg protein when the cells were seeded at 20–40 × 104 cells/well. The Reg protein concentrations exhibiting the growth-stimulating effect on RINm5F cells were consistent with those for primary cultured rat islets (14.Watanabe T. Yonemura Y. Yonekura H. Suzuki Y. Miyashita H. Sugiyama K. Moriizumi S. Unno M. Tanaka O. Kondo H. Bone A.J. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3589-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), suggesting that islets and RINm5F cells use the same receptor for Reg protein. We therefore introduced the expression vector into RINm5F cells and established several cell lines overexpressing the Reg receptor. The control RINm5F cells showed no increase of WST-1 cleavage in response to Reg protein when the cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well (Fig. 4 A). In contrast to the control cells, the receptor-expressing cell lines (lines 1, 6, and 24) showed significant increases in BrdUrd incorporation when incubated with 0.3–300 nm rat Reg protein (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, the numbers of RINm5F cells were increased in response to Reg protein (0.3–100 nm) as judged by the cleavage of WST-1 (Fig.4 C). With high concentrations of Reg protein (300–1,000 nm), the cell numbers were decreased, and the decrease in the viable cells (Fig. 4 C) and the increase in TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 4 D) were correlated, suggesting that the Reg-Reg receptor interaction may regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells for maintaining the β-cell mass.Figure 4Proliferation of RINm5F cells by rat Reg protein.

Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of four to eight separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 3 A, the expression of the Reg receptor was not increased in regenerating islets as compared with that in normal islets, suggesting that the regeneration and proliferation of pancreatic β-cells in the increase of the β-cell mass are primarily regulated by the expression of Reg protein. This idea is consistent with the observations that Reg gene was first identified as a gene specifically expressed in regenerating islets (7.Terazono K. Yamamoto H. Takasawa S. Shiga K. Yonemura Y.

ARIP cells, a pancreatic ductal cell line, which express the Reg receptor (see Fig. 3 A, lane 6), were also reported to proliferate in a Reg protein-dependent manner (34.Zenilman M.E. Magnuson T.H.

The expression of Reg receptor mRNA was also detected in liver, kidney, stomach, small intestine, colon, adrenal gland, pituitary gland, and brain, but not in heart (Fig. 3 B), suggesting the possible involvement of the Reg-Reg receptor signal system in a variety of cell types other than pancreatic β-cells.

This peptide, which displays antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria at micromolar concentrations, is also able to kill a large variety of filamentous fungi and yeast cells in the 1–10 μm range. We have found that the C-terminal moiety of vasostatin-1 is essential for the antifungal activity, and shorter active peptides have been synthesized. In addition, from the comparison with the activity displayed by related peptides (human recombinant and rat synthetic fragments), we could determine that antibacterial and antifungal activities have different structural requirements. To assess for such activities in vivo, CGA and CGA-derived fragments were identified in secretory material released from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils upon stimulation. Vasostatin-1, which is stored in a large variety of cells (endocrine, neuroendocrine, and neurons) and which is liberated from stimulated chromaffin and immune cells upon stress, may represent a new component active in innate immunity.

The need for efficient agents increases with the expanding number of immunodeficient patients (chemotherapy, grafts, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 syndrome, prolonged antibiotherapy, etc.) and with the emergence of bacterial and fungal pathogens resistant to current therapies. Among the several different mechanisms that have evolved to act efficiently, the production of a large variety of natural antimicrobial peptides from both animals and plants is attracting increasing attention. The importance of these molecules is clearly established in the immune defense of invertebrates (1.Boman H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar, 2.Hoffman J.A. Reichhart J.M. Hetru C. Curr. Opin.

These antimicrobial peptides are located at sites exposed to microbial invasion such as the epithelia of amphibian (3.Zasloff M. Curr. Opin.

They are present in the hemolymph of insects and stored in the secretory granules of immune cells of mammals and birds (8.Gennaro R. Romeo D. Skerlavaj B. Zanetti M. Harris J.R.

In addition, α-defensins are expressed by human intestinal Paneth cells that are secretory epithelial cells located at the bottom of crypts in the small intestine (12.Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1280-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-defensins that are produced in various epithelia such as psoriatic skin (6.Harder J. Bartels J.

Surveys of antimicrobial peptides have revealed links between the antimicrobial peptides found in vertebrates and those found in invertebrates (15.Charlet M. Chernysh S. Philippe H. Hetru C.

Recently, new data have highlighted similarities between pathogen recognition, signaling pathways and effector mechanisms of innate immunity in Drosophila and mammals (19.Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway Jr., C.A. Ezkowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Thus, it became apparent that innate immunity is an evolutionary ancient defense mechanism. We have recently discovered new natural antimicrobial peptides derived from the processing of chromogranins (CGs)1 and proenkephalin-A, which are secreted with catecholamines upon stimulation of chromaffin cells from adrenal gland (20.Strub J.M.

These peptides may play a role in stress situations and act as one immediate protective barrier against infection. In the present paper we report that bovine vasostatin-1, an abundant natural secreted peptide (24.Metz-Boutigue M.H. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Strub J.M. Aunis D. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25.Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), well conserved along evolution and corresponding to the N-terminal domain of bovine chromogranin A (CGA1–76), displays both antibacterial and antifungal activities. By using recombinant and synthetic peptides corresponding to vasostatin-related fragments from various species, structural features necessary for the expression of antibacterial and antifungal activities have been pointed out. We have shown that the C-terminal moiety of vasostatin-1 displays a potent antifungal activity, and we have prepared several synthetic antifungal vasostatin-1-derived fragments. Furthermore, in order to study the biological function of CGA-derived peptides in innate immunity, we have investigated their presence in material secreted from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Secretory granules were isolated from bovine adrenal medulla (26.Smith A.D. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and soluble proteins were separated from membranes after lysis and centrifugation (27.Aunis D. Bouclier M. Pescheloche M. Mandel P. J. Neurochem. 1977; 29: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CGA1–76 was purified by HPLC on a Macherey Nagel Nucleosil 300–5C18 column (4 × 250 mm; particle size 5 μm and pore size 100 nm) with the Applied Biosystems HPLC system 140 B. Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Material was eluted at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min using successively a gradient of 0–30% B in A over 15 min followed by a gradient of 30–50% over 40 min and achieved by a gradient of 50–100% over 10 min. Each fraction was manually collected and concentrated by evaporation. Human recombinant Ser-Thr-Ala-CGA1–78 peptide (VS-1) was cloned, purified, and characterized as described previously (28.Corti A. Perez Sanchez L. Gasparri A. Curnis F. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A.G. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rat CGA7–57 peptide was synthesized on an ABI 431 A (Applied Biosystems) peptide synthesizer using the standard procedures of Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry (29.Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Formation of the disulfide bridge between Cys17 and Cys38 was obtained in the presence of N-ethyldiisopropylamine at pH 8.5, leaving the mixture to stand under open atmosphere for 24 h until complete reaction, according to Ellman test (30.Deakin H. Ord M.G. Stocken L.A. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After reduction of the disulfide bridge in the presence of 8 m guanidine HCl in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 4 mmEDTA, S-pyridylation of cysteine residues was obtained by treatment with 4-vinylpyridine (31.Tarr G.E. Shively J.E. Methods of Protein Microcharacterization. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1986: 162Google Scholar). The reduced and alkylated peptide was then isolated by HPLC on a Macherey Nagel Nucleosil 300–5C18 column. In order to oxidize natural bovine vasostatin-1 and recombinant human VS-1, the oxidizing agent was prepared by addition of formic acid to 30% hydrogen peroxide (v/v, 9:1) and stirring at 20 °C for 45 min. This mixture was then chilled at 0 °C, and the oxidative agent (100 μl) was added to the protein. The reaction was performed at 0 °C for 30 min, stopped by dilution with water (500 μl). Samples were then concentrated by evaporation but not to dryness. This washing step was repeated three times to eliminate completely performic acid. Recombinant VS-1 was digested for 18 h at 30 °C by endoproteinase Glu-C at a protein to enzyme weight ratio of 50:1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Released fragments were separated by HPLC using a Macherey Nagel Lichrospher 100–5-RP-18 column (3 × 250 mm; particle size 5 μm and pore size 100 nm). Absorbance was monitored at 214 nm, and the solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Material was eluted at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min using successively a gradient 0–10% solvent B in 5 min, followed by a gradient 10–40% over 55 min. The sequence of purified peptides was determined in our laboratory by automatic Edman degradation onto an Applied Biosystems 473A microsequencer. Samples purified by HPLC were loaded on Polybrene-treated and precycled glass fiber filters (25.Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-derivatives were identified by chromatography on a PTH C18 column (2.1 × 200 mm). Determination of molecular mass was carried out on a Brucker BIFLEXTM matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF) according to the procedure previously reported (23.Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Kieffer B. Lefèvre J.F. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29847-29856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A micromolar analyte solution (0.5 μl) was applied to the matrix and dried under moderate vacuum. After fast spreading and evaporation of the solvent, we obtained a thin layer of matrix crystals (32.Vorm O. Mann M. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33.Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (642) Google Scholar). This preparation was washed by applying 1 μl of a 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in water and then flushed after a few seconds. Bacteria were precultured aerobically at 37 °C in a Mueller-Hinton Broth medium, pH 7.3. The following bacteria strains were tested: Micrococcus luteus(A270), Bacillus megaterium (MA), Bacillus cereus(ATCC11778), Bacillus subtilis (QB935), Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (K23430),Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes(S47014), Escherichia coli (D22 and D31), Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC82118). Bacteria were suspended in the Mueller-Hinton Broth medium, and antibacterial activity was tested by measuring the inhibition of bacterial growth (34.Wu M. Hancock R.E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 29-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Aqueous peptidic solutions (10 μl) were incubated in microtiter plates with 100 μl of a midlogarithmic phase culture of bacteria with a starting absorbance of 0.001 at 620 nm (35.Bulet P. Dimarcq J.L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microbial growth was assessed by the increase of absorbance after 16 h incubation at 30 °C. The A 620 nmvalue of control cultures growing in the absence of peptide was taken as 100%. Filamentous fungi were grown on medium including a five-cereal medium, and the spores were harvested as described previously (36.Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R.G. Cammue B.P.A. Vanderleyden J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 69: 55-60Crossref Google Scholar). The following filamentous fungi strains were used: Alternaria brassicola (MUCL 20297), Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Nectria hematococca (160.2.2),Fusarium culmorum (MUCL 30162), Fusarium oxyporum (MUCL 909), Neurospora crassa (CBS 327–54), and Aspergillus fumigatus. Yeast cells were precultured on a Sabouraud medium, and two yeast strains were tested,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (TGY481 pJM600) and Candida albicans. In order to test the antifungal activity of CGA-derived peptides, spores (final concentration, 104 spores/ml) were suspended in a growth medium containing Potato Dextrose Broth (Difco, in half-strength) and yeast cells in Sabouraud medium with starting absorbance at 620 nm of 0.001. These media were supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and cefotaxime (0.1 μg/ml). Fungal growth was assessed after appropriate incubation period, specific to each fungi (24 or 48 h at 30 °C). Aliquots of peptide extract (20 μl) were incubated in microtiter plates with 80 μl of fungal spores or yeast cultures. Growth of fungi was monitored microscopically and also evaluated by measuring the culture absorbance at 595 nm using a microplate reader. Yeast cells growth was assessed by the increase of absorbance at 620 nm. Human PMNs were prepared to 98% homogeneity, as described previously (37.Finck-Barbancon V. Duportail G. Meunier G. Colin D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), from buffy coat of healthy donors of either sex, kindly provided by the Center de Transfusion Sanguine de Strasbourg (France). PMNs were suspended in a buffer solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, at 5 × 106 cells per ml. Exocytosis of the content of the specific and primary granules of PMNs was initiated at room temperature by application of 2.3 nm LukS-PV and 0.6 nm LukF-PV, the two components of leukocidin from S. aureus (38.Colin D.A. Mazurier I. Sire S. Finck-Barbancon V. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3184-3188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion was monitored by flow cytometry as described previously (39.Meunier O. Falkenrodt A. Monteil H. Colin D.A. Cytometry. 1995; 21: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and when completed, PMNs were centrifuged (800 × g) for 10 min. The supernatant was recovered for further analysis. Samples from PMNs secretions were separated by SDS-PAGE gels containing 15% acrylamide (40.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). In order to detect immunologically reactive fragments, proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose sheets (41.Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). They were first soaked in 3% bovine serum albumin in 25 mm sodium phosphate containing 0.9% NaCl at pH 7.5 (NaCl/Pi). Nitrocellulose sheets were quickly washed with NaCl/Pi and incubated 2 h at room temperature with monoclonal anti-CGA5A8 corresponding to anti-CGA47–68 antiserum (28.Corti A. Perez Sanchez L. Gasparri A. Curnis F. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A.G. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) diluted in NaCl/Pi (2 μg/ml). The second antibody was an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). The nitrocellulose sheets were stained for enzyme activity in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.4 mm nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.38 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. In addition to catecholamines, material present in bovine chromaffin intragranular matrix contains a large number of peptides derived from chromogranins and proenkephalin-A. After separation by HPLC, antibacterial activity against M. luteus(Gram-positive bacteria) was detected in several fractions, and we focused on a major active fraction eluted at 47% B (Fig.1 A). Automatic Edman degradation revealed a unique sequence (LPVNSPMNKGDT) corresponding to the N-terminal end of bovine CGA (42.Iacangelo A. Affolter H. Eiden L. Herbert E. Grimes M. Nature. 1986; 323: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To determine further the full primary structure of this N-terminal CGA-derived fragment, mass spectrometry analysis was obtained using the MALDI-TOF technique (Fig.1 B). The experimental molecular mass values of 8583.9, 4292.9, and 2863.6 correspond to the ratio m/z (z = 1, 2 and 3) and are in agreement with the theoretical molecular mass of the peptide CGA1–76 (8584.9 Da), named vasostatin-1, including the disulfide bridge Cys17-Cys38(43.Iacangelo A.

In contrast, no activity is detectable at the concentration of 10 μm against other Gram-positive bacteria such as B. cereus, B. subtilis, S. pyogenes, M. fortuitum, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, and several Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli D31 and D22, E. cloacae,S. typhimurium, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa(data not shown).Table IAntimicrobial activity of vasostatin-1, human recombinant VS-1, and synthetic rat CGA7–57MIC100Vasostatin-1VS-1Rat CGA7–57(S–S)(SH)μmGram-positive bacteria M. luteus230–– B. megaterium0.230––Filamentous fungi N. crassa3101010 A. fumigatus5––– A. brassicola3 12020 N. haematococca1 31010 F. culmorum1 52020 F. oxyporum10––– T. mentagrophytes––––Yeast cells S. cerevisiae10––– C. albicans10–––MIC100 in μm is the minimal concentration completely inhibiting bacterial and fungal growth in the standardized conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” Peptides corresponding to synthetic rat CGA7–57 with disulfide bridge (S–S) and cysteine residues (SH) are indicated. Open table in a new tab MIC100 in μm is the minimal concentration completely inhibiting bacterial and fungal growth in the standardized conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” Peptides corresponding to synthetic rat CGA7–57 with disulfide bridge (S–S) and cysteine residues (SH) are indicated. To complete the spectrum of activity of vasostatin-1, we also tested its ability to affect the growth of filamentous fungi and yeast cells (Table I). Interestingly, this peptide in the concentration range of 1–10 μm is highly active against a variety of filamentous fungi including N. crassa, A. fumigatus, A. brassicola, N. hematococca,F. culmorum, and F. oxyporum, but it is inactive against T. mentagrophytes. In addition, it is active against the yeast forms of S. cerevisiae and C. albicansat the concentration of 10 μm (Table I). Furthermore, after removal of medium containing vasostatin-1 and substitution with fresh vasostatin-1-free growth medium, fungi are unable to restart its growth, strongly suggesting that vasostatin-1 possesses fungicidal activity. In parallel experiments, we have found that vasostatin-1 is not able to induce the lysis of bovine erythrocytes (data not shown). In addition, the antimicrobial properties of vasostatin-1 againstM. luteus, B. megaterium, and N. crassa disappear after treatment with a mixture of proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and the protease V8 of S. aureus, indicating that the activity is due to peptidic material. The importance of the disulfide bridge for the antibacterial and antifungal activities of natural vasostatin-1 was then examined. After reduction, alkylation using 4-vinylpyridine and desalting by HPLC, the peptide was modified on the two cysteine residues (Cys17and Cys38), which were S-pyridylethylated as verified by MALDI-TOF analysis (data not shown). The modified fragment (pS-vasostatin-1) is still active against the growth of M. luteus and B. megaterium but at the concentration of 10 and 5 μm, respectively (Table II). In addition, modification of disulfide bridge does not alter antifungal activity since the pS-vasostatin-1 inhibits the growth of N. crassa at a concentration of 3 μm similarly to the natural form (Table II). These data indicate that the intactness of the disulfide bridge is not crucial for antifungal property but seems to be important for full antibacterial activity.Table IIAntimicrobial activity of vasostatin-1, human recombinant VS-1, and related peptidesMIC100M. luteusB. megateriumN. crassaμmVasostatin-1 20.2 3pS-vasostatin-1105 3[O]-vasostatin-1––30VS-1303010pS-VS-1–20 5[O]-VS-1––20The S-pyridylethylated and oxidized forms are, respectively, named pS- and [O]-.

MIC100 in μm is the minimal concentration completely inhibiting bacterial and fungal growth in the standardized conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” –, no detectable activity. After performic oxidation of vasostatin-1, all peptide molecules were modified, as shown from MALDI-TOF analysis that revealed the presence of five oxidations corresponding to the modifications of cystine (cysteic acids Cys17 and Cys38) and methionine (methionine sulfoxide/sulfone Met7, Met15, and Met32) residues (data not shown). This oxidized form [O]-vasostatin-1 is inactive against the growth ofM. luteus and B. megaterium at a concentration up to 30 μm, but it inhibits the growth ofN. crassa at a concentration of 30 μm (TableII). These data indicate that performic oxidation induces the complete loss of the antibacterial activity and strongly decreases the antifungal activity. The conformational changes induced by the oxidative treatment inhibit the antimicrobial activity of vasostatin-1. Recombinant VS-1 corresponds to the sequence of human CGA1–78 bearing the tripeptide STA at the N-terminal end. This peptide was expressed in E. coli, purified (28.Corti A. Perez Sanchez L.

The experimental mass values of 9069.7, 4536.1, and 3024.1 correspond to the ratio m/z (z = 1, 2 and 3) and fully agree with the theoretical mass of 9069.5 Da corresponding to the recombinant fragment including the disulfide bridge (data not shown). This fragment is active against the growth of M. luteus andB. megaterium at a concentration of 30 μm(Table I). In addition, it inhibits the growth of several fungi such asN. crassa, A. brassicola, N. hematococca, andF. culmorum at concentration range of 1–10 μm(Table I). However, VS-1 is inactive against the growth of yeast cells at a concentration up to 50 μm (Table I). After redu"

Upon activation, the HGF-receptor c-Met binds and phosphorylates the multisite docking protein Gab1. Besides binding motifs for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Grb2, Gab 1 contains multiple Tyr-X-X-Pro (YXXP) motifs which, when phosphorylated, are potential binding sites for the adapter proteins c-Crk and Crk-like (CRKL). Stimulation of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) with HGF leads to Gab1 association with CRKL. The Gab1-CRKL interaction requires both, the SH2 domain of CRKL and the region containing the YXXP motifs in Gab1. CRKL binds via its first SH3 domain to several downstream signal transducers, including C3G an activator of the small GTPase Rap1. Indeed, Rap1 was rapidly activated after HGF stimulation of HEK293 cells. Rap1 activation through HGF was suppressed through transfection of a truncated C3G protein which only contains the SH3-binding motifs of C3G. Transfection of nonmutated Gab1 led to a strong increase of Rap1·GTP in the absence of HGF. In contrast, transfection of the GabΔYXXP mutant abolished the elevation of Rap1·GTP by HGF. A replating assay indicated that HGF decreases the adhesion of HEK293 cells. The results presented here delineate a novel signaling pathway from HGF to the GTPase Rap1 which depends on the interaction of the adapter protein CRKL with the exchange factor C3G and could be linked to cell migration.

The Crk family of adapter proteins was initially discovered in the form of an oncogene carried by two sarcoma-inducing retroviruses (CT10, ASV1; 3, 4). The normal cellular counterparts of this oncogene, c-Crk I and c-Crk II, as well as the highly homologous, but distinct gene product Crk-like (CRKL; 5) are characterized through their almost exclusive composition from building blocks that mediate selective protein-protein interactions and are known as SH21 and SH3 domains (reviewed in Refs. 2.Feller S.M.

Since SH2 and SH3 domains are very widely present in signal transduction proteins, considerable effort was made to understand the binding preferences of these protein interaction domains. In the case of Crk, useful clues for the specificity of the SH2 domain came from phosphopeptide library studies (22.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar), as well as the identification of intramolecular and intermolecular CrkSH2 binding motifs in c-Crk II (23.Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), p130Cas (24.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and other proteins. It is now well established that the “in vivo” binding sites of the Crk and CRKL SH2 domains commonly conform to the sequence phospho-Tyr-X-X-Pro (pYXXP). The downstream signal transduction of c-Crk and CRKL seems to be largely mediated by the first of the two SH3 domains (SH3(1)). The SH3(1) domains of c-Crk and CRKL recognize with great preference sequence motifs which conform to the consensus Pro-X-X-Pro-X-Lys (26.Knudsen B.S. Zheng J. Feller S.M. Mayer J.P. Burrell S.K. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2191-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Multiples of these Crk/CRKLSH3(1)-binding motifs are found in Crk/CRKL-signal transducers like C3G and DOCK180 (reviewed in Ref. 2.Feller S.M. Posern G. Voss J. Kardinal C. Sakkab D. Zheng J. Knudsen B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). C3G activates the Ras-like GTPases Rap1A and Rap1B (16.Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H.

Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), while DOCK180 up-regulates by a not yet exactly defined mechanism the activity of Rac1 (18.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 19.Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3337-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Rap1 can counteract Ras in some cell types and leads to T-cell anergy and neuronal differentiation (7.York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 9.Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts it is activated in response to growth-stimulating factors like bombesin which do not activate Ras (28.Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, injection of Rap1-overexpressing fibroblasts leads to tumor formation in nude mice (29.Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In platelets, Rap1 is strongly activated by thrombin (30.Bos J.L. Franke B. M'Rabet L. Reedquist K. Zwartkruis F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31.Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The distinct roles of Rap1 thus appear to depend largely on the cellular context. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (hereafter simply referred to as HGF) is a multifunctional factor produced by many cell types, including normal fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells, but also different oncogenic cells (32.Boros P. Miller C.M. Lancet. 1995; 345: 293-295Abstract PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported to influence cell proliferation of hepatocytes and multiple other cell types, kidney cell migration, organ and tissue development, but also the invasiveness of tumor cells and other biological responses (for reviews, see Refs.33.Cantley L.G. Cantley L.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 5: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Bardelli A. Comoglio P.M. Ciba Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 133-144PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Birchmeier C. Gherardi E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Kidney epithelial cells show three types of responses to HGF in a sequential, timely regulated and to some extent interdependent order. First, HGF leads to scattering and increased motility which requires the detachment of cell-cell contacts and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase plays an important role in this process (36.Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Second, cells show an increased proliferation, a response which requires the activation of mitogenic kinases (mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular regulated kinases; Ref. 37.Ponzetto C. Zhen Z. Audero E. Maina F. Bardelli A. Basile M.L. Giordano S. Narsimhan R. Comoglio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14119-14123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The third response is the formation of branched tubules, a developmental process which occurs only in three-dimensional culture systems and appears to require signaling through STAT3 (38.Boccaccio C. Ando M. Tamagnone L. Bardelli A. Michieli P. Battistini C. Comoglio P.M. Nature. 1998; 391: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). HGF binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met which transmits the HGF signal into the cytoplasm. c-Met autophosphorylation leads to the recruitment of signal transduction proteins like the c-Src kinase, phospholipase C-γ, the Grb2·SoS complex, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (summarized in Ref. 33.Cantley L.G. Cantley L.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 5: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One prominent substrate protein of c-Met is Gab1 (Grb2-associatedbinder 1), which was independently found as an epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate and is also phosphorylated after stimulation of cells with nerve growth factor, insulin, interleukin-6, and erythropoietin (39.Holgado-Madruga M.

Blood. 1999; 93: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon its tyrosine phosphorylation, Gab1 recruits a number of signaling molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (44.Holgado-Madruga M. Moscatello D.K. Emlet D.R. Dieterich R. Wong A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12419-12424Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the adapter protein Shc, the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and SHIP, a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase (Ref. 43.Lecoq-Lafon C. Verdier F. Fichelson S. Chretien S. Gisselbrecht S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). It seems likely that the activation of Gab1-phosphorylating kinases in response to different growth and differentiation factors leads to differential tyrosine phosphorylation patterns on Gab1 and that additional, yet unidentified signal transducers can be recruited by this large multisite docking protein. Crk, CRKL, and their interacting proteins are known to have effects on proliferation, cell differentiation, and migration, cellular responses which all have been reported to occur after HGF stimulation of certain cells. Crk and CRKL are also involved in signal transduction events after treatment of cells with erythropoietin, nerve growth factor and insulin, stimuli known to result in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 (2.Feller S.M. Posern G. Voss J. Kardinal C. Sakkab D. Zheng J. Knudsen B.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6.Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the c-Met substrate Gab1 contains six putative Crk/CRKLSH2-binding sites (YXXP motifs; see also Fig.1). Therefore, we explored a possible link from the HGF-c-Met-Gab1 signaling pathway to Crk/CRKL and its downstream targets. The results document the existence of HGF-induced signals via complex formation of Gab1 and CRKL to the small GTPase Rap1. Antibodies used in the experiments were from commercial sources: anti-c-Met (05-237 and 05-238, UBI), anti-C3G (sc-869, Santa Cruz), anti-Crk (Transduction Laboratories, C12620), anti-CRKL (sc-319, Santa Cruz), anti-cyclin A (sc-596, Santa Cruz), anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (IgG2a; GR01, Calbiochem), anti-FLAG (M2, Kodak), anti-Gab1 (sc-6292, Santa Cruz), anti-GRAP (sc-6101, Santa Cruz), anti-Nck (N15920, Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-Tyr (PY20, Transduction Laboratories), and anti-Rap1 (R22020, Transduction Laboratories). Anti-C3G for detection of a transfected C3G-CBR fragment (details below) was generated by immunizing rabbits with a GST fusion protein of the CBR region of C3G as described previously (15.Knudsen B.S.

The pMT2-HA-Rap1 vector is a gift of Fried Zwartkruis and Johannes L. Bos, Utrecht (53.Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L.

Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). pBat-Flag-Gab1-ΔYxxP was constructed in two steps. A polymerase chain reaction fragment encoding amino acids 411 to 695 of Gab1 was cloned into NotI and SalI sites of the pBat-Flag expression vector (40.Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1 to 241 of Gab1 was then inserted in-frame with the C-terminal coding sequences using the NotI site. HEK293, 293T, and A431 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Active (processed) HGF was made as described previously (48.Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). One unit of HGF (defined by the minimal amount of HGF required to induce scattering of a highly sensitive Madin-Darby canine kidney cell clone) equals 0.5 ng of protein. Cells were stimulated with HGF as indicated in the figures. Cell lysis was done as described (20.Oehrl W. Kardinal C. Ruf S. Adermann K. Groffen J. Feng G.S. Blenis J. Tan T.H. Feller S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1893-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but with a buffer containing only 1% Triton X-100 as detergent (Triton X-100 buffer). Immunoprecipitations were carried out with Triton X-100 buffer lysates overnight and precipitates were washed three times with low stringency buffer (IP buffer: 20 mm Tris 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol) prior to SDS-PAGE. Calcium phosphate/BES transfection was done as described (49.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 5 μg of DNA per plasmid used. Transfected 293T cells were harvested 24–30 h after the start of the transfection as described below. The Rap1 activity assay has been previously described in detail (28.Posern G. Weber C.K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 containing buffer as described (28.Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and extracted for 30 min, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. After protein quantification, 1 mg of extracted protein was incubated for 90 min with 20 μg of GST-RalGDS RBD and GSH-Sepharose beads, precipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and analyzed for bound Rap1·GTP by 12% SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-Rap1. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS until approximately 80% confluent and subsequently maintained in medium with 0.1% FBS, allowing cell survival without significant proliferation. To some wells HGF was added as indicated while control wells were maintained without HGF. After 2 days the culture medium containing floating and loosely attached cells was carefully removed. These cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and replated with medium containing 10% FBS but without HGF to allow viable cells to grow into clusters. Cells were then fixed with 100% methanol, stained for 1 h with Giemsa (Merck, 1.09204), rinsed with water to remove unbound dye, and air dried. To investigate a potential link between HGF signaling and Crk family adapter proteins, human epithelial kidney (HEK) 293 cells were chosen as a model system. They form epithelial layers similar to the widely used Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and are much easier to transfect. HEK293 cells express both, c-Crk and CRKL (20.Oehrl W. Kardinal C. Ruf S. Adermann K. Groffen J. Feng G.S. Blenis J. Tan T.H. Feller S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1893-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as well as the HGF receptor c-Met (Fig.2 A). Human epithelial A431 cells which have previously been reported to express c-Met (50.Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 51.Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Kiritoshi A. Tano Y. Nakamura T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3305-3313PubMed Google Scholar) were used as a positive control. HEK293 cells respond to HGF treatment by tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B) and with a very rapid onset (Fig.2 C). Strong phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues in proteins is detectable after 30 s, with a peak around 3 min and a sustained elevation of phosphotyrosyl proteins for at least an hour. Gab1 could be precipitated with GST-CRKL from lysates of serum-starved cells stimulated with HGF but not from lysates of nonstimulated control cells (Fig. 3 A). GST alone or a CRKL construct with a deleted SH2 domain did not precipitate Gab1. Endogenous Gab1 isolated by immunoprecipitation with Gab1-antiserum co-precipitated CRKL only after stimulation of serum-starved cells with HGF. This co-precipitation of CRKL was further increased by overexpression of a FLAG-tagged Gab1 protein (Fig. 3 B). Endogenous Gab1 from HGF-stimulated cells also co-precipitated in small amounts with a CRKL-specific antiserum (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, a Crk-specific monoclonal antibody was apparently unable to co-precipiate Gab1 (data not shown). As expected, binding of CRKL was not seen with a deletion mutant of FLAG-Gab1 in which the region containing the 6 YXXP motifs is missing (Gab1ΔYxxP; Fig. 3 D). To analyze the functional consequences of the Gab1-CRKL interaction induced by HGF stimulation of starved cells, downstream effector proteins of CRKL were investigated. One of the best characterized signal transducers of Crk and CRKL is the guanine nucleotide releasing protein C3G, which binds with great selectivity to the SH3(1) domains of Crk and CRKL. C3G is found in constitutive complexes with CRKL in many cell types and is known to activate the GTPase Rap1 in cells and “in vitro.” C3G is also constitutively bound to CRKL in HEK293 cells (Fig.4 A). Binding of CRKL to Gab1 is expected to lead to an accumulation of C3G near the plasma membrane where it may exert its effect on Rap1. Recently, an additional mechanism of C3G activation through phosphorylation of a specific tyrosyl residue (Tyr-504) has been described (52.Ichiba T. Hashimoto Y. Nakaya M. Kuraishi Y. Tanaka S. Kurata T. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The binding of CRKL to Gab1 may bring C3G into the vicinity of the c-Met tyrosine kinase and tyrosine kinases associated with it. For analysis of Rap1 activity, cells were starved as before and stimulated with HGF or chemicals previously shown to activate Rap1 in fibroblasts (28.Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). GTP-loaded Rap1 was precipitated by virtue of its binding to a GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion protein (31.Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Analysis of tissue-derived cells with this assay was previously shown to lead to a 2–4-fold increase of GTP-loaded endogenous Rap1 (28.Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 54.Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Activation of Rap1 was seen with HGF after 3 min, but Rap1 was down-regulated again after 10 min (Fig. 4 B). Stimulation of 293 cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate/H2O2 also lead to a significant elevation of Rap1·GTP. Stimulation of endogenous Rap1 was partly inhibited by the transient transfection of a C3G fragment which contains the Crk/CRKLSH3(1)-binding region of C3G (C3G-CBR; 7) (data not shown). A total inhibition of endogenous Rap1 activity is not expected since not all of the 293 cells are transfected. To observe the Rap1 inhibition effect by C3G-CBR more clearly, HA-tagged Rap1 was co-transfected with C3G-CBR or control vector. HA-Rap1 from transfected cells can then be selectively detected by subsequent anti-HA blotting of precipitated Rap1·GTP. HA-Rap1 activation of transfected 293T cells in response to HGF was strongly decreased by C3G-CBR (Fig.4 C). The basal Rap1 activity in nonstimulated cells was also slightly reduced, indicating the importance of C3G for the Rap1 activity in 293 cells. To determine whether Gab1 is crucial for the HGF-mediated Rap1 activation, nonmutated Gab1, mutant Gab1 with a deleted YXXP-region (Gab1ΔYxxP), or control vector was co-transfected together with HA-tagged Rap1 into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the empty control vector did not affect the HGF-induced activation of Rap1. Overexpression of wild-type Gab1 prominently increased the basal Rap1 activity to levels comparable to those normally seen after HGF treatment. On the other hand, expression of the Gab1ΔYxxP mutant protein completely abolished the HGF-inducible Rap1 activation. We conclude that the HGF-induced complex formation of Gab1 and CRKL is an important prerequisite for the transmission of signals from HGF to Rap1. To understand the biological effects of HGF on 293 cells several analyses were performed. Since HGF has been reported to stimulate the proliferation of certain cells, the possibility of a dose-dependent proliferation increase by HGF was investigated. We were unable to observe a marked effect on cell numbers when cells were treated with HGF over a period of several days (data not shown). However, during these experiments it was noted that HGF appeared to reduce the adhesion of HEK293 cells. To investigate this further, cells maintained in low serum were treated with different doses of HGF for 2 days. Floating and loosely attached cells were then carefully collected with the culture medium and replated into normal 10% serum-containing culture medium in the absence of HGF for 5 to 7 days to again allow proliferation and growth of the 293 cells into small clusters. The cells were then fixed and stained for better visibility. The result of a representative experiment is shown in Fig. 6. This suggests that HGF reduces the adhesion of 293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, observation of untreated and HGF-treated 293 cells by video microscopy indicated an increased motility upon treatment with HGF (data not shown). Further studies will be necessary to clarify whether these biological effects of HGF on HEK293 cells depends on CRKL and Rap1 signals. HGF is a multipotent growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis factor as well as a cytokine. Despite many investigations into the molecular mechanisms of its action, it has only recently become clear that the c-Met substrate Gab1 is an important mediator of many HGF signals. Based on the primary structure of Gab1 it seemed likely that it provides docking sites for SH2 domains of signal transduction proteins which have not yet been characterized in the context of HGF signaling. In the current study we present evidence that CRKL is recruited to Gab1 by HGF stimulation of human kidney epithelial cells and that HGF leads to Rap1 activation in a C3G-dependent fashion. Crk, CRKL, and their SH2 and SH3 domain-binding proteins (p130Cas, paxillin, C3G, and DOCK180 etc.) have been implicated in the regulation of a number of signaling events including cell proliferation and adhesion regulation, T-cell anergy, cell migration, and transformation of cells. HGF is known to mediate several of these responses in certain cell types. A future goal will therefore be to determine which biological functions of HGF are affected by the formation of Gab1·CRKL complexes and Rap1 activation. In this context, it is interesting to note that bombesin, which also induces Rap1 activation (28.Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), leads to an increased cell motility (55.Yule K.A. White S.R. Exp. Lung Res. 1999; 25: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 56.Aprikian A.G. Tremblay L. Han K. Chevalier S. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Modulatory effects on cell motility have also been described for the Crk and CRKL interacting proteins p130Casand p70 paxillin as well as the DOCK180-like MBC protein inCaenorhabditis elegans (13.Klemke R.L.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) indicating that Crk family adapter proteins may have functions beyond those currently known, for example, in the regulation of cell migration. Crk adapters can signal at least two GTPases, namely Rap1 and Rac. The latter is clearly implicated in the regulation of cell migration events (see e.g. Ref. 60.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar for review). By contrast, little is known about the biological functions of Rap1 and its downstream targets remain largely elusive. The only present indication that Rap1 is involved in the regulation of cell migration events comes from Drosophila studies with deleted Rap1. These flies display, for example, defects in ventral and dorsal closure of the developing embryo. This may be explained by a failure of specific cells to migrate to their appropriate location in the absence of Rap1 (61.Asha H. de Ruiter N.D. Wang M.G. Hariharan I.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It will be important to find out whether Rac1 is also activated in a CRKL-dependent manner after HGF stimulation of HEK293 cells and to determine whether Rap1 and Rac signals are somehow interconnected. In our current study, we were only able to detect the HGF-induced complex formation of CRKL and Gab1. However, a role for the c-Crk proteins cannot be excluded at this point. While the polyclonal CRKL antiserum used in the experiments shown here works well for coimmunoprecipitations and does not cross-react with c-Crk proteins, such a reagent specific for c-Crk still needs to be generated. Gab1 is also a substrate of other tyrosine kinases, for example, the epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor receptors and the kinases coupled to the erythropoietin and interleukin-6 receptors (39.Holgado-Madruga M.

It remains to be studied whether complexes between Crk family adapters and Gab1 can also form after the activation of other receptor systems. Additional results pertaining to HGF signaling via Crk family adapters have recently been published (Garcia-Guzman, M., Dolfi, F., Zeh, K., and Vuori, K. (1999)Oncogene 18, 7775–7786).

https://openalex.org/W1983429506,"IscS from Escherichia coli is a cysteine desulfurase that has been shown to be involved in Fe-S cluster formation. The enzyme converts l-cysteine tol-alanine and sulfane sulfur (S0) in the form of a cysteine persulfide in its active site. Recently, we reported that IscS can donate sulfur for the in vitro biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine (s4U), a modified nucleotide in tRNA. In addition to IscS, s4U synthesis in E. coli also requires the thiamin biosynthetic enzyme ThiI, Mg-ATP, andl-cysteine as the sulfur donor. We now report evidence that the sulfane sulfur generated by IscS is transferred sequentially to ThiI and then to tRNA during the in vitro synthesis of s4U. Treatment of ThiI with 5-((2-iodoacetamido)ethyl)-1-aminonapthalene sulfonic acid (I-AEDANS) results in irreversible inhibition, suggesting the presence of a reactive cysteine that is required for binding and/or catalysis. Both ATP and tRNA can protect ThiI from I-AEDANS inhibition. Finally, using gel shift and protease protection assays, we show that ThiI binds to unmodified E. coli tRNAPhe. Together, these results suggest that ThiI is a recipient of S0 from IscS and catalyzes the ultimate sulfur transfer step in the biosynthesis of s4U.

The biochemical steps for sulfur incorporation into biotin, lipoic acid, and thiamin, as well as macromolecules such as protein Fe-S clusters and thionucleosides in tRNA, have not been fully elucidated. The biosynthesis of thiamin and 4-thiouridine (s4U)1 in tRNA has been linked by the observation that some mutants lacking s4U in their tRNA were also auxotrophic for thiamin (1.Ryals J. Hsu R.-Y. Lipsett M.N. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 899-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In two independent studies, the thiI gene was isolated and found to complement both s4U (2.Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and thiamin (3.Webb E. Class K. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4399-4402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) deficient mutants in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, respectively. We recently reported that IscS, a NifS homolog from E. coli, can mobilize sulfur from cysteine for the in vitro synthesis of s4U in E. coli tRNA (4.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The formation of s4U requires IscS and ThiI as well as Mg-ATP and l-cysteine as the sulfur donor. Using UV spectroscopy and HPLC analysis, we have confirmed that s4U is the product of the in vitro reaction (4.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All tRNA substrates lacking a uridine in position 8, the natural site of s4U modification, are completely inactive in our system, suggesting that the modification is restricted to this position. 2C. T. Lauhon and R. Kambampati, manuscript in preparation. 2C. T. Lauhon and R. Kambampati, manuscript in preparation. We have also found that IscS, among multiple enzymes in E. coli with cysteine desulfurase activity, is specifically involved in sulfur transfer to tRNA in vitro (4.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Early work by Lipsett and co-workers (5.Abrell J.W. Kaufman E.E. Lipsett M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 294-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that two factors, A and C, mediated s4U synthesis. Two genes, nuvA andnuvC, which were later identified in E. coli near UV-resistant mutants, were reported to lack s4U and were complemented by Factors A and C, respectively (1.Ryals J. Hsu R.-Y. Lipsett M.N. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 899-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Lipsett M.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 993-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IscS requires PLP for activity analogous to Factor C; however, the location ofiscS in the E. coli genome (57.3 min) is different from that reported for nuvC (42–46 min). ThethiI gene was previously reported to complement anuvC mutation (7.Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), however, ThiI does not bind PLP (4.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7.Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the assignment of iscS and thiI asnuvA or nuvC remains unclear. IscS was previously characterized as a cysteine desulfurase that catalyzes the formation of alanine and sulfane sulfur (S0) from cysteine (8.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). During this reaction, a cysteine persulfide is formed in the IscS active site. In the presence of excess DTT or other thiols, the products of the reaction are alanine and sulfide. Flint (8.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) has proposed a scheme in which IscS functions as a S0 donor for Fe-S cluster synthesis. We have found that ThiI stimulates the cysteine desulfurase activity of IscS 2-fold (4.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift studies (reported herein) show that ThiI and not IscS binds to unmodified E. coli tRNAPhe. We therefore hypothesized that the persulfide sulfur formed at the active site of IscS may be transferred to ThiI for reaction with an activated form of uridine 8 in the tRNA to form s4U. To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine the nature of sulfur transfer in the biosynthesis of s4U in E. coli tRNA. In this paper, we report evidence that ThiI binds tRNA, accepts sulfur from IscS, and functions as the ultimate sulfur donor for s4U formation. l-[35S]Cysteine and [α-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. TPCK-treated trypsin, ATP, cysteine, and all other biochemicals were from Sigma. Overproduced and purified ThiI and IscS were prepared as described previously (4.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unmodified tRNAPhe was prepared by linearization of pCF23 (a gift from Dr. Rachel Green, Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, MD) withBstNI and runoff transcription essentially as described (9.Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar).E. coli tRNAPhe transcript was labeled with32P by substituting ATP with [α-32P]ATP in the in vitro transcription reaction mixture. 32P-Labeled tRNA (3.7 μm) was incubated with varying amounts (0.9–7.2 μm) of ThiI or IscS in 20 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 3% glycerol) for 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were then applied to 8% native polyacrylamide gels, and electrophoresis was performed using 90 mm Tris/90 mm boric acid and 2.5 mm EDTA at 4 °C. The gels were then dried using gel drying frames and exposed to x-ray film. ThiI (0.13 mg/ml) in buffer A minus PMSF was digested at 37 °C with TPCK-trypsin at a ThiI/trypsin ratio of 83:1 (w/w). In the protection experiments, ThiI was preincubated with 1 mm ATP or 1 mm cysteine or tRNA (at a molar ratio of 1:13) at 37 °C for 5 min in buffer A minus PMSF, and then reaction mixtures were digested as above. Aliquots were removed at various time intervals and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were quantitated using a densitometer and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The intensity of the bands was quantitatively analyzed by the volume quantitation method, and the object average option was used for background correction. IscS (0.9 μm) was incubated with increasing amounts of ThiI (0–1.4 μm) as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were performed either in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP in 25 μl of buffer A containing 10 μm [35S]cysteine (4000 cpm/pmol), 20 μm PLP. BSA, carbonic anhydrase, and unlabeled tRNAPhe transcript were also present in the reactions where indicated. Incubations were for 10 min at 37 °C. An equal volume of SDS sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the assay mixtures, which were then heated to 70 °C for 2–5 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining followed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Labeled bands were quantitated as described above. ThiI (3.0 μg, 54 pmol) in 30 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl was incubated with 500 pmol of I-AEDANS (2.3-fold molar excess of cysteines in ThiI) at 25 °C for 30 min in dark. In the experiments in which the protective effect of substrates was assessed, 1.6 mm ATP, 1.9 mmGTP, 16.7 μm [35S]cysteine, or 5.0 μg of unmodified tRNAPhe were included in the incubation mixture. Reactions were quenched with DTT (8.2 mm final concentration) and diluted to 50 μl with sulfurtransferase assay components. The standard assay mixture is composed of buffer A containing 1 mm ATP, 10 μm[35S]cysteine (1338 CPM/pmol), 5.0 μg of unmodified tRNAPhe, 20 μm PLP, and 0.2 μg of IscS. For maximal sulfur mobilization, we used saturating amounts of IscS in the assays. The concentrations of ThiI used in the inhibition studies were within the linear range of the assay. The sulfurtransferase assay was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, and samples were applied to DEAE-81 filters (2.4 cm, Whatman). The filters were washed once with 0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, for 30 min and three times with 0.3m KCl, 20 mm cysteine for 5 min. The filters were finally washed three times with H20 in a Buchner funnel and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. We first looked for tRNA binding by each of the protein factors involved in the biosynthesis of s4U using a gel mobility shift assay. Fig. 1shows the effect of increasing concentrations of either ThiI (lanes 2–5) or IscS (lanes 8–11) on the mobility of 32P-labeled unmodified E. colitRNAPhe. Analysis by native PAGE indicates that only ThiI is able to shift the mobility of the tRNA substrate. The addition of an excess of unlabeled tRNA (25–50-fold) could block the observed mobility shift by ThiI (lanes 6–7). To corroborate the gel shift results, we performed protease protection experiments on ThiI (Fig. 2). TPCK-trypsin degrades ThiI into a major fragment with an approximate molecular mass of 45 kDa (designated L in Fig. 2); tRNA protects ThiI from proteolysis (lower left panel). Neither cysteine nor ATP protects ThiI from tryptic degradation at this site. However, ATP lowers the rate of proteolysis of both ThiI and the 45-kDa fragment (Fig. 2, lower right panel). Quantitative analysis of the protein bands in Fig. 2 revealed that ThiI proteolysis was slowed by 2-fold in the presence of ATP. ThiI tryptic digests containing primarily the 45-kDa fragment are devoid of tRNA sulfurtransferase activity (data not shown). Both the gel shift analysis and protease protection experiments clearly show that ThiI binds to tRNA.Figure 2Protection of tryptic cleavage of ThiI by unlabeled tRNAPhe transcript. ThiI was digested with trypsin as described under ”Materials and Methods.“ Aliquots (15 μl) containing 2.0 μg of ThiI digest were removed at different time intervals and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Lane MW, molecular mass markers are indicated on the right. The positions of ThiI and its tryptic peptides, large (L) and small (S), are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We used 35S-labeled cysteine in an attempt to follow the transfer of sulfur during s4U synthesis in vitro. Reactions containing an increasing amount of ThiI, with or without ATP and tRNA, were incubated for 10 min and then quenched with SDS buffer and subjected to electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Each lane in Fig. 3 corresponds to a separate reaction mixture.35S-Labeled bands were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 3, B and C). As expected, only IscS can be labeled with [35S]cysteine alone. In reactions with increasing concentrations of ThiI (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3–6), we observed a 35S-labeled band of increasing intensity with mobility identical to ThiI. The proportion of35S label comigrating with IscS was observed to decrease with an increasing ThiI concentration (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–6). However, 35S label on IscS increased 47% in the presence of small amounts of ThiI (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Interestingly, this increase was not observed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). When the tRNA substrate was included in the reaction mixture (Fig.3 B, lane 7), the label corresponding to ThiI and IscS was greatly diminished, and a high intensity band that correlates with the position of the tRNA was observed. Quantitation of the labeled bands shown in Fig. 3 B reveals that the amount of label on ThiI and IscS was decreased by 81 and 98%, respectively, in the presence of tRNA (Fig. 3 D). Together, these labeling patterns suggest that ThiI is covalently modified with sulfur mobilized by IscS and catalyzes the ultimate sulfur transfer in the synthesis of s4U. Under previously reported sulfurtransferase assay conditions (4.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), ThiI and IscS catalyze the transfer of 0.2 mol of35S to 1 mol of tRNA. HPLC analysis of35S-labeled tRNA nuclease digests confirms that s4U accounts for >85% of the 35S label. In the present experiment (Fig. 3), the radioactivity observed in ThiI is 1% that of the label on tRNA. The higher intensity of the label in the tRNA results from the greater chemical stability of s4U relative to the putative protein persulfides. An additional unidentified labeled band with electrophoretic mobility in between IscS and tRNA was also observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 7). Quantitation of this labeled band gave a value 0.1% of the label in tRNA. Because we do not see this band in the Coomassie-stained gel (Fig. 3 A, lane 7), and it is visible by staining with ethidium bromide (not shown), we conclude that it is a nucleic acid contaminant present in the tRNA substrate. We observed no labeling of the negative control protein BSA (Fig.3 B, lanes 8 and 9), which is known to contain reactive cysteine residues, or of carbonic anhydrase (Fig.3 B, lane 10) when each is substituted for ThiI in the reaction mixture. As expected, IscS, in the absence of ThiI, does not catalyze sulfur transfer to tRNA (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9 and 10). In the absence of ATP, the amount of label transferred to tRNA was reduced by more than 98%, and the intensity of the labeled band corresponding to ThiI remained unchanged (Fig.3 C, lane 7, and 3 E). As expected, ATP was not required for the transfer of 35S froml-cysteine to IscS and then to ThiI (Fig. 3 C,lanes 2–6). The persulfides were expected to be labile to reducing agents, and therefore we removed mercaptoethanol from the electrophoresis sample buffer. However, the gel samples received 0.5 mm DTT from the reaction mixtures, which is required for ThiI activity. It is perhaps unexpected that we observed 35S-labeled ThiI and IscS in the gel under denaturing conditions. Because the DTT from the reaction mixture is rapidly diluted as the proteins enter the stacking gel, it is possible that a fraction of the persulfides survives long enough to be separated in the gel matrix. Flint (8.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) has found that the reduction of the IscS persulfide in the absence of DTT is slow, despite the presence of 2.5 mm cysteine as substrate. Attempts to exclude DTT completely in our experiments resulted in the appearance of additional high molecular weight protein bands in the gel, presumably because of oligomerization or aggregation. We also found that the presence of 5 mm DTT in the reactions abolished label on either IscS or ThiI in our gel analysis. Thus, the35S-label is sensitive to higher DTT concentrations, which is consistent with the proposed persulfide functionality. We removed [35S]cysteine from the reaction mixture after incubation using size exclusion chromatography and analyzed the separated large molecule fraction by SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager analysis. This shows that the separated protein fraction contains35S-labeled ThiI, and the addition of this fraction to tRNA in the presence of Mg-ATP results in the transfer of label to tRNA (data not shown). This result suggests that 35S-modified ThiI lies on the direct pathway to s4U formation in tRNA. The reaction of ThiI with the fluorescent thiol-specific alkylating agent I-AEDANS leads to irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. Fig. 4 shows that ThiI can be protected from I-AEDANS inhibition by adding ATP and, to a lesser extent, tRNA into the reaction mixture. As expected, GTP, which is inactive as a substrate for s4U formation, does not protect ThiI from I-AEDANS inhibition. Because tRNA and ATP have a protective effect, we are confident that inactivation of IscS, which is present in saturating amounts, is not the cause for the observed inhibition. Exposure of SDS gels to UV light after reaction with I-AEDANS shows a fluorescent band comigrating only with ThiI. An alignment of amino acid sequences of ThiI from E. coli and homologs from a range of other organisms shows that Cys344 is present in all of the analyzed sequences (data not shown). These results support the possibility that ThiI possesses a reactive cysteine that can accept S0 for the synthesis of s4U. We are currently attempting to identify the modified cysteine residue(s), as well as prepare site-directed mutants for analysis both in vitro andin vivo. Based on the model proposed by Flint (8.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the evidence presented in our current work, we propose a scheme for sulfur mobilization and transfer in the biosynthesis of s4U inE. coli (Fig. 5). The initial mobilization of sulfur from cysteine results in the formation of S0 covalently bound to a cysteine in the active site of IscS as a persulfide (IscS-SSH). This persulfide sulfur is then transferred, presumably to a cysteine residue on ThiI, to give the ThiI persulfide (ThiI-SSH). Finally, in the presence of ATP, the persulfide sulfur from ThiI-SSH is mobilized and transferred to tRNA. The exact mechanism of the mobilization in vivo is not yet clear, but it could involve oxidation of the protein via internal reduction of the persulfide by a cysteine residue to give a disulfide that is reduced later. Alternatively, an external reducing agent could be required to directly mobilize the sulfur from the persulfide. Because native ThiI has not yet been isolated, it is not possible to ascertain the oxidation state of the naturally isolated enzyme. It is interesting to note that in Flint's (8.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) original isolation of IscS in the absence of reducing agents, the enzyme was found to be part of a mixed disulfide with the phosphopantetheine moiety of acyl carrier protein. The role of ATP in s4U synthesis has not yet been elucidated. Lipsett and colleagues (5.Abrell J.W. Kaufman E.E. Lipsett M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 294-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that Factor A utilized Mg-ATP to synthesize a tRNA-derived unstable activated intermediate, which is then converted to s4U by Factor C in the presence of cysteine and PLP. Based on sequence homology searches with putative ThiI homologs from various organisms, we have proposed that ThiI uses Mg-ATP to activate the oxygen at the 4-position of uridine for attack by a sulfur nucleophile (4.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our observation that ATP protects ThiI from inhibition by I-AEDANS and lowers the rate of ThiI trypsinolysis is consistent with this suggestion. The observed in vitro shuttling of S0 from IscS to ThiI may represent a general strategy in vivo for efficient sulfur transfer in a number of metabolic pathways (10.Toohey J.I. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is possible that IscS or other NifS homologs in E. colitransfer S0 to a variety of other acceptors, including Fe-S cluster-containing enzymes and other sulfurtransferases. We have recently found that E. coli iscS − mutants are viable but are unable to synthesize s4U or thiamin. 3C. T. Lauhon and R. Kambampati, manuscript in preparation. It is thus likely that IscS initiates sulfur mobilization for the synthesis of both s4U and thiazole in vivo. Current efforts are focused on a full characterization of the iscS − phenotype inE. coli and further elucidation of the scope of IscS-initiated sulfur transfer in thionucleotide biosynthesis. While this paper was in review, a paper was published by Mueller and Palenchar (11.Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showing that ThiI contains a unique P-loop motif (185SGGXDS190) that is common to the pyrophosphate synthetase family of enzymes that catalyze the adenylation and substitution of carbonyl oxygens. We note that ThiI contains significant ATPase activity independent of tRNA,3 as was earlier reported for Factor A (5.Abrell J.W. Kaufman E.E. Lipsett M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 294-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, we have only found evidence of ADP formation. However, it is possible that the tRNA-independent ATP hydrolysis is obscuring our ability to observe AMP formation."

In measurements conducted near the glass transition temperature, there was measurable deformation-induced enhancement of the mobility of the amorphous chains up to the yield point. This enhanced mobility decayed once deformation was stopped. Enhanced mobility was not observed in deformation at room temperature. The mechanics of deformation can be explained by the Robertson model for glassy polymers near the glass transition temperature, which states that applied stress induces liquid-like behavior in the polymer chains."

Recognition of the pathogen is followed by the activation of different signal transduction chains, which are functionally connected to a large number of transcription factors regulating the activity of defense gene promoters (1.Glazebrook J.

Uknes S. Ward E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 38: 1109-1112Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). SAR is associated with the co-ordinate induction of a set of host genes presumably involved in plant defense mechanisms such as glucanases, chitinases, and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (3.Ward E.R. Uknes S.J. Williams S.C. Dincher S.S. Wiederhold D.L. Alexander D.C. Ahl-Goy P. Métraux J.-P. Ryals J.A. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Rauscher M. Adam A.L.

Activating sequence-1 (as-1) is a functionally important element of a subgroup of SA-inducible defense genes (e.g. Nt103, also referred to as GNT35 (Ref. 6.Xiang C. Miao Z. Lam E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and PR-1a (Ref.7.Strompen G. Gruner R. Pfitzner U.M. Plant Mol.

Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), its regulation is likely to affect the expression of several SAR genes. This is corroborated by the finding that as-1-binding bZIP transcription factors of the TGA family interact with ankyrin-rich repeat protein NPR1 (nonexpressor of PR-1), which is essential for SA-inducible expression of PR-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana (9.Cao H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 668-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating its functional connection to other signal transduction pathways independent from the SAR. as-1-like elements are characterized by two imperfect TGACGTCA motifs spaced by 4 bp (13.Lam E. Benfey P.N. Gilmartin P.M. Fang R.-X. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), a nuclear protein complex called ASF-1 was identified (13.Lam E. Benfey P.N. Gilmartin P.M. Fang R.-X. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). ASF-1 is most likely involved in SA induction of the as-1 element, as oligonucleotides encoding two perfect TGACGTCA motifs are recognized with higher affinity by ASF-1 and confer higher SA inducibility of transcription (8.Qin X.-F. Holuigue L. Horvath D.M. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An as-1 binding activity identified in leaf cell extracts has been called salicylic acid response protein (SARP; Ref. 14.Jupin I. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Its main component is a 40-kDa protein that is immunologically related to bZIP transcription factor TGA1a. Both SARP activity and ASF-1 activity increase upon SA treatment of leaves (14.Jupin I. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15.Stange C. Ramirez I. Gomez I. Jordana X. Holuigue L. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence supports the hypothesis that, in the absence of SA, binding of SARP to as-1 is inhibited by a not yet identified protein (SAI). Knowledge of the molecular composition of ASF-1 or SARP will be a crucial step toward the identification of SAI. TGA1a was the first of the four so far characterized members of the tobacco as-1-binding family of bZIP factors to be isolated (16.Katagiri F. Lam E. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1989; 340: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). A related tobacco clone called PG13 was subsequently reported (17.Fromm H. Katagiri F. Chua N.H. Mol. Gen.

TGA2.1 is 76% identical to A. thaliana TGA2, but is characterized by an additional 128-amino acid N-terminal domain. At present, information on the in vivo function of individual TGA factors is limited. In Arabidopsis, theperianthia mutant is characterized by five instead of four petals, but the target genes of PERIANTHIA are not yet known (23.Chuang C.F. Running M.P. Williams R.W. Meyerowitz E.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Injection of recombinant TGA1a into tobacco leaf cells led to transcriptional activation from the as-1 element (26.Neuhaus G. Neuhaus-Url G. Katagiri F. Seipel K. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 827-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that increasing the amount of TGA1a can lead to constitutive promoter activation. TGA1a is predominantly expressed in roots (16.Katagiri F. Lam E. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1989; 340: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This observation has been taken as evidence that TGA1a is responsible for root specific expression from the element. In addition, increased TGA1a levels lead to increased activation of the as-1element upon 2,4D treatment, as revealed by transient expression analysis using protoplasts from tobacco cell line BY-2 (27.Pascuzzi P. Hamilton D. Bodily K. Arias J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26631-26637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we elucidate the composition of ASF-1 and SARP and thus define two members of the TGA family (TGA2.1 and TGA2.2) as candidates for being involved in regulating the as-1 element in leaves. Biochemical analysis identified the TGA2.2 homodimer as the main component of these complexes. Functional analysis of transgenic plants expressing either TGA2.2 and or a dominant negative TGA2.2 mutant supports its involvement in gene expression in leaves as expression of genes containing the as-1 element within their regulatory sequences was altered both in response to SA and in response to 2,4D. The coding regions ofTGA2.1, TGA2.2 and TGA1a were cloned into pBluescript SK under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (25.Niggeweg R. Thurow C. Weigel R. Pfitzner U. Gatz C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). RNAs were synthesized using the T7 transcription kit (MBI) with 1 μg of plasmid DNA. TGA proteins were obtained using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 0.5 μg of RNA were included in each reaction. To control the efficient synthesis of the different factors, products were radiolabeled by [35S]methionine incorporation and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). The gel was incubated in 50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid for 30 min and in 7% acetic acid, 7% methanol, 1% glycerol for 5 min before drying it on a gel dryer. The gel was exposed to a Bioimager screen overnight. For EMSAs using as-1 as a probe, a 77-bpHindIII/EcoRI fragment was cut out from the pUC18-as-1 vector. This vector was constructed by cloning the following oligonucleotide into the XbaI site of the multiple cloning site of pUC18:HindIII–XbaI-TGACGTAAgggaTGACGCAc-XbaI—EcoRI. In addition, the 274-bp 5xas-1 PCR fragment described below (see “Affinity Purification of SARP”) was amplified with nonbiotinylated primers and cloned into the vector pUC57/T (MBI Fermentas). For radiolabeling, a 250-bp fragment was cut out using the internal EcoRI site of the PCR fragment and theXbaI site of the vector. As G-box probe, a 55-bp XbaI/EcoRI fragment was cut out of the pUC18-G-box vector. This vector was constructed by cloning a 28-bp BamHI/BglII fragment containing the G-box element, which was obtained from the plasmid pECK box II (kindly provided by Dr. B. Weisshaar, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding, Cologne, Germany), into the BamHI site of the pUC18 vector:XbaI-GGATCCCTTATTCCACGTGGCCATCCGGAGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTC-EcoRI (the G-box motif is written in bold letters). The fragments for gel retardation were radiolabeled by filling in the 5′-overhangs with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP with the Klenow fragment and gel-purified on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Binding reactions were done as described previously (29.Prat S. Willmitzer L. Sanchez-Serrano J.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 17: 209-214Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For supershift analysis, 1 μl of the respective antiserum or preimmune serum was added. Quantification of complexes was accomplished by Bioimager analysis (Fujix BAS 1000, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Generation of the antibodies against the N termini of TGA1a, TGA2.1, and TGA2.2 is described by Niggeweg et al. (25.Niggeweg R. Thurow C. Weigel R. Pfitzner U. Gatz C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To generate a general antibody directed against TGA factors, a synthetic peptide encoding the basic domain (RRLAQNREAARKSRLRKKA) was coupled to ovalbumin (Pierce) and used for rabbit immunization. The antibody was purified against the peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose according to a procedure recommended by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The antibodies directed against TGA2.1 and TGA2.2 were affinity-purified using protein extracts from recombinant Escherichia coli strains expressing the antigen. Incubation of the serum with the antigen blotted on a membrane was done as described (30.Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding either TGA2.1 or TGA2.2 were excised from the respective pSK vectors (25.Niggeweg R. Thurow C. Weigel R. Pfitzner U. Gatz C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) asKpnI/BamHI fragments and ligated to the protein expression vector pETmcs under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The pETmcs vector is a derivative of the vector pET3b with further restriction enzyme sites (KpnI, SnaBI, and HindIII) added to the multiple cloning site downstream of the ATG start codon. This cloning strategy added three amino acids to the N termini of TGA2.1 and TGA2.2. These constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE)-competent cells. To express TGA1a, a pET vector containing the cDNA of TGA1a(7.Strompen G. Gruner R. Pfitzner U.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 871-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was used; the vector was kindly provided by Dr. U. Pfitzner (University of Hohenheim, Hohenheim, Germany). 0.4 ml of an overnight culture was added to 20 ml of medium and incubated at 37 °C untilA 600 = 0.6–0.8 was reached. The expression of the encoded protein was induced for 3 h with 0.6 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The pellet of the cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of denaturation buffer (8m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Tobacco and bacterial proteins were first separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar) and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) as described (31.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44846) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked in PBS-T (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 4 mm Na2HPO4, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk overnight at 4 °C by shaking. It was washed once for 5 min in PBS-T containing 1% nonfat dried milk and then incubated with the respective affinity-purified antibodies diluted in 1% nonfat dried milk/PBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed in 1% nonfat dried milk/PBS-T four times for 5 min. They were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 in PBS-T for 1.5 h at room temperature, washed four times for 5 min in PBS-T and twice for 5 min in PBS. Detection was carried out with a chemiluminescence reaction using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's protocols. The membrane was finally exposed to autoradiography film (Cronex T10, Eastman Kodak Co.). Before incubation of a processed filter with a second primary antibody, it was washed once with PBS and then incubated in stripping buffer (100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 60 min at 50 °C by shaking. Washing was performed twice in PBS-T. Tobacco plants (N. tabacum cv. Samsun NN) were grown under a 16-h light (22 °C)/8-h (19 °C) regime in 85% humidity. Fully expanded, young leaves from tobacco plants were taken either for protein or RNA extraction. For induction experiments, discs of these leaves were floated on 1 mm salicylic acid (SA) or 1 mm3-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, or on 50 μm 2,4-dichlorophenylacetic acid (2,4D) or 50 μm 2,6-dichlorophenylacetic acid (2,6D) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.7. These treatments were performed in a climate chamber under a 16-h light (24 °C)/8-h (22 °C) regime. Preparation of nuclei was done as described previously (29.Prat S. Willmitzer L. Sanchez-Serrano J.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 17: 209-214Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nuclei were not purified using Percoll, but directly used for nuclear protein extraction as described previously (32.Rieping M. Fritz M. Prat S. Gatz C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1087-1098PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular extracts were prepared according to Jupin and Chua (14.Jupin I. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Instead of using Centricon tubes, conventional dialysis was used to desalt the extract. This alteration did not change the binding characteristics of SARP. Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) tobacco (N. tabacum) cell suspension cultures were grown in a modified Murashige and Skoog medium with 3% sucrose, 0.9 g/liter myo-inositol, 0.9 mg/liter thiamine, and 0.22 mg/liter 2,4D at 26 °C in the dark on a rotary shaker. Every week the cells were subcultured by transferring 3 ml of the culture to 27 ml of fresh medium. Cells were harvested 4 days after subculturing by suctioning off the medium, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. After grinding the frozen cells in liquid nitrogen in a mortar, the fine powder was used to prepare cellular extracts as described above for cellular extracts from tobacco leaves. Typically, 2 ml of cellular extracts containing about 5 mg of protein/ml were obtained from 2 g of BY-2 cells. A 274-bp PCR fragment containing five as-1elements (5xas-1) was amplified with a 5′ biotinylated 27-bp upstream primer and a 23-bp downstream primer using the 5xas-1 Gus plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. S. Prat, Barcelona) as template and purified from agarose gel with the QIAquick™ gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The sequence of the 5xas-1 PCR fragment is: biotin, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCCACTGACGTAAgggaTGACGCAcAATCCCACTAGGATCCTCCACTGACGTAAgggaTGACGCAcAATCCCACTAGGATCCTCCACTGACGTAAgggaTGACGCAcAATCCCACTAGGATCCTCCACTGACGTAAgggaTGACGCAcAATCCCACTAGGATCCGTCATCTCCACTGACGTAAgggaTGACGCAcAATCCCACTATCCTTCGCAAGACCCT-3′.as-1 elements are shown in bold and small letters. The internal EcoRI site is underlined. The biotinylated DNA fragment was immobilized on streptavidin-coated, paramagnetic beads (Dynabeads™ M-280 streptavidin; Dynal) as follows. After prewashing the Dynabeads in 1× B&W buffer (2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) according to the manufacturer's specifications, 1 mg of beads were resuspended in 0.5× B&W buffer containing 200 ng of the purified 5xas-1PCR fragment. Coupling occurred during incubation for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rotation of the tube. Afterwards the beads were washed in 1× B&W buffer and equilibrated in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For purification of SARP, all incubations were done at room temperature and with gentle rotation of the tubes. Cellular extract prepared from BY-2 cells was diluted 1:4 in binding buffer. To deplete the amount of unspecific DNA binding proteins and GBFs (G-box binding factors), 20 ng of poly(dI/dC) (Sigma) and 2 ng of G-box double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-GATCTCTTATTCCACGTGGCCATCCGGATC-3′; the G-box motif is written in bold letters) per μg of cellular protein were included as competitor DNA. The mixture was added to 1 μg of Dynabeads (coupled with 0.2 ng of 5xas-1 fragment) per μg of cellular protein, and binding reaction was extended to 20 min. Afterwards, beads with the adsorbed DNA-binding proteins were separated from the supernatant and washed twice for 10 min with 1 volume of binding buffer (supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml BSA) including the same concentration of poly(dI/dC) and G-box oligonucleotide as used in the binding reaction. Finally elution of DNA binding proteins was performed by twice adding 0.125 volume of elution buffer (binding buffer supplemented with 2m NaCl; if the eluted fraction was used for EMSAs, 0.5 mg/ml BSA was added) to the beads (eluted fractions 1 and 2; elution time, 15 and 10 min, respectively). The initial cellular extract and the eluted fraction 1 were analyzed for specific as-1 and G-box binding activities in EMSAs. Because the eluted fraction 1 is twice as concentrated compared to the initial extract, we added 1 volume of cellular extract corresponding to 5 μg of protein and 0.5 volume of eluted fraction 1 to the binding reactions. Because of the very low protein content, 10 μg of BSA was included in binding reactions with the eluted fraction. Eluted fractions 1 and 2 from initially 3.4 mg of cellular proteins were collected, dialyzed against water, freeze-dried, and resuspended in 25 μl of denaturation buffer (8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). 2.5 μl of the sample were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. To introduce the mutations in the basic domain of TGA2.2, a cDNA fragment encoding the N terminus and basic domain of TGA2.2 was amplified by PCR. The lower primer (CCC AAG CTT CAT ATG CCT TTT TCC TTA GAC GAC TTT TCC GCG GTG GTT CAC G introducing a HindIII site) being complementary to the basic DNA-binding domain contained nucleotide substitutions to change the sequence AGCAGCTCGAA on the upper DNA strand to ACCACCGCGGA. These substitutions caused an exchange of two alanine to proline residues. The upper primer encoded the sequence GGG GTA CCA ACC ATG GCT GAT ATC AGT CCT A, introducing a KpnI site and the Kozak sequence. The PCR fragment was subcloned as a KpnI/HindIII fragment into the pSK vector (pSK-28mutNterm). The introduced nucleotide substitutions were controlled by sequencing. The C-terminal fragment (HincII/BamHI) was amplified using PCR, to generate a single SunI restriction site just upstream of the Stop codon, changing the sequence from CGG GAA TAA to CGT ACG TAA. An oligonucleotide encoding the Streptavidin-Tag (WSHPQFEK) was inserted into pSK-28modCterm vector digested withSunI/BamHI and controlled by sequencing. TheHincII/BamHI fragment was used to exchange the C terminus within the pSK vector encoding the wild-type allele. ANdeI/BamHI fragment of this vector was ligated into the pSK-28mutNterm vector, which was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI resulting in the derivative TGA2.2trd. To obtain the corresponding wild-type TGA2.2 allele with the Kozak sequence, the cDNA sequence containing the nucleotide substitutions was exchanged by the corresponding EcoRV/PstI fragment of the wild-type TGA2.2 cDNA. The cDNAs encoding the TGA2.2 derivatives (TGA2.2 and TGA2.2trd) were cloned under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (modified by three operators; Ref. 33.Gatz C. Frohberg C. Wendenburg R. Plant J. 1992; 2: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar), by excising them from the pSK vectors asKpnI/XbaI fragments and inserting them in pBINHygTX (32.Rieping M. Fritz M. Prat S. Gatz C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1087-1098PubMed Google Scholar), cleaved with KpnI and XbaI. The constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciensGV3101 competent cells containing the pMP90 vector (34.Koncz C. Schell J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 383-396Crossref Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Transformation of tobacco plants was performed using the Agrobacterium leaf disc technique as described previously (35.Horsch R.B. Fry J.E. Hoffmann D. Eichholtz D. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T. Science. 1985; 227: 1229-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from tobacco leaves using the RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, and 15 μg of RNA for each sample were electrophoresed on denaturing agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell; Ref. 36.Fourney R. Miyakoshi J. Day III, R.S. Paterson M.C. Focus. 1988; 10: 5-7Google Scholar). RNA blots were prehybridized in 50% formamide, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate sodium salt, and 1 mNaCl for 1 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was performed in the same solution with 100 μg/ml salmon sperm carrier DNA and32P-labeled probe for 14–16 h at 42 °C. The probe was made by the random-priming method (37.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar) with the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA probes used for Northern blot hybridizations were: tobacco Nt103, a 1-kilobase pair full-length cDNA encoding the auxin-inducible geneNt103 (38.Van der Zaal B.J. Droog F.N.J. Boot C.J.

https://openalex.org/W2024864454,"African trypanosomes, the cause of sleeping sickness, need massive amounts of myristate to remodel glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors on their surface glycoproteins. However, it has been believed that the parasite is unable to synthesize any fatty acids, and myristate is not abundant in the hosts' bloodstreams. Thus, it has been unclear how trypanosomes meet their myristate requirement. Here we found that they could indeed synthesize fatty acids. The synthetic pathway was unique in that the major product, myristate, was preferentially incorporated into GPIs and not into other lipids. The antibiotic thiolactomycin inhibited myristate synthesis and killed the parasite, making this pathway a potential chemotherapeutic target."

Here we have investigated the impact of PDE4D3 activation on hormone responsiveness. Stimulation of FRTL-5 cells with TSH caused an increase in PDE activity within 3 min, with a maximal stimulation reached after 5 min. Preincubation with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 or (R p)-cAMPS, but not with the inactive isomer H85, blocked this activation.

Corbin J.D. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1822-1829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maximal biological effects are elicited with only 2–3-fold changes in intracellular cAMP levels, while the cell potential for cAMP production is usually much larger. In addition, the increase in intracellular cAMP is transient despite the continuous presence of the extracellular stimulus (2.Su Y.F. Cubeddu L. Perkins J.P. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1976; 2: 257-270PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Barber R. Clark R.B. Kelly L.A. Butcher R.W. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 9: 507-516PubMed Google Scholar). This limited and short-lived nature of the activating signal is an essential feature of hormone or neurotransmitter action. This is necessary to decrease the intrinsic “noise” in the signaling mechanism, to allow iterative signaling, and to prevent excessive stimulation. The rapid and transient changes in cAMP concentrations are the result of changes in both synthesis and degradation of the second messenger cAMP, involving steps at the receptor as well as at a postreceptor level (4.Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 5.Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Following the activation of Gs and adenylyl cyclase, receptor phosphorylation causes an uncoupling from Gs, and therefore a decrease in cAMP synthesis. For the β2-adrenergic receptor, β2-adrenergic receptor kinases phosphorylate only agonist-occupied active receptors and enhance the affinity of the receptors for the inhibitor protein β-arrestin (6.Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Binding of β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptors inhibits the receptor-Gs interaction, thereby inducing the uncoupled or desensitized state of the receptors (7.Lohse M.J. Andexinger S. Pitcher J. Trukawinski S. Codina J. Faure J.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8558-8564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several kinases have also been implicated in the phosphorylation of the glycoprotein receptors including the GRK kinases, PKA1 and PKC. While PKA efficiently phosphorylates and uncouples the β-adrenergic receptor (5.Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), the involvement of this kinase in the glycoprotein receptor phosphorylation is less clear (8.Ascoli M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition to receptor uncoupling from G protein and cyclase, rapid modulation of phosphodiesterases and of cAMP degradation plays an essential role in the transient accumulation of cyclic nucleotides (9.Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 370-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This concept was initially inferred by the use of xanthine inhibitors of PDEs and by measuring the decay of the cAMP signal in intact cells (3.Barber R. Clark R.B. Kelly L.A. Butcher R.W. Adv.

The use of cAMP analogs has confirmed that cAMP-dependent PKA activation in the cell causes an activation of cAMP degradation (10.Corbin J.D. Gettys T.W. Blackmore P.F. Beebe S.J. Francis S.H.

The impact and physiological significance of this rapid feedback regulation is unclear. Of the many PDEs expressed in the cell, two isoforms are activated by an increase in cAMP. In platelets (13.Macphee C.H. Reifsnyder D.H. Moore T.A. Beavo J.A. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1986; 11: 487-496PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Grant P.G. Mannarino A.F. Colman R.W.

Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1986; 11: 497-511PubMed Google Scholar) a type 3 PDE is activated by a PKA-dependent phosphorylation lowering cAMP levels. Recently, a distinct PDE isoenzyme, a member of the PDE4 family, has been implicated in this feedback regulation (17.Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In thyroid cells, TSH causes a PKA-mediated phosphorylation and activation of a PDE4D3 variant. This conclusion is supported by studies involving PDE4-specific inhibitors and immunoprecipitation with PDE4-selective antibodies (17.Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is consistent with cell-free phosphorylation and activation of the recombinant PDE4D3 enzymes (18.Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The site of PKA phosphorylation of PDE4D3 has been mapped to the amino terminus of PDE4D3 where Ser13 and Ser54 are the predominant phosphorylation sites. Only Ser54phosphorylation, however, is essential for activation of cAMP hydrolysis (18.Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Similar PDE4 activation has been described in myoblasts (19.Ball E.H. Seth P.K. Sanwal B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), aortic smooth muscle cells (20.Ekholm D. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. Degerman E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and osteoclasts (21.Ahlstrom M. Lamberg-Allardt C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating the ubiquitous nature of this feedback regulation. While the impact of overall PDE4 activity on cAMP levels during cell stimulation can be assessed using PDE4-selective inhibitors, the exact role of PDE4D activation during hormonal stimulation has not been explored. Here, we have taken advantage of different strategies to distinguish between the effect of basal and activated PDE on cAMP accumulation and determine how the increase in PDE4D activity affects the TSH-dependent responses of FRTL-5 cells. We demonstrate that PDE4D3 activation has a major impact on the cAMP response by controlling the intensity of the cAMP signal. Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium (Coon's F-12), bovine TSH, bovine insulin, human transferrin for culture, andCrotalus atrox snake venom were purchased from Sigma; bovine TSH, bovine FSH, and hCG for stimulation were obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Agency of the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health; Pansorbin cells from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); Immobilon membrane from Millipore Corp.

Rolipram (4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)imidazolidin-2-one) was provided by Shering A.G. (Berlin, Germany). Unless otherwise designated, all other chemicals were the purest grade available from Sigma. FRTL-5 cells (ATCC number CRL8305), a line of rat thyroid follicular cells developed by Dr. F. S. Ambesi-Impiombato et al. (22.Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), were generously provided by Dr. Leonard Kohn (Section of Cell Regulation, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health) and the Interthyr Research Foundation (Baltimore, MD). Cells were routinely cultured in Coon's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and a mixture of three hormones (3H) including TSH (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), and transferrin (5 μg/ml). Mouse Leydig tumor cells (MA-10) (23.Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) were grown in Waymouth MB752/1 modified to contain 1.1 g/liter NaHCO, 20 mm Hepes, 50 μg/ml Gentamicin, and 15% horse serum, pH 7.4 (growth medium). FRTL-5 cells and MA-10 cells were cultured in 75-cm flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Sertoli cell cultures were prepared from 15-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats following a procedure previously reported (24.Conti M. Toscano M.V. Petrelli L. Geremia R. Stefanini M. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and cells were seeded on 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes in a serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with glutamine, nonessential amino acids, pyruvic acids, gentamycin, streptomycin, and penicillin. Incubation was carried out at 32 °C in a controlled atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. MA-10 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/dish and used 1 day later. MA-10 cells were transfected with pCDNA3-PDE4D3, pCDNA3-rat PDE 4D3/Ser13–54/Ala, or pCDNA alone as control (see Ref.18.Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). DNA transfection was performed during a 4-h incubation with CaPO4 as described by Parker and Stark (25.Parker B.A. Stark G.R. J. Virol. 1979; 31: 360-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each dish received 18 μg of expression vector. The cells were shocked with 15% glycerol (in Hanks' balanced salt solution) for 2 min at room temperature at the end of the incubation with the plasmid/CaPO4 mixture. Following transfection, the cells were extensively washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated in growth medium for 1 day. The medium was then replaced with growth medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418. The cells were maintained in this medium for about 2 weeks with twice weekly media changes. Resistant colonies were isolated by gentle scraping and suction with a P1000 pipettman and were then transferred to individual wells of a 96-well plate. The clones were expanded by passage to 24- and 6-well plates. These wells were maintained in the appropriate medium (see above) and were expanded into T25 or T75 flasks as they became confluent. Cells were subcultured into 10-cm dishes and assayed for cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity or for cAMP accumulation (see below). FRTL-5 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes in Coon's F-12 containing 5% serum and three hormones. After 5–7 days, cell monolayers were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and cultures were continued for an additional 24 h with Coon's F-12 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin to induce cell quiescence. The medium was changed 1 h before the experiment. MA-10 cells were plated in growth medium (see above). The medium was replaced on day 2 and the experiments were performed on day 3. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed 4 times with warm assay medium (Waymouth MB752/1 modified to contain 1.12 g/liter of NaHCO3, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). At the end of the treatment, cell monolayers were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS solution, then homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μg/ml microcystin, 50 mm benzamidine, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. PDE activity was measured using 1 μm cAMP as substrate, according to the method of Thompson and Appleman (26.Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as detailed previously (24.Conti M. Toscano M.V. Petrelli L. Geremia R. Stefanini M. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Samples were assayed in a total volume of 200 μl of reaction mixture including 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm cAMP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and [3H]cAMP (0.1 μCi/tube). In some experiments, serial dilutions (1 nm to 10 μm) of Rolipram were added to the reaction mixture. After incubation at 34 °C for 5–15 min, the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm EDTA, followed by heat denaturation for exactly 1 min at 100 °C. To each reaction tube, 50 μg of C. atrox snake venom was added, and the incubation was continued at 34 °C for 20 min. The reaction products were separated by anion exchange chromatography on AG1-X8 resin, and the amount of radiolabeled adenosine collected was quantitated by scintillation counting. H89 is a synthetic isoquinoline sulfonamide that has been shown to be the most selective and potent inhibitor of PKA in this series of derivatives (27.Hidaka H. Watanabe M. Kobayashi R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). H85 is an inactive derivative structurally related to H89 which was used as a control for the nonspecific effects of H89. Both compounds inhibited recombinant PDE4D3 activity in a concentration-dependent fashion in a cell-free assay. H89 was less effective than H85 with IC50 values of 50 and 10 μm, respectively. At a concentration of 300 μm, both compounds blocked approximately 90% of the PDE activity. The FRTL-5 cell extracts in RIPA buffer were immunoprecipitated using fixedStaphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin) according to the method of Macphee with minor modifications (28.Macphee C.H. Harrison S.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6660-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with Pansorbin and an anti-cAMP-PDE antiserum (K116) (29.Iona S. Cuomo M. Bushnik T. Naro F. Sette C. Hess M. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The bound PDE was eluted from the pellet by incubation with 1% SDS in PBS at room temperature. Eluted samples were diluted in 4× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.7 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenol blue). The samples were boiled for 5 min and proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the membrane overnight in 5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) dissolved in TBS-T solution (0.2% Tween 20, 20 mmTris-HCl, 14 mm NaCl, pH 7.6). The following day, the membrane was incubated in a monoclonal antibody (M3S1) raised against the carboxyl-terminal region of rat PDE4D3 (29.Iona S. Cuomo M. Bushnik T. Naro F. Sette C. Hess M. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), diluted 1:100 (v/v) in TBS-T for 1 h, washed extensively for 1 h with multiple changes of TBS-T, and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:7500 in TBS-T. After multiple washes in TBS-T for at least 1 h, bound antibodies were detected using a luminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and recorded after exposure to XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). FRTL-5 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes in Coon's F-12 containing 5% serum and three hormones. After 5–7 days, cell monolayers were rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and cultures were continued for an additional 24 h with Coon's F-12 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin to induce cell quiescence. The medium was changed 1 h before the experiment. MA-10 cells were plated in growth medium (see above). The medium was replaced on day 2 and the experiments were performed on day 3. On the day of the experiments the cells were washed 4 times with warm assay medium (Waymouth MB752/1 modified to contain 1.12 g/liter of NaHCO3, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Sertoli cells were plated in growth medium (see above). The medium was replaced on day 3 and the experiments were performed on day 4. On the day of the experiments the cells were washed twice with warm PBS solution. At the end of the treatment ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (0.1%) in 95% EtOH was added. Samples were harvested and transferred to glass vials. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. EtOH in the supernatant was evaporated using vacuum centrifugation at room temperature and the material was reconstituted with PBS solution, pH 7.4, then cAMP content was measured by RIA (30.Steiner A.L. Pagliara A.S. Chase L.R. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1114-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after acetylation of the samples and appropriate dilution (31.Harper J.F. Brooker G. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar). 8-CPT-cAMP used for cell stimulation was first repurified by gel filtration chromatography on a 1 × 17-cm Sephadex G-25 (superfine) column (10.Corbin J.D. Gettys T.W. Blackmore P.F. Beebe S.J. Francis S.H. Glass D.B. Redmon J.B. Sheorain V.S. Landiss L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with purified 8-CPT-cAMP for 30 min at 30 °C and incubation was terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (0.1%) in 95% EtOH. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C. EtOH in the supernatant was evaporated using vacuum centrifugation at room temperature and the material was reconstituted with 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 7.8. The sample was applied at 4 °C to a 1 × 45-cm Sephadex G-25 (superfine) column equilibrated in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, and 0.5-ml fractions/min were collected (12.Corbin J.D. Beebe S.J. Blackmore P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8731-8735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to cAMP were evaporated and reconstituted with PBS solution, pH 7.4, and cAMP content was measured by RIA. Recovery of [3H]cAMP from the columns was approximately 50%. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) or Lowry (40.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin or γ-globulin as a standard, respectively. The PDE activity expressed in FRTL-5 cells is stimulated by TSH (17.Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions used, the increase in PDE activity was maximal within 5 min, and the activity remained elevated for at least 30 min (see below). We have previously reported that this PDE activation is associated with phosphorylation and a shift in electrophoretic mobility of the PDE4D3 protein (18.Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). A detailed time course study showed that a polypeptide with an apparentM r of 93 was present in unstimulated cells, and incubation with TSH caused the appearance of an additional band withM r of 98 (Fig. 1,left panel). The appearance of the 98-kDa species was associated with a decrease in the intensity of the 93-kDa band (Fig. 1,right panel). Thus, PDE4D3 remained phosphorylated for at least 30 min after stimulation and the shift in mobility was consistent with the increase in activity. To test the role of PKA on activation of PDE, quiescent FRTL-5 cells were preincubated for 1 h in the absence or presence of either 10 μm H89, a PKA-specific inhibitor, or 1 mm (R p)-cAMPS, a cAMP antagonist. At the end of this preincubation, cells were stimulated with 10 nm TSH for 5 min, and PDE activity was measured in the cell homogenate (Table I). TSH stimulation of PDE was blocked by either H89 or (R p)-cAMP. Treatment with H89 completely obliterated the TSH-stimulated PDE activity at all time points studied (Fig. 2).Table IEffect of PKA inhibitors on the TSH-stimulated PDE activityTreatmentPDE activityNo inhibitorH89(R p)-cAMPSpmol/min/mg proteinControl53.29 ± 3.08aThe difference between these two values is significant (p < 0.001).67.63 ± 7.4756.56 ± 2.79TSH96.80 ± 3.48aThe difference between these two values is significant (p < 0.001).69.93 ± 12.4365.01 ± 0.55Quiescent FRTL-5 cells were preincubated in the absence or presence of different PKA inhibitors (10 μm H89, 1 mm(Rp)-cAMP) for 1 h.

Open table in a new tab Quiescent FRTL-5 cells were preincubated in the absence or presence of different PKA inhibitors (10 μm H89, 1 mm(Rp)-cAMP) for 1 h. At the end of the preincubation, cells were challenged for 5 min with 10 nmTSH, harvested in homogenization buffer, homogenized, and the PDE activity in the cell extracts was determined using 1 μmcAMP as substrate. To determine whether the PKA inhibition is associated with a change in mobility of the PDE4D3 expressed in FRTL-5 cells, Western blot analysis was performed on extracts from cells incubated without and with TSH and different PKA inhibitors. Fig. 3 shows that the TSH-induced shift in the mobility of the cAMP-PDE polypeptide was completely blocked by H89, and to a lesser extent by staurosporine, while the H85 isomer had no effect (Fig. 3). The band shift was incompletely blocked by a 5-min preincubation with (R p)-cAMPS (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that phosphorylation and activation of the PDE4D3 protein was prevented by blocking PKA activity. Since activation of a PDE is prevented by H89, inhibition of PKA was used to determine the impact of PDE feedback activation on cAMP levels in FRTL-5 cells. FRTL-5 cultures were treated with 10 μm H89 or 10 μm H85 for 1 h prior to and during the TSH stimulation, and cAMP levels were determined. H89 treatment potentiated the TSH-dependent cAMP accumulation, but H85 had no effect (Fig.4). A detailed time course showed that cAMP accumulation was increased by H89 PKA blockade as early as 3 min and that H89 continued to be effective after 30 min (Fig.5).Figure 5Time course of the TSH-dependent cAMP accumulation: effect of the PKA inhibitor H89. Quiescent FRTL-5 cells were preincubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm H89 for 1 h. At the end of the preincubation, cells were stimulated with 10 nm TSH. Cells were harvested at different time intervals from the hormone addition and intracellular cAMP levels were determined by RIA. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of three observations. A representative experiment of the three performed is reported.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The PDE4-specific inhibitor Rolipram at a concentration of 10 μm produced a large increase in maximum cAMP accumulation induced by TSH, with no major change in the time course (data not shown). Conversely, incubation with the nonselective PDE inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine prevented the return of cAMP to basal levels (data not shown). When Rolipram was used in combination with H89 and TSH, the H89 potentiation of cAMP accumulation was no longer evident (TSH + Rolipram = 1604 ± 393; TSH + Rolipram + H89 = 1364 ± 143 pmol of cAMP/mg of protein). This latter finding suggests that the H89 effect was not due to changes in the rate of cAMP synthesis. Sertoli and FRTL-5 cells often have been compared because they provide similar models with which to study peptide hormone receptor activation of target cells. While TSH produces a rapid activation of a PDE in FRTL-5 cells, FSH does not stimulate PDE activity in a short term fashion in immature Sertoli cells. This difference is due to the fact that PDE4D3, the target for PKA activation in FRTL-5 cells, is undetectable in immature Sertoli cells (34.Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Sertoli cells were used to determine whether H89 treatment potentiated the hormone-dependent cAMP accumulation in the absence of a short term PDE activation. Fig. 6 shows that H89 did not potentiate the FSH stimulation of cAMP in the Sertoli cells during this short term incubation. No change or a decrease in cAMP accumulation was observed with H89 after 30 and 60 min (Fig. 6). This finding indicates that H89 was ineffective in increasing intracellular cAMP when PDE4D3 activation was absent. According to the feedback model, a direct activation of PKA bypassing the adenylyl cyclase step should produce a decrease in cAMP in the cell. This possibility was tested by incubating FRTL-5 cells with cAMP analogs that can be separated from the endogenous cAMP. Previously, this strategy has been used in hepatocytes, taking advantage of several available cAMP analogs that specifically activate PKA (35.Beebe S.J. Corbin J.D. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 43-75Google Scholar). Given its chromatographic properties, 8-CPT-cAMP can easily be separated from cAMP on a G-25 gel filtration column (10.Corbin J.D. Gettys T.W.

https://openalex.org/W2065685149,"Previous studies suggested that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) antagonizes insulin action by catalyzing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and/or other key proteins in the insulin signaling pathway. In adipose tissue and muscle of obese humans and rodents, PTP1B expression is increased, which led to the hypothesis that PTP1B plays a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Consistent with this, mice in which the PTP1B gene was disrupted exhibit increased insulin sensitivity. To test whether increased expression of PTP1B in an insulin-sensitive cell type could contribute to insulin resistance, we overexpressed wild-type PTP1B in 3T3L1 adipocytes using adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. PTP1B expression was increased ∼3–5-fold above endogenous levels at 16 h, ∼14-fold at 40 h, and ∼20-fold at 72 h post-transduction. Total protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity was increased by 50% at 16 h, 3–4-fold at 40 h, and 5–6-fold at 72 h post-transduction. Compared with control cells, cells expressing high levels of PTP1B showed a 50–60% decrease in maximally insulin-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of IR and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity associated with IRS-1 or with phosphotyrosine. Akt phosphorylation and activity were unchanged. Phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAP kinase (MAPK) was reduced ∼32%. Overexpression of PTP1B had no effect on basal, submaximally or maximally (100 nm) insulin-stimulated glucose transport or on the EC50 for transport. Our results suggest that: 1) insulin stimulation of glucose transport in adipocytes requires ≤45% of maximal tyrosyl phosphorylation of IR or IRS-1 and <50% of maximal activation of PI3K, 2) a novel PI3K-independent pathway may play a role in insulin-induced glucose transport in adipocytes, and 3) overexpression of PTP1B alone in adipocytes does not impair glucose transport. Previous studies suggested that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) antagonizes insulin action by catalyzing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR) and/or other key proteins in the insulin signaling pathway. In adipose tissue and muscle of obese humans and rodents, PTP1B expression is increased, which led to the hypothesis that PTP1B plays a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.

These tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins provide high affinity binding sites for the Src homology 2 domains of several signal relay molecules, such as the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which leads to kinase activation and stimulation of several downstream mediators, including the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (6.Franke T.F.

Impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissue is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of insulin-resistant states such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Substantial efforts have been made to identify proteins that impair critical steps in insulin signal transduction in individuals with insulin resistance. The central role of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its substrates in insulin action has focused attention on protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) as candidate molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Indeed, increased expression and activity of several PTPs has been observed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in insulin-resistant, obese states in rodents and humans (16.Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17.Ahmad F. Considine R.V. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin.

In obese humans, the increased PTP activity in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue has been reported to be due mainly to increased expression of two PTPs, the transmembrane (receptor-like) leukocyte antigen related phosphatase (LAR) and the nontransmembrane tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B (17.Ahmad F. Considine R.V. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2806-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18.Ahmad F. Azevedo J.L. Cortright R. Dohm G.L. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Whereas Src homology phosphatase 2 expression is also increased, immunodepletion (17.Ahmad F. Considine R.V. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2806-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18.Ahmad F. Azevedo J.L. Cortright R. Dohm G.L. Goldstein B.J. J. Clin.

Biochem. 1998; 182: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) studies suggest it may be less important. Consistent with the notion that increased PTP activity may contribute to insulin resistance, weight loss in obese humans results in a decrease in the level of these PTPs, concomitant with an increase in the glucose disposal rate (22.Ahmad F. Considine R.V. Bauer T.L. Ohannesian J.P. Marco C.C. Goldstein B.J. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 1140-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, such studies provide only correlative suggestions that one or more of these PTPs plays a causal role in insulin resistance. Some studies using cultured cells support the notion that PTP1B participates in regulation of insulin receptor signaling. Overexpression of PTP1B in rat fibroblasts that also overexpress insulin receptors at high levels results in decreased insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation (23.Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, fibroblasts do not express GLUT4, the major physiologically relevant glucose transporter, so the significance of these findings for glucose transport in insulin responsive tissues remains unclear. In transient transfection studies in primary rat adipocytes, overexpression of PTP1B was reported to decrease cell surface GLUT4 in the presence of insulin (24.Chen H. Wertheimer S.J. Lin C.H. Katz S.L. Amrein K.E. Burn P. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8026-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, surface levels of GLUT4 were decreased also in the absence of insulin (24.Chen H. Wertheimer S.J. Lin C.H. Katz S.L. Amrein K.E. Burn P. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8026-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), such that the overall increment of cell surface GLUT4 in response to insulin was normal in PTP1B-overexpressing cells. Moreover, the transient transfection approach does not permit any assessment of the consequences of PTP1B overexpression on protein phosphorylation or activation of intracellular signal transduction. The most compelling evidence that PTP1B could play an important role in the physiologic regulation of insulin receptor signaling comes from recent work characterizing mice rendered PTP1B-deficient by homologous recombination (25.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). These mice exhibit increased insulin sensitivity in terms of glucose homeostasis and enhanced insulin-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of the IR and IRS-1 in muscle and liver. Notably, however, insulin-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation in adipose tissue appears unaffected (25.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). Thus, although it now seems likely that PTP1B is an important negative regulator of insulin signaling in muscle and liver, its role in normal insulin action in the adipocyte remains uncertain. Moreover, it remains unclear whether increased PTP1B expression in adipocytes, at levels comparable to those found in insulin-resistant rodents and humans, can impair insulin-induced signal transduction and lead to insulin resistance. To address these questions, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to achieve greater than 90% efficient expression of human PTP1B in the highly insulin responsive target cell, the 3T3-L1 adipocyte. With PTP1B overexpression ranging from ≤3-fold (at 4–8 h after viral transduction) to 20-fold (with longer time after transduction) over endogenous levels, neither maximal nor submaximal glucose transport was altered despite blunted upstream insulin signaling, reflected by 50–60% impairments in IR and IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation and PI3K activation. Insulin-stimulated Akt activity also remained unaffected, whereas MAPK phosphorylation in response to insulin was reduced ∼32%. Our data demonstrate that, in 3T3L1 adipocytes, <50% of maximal PI3K activation is necessary for maximal activation of glucose transport and Akt/protein kinase B by insulin. Furthermore, our results suggest that the modest increase in PTP1B activity observed in adipose tissue of obese, insulin-resistant humans and rodents is, by itself, unlikely to impair insulin signaling to a pathophysiologically significant degree such that it would interfere with glucose transport. Conceivably, however, increased PTP1B activity in other tissues or in combination with elevation of other protein-tyrosine phosphatases could alter insulin action and lead to the development of insulin resistance. 293 cells and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (obtained from the ATCC, catalog no. CCL 92.1, Rockville, MD) were grown in DMEM with 10% newborn calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Two days after reaching confluence, fibroblasts were induced to differentiate by treatment with 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone (both from Sigma), and 1 μg/ml insulin (porcine, crystalline, gift from R. Chance, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) for 3 days. During and following differentiation, DMEM was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were used for experiments at least 10 days after induction of differentiation and only if greater than 90% of cells showed fat droplets. COS-7 cells were transfected at 80–90% confluence in serum-free Optimem (Life Technologies, Inc.), using 2.5 μg of DNA and 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.)/35-mm diameter dish with pJ3H constructs containing the respective mouse and human PTP1B cDNA. The pJ3H vector places an N-terminal HA tag on expressed proteins. Transfected cells were incubated overnight, and the medium was changed to standard DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum in the morning. After 24 h, the cells were collected as described below. Human PTP1B cDNA (3.2 kilobases) was cloned as an EcoRI fragment (26.Chernoff J. Schievella A.R. Jost C.A. Erikson R.L. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2735-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) into pACCMV·pLpA (27.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alarm T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 262-289Google Scholar) (a gift of C. Newgard, University of Texas, Southwestern, Dallas, TX), resulting in the plasmid pACCMV·pLpA-PTP1B. Viral recombination was achieved as described previously (10.Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 27.Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alarm T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 262-289Google Scholar). Briefly, pACCMV·pLpA-PTP1B (0.7 μg/35-mm diameter dish) was co-transfected with the plasmid pJM-17 (1 μg/35-mm diameter dish, gift of C. Newgard) into 80% confluent 293 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombination, as indicated by cell lysis, occurred 1–2 weeks after transfection. Six clones of recombinant virus were assayed by immunoblotting transduced 293 cell lysates with anti-PTP1B antibodies. All six clones revealed successful integration of PTP1B into adenovirus, and one clone was amplified further in 293 cells. The virus was purified from 40 15-cm diameter plates by two sequential cesium chloride gradient centrifugations. A recombinant adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (gift of C. Newgard) was amplified and purified in the same way as the PTP1B-encoding virus. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transduced with recombinant adenovirus overnight with constant agitation on a rocking platform in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. PTP1B- and β-galactosidase-encoding recombinant adenoviruses were used at a concentration of 1 × 1012 plaque forming units/ml, as determined by spectrophotometry (corresponding to 1 × 109 plaque forming units/ml by limiting dilution). Experiments were performed at 16, 40, or 72 h after transduction. For experiments at 40 and 72 h, adenovirus was removed at 16 h, and cells were incubated for an additional 24–56 h in DMEM with or without serum starvation. For glucose transport, experiments were also performed after only 4 or 8 h of transduction to assess the effects of low level overexpression of PTP1B. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in DMEM with 0.1% or 10% fetal calf serum for 16 h prior to study, stimulated with insulin (0 or 100 nm) for 1 or 5 min, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and collected in 200 (16-mm diameter dish) or 500 μl (35-mm diameter dish) of ice-cold lysis buffer (pH 7.4) (20 mmHEPES, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPP, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm vanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin (28.Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)). The lysates were then homogenized by 20 strokes with a Potter homogenizer and centrifuged for 15 min in a microfuge at 4 °C. COS-7 cells were collected in the same manner except without insulin stimulation. PTP activity was measured in lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were not transduced or were transduced with β-galactosidase or PTP1B adenoviruses. Lysates from cells at the indicated times post-transduction were collected in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (7.5), 140 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μl/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. Aliquots containing 10 μg of cellular protein were incubated with a solution containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm pNPP for 30 min or 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.2m NaOH. PTP activity was then determined by absorbance at 410 nm. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (10.Frevert E.U.

The membranes were then washed for 25 min in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20, and bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified by densitometry using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Lysates from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (80–100 μg of protein) were collected as described above with the exception that buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin were used. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of a polyclonal IRS-1 antiserum (gift of M. White, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA) or PY20 monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibodies (Santa Cruz) coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immune complexes were washed as described (32.Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Sherman L.A. Carey J. Smith R.J. Dohm G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 9585: 2195-2204Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 50 ml of Tris-NaCl buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm Na3VO4). PI3K activity was measured as reported (32.Goodyear L.J. Giorgino F. Sherman L.A. Carey J. Smith R.J. Dohm G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 9585: 2195-2204Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the spots corresponding to PI3-phosphate was quantified using densitometry and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Lysates from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (80–100 μg of protein) were collected in buffer A (above). Samples were immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of a polyclonal Akt antiserum (recognizing both Akt1 and Akt2) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immune pellets were washed as described (33.Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor, 30 μm Crosstide, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) (34.Kim Y.-B. Zhu J.-S. Zierath J.R. Shen H.-Q. Baron A.D. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Aliquots (40 μl) of the reaction mixture were spotted onto phosphocellulose p81 paper (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) and washed, and the incorporated counts were determined by scintillation counting (33.Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose transport was measured after cells were incubated following two protocols. In protocol 1, fully differentiated adipocytes were not transduced or were transduced with β-galactosidase or PTP1B adenoviruses for 4, 8, or 16 h followed by a 3–4-h serum starvation. In protocol 2, cells were left nontransduced or were transduced for 16 h with β-galactosidase or PTP1B virus. The medium was then changed to standard DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum without virus, and cells were incubated for another 24 or 56 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, so that experiments could be performed at 40 and 72 h after viral transduction. In both protocols, cells were starved for 3–4 h in serum-free DMEM (25 mm glucose) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and then washed once with glucose-free minimum Eagle's medium. Insulin (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, or 100 nm) was added for 30 min, followed by the addition of 100 μm[3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose, 0.33 μCi per 35-mm diameter well (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA). Cells were incubated for a further 10 min in a gently shaking waterbath at 37 °C. Transport was subsequently stopped by placing the cells on ice and adding 1:1 (v/v) ice-cold phloretin solution (82 μg/liter in phosphate-buffered saline) (Sigma). Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 1 N NaOH at 37 °C for 30 min, and [3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Statview software. Curve fitting was performed with Origin 35 (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). We overexpressed human PTP1B in mouse adipocytes. Because there is no available PTP1B antibody with equal affinity for mouse and human PTP1B, to enable quantification of the relative level of PTP1B expression in transduced cells, we first determined the relative affinity of our antibodies for mouse and human PTP1B. The antibody used was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the N-terminal 150 amino acids of human PTP1B (GST-N) (31.Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This region is 93% identical between human and mouse PTP1B. We transiently transfected COS-7 cells with HA-tagged mouse and human PTP1B cDNA and compared anti-HA reactivity with anti-PTP1B reactivity. When transfected COS-7 cell lysates were immunoblotted with the anti-HA antibody, approximately equal amounts of mouse and human PTP1B were detected (Fig. 1 A, left panel). However, when the same cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-PTP1B antiserum, there was a substantially higher intensity signal for human PTP1B (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Quantifying these results reveals an ∼7-fold greater sensitivity of the anti-PTP1B antiserum for human, compared with mouse PTP1B; hence signals derived from endogenous mouse PTP1B must be multiplied by seven to compare with signals derived from the exogenous human PTP1B protein. For example, Fig. 1 B shows results of 3T3-L1 adipocytes transduced with adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase or human PTP1B. Transduction with β-galactosidase-encoding adenovirus had no effect on the relatively low level of endogenous PTP1B protein compared with nontransduced cells (not shown). The PTP1B expression did not change over 72 h after transduction with β-galactosidase-encoding virus; hence only the level at 72 h is shown. The PTP1B-transduced cells show an increase in the immunoreactive signal of ∼20–35-fold at 16 h, ∼98-fold at 40 h, and ∼140-fold at 72 h after transduction compared with cells transduced with the β-galactosidase-encoding adenovirus (Fig. 1 B). However, normalizing for the difference in antiserum sensitivity for human and mouse PTP1B demonstrated with COS cell transfections shown in Fig.1 A, the corrected increase in PTP1B expression in PTP1B-transduced adipocytes is approximately 3–5-fold at 16 h, ∼14-fold at 40 h, and ∼20-fold at 72 h (Fig.1 C). We carried out the biochemical studies described below at these different time points to compare low level overexpression as seen in insulin-resistant humans and rodents with higher level overexpression. Total PTP activity was measured in lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes at 16, 40, and 72 h after transfection with β-galactosidase or PTP1B adenovirus (Fig.2). Sixteen hours post-transduction, total PTP activity was increased by ∼50% in PTP1B-transduced cells compared with either nontransduced or β-galactosidase-transduce"
https://openalex.org/W2020479551,"Abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the α1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with a predominant loss of the Purkinje cell. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from mouse Purkinje cells revealed a predominant expression of the α1A channel lacking an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in the domain IV (α1A(−NP)). Human α1A channels carrying various polyglutamine length with or without NP were expressed in HEK293 cells, and channel properties were compared using a whole-cell voltage clamp technique. α1A(−NP), corresponding to P-type channel, with 24 and 28 polyglutamines found in patients showed the voltage dependence of inactivation shifting negatively by 6 and 11 mV, respectively, from the 13 polyglutamine control. Contrarily, the α1A channel with NP (α1A(+NP)), corresponding to Q-type channel, with 28 polyglutamines exhibited a positive shift of 5 mV. These results suggest that altered function of α1A(−NP) may contribute to degeneration of Purkinje cells, which express predominantly α1A(−NP), due to the reduced Ca2+ influx resulting from the negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation. On the other hand, other types of neurons, expressing both α1A(−NP) and α1A(+NP), may survive because the positive shift of voltage-dependent inactivation of α1A(+NP) compensates Ca2+ influx.

Although their clinical and pathological features are widely diverse, a common mechanism is presumed to underlie the pathogenesis in which some cytological abnormalities such as nuclear inclusion are claimed to induce cytotoxicity. On the other hand, several unique characteristics have been demonstrated in SCA6 compared with other polyglutamine diseases. The CAG repeat expansion is smaller (4–20 in normal alleles and 21–33 in mutated alleles), the repeat is more stable, and the anticipation is much milder than other polyglutamine diseases (3.Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Bonnen P. Ashizawa T. Stockton D.W. Amos C. Dobyns W.B. Subramony S.H. Zoghbi H.Y. Lee C.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 4.Ishikawa K. Tanaka H.

Furthermore, other mutations in CACNA1Aare known to be associated with both human and mouse diseases such as familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA-2) (16.Ophoff R.A.

These diseases often have a progressive ataxia like SCA6. Considering these together with the fact that theCACNA1A encodes an α1A subunit of the P/Q (P and/or Q)-type calcium channel which plays a crucial role in the brain function, especially for the Purkinje cells (18.Llinás R. Sugimori M. Hillman D.E. Cherksey B. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 19.Mintz I.M. Sabatini B.L. Regher W.G.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6403-6418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that, unlike the other polyglutamine diseases, functional alterations of the α1A calcium channel are causally related to pathophysiology of SCA6. An alteration of the P/Q (P and/or Q)-type calcium channel property by the polyglutamine stretches in the rabbit α1A channel expressed in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells was reported for the channels with 30 or 40 polyglutamines but not with 24 polyglutamines (21.Matsuyama Z. Wakamori M. Mori Y. Kawakami H. Nakamura S. Imoto K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is still obscure whether the observed change reflects functional abnormalities in SCA6 brains, since the authors did not observe the alteration for the channel with 24 polyglutamines, which falls exactly within the range in SCA6 patients. These observations and our hypothesis prompted us to explore the conditions that ensure matching the functional alteration to the disease without such discrepancy. Furthermore, the presence or absence of an NP insertion in the domain IV S3-S4 in the α1A channels is recently postulated as the essential determinant of the P/Q channel subtype distinction (22.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In SCA6, degeneration occurs dominantly in Purkinje cells, which possess mostly the P-type channel, whereas other neurons such as granule cells, which express Q-type together with P-type, are basically preserved. Therefore, we designed experimental conditions in which the human full-length α1A channels are expressed in human cells to allow anin situ operation of mutated channel functions, and we compare their properties between channels with or without the NP insertion in order to relate the channel subtypes to the altered mechanism. Here, we report that a moderate elongation caused a negative shift of voltage dependence of inactivation in the presumed P-type channel, whereas the same elongation caused a positive shift in the presumed Q-type channel. These may explain a plausible mechanism of the selective Purkinje cell degeneration. Total RNAs were obtained separately from frozen cerebellar tissues of control and a SCA6 cases. RT-PCR of CACNA1AmRNA was performed as described previously (23.Ishikawa K. Fujigasaki H. Saegusa H. Ohwada K. Fujita T. Iwamoto H. Komatsuzaki Y. Toru S. Toriyama H. Watanabe M. Ohkoshi N. Shoji S. Kanazawa I. Tanabe T. Mizusawa H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of a coding region of CACNA1A cDNA from a control and a patient with SCA6 were analyzed by directly sequencing the PCR products using ABI 310 Prism Sequencing Analysis (PE Applied Biosystems). Single Purkinje cells from mouse cerebella were obtained under microscopic observation using a glass micropipette and were directly subjected to reverse transcription in a tube containing random hexamer (Perkin Elmer, Pomona, CA) and First Strand Buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was obtained from mouse cerebella. Young male C57BL/6N (Clea Japan Inc., Japan) mice (20 days old) were used. Primers for amplifying the region spanning the AATCCG insertion site were 5′-GGAATGTGTGCTGAAAGCCATGG-3′ for a sense primer and 5′-(6-FAM)-TGGTGTAACCCTGACGGAGAAGT-3′ for an antisense primer. Quantification was performed using ABI 310 Prism Gene Scan (PE Applied Biosystems) as described (23.Ishikawa K. Fujigasaki H. Saegusa H. Ohwada K. Fujita T. Iwamoto H. Komatsuzaki Y. Toru S. Toriyama H. Watanabe M. Ohkoshi N. Shoji S. Kanazawa I. Tanabe T. Mizusawa H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). CACNA1AcDNAs, containing 13, 24, or 28 CAG repeats with AATCCG insertion, which corresponds to the amino acid NP (asparagine and proline) in the domain IV, were subcloned in the SphI and XbaI sites of pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as described previously (23.Ishikawa K. Fujigasaki H. Saegusa H. Ohwada K. Fujita T. Iwamoto H. Komatsuzaki Y. Toru S. Toriyama H. Watanabe M. Ohkoshi N. Shoji S. Kanazawa I. Tanabe T. Mizusawa H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To construct full-length CACNA1A cDNAs containing 13, 24, or 28 CAG repeats and lacking the AATCCG insertion, we first amplified the region spanning the EcoRV site (nucleotides 4968–4973) and theHindIII site (nucleotides 5305–5310) from human cerebellar mRNA. Subcloning this PCR product into pCRII (Invitrogen) yielded clones with and without the AATCCG insertion. After choosing a proper clone by nucleotide sequencing, the EcoRV andHindIII fragment with the AATCCG insertion of HS13(+NP), HL24(+NP), or HL28(+NP) was substituted with the corresponding fragment without this insertion to yield HS13(−NP), HL24(−NP), or HL28(−NP). In these rabbit-human chimeric α1A cDNA, the 2-kb 3′ region of the rabbit α1A cDNA (BI-1) (24.Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hoffman F. Flockerzi V. FuruIchi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) was substituted with human α1A 3′-terminal region (1.7 kb) flanking the CAG repeat. The 3′ region of the human cDNA was amplified from control human cerebellar cDNA and subcloned into pCRII. The two primers were 5′-TGGTCACACCTCACAAGTCCACGGA-3′ for a sense primer, which corresponded to nucleotides 5863–5887 in theCACNA1A cDNA, and 5′-GCTCTAGATTAGCACCAATCATCGTCAC-3′ for an antisense primer, which corresponded to nucleotides 7576–7595 in the CACNA1A cDNA. The antisense primer contained anXbaI site. Amplification with the primer pair yielded an approximately 1.7-kb fragment that contained a BglII site in nucleotides 5902–5907. The BglII and XbaI fragment of the 3′ region of CACNA1A cDNA was finally subcloned into the BglII and XbaI sites of BI11E vector (rabbit BI-1 in pcDNA I/Amp) to yield BI 11E-S13. To generate the construct BI 11E-L24, the KpnI fragment flanking the CAG repeats was replaced with the fragment amplified from genomic DNA obtained from an SCA6 patient harboring 24 repeats. PKCRα2 and PKCR β1a that encode α2/δ and β1a subunits, respectively, were described previously (25.Zong S. Zhou J. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). pCAGS65A encoding a mutated form of green fluorescence protein (GFP), in which serine 65 has been changed to an alanine and a 20-amino acid transmembrane region from GAP-43 has been inserted to the N-terminal region, was a gift from Dr. C. Akazawa. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1573) and were grown at 34 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The culture medium contained 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Every 2–3 days, the cells were briefly trypsinized and replated. Native HEK293 cells lack endogenous Ca2+ channel activities. One day prior to transfection, cells were replated onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips in a 35-mm culture dish. The calcium phosphate precipitation method (Mammalian Transfection Kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to transfect the seeded cells with expression plasmids (1.5 μg of plasmid DNA per dish) encoding the α1A subunit, in a combination with or without α2/δ and β1a subunits. The transfection mixture also included pCAGS65A or pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) encoding GFP to discriminate successfully transfected cells. Twenty four to 72 h after transfection, cells were used for the electrophysiological analysis. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate micropipettes (Narishige, GD-1.5) and were filled with a solution containing (in mm) 140 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 ATP-Mg. pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. Aliquots of pipette solution were stored at −80 °C and kept on ice after thawing. Pipettes were coated with paraffin to reduce capacitance and then fire-polished. Pipette resistance ranged from 1.5 to 3 MΩ when filled with the pipette solution. The external solution contained (in mm) 15 CaCl2, 145 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose. pH was adjusted to 7.4 with tetraethylammonium-OH. Calcium currents were recorded at room temperature (23–27 °C) using a whole-cell mode of the patch clamp recording (26.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15144) Google Scholar) with an amplifier (EPC-9, HEKA, Germany). The holding potential was −80 mV unless otherwise stated. The series resistance was electronically compensated by 30–80%. All illustrated and analyzed currents have been corrected for remaining capacitance and leakage currents using the −P/4 method. Data were filtered at 3 kHz (4-pole Bessel filter) and sampled at 10 kHz. Software (Pulse+PulseFit 8.09, HEKA) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Student'st test. Two splice variants, with or without insertion of an asparagine-proline (NP) stretch in the domain IV, are known in rat α1A channel (22.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and the pharmacological studies suggested that native P-type channels lack NP and that Q-type channels contain these residues (22.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). To investigate the difference in the levels of mRNAs spanning the AATCCG insertion site, we conducted RT-PCR analysis of mouse cerebella and Purkinje cells. In a whole mouse cerebellum, the amount of RT-PCR product of α1A channel without NP (α1A(−NP)) was not more than twice as large as that of α1A channel with NP (α1A(+NP)) (Fig.1 A). On the other hand, mRNA for α1A(−NP) was predominant in single mouse Purkinje cells (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that, like the rat α1A channel, α1A(−NP) generally corresponds to the P-type, whereas α1A(+NP) to the Q-type channels, respectively. To investigate the effect of polyglutamine expansion on the function of α1A voltage-dependent calcium channel, we first made an electrophysiological analysis using rabbit-human chimeric α1A, BI11E-S13 and BI11E-L24. These chimeric constructs carry cDNAs for rabbit α1A subunit, which has the C-terminal tail, replaced with the tail region of human α1A containing 13 or 24 polyglutamines. Since Purkinje cells were suggested to express predominantly α1A channel without NP as mentioned above, we used rabbit α1A which lacked the NP insertion. BI11E-S13 and BI11E-L24 were expressed with α2/δ and β1a subunits in HEK293 cells, and their electrophysiological properties were studied using a whole-cell patch clamp technique with the same protocol as described below. No statistically significant differences were detected between BI11E-S13 and BI11E-L24 in the current density, activation and inactivation kinetics, and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation (data not shown). Because we did not observe any noticeable functional alteration for rabbit-human chimeric α1A channels as described above, we speculated that residual regions of the human α1A channel might be needed for alteration of the channel function by polyglutamine expansion. In order to examine this possibility, we directly sequenced the amplified fragments of the full-length CACNA1A cDNA from a control and a SCA6 cerebella. The sequence of human α1A channel was, indeed, different from BI in several regions. Therefore, we constructed full-length CACNA1A with various CAG repeats using the control clone. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA in an SCA6 cerebellum was essentially the same as that in a control cerebellum, although there were several polymorphic alterations between them. The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank nucleotide sequence data bases with the accession numbers AB035727 (control) and AB035726 (patient). We compared the properties of Ca2+ current in HEK293 cells transiently expressing human α1A(−NP) of various numbers of polyglutamine (HS13(−NP), HL24(−NP), and HL28(−NP)), which was suggested to be dominantly expressed in Purkinje cells. Whole-cell Ca2+ currents recorded from a HEK293 cell expressing α1A(−NP) coexpressed with α2/δ and β1a subunits are shown in Fig. 2 A. Calcium currents were elicited by 400-ms depolarizing test pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV to test potentials (−30 to +50 mV) in 15 mmCa2+ solution. Inward currents of all the three channels were first activated at the threshold potentials of approximately −20 mV and gradually developed to a peak amplitude at approximately 20 mV. To compare the activation and inactivation kinetics of these currents, the time courses of activation and inactivation were quantified. The activating phase of the currents was fitted to a single exponential function, and the obtained time constants for activation at 20 mV are shown in Table I. There is no significant difference in time constants among these channels. Then, the decaying phase of the currents was fitted to a double exponential function, and the time constants and their fractions of the components at 20 mV are also shown in Table I. In HL28(−NP), the fraction of the fast inactivating component increased significantly, and oppositely the fraction of the slow inactivating component decreased compared with those of HS13(−NP). However, no difference was observed between HL24(−NP) and HS13(−NP). As for the current density of these channels, there was no noticeable difference among the three types (data not shown).Table IActivation and inactivation kinetics of α1A channels in HEK293 cells at 20 mVChannelHS13(−NP)HL24(−NP)HL28(−NP)HS13(+NP)HL28(+NP)n91281111Activation τact(ms)1.35 ± 0.061.40 ± 0.101.31 ± 0.141.44 ± 0.111.64 ± 0.15Inactivation τfast (ms)30.5 ± 3.133.2 ± 3.330.5 ± 3.033.9 ± 3.937.4 ± 3.5 τslow (ms)116.7 ± 6.1116.6 ± 7.1134.9 ± 16.5116.0 ± 9.5126.8 ± 10.1 Ifast0.41 ± 0.060.42 ± 0.050.59 ± 0.04ap < 0.05, significantly different from HS13(−NP).0.47 ± 0.050.44 ± 0.06 Islow0.50 ± 0.050.50 ± 0.050.34 ± 0.03ap < 0.05, significantly different from HS13(−NP).0.46 ± 0.050.47 ± 0.05 NI0.09 ± 0.030.07 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.010.09 ± 0.02Values are means ± S.E. n, number of cells recorded; τact, time constants for activation; τfast and τslow, fast and slow time constant for inactivation;I fast and I slow, the fast and slow inactivation component of the total current; NI, the noniactivating component of the total current.

Activation kinetics were derived by fitting a single exponential function: ICa = I∞[1 − exp(−t/τact)], where ICa is the total current, and I∞ is the steady-state current, to the activating segment of test currents. Inactivation kinetics were obtained by fitting a two exponential function: ICa = −Ifast · exp(−t/τfast) − Islow · exp(−t/τslow)−NI. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. The voltage dependence of activation for the expressed Ca2+channels was then compared (Fig.3 A and TableII). Conductance was calculated from the peak current (see legend to Fig. 3). The normalized values of conductance were then fitted to a single Boltzmann function. The half-maximal voltage of activation (V 12) and the slope factor (k) revealed no difference among α1A(−NP) of various numbers of polyglutamine stretch.Table IIParameters of voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of α1A channels in HEK293 cellsChannelHS13(−NP)HL24(−NP)HL28(−NP)HS13(+NP)HL28(+NP)Activation n111381414 V 12 (mV)10.5 ± 0.511.1 ± 0.69.2 ± 0.810.8 ± 0.912.0 ± 0.5 k (mV)5.19 ± 0.184.86 ± 0.265.25 ± 0.194.53 ± 0.20ap < 0.05.3.89 ± 0.23bp < 0.0005.Inactivation n 7136 910 V 12 (mV)−37.0 ± 1.4−43.0 ± 1.2cp < 0.005; significantly different from HS13(−NP).−47.8 ± 1.6bp < 0.0005.−36.4 ± 2.1−31.9 ± 1.0cp < 0.005; significantly different from HS13(−NP). k (mV)17.78 ± 0.4215.53 ± 0.35cp < 0.005; significantly different from HS13(−NP).17.81 ± 0.5618.78 ± 0.7518.38 ± 0.51Values are means ± S.E. n, number of cells recorded;V 12, half-maximal voltage of activation and inactivation; k, slope factor.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. To examine the voltage dependence of inactivation of the Ca2+ channels, a two-pulse protocol was used. A long prepulse (10 s) to different voltages (from −120 to +40 mV with an increment of 20 mV) was applied to allow inactivation to reach a steady state, then a test pulse (20 or 30 mV, the voltage which yielded a peak amplitude) followed. The values of normalized current amplitude were plotted against holding potentials (Fig. 3 B). Compared with HS13(−NP), the half-maximal voltage for the voltage-dependent inactivation of HL24(−NP) and HL28(−NP) shifted to a significantly more negative potential by 6 and 11 mV, respectively. As for the slope factor, the value was significantly smaller in HL24(−NP) than in HS13(−NP). We analyzed the properties of Ca2+ current in HEK293 cells transiently expressing human α1A(+NP) of different numbers of polyglutamine, HS13(+NP) and HL28(+NP). Whole-cell Ca2+ currents of α1A(+NP) were recorded with the same protocol as that for α1A(−NP) (Fig. 2 B). The activation and inactivation kinetics of these currents were not different from those of HS13(−NP) (Table I). The peak current densities of these channels were not significantly different either (data not shown). Voltage dependence of activation for α1A(+NP) was illustrated in Fig. 4A. The slope factors of HS13(+NP) and HL28(+NP) were significantly smaller than that of HS13(−NP) (Table II). Comparing voltage dependence of inactivation between α1A channels with and without NP, there was no difference in the half-maximal voltage of inactivation between HS13(+NP) and HS13(−NP) (Fig.4 B and Table II). However, this value for HL28(+NP) shifted to significantly more positive potential by 5 mV from that of HS13(+NP), which was in opposite direction to the shift for HL24(−NP) and HL28(−NP) from HS13(−NP). In the present study, we employed a human cell (HEK293) expression system to study the effect of polyglutamine expansion on calcium channel properties of the rabbit-human chimeric α1A channel and the full-length human α1A channel. First, rabbit-human chimeric α1A channel with 13 or 24 polyglutamines was expressed to conduct an electrophysiological study, but no significant differences in channel properties were detected. These findings are consistent with the previous report (21.Matsuyama Z. Wakamori M. Mori Y. Kawakami H. Nakamura S. Imoto K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which showed that rabbit α1A with 24 polyglutamine expressed in BHK cells had a normal channel function. Thus, we speculated that regions other than 1.7-kb 3′ tail were needed to yield a functional difference due to expansion of the CAG repeat. It is well known that two molecular forms with or without an insertion of NP in the domain IV S3-S4 region are expressed in rat α1A channel (22.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization to rat brain sections revealed a predominant expression of the variant without NP in the Purkinje cell (22.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This gives a good agreement with our data of RT-PCR showing a predominance of the α1A(−NP) in the mouse Purkinje cell. Moreover, a pharmacological study determined by ω-AgaIVA sensitivity in rat suggested that native P-type channels contain α1A subunit lacking NP (22.Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is most likely that α1A(−NP) is the main component in Purkinje cells and also in human. To study the mechanism of the dominant degeneration of Purkinje cells expressing this form of α1A channel in SCA6, we evaluated the properties of the wild-type and mutated α1A channels with or without NP expressed in HEK293 cells. In α1A(−NP), the most striking change caused by abnormal expansions of the polyglutamine was hyperpolarizing shift of the half-maximal voltage for the voltage-dependent inactivation in proportion to the increase in the length of polyglutamine. Furthermore, α1A(−NP) with 24 polyglutamines had a steep slope factor, consequently its voltage-dependent inactivation stays at a similar level to that with 13 polyglutamines at hyperpolarized holding potentials, whereas it gets closer to that with 28 polyglutamine at more depolarized holding potentials. Thus α1A(−NP) with 24 polyglutamines is characterized as an intermediate between those with 13 and 28 polyglutamines. As a result of the shift to the hyperpolarizing direction in the voltage-dependent inactivation, available Ca2+ channels near the resting membrane potential are predicted to be reduced in the cells expressing α1A(−NP) harboring extended polyglutamine. The more the polyglutamine expands, the less Ca2+ influx is induced in the cells. Our PCR analysis proved that Purkinje cells predominantly express α1A(−NP). Therefore, we would present a hypothesis that the alteration of inactivation in α1A(−NP) with an abnormal expansion of polyglutamine, inducing the reduction of Ca2+ influx, finally contributes to Purkinje cell death, although there is no molecular linkage suggested between the reduced Ca2+ influx and the degeneration at present. This would also suggest that other cell types expressing both forms of polyglutamine-stretched α1A channels, i.e. α1A(−NP) and α1A(+NP), can be rescued by compensated Ca2+ influx due to the opposite direction of channel dysfunction of α1A(+NP). In other words, Purkinje cells may be selectively damaged because of the lack of this compensation. Another alteration observed in this study was a slight increase of the fast inactivation component without a change in inactivating time constant for α1A(−NP) with 28 polyglutamines. Although this finding may also contribute to the reduction of Ca2+ influx, we cannot conclude that it is associated with the pathogenesis of SCA6 because α1A(−NP) with 24 polyglutamines did not show a similar tendency. Among the wide variety of degenerative diseases, SCA6 has valuable features. First, in SCA6, Purkinje cell degeneration is predominant. Therefore, it will be a suitable model for pure cerebellar ataxia from a clinical point of view. Second, SCA6 is one of the calcium channelopathies. In addition to SCA6, the α1A channel is linked totottering (tg) and leaner(tg la) mice. The tg la mice have a severe progressive ataxia, and this mutated channel was reported to exhibit a considerably reduced Ca2+ influx into Purkinje cells (27.Lorenzon N.M. Lutz C.M. Frankel W.N. Beam K.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4482-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Dove L.S. Abbott L.C. Griffith W.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7687-7699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Wakamori M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34857-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the reduced Ca2+ influx by these mutations may account for their ataxic phenotype. On the other hand, although shrinkage and apoptosis of Purkinje cells were revealed in tg andtg la mutant mice (30.Meier H. Macpike A.D. J. Hered. 1971; 62: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31.Herrup K. Wilczynski S.L. Neuroscience. 1982; 7: 2185-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 32.Heckroth J.A. Abbott L.C. Brain Res. 1994; 658: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the degeneration was not strictly specific to the Purkinje cell. Therefore, the selective degeneration of the Purkinje cell, which is seen in SCA6, cannot be explained by the reduced Ca2+ influx alone. Cytoplasmic aggregates were observed in more than half of the remaining Purkinje cells (23.Ishikawa K. Fujigasaki H. Saegusa H. Ohwada K. Fujita T. Iwamoto H. Komatsuzaki Y. Toru S. Toriyama H. Watanabe M. Ohkoshi N. Shoji S. Kanazawa I. Tanabe T. Mizusawa H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and may participate in the cell death, but this mechanism still remains to be confirmed. Furthermore, other mutations in the α1A channel are associated with human diseases of FHM and EA-2 (16.Ophoff R.A. Terwindt G.M. Vergouwe M.N. van Eijk R. Oefner P.J. Hoffman S.M.G. Lamerdin J.E.

Although alterations of channel function by these mutations were indicated (33.Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Hering S. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5586-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,34.Hans M. Luvisetto S. Williams M.E. Spagnolo M. Urrutia A. Tottene A. Brust P.F. Johnson E.C.

We have demonstrated in the present study a consistent direction of functional alteration of α1A channel in proportion to the increase of the polyglutamine in SCA6. Since the expansion is inversely correlated with the age of onset (4.Ishikawa K. Tanaka H. Saito M. Ohkoshi N. Fujita T. Yoshizawa K. Ikeuchi T. Watanabe M. Hayashi A. Takiyama Y. Nishizawa M.

Recently, the methodology of investigating Ca2+channel functions being considerably refined and means to modulate them being increasingly established, an insight into their dysfunction will potentially lead to the treatment of this disease in the near future. Finally, SCA6 is a member of the polyglutamine disease, which shares several common features. Understanding the pathogenesis of SCA6 as one of polyglutamine disease is very important for elucidation of the common mechanism of these neurodegenerative diseases. In this respect, we would emphasize that both the molecular biological approaches to polyglutamine and the physiological analysis of channel function are essential for clarifying the pathogenetic mechanism of this disease.

Although members of the nidogen (entactin) protein family are structural components of basement membranes, we find that nidogen is not required for basement membrane assembly in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Nidogen is localized to body wall basement membranes and is required to direct longitudinal nerves dorsoventrally and to direct axons at the midlines. By examining migration of a single axon in vivo, we show that nidogen is required for the axon to switch from circumferential to longitudinal migration. Specialized basement membranes may thus regulate nerve position."

[3H]Inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Partial human cDNA clone of PIPP (24.Mochizuki Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36790-36795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number H14886) was obtained from Genome System, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) H14886 is a 468-bp human cDNA clone whose putative amino acid sequence contains an IP5Pase-conserved catalytic motif 2-like sequence. The human testis λZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using this cDNA as a probe. All DNA probes were 32P-labeled using a random primer labeling kit (Takara Shuzo) following the manufacturer's protocol. A membrane containing mRNA (2 μg of poly(A) was contained in each lane) (human 12-lane multiple tissue Northern (MTN) blot) was pruchased from CLONTECH. The 1.9-kilobase pair human IP5Pase cDNAs including the coding region of SKIP were32P-labeled using a random primer labeling kit (Takara Shuzo) and probed with a following the manufacturer's protocol. The bacterial expression vector for human SKIP was constructed by ligating the 990-bpHindIII fragment, corresponding to amino acid residues 137–448, into His6-tagged pQE-30 bacterial expression vector (Qiagen). His-SKIP recombinant protein was expressed and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads as described by the manufacturer. Polyclonal anti-SKIP antibodies were made by immunizing rabbits with the recombinant His6-tagged human SKIP. The antibodies were affinity-purified from sera by conjugating the antibody proteins to CNBr beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-Myc polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The cDNA constructs, GST-tagged full-length SKIP (GST-SKIP), and GST-tagged partial human SHIP 1 cDNA (nucleotides 1,461–4,079; GenbankTM accession number U57650) (GST-SHIP) were constructed by subcloning BglII-BamHI site polymerase chain reaction products encoding full-length GST amplified from pGEX-2T into the BamHI site of pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then introducing either an EcoRI site full-length human SKIP fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction or a BamHI site partial human SHIP 1. GST, GST-SKIP, GST-SHIP, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit p110α proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells by infecting them with 1 ml of 1 × 109 units/ml recombinant virus and cultured in Sf-900 serum-free medium at 28 °C for 48 h. COS-7 cells and N1E-115 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Seiyaku) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml kanamycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2at 37 °C. Full-length human SKIP was subcloned into the SRα- and the Myc-tagged pCMV5 mammalian expression vector. These constructs (10 μg) were transfected into COS-7 cells (1 × 107) by the electroporation method. Cells were cultured for 24 h after transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and then cultured 24 h in a serum-deprived medium before cells were harvested or fixed. 50 μg/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 1% fetal calf serum was added after serum starvation for 24 h to analyze the effect. N1E-115 cells were differentiated into neurite-extended cells by culturing in the serum-free medium for 48 h and fixed. Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The cells were incubated with anti-SKIP polyclonal antibody or anti-Myc polyclonal antibody and visualized by a second antibody or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. The cells were observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope. Baculovirus-expressing Sf9 cells were centrifuged and lysed in a cold lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cells were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was applied to 400 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then washed five times with wash buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and three times with buffers for inositol phosphatase (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and phospholipids (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm cetyltriethylammonium bromide). Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase activity assay was carried out as described by Connolly et al. (26.Connolly T.M. Bross T.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7868-7874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using [3H]Ins(1,3,4)P3 and [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as substrates and purified baculovirus-expressed recombinant proteins as enzymes (26.Connolly T.M. Bross T.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7868-7874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol polyphosphates were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Partisphere strong anion exchange (SAX) column (Whatman) according to the method of Zhang and Buxton (27.Zhang L. Buxton I.L.O. Bird I.M. Phospholipid Signaling Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 47-63Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Collected fractions were diluted 20:1 with distilled water and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Phosphatase activity for Ins(1,3,4)P3 was measured as follows. [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was incubated with recombinant partial SHIP protein at 37 °C for 15 min; after that, recombinant SKIP protein was added and further incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The phosphatase activity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 was measured as described previously (28.Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2was sonicated with a phosphatase buffer for phospholipids (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm cetyltriethylammonium bromide) and then incubated with purified recombinant proteins at 37 °C for 20 min. Radiolabeled lipids were extracted and resolved by TLC in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/H2O (43:38:5:7, v/v/v/v) and visualized by autoradiography after treating the TLC plate with ENH3ANCE spray (NEN Life Science Products). The phosphatase activity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was measured according to the method of Woscholski et al. (29.Woscholski R. Waterfield D.M. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase purified from Sf9 cells expressing full-length human phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit p110α was used to produce [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. p110α protein was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described by Funakiet al. (30.Funaki M. Katagiri H. Kanda A. Anai M. Nawano M. Ogihara T. Inukai K. Fukushima Y. Ono H. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22019-22024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PtdIns(4,5)P2/PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 mixture was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and then dried up with nitrogen gas. Phosphatase activity assay was performed under the same conditions as those for the PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase activity assay. The lipids were extracted and separated by TLC usingn-propyl alcohol/2 m acetic acid (2:1, v/v) and visualized by autoradiography. In an attempt to identify novel inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases, we screened several cDNA libraries using human expressed sequence tag clone H14886 containing the 5-phosphatase catalytic motif 2-like sequence (see Fig. 2) as a probe (10.Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 14.McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I.

We obtained two novel cDNA clones encoding 5-phosphatase-like sequences. One is PIPP, a recently isolated 107-kDa protein (24.Mochizuki Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36790-36795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The other encodes a putative 5-phosphatase cDNA clone obtained from a human testis cDNA library and 87% identical to the mouse cDNA clone U96724. Three alternative splicing isoforms were obtained (Fig. 1 A). Clone 1 is a 2,786-bp cDNA with an open reading frame predicting a protein with a molecular mass of 51 kDa (Fig. 1 B). Clone 2 has a 230-bp insertion, corresponding to exon II, in the N terminus of Clone 1 with a putative molecular mass of 43 kDa (Fig. 1, A andC). Clone 3 has a 937-bp deletion, corresponding to exon XIII, in the C-terminal non-coding region (Fig. 1 B,shaded). In each splicing isoform, the open reading frame begins at the consensus start methionine with an upstream in-frame stop codon (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively) (31.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar).Figure 1Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of human SKIP. A, schematic representation of the genomic structures of the three different isoforms of human SKIP cDNA clones. The genome DNA sequence of human SKIP was obtained from the human genome data base (Homo sapienschromosome 17, clone hRPK.107_N_19, GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number AC006405). Clone 2 has a 230-bp insertion corresponding to exon II, and Clone 3 has a 937-bp deletion in the C-terminal non-coding region (exon XIII). Positions of the start methionine and stop codon of each clone are indicated byasterisks. B, nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of human SKIP cDNA Clone 1. The nucleotide and amino acid numberings for human SKIP are indicated on the right. The amino acid numbering indicates the position relative to the putative start methionine.

The nucleotide and amino acid numberings are indicated on the right. The in-frame stop codon isunderlined, and a 230-bp inserted sequence isshaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This IP5Pase has two conserved catalytic motifs of IP5Pases (Fig.2). To other IP5Pases, PIPP has a lot of similarity (24.Mochizuki Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36790-36795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas Type I phosphatase and Type III phosphatase SHIP have little resemblance. The full length of this IP5Pase also has greater identity with PIPP (53.3%) than do other IP5Pases (about 45%, see Fig. 2). However, no other motifs for interactions with other molecules are observed. The results of Northern blot analysis of the expression of the human novel IP5Pase are shown in Fig.3. Two different transcripts of 2.0 kilobases and about 3.0 kilobases, respectively, are detected. The longer ones are the transcripts of Clone 1 and Clone 2, and the 2.0-kilobase transcript is that of Clone 3. This IP5Pase is expressed in all the tissues we tested, but its expression is especially high in heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. Thus we designated this IP5Pase SKIP. Only the 3.0-kilobase transcript was detected in the brain. To characterize the endogenously expressed SKIP protein, we generated a specific antibody against SKIP and blotted lysates from different tissues and cells (Fig.4 A). In addition to the 51-kDa form, a smaller 43-kDa band was detected. In rat brain lysate and mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells, only the 51-kDa form was expressed. In contrast, in mouse C2C12 myoblast cells, C3H/10T1/2 cells, and Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells, only the 43-kDa band was detected. Surprisingly, although SKIP cDNA was obtained from the human testis library, its expression was very weak in rat testis lysate. To confirm that the 43-kDa band is really an alternatively spliced isoform, we subcloned the full length of Clone 1 and 2 into SRα expression vector, and then they were expressed in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 B, in addition to the 51-kDa form, endogenously expressed in COS-7 cells, the 43-kDa band was detected only in cells expressing Clone 2. This indicates that the 43-kDa band is indeed an alternative splicing isoform of SKIP. GST-conjugated SKIP (GST-SKIP) protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus system and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. To characterize the substrate specificity, we examined the phosphatase activities for inositol polyphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (Fig. 5 and Fig.6). SKIP hydrolyzed Ins(1,4,5)P3 as well as Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to produce inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B) (27.Zhang L. Buxton I.L.O. Bird I.M. Phospholipid Signaling Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 47-63Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To further determine whether this phosphatase hydrolyzes D-4 or D-5 positions of inositol phosphates, we analyzed the activities for Ins(1,3,4)P3. Ins(1,3,4)P3 was generated by incubating Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 with recombinant SHIP, a Type III 5-phosphatase, which hydrolyzes the D-5 position of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to generate Ins(1,3,4)P3. Ins(1,3,4)P3 was further incubated with recombinant SKIP protein, but generation of inositol bisphosphate was not detected (Fig. 5 C). This indicates that SKIP hydrolyzes the D-5 position of inositol polyphosphates.Figure 6Phospholipid phosphatase activity of recombinant SKIP. A, [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 was incubated with GST alone and GST-SKIP. The products were analyzed by TLC. The positions of phospholipids are indicated on the right. B, [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was incubated with GST alone and GST-SKIP. The products were analyzed by TLC. Generation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 was caused by GST-SKIP but not by GST. The positions of phospholipids are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The catalytic motifs of SKIP are very similar to those of Type II phosphatases, including PIPP and synaptojanin (see Fig. 2), which can hydrolyze lipid substrates such as PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as well as inositol polyphosphates (24.Mochizuki Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Next, we determined whether SKIP can hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. GST-SKIP, but not GST alone, markedly hydrolyzed not only PtdIns(4,5)P2 but also PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to generate PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 6 A) and PtdIns(3,4)P2(Fig. 6 B), indicating that SKIP hydrolyzes the D-5 position of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Thus, SKIP is classified as a Type II 5-phosphatase (34.Zhang X. Hartz P.A. Philip E. Racusen L.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1574-1582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To analyze the substrate specificity of SKIP, we determined the apparent K m values of the 5-phosphatase by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis, using purified recombinant protein (Fig.7). K m values of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase are 180 μm and 1.15 mm, respectively. ThisK m value for PtdIns(4,5)P2 is comparable with that of other Type II 5-phosphatases, such as the 75-kDa Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (K m = 250 μm) (28.Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SKIP hydrolyzes PtdIns(4,5)P2 with a 6-fold higher affinity than for Ins(1,4,5)P3, indicating that SKIP functions as a 5-phosphatase that has high specificity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and probably also for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Next, Myc epitope-tagged SKIP was expressed in COS-7 cells and immunostained with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 8, SKIP was localized at the cytoplasm and concentrated at the periphery of the nucleus. Actin filaments are also observed using rhodamine-phalloidin. COS-7 cells develop actin stress fibers throughout, but in SKIP-expressing cells, stress fibers disappeared from places where SKIP concentrated. This result suggests that SKIP has a negative effect on the formation of actin stress fibers, as synaptojanin 1 does (8.Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, when COS-7 cells expressing the 51-kDa form of SKIP were stimulated with epidermal growth factor and fetal calf serum, no change in the localization of SKIP or actin stress fiber formation was observed (data not shown), indicating that SKIP does not function downstream of the mitogenic signals, whereas synaptojanin 1 associates with the epidermal growth factor receptor through Ash/Grb2 and acts downstream of it (8.Sakisaka T. Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Then, to determine the endogenous expression of SKIP, rat neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells (expressing only the 51-kDa form) were immunostained with a specific antibody against SKIP (Fig.9). In undifferentiated N1E-115 cells, staining was seen throughout except in the actin bundles at the cell periphery. In neurite extended cells, SKIP was expressed also in the neurites. Some strong spots were seen in the neurites, where actin staining was reduced (Fig. 9, C and D,arrowheads). In conclusion, we have cloned a novel protein, SKIP, encoding inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. SKIP has two isoforms of 51 and 43 kDa, which hydrolyze the D-5 position of Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 but have a 6-fold higher specificity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 than for Ins(1,4,5)P3. Actin filaments are reduced wherever SKIP is localized, suggesting that SKIP helps to negatively regulate the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. The relationship between PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase activity and actin reorganization or regulation of its phosphatase activity remains to be elucidated."

Formation of 3-chlorotyrosine (Cl-Tyr) has been used as a marker for assessing the involvement of HOCl in such processes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the formation of Cl-Tyr from reaction of HOCl with tyrosine (both free and peptide-bound) and the fate of Cl-Tyr under such conditions. Tyrosine, N-acetyltyrosine, bovine serum albumin, and human low density lipoproteins were incubated with a range of reagent hypochlorite concentrations for varying periods in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 22 °C. The reaction products, and several biological samples, were hydrolyzed (in the case of proteins), isolated, and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized or quantitated by mass spectrometry and NMR. A significant amount of 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (diCl-Tyr) was obtained from the bovine serum albumin, low density lipoprotein, and some biological samples, in addition to Cl-Tyr, indicating that Cl-Tyr competes effectively for HOCl even when tyrosine is present in great excess. Cl-Tyr and diCl-Tyr were also formed from free tyrosine but then reacted further with HOCl. This finding differs from a claim in the literature that Cl-Tyr was not formed in such a system. The further reaction products of Cl-Tyr and diCl-Tyr with HOCl were elucidated as their corresponding mono- and dichlorinated 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehydes.

For example HOCl-modified proteins, including apolipoprotein B-100 from low density lipoproteins (LDLs), have been detected in human atheroma and in LDL isolated from atherosclerotic tissue, by use of a monoclonal antibody (37.Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar).It is known that HOCl reacts rapidly with cysteine and methionine to give oxyacids and cystine (from cysteine) and sulfoxides (from methionine) (17.Prutz W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25.Pereira W.E. Hoyano Y. Summons R.E. Bacon V.A. Duffield A.M. Biochim. Biophys.

However, these products are not specific for the action of HOCl as other oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and peroxyl radicals induce identical materials (39.Amiconi G. Ascoli F. Concetti A.

HOCl also reacts readily with the free amino group of amino acids and peptides either at the N-terminal position (21.Zglicznski J.M. Stelmaszynska T. Domanski J. Ostrowski W. Biochim. Biophys.

Davies M.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1998; 2: 1937-1945Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Decomposition of such chloramines and chloramides leads to deamination, decarboxylation, or aldehyde formation depending on the nature of the chloramine involved (7.Hazen S.L. d'Avignon A.

EPR studies showed that this process occurs concurrently with the formation of nitrogen-centered radicals, which are believed responsible for secondary radical damage reactions (26.Hawkins C.L.

Tyrosine in peptides or proteins is readily chlorinated by HOCl or the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system to give Cl-Tyr, and this product has been widely utilized as a marker for HOCl-mediated damage to proteins both in vitro and in vivo (27.Hazen S.L.

Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1997; 23: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that free tyrosine does not give rise to Cl-Tyr under neutral or basic pH (51.Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), instead giving rise predominantly to 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (HPAA) (46.Hazen S.L. Gaut J.P. Hsu F.F.

It was proposed that formation of a chloramine is the general first step for reaction of HOCl with both free and peptide-bound tyrosine (7.Hazen S.L. d'Avignon A. Anderson M.A. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4997-5005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 24.Anderson M.M. Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). With free tyrosine, the chloramine formed at the α-amino group decomposes to give HPAA (46.Hazen S.L. Gaut J.P. Hsu F.F.

In the latter case, the chloramine on a free amine group (either on a N terminus or on a lysine side chain) or chloramide group on a peptide bond adjacent to a tyrosyl residue in a peptide or a protein undergoes an intramolecular reaction with the tyrosyl residue to convert it into Cl-Tyr (47.Domigan N.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16542-16548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).In this study, we aimed to investigate both the formation of Cl-Tyr from reaction of HOCl with tyrosine (both free and peptide-bound) at pH 7.4 and the fate of Cl-Tyr under such conditions. We have found that Cl-Tyr is not only formed from tyrosine (both free and peptide-bound) but also reacts further with excess HOCl to give rise to other oxidation products such as 3,5-dichlorotyrosine (diCl-Tyr) and aldehydes such as chlorinated HPAA. Accordingly, we have detected diCl-Tyr on proteins obtained from in vivo inflammatory sites characterized by neutrophil infiltration.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe water used was filtered through a four-stage Milli Q system (Millipore-Waters, Lane Cove, New South Wales, Australia) equipped with a 0.2-μm pore size final filter. Tyrosine,N-acetyltyrosine (Ac-Tyr), Cl-Tyr standard, and bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid-free) were from Sigma. Isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 50 mm at pH 7.4) was prepared in nanopure water and treated overnight with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove contaminating metal ions (52.Van Reyk D.M. Brown A.J. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Free Radical Res. 1995; 23: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All other chemicals, solvents, and chromatographic materials were of analytical or HPLC grade.Preparation of HOCl ReagentHOCl solutions (10 mm) were prepared daily by dilution of a concentrated stock solution (approximately 1 m in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide, BDH, Poole, Dorset, UK) into 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The concentration of HOCl was determined by measuring its absorbance at 290 nm at pH 9.5, based on a molar absorptivity of 350 dm3 mol−1 cm−1 for the−OCl species.Preparation of LDL from Human PlasmaHuman LDL (density 1.021–1.063) was prepared by density gradient ultracentrifugation of plasma from normal fasting donors (53.Chung B.H. Segrest J.P. Ray M.J. Brunzell J.D. Hokanson J.E. Krauss R.M. Beaudrie K. Cone J.T. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 181-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Protein content of LDL was determined using bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma), with BSA as standard, by measurement of the absorbance at 562 nm after incubation for 1 h at 60 °C.Preparation of Biological Samples for Analysis of Chlorinated TyrosinesSamples of normal human iliac vessels and advanced carotid atherosclerotic plaques (54.Fu S. Davies M. Stocker R. Dean R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), of normal and stage IV cataractous human lenses (55.Fu S. Dean R. Southan M. Truscott R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28603-28609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and of peritoneal abscesses from the mouse, were extracted to provide materials ready for protein hydrolysis. 4WT/BL and BALB/c mice were injected with 2 × 107 colony-forming units/ml Escherichia coli, 5 × 109 colony-forming units/ml Bacteroides fragilis, and 10 mg/ml bran (100 μl per animal, intraperitoneal), as described in detail previously (56.Kocher M., PA, K. Farram E. Abdul Majid K. Finlay-Jones J. Geczy C. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1342-1350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Abscesses were removed 7 days later and frozen in liquid nitrogen for brief storage at −70 °C. These samples were kindly provided to us by Dr. John Finlay-Jones, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia.The abscesses frozen in liquid nitrogen were powdered in an Eppendorf tube by using a Teflon hand homogenizer. Proteins were extracted by adding 1 ml of PBS into each sample and vortexing. The supernatant resulting from centrifugation was taken and treated with sodium deoxycholate (final concentration 0.03%, w/v) and trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%, w/v). After further centrifugation, the protein pellets were resuspended and washed once with 5% trichloroacetic acid and twice with cold acetone. The delipidated protein samples were subsequently freeze-dried before protein hydrolysis. For LDL samples, proteins were purified by trichloroacetic acid/deoxycholate precipitation following acetone and diethyl ether washing before hydrolysis as described previously (57.Dean R.T. Fu S. Gieseg S. Armstrong S.G. Punchard N. Kelly F.J. Free Radicals: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 171-183Google Scholar).Protein HydrolysisProtein samples were hydrolyzed by employing a gas phase hydrolysis procedure involving the use of 6m HCl solution containing 5% mercaptoacetic acid (v/v) and 1% phenol. Under such conditions, artifactual formation of Cl-Tyr from tyrosine was not observed. This was confirmed by subjecting both free tyrosine and BSA to this treatment; no detectable chlorotyrosine was observed in the hydrolysates under such conditions by HPLC analysis using both diode array and electrochemical (with a detection limit of 1 pmol) detectors (see below). This is in contrast to the conventional liquid phase hydrolysis by which Cl-Tyr has been reported to form as a result of the hydrolysis procedure (27.Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar).HPLC AnalysisHPLC analysis was performed on a Shimadzu LC-10A HPLC system. The HPLC column was kept in a column oven at 30 °C. For detection of Cl-Tyr and diCl-Tyr, samples were chromatographed on a Zorbax reverse-phase HPLC column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5-μm particle size, Rockland Technologies) packed with octadecylsilanized silica (ODS), equipped with a Pelliguard guard column (2 cm, Supelco). The mobile phase was a gradient of solvent A (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) with 100 mm sodium perchlorate) and solvent B (80% methanol in water) eluting at 1 ml/min. The gradient change over a run was programmed as follows: isocratic elution with 100% solvent A for 10 min; then to 3% solvent B for 2 min; further elution at 3% solvent B for 6 min; then to 15% solvent B for 7 min before isocratic elution at 20% solvent B for 10 min and at 80% solvent B for another 5 min; then re-equilibration with 100% solvent A for 15 min. The eluent was monitored in series by both a diode array detector (SPD-M10Avp, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and an electrochemical detector (Coulochem II, ESA, Chelmsford, MA). The diode array detector was set at 280 nm to monitor the eluent with spectrum scanning from 200 to 350 nm. Elution positions were defined on the basis of standards, and identities were confirmed by ultraviolet absorption. The analytical cell of the electrochemical detector has two electrodes in series: the first electrode was set to an oxidation potential of 420 mV (at which no oxidation of chlorotyrosines occur), and the second was set to 650 mV for detection of chlorotyrosines.For isolation of the products from the reaction of Ac-Tyr with HOCl, a semi-preparative ODS column (LC-18, 25 × 1 cm, 5-μm particle size, Supelco) was used. Separation of the products was achieved by isocratic elution of 32% methanol (v/v) and 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in water at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Sample collection was automated by the use of a FRC-10A fraction collector (Shimadzu). Collection windows were determined based on the UV absorbance of the eluent at 280 nm.DiCl-Tyr present in biological samples was determined on a Shimadzu LC-10Avp HPLC system equipped with a CoulArray electrochemical detector (model 5600, ESA, Chelmsford, MA) with 12 cells (channels) in series using platinum electrodes. The chromatographic conditions were the same as described above for the detection of Cl-Tyr, except for the gradient elution profile that was modified as follows: isocratic elution with 6% solvent B for 16 min; then to 8% solvent B for 4 min; further elution at 8% solvent B for 10 min; then to 80% solvent B for 5 min before re-equilibration with 6% solvent B for 15 min. The potential settings for the CoulArray detector are 150, 310, 380, 450, 500, 530, 550, 560, 620, 700, 810, and 840 mV, for channels 1–12 respectively. The signals for diCl-Tyr appeared in channels 6–8, with channel 7 as the dominant channel (where a maximum signal response was observed), channel 6 the leading channel and channel 8 the following one. Peak identity for diCl-Tyr in biological samples was confirmed by comparison of its hydrodynamic voltammogram and the two “ratio accuracy” parameters (the leading channel response to the dominant channel response, and the following channel response to the dominant channel response) to those of the standard (58.Hensley K. Maidt M. Pye Q. Stewart C. Wack M. Tabatabaie T. Floyd R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To add to further identification, standard diCl-Tyr was also spiked into the biological samples and analyzed subsequently for the proportional increment of the added substance. The detection limit of diCl-Tyr by this method was determined to be 4 μmol/mol Tyr for standard and 40 μmol/mol Tyr for the abscess materials due to influence of background materials in the biological samples.MS and NMRElectrospray (ES) MS was conducted on a VG Platform mass spectrometer (Fisons, New South Wales, Australia). The samples (around 100 pmol/ml) were dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile. The solvent was delivered by a Phoenix (Fison) syringe pump at a flow rate of 20 μl/min; 10 μl of each solution was injected for analysis. A dry nitrogen bath gas at atmospheric pressure was employed to assist evaporation of the electrospray droplets. A negative electrospray mode was used with capillary potential at 2.35 kV, chicane counter electrode potential at 0.5 kV, and cone potential at 45 V.Proton NMR studies were performed on a Varian Gemini 300 BB spectrometer at 22 °C. Samples were dissolved in 0.01 m2HCl in 2H2O. The chemical shifts recorded were referenced to the non- or partially deuterated water signal that was set to δ 4.76 ppm.

Cl-Tyr: δ ppm 2.99 dd (7.7 Hz, 14.8 Hz, 1H, β-CH2), 3.11 dd (5.5 Hz, 14.8 Hz, 1H, β-CH2), 4.03 dd (5.5 Hz, 7.7 Hz, 1H, α-CH), 6.90 d (8.4 Hz, 1H, H-5), 7.00 dd (2.1 Hz, 8.4 Hz, 1H, 6-H), 7.22 d (2.1 Hz, 1H, 2-H). diCl-Tyr: 2.97 dd (7.7 Hz, 14.7 Hz, 1H, β-CH2), 3.09 dd (5.5 Hz, 14.7 Hz, 1H, β-CH2), 3.94 dd (5.5 Hz, 7.7 Hz, 1H, α-CH), 7.19 s (2H, 2-H, 6-H).DISCUSSIONIt has been shown previously that Cl-Tyr is formed from tyrosyl residues in peptides and proteins on exposure to HOCl (47.Domigan N.M. Charlton T.S. Duncan M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16542-16548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 49.Kettle A.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here show that the formed Cl-Tyr undergoes further structural modifications in such systems. Thus when Ac-Tyr is treated with HOCl, both Ac-Cl-Tyr and Ac-diCl-Tyr are formed. Kinetic studies reveal that the mono-chlorinated tyrosine species reacts further with HOCl to give rise to the dichlorinated species. This conclusion is supported by studies on the reaction of HOCl with BSA and apolipoprotein B-100 in LDL. Thus when BSA (30 μm) was reacted with HOCl at varying concentrations, formation of both Cl-Tyr and diCl-Tyr was observed (see Fig. 5), although the yield of these two materials does not account for all the tyrosine lost nor HOCl added. For example, at 750 μm HOCl, 37 μm Cl-Tyr and 6.8 μm diCl-Tyr were formed on BSA, whereas 58 μm tyrosine was lost. The mono- and dichlorotyrosines therefore account for approximately 76% of the tyrosine lost and approximately 7% of the total HOCl added to the BSA solution.Previous studies on human LDL exposed to HOCl suggested that apolipoprotein B-100 is the major site for HOCl damage (10.Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 11.Hazell L.J. van den Berg J.J.M. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), with lysine residues scavenging some 70% of the HOCl added, and tryptophan and cysteine together accounting for an additional 10% of the oxidant. In this study, we found that the mono- and dichlorotyrosine accounted for 72% of the tyrosine lost and approximately 6% of the total HOCl added to the LDL sample. These results are very similar to those with BSA and in agreement with literature reports (10.Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 11.Hazell L.J. van den Berg J.J.M. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). They have also confirmed that lipid components in LDL do not compete effectively for HOCl and therefore do not alter the reaction kinetics of HOCl with proteins. Our results with BSA and LDL indicate that approximately 10% of the oxidant is consumed in reactions with tyrosyl residues.Free tyrosine, on the other hand, gives rise to a more complex mixture of oxidation products at physiological conditions on exposure to HOCl. Among the isolated and purified products are Cl-Tyr, diCl-Tyr, HPAA, Cl-HPAA, and diCl-HPAA (Figs. 3 and 4 a). On the basis of the experimental results obtained in this study, we propose that HPAA and Cl-Tyr are the initial products, which both react further with HOCl and lead to formation of the other products identified in the reaction mixture (Scheme FS2). For example, Cl-Tyr gave rise to both diCl-Tyr and Cl-HPAA on reaction with HOCl. The formation of diCl-Tyr from Cl-Tyr is analogous to the formation of Ac-diCl-Tyr from Ac-Cl-Tyr and diCl-Tyr from Cl-Tyr in proteins, whereas the formation of Cl-HPAA from Cl-Tyr is analogous to that of HPAA from tyrosine. When purified HPAA was reacted with HOCl, both Cl-HPAA and diCl-HPAA were formed (Fig. 4 c). Collectively, these data indicate that both HPAA and Cl-Tyr can form Cl-HPAA on reaction with HOCl. By analogy, we propose that both diCl-Tyr and Cl-HPAA are potential precursors for the formation of diCl-HPAA. These results are in agreement with a recent report that not only 3-bromotyrosine (a mono-brominated tyrosine) but also 3,5-dibromotyrosine (a di-brominated tyrosine) are formed from reaction of tyrosine with brominating agents such as eosinophil peroxid"
https://openalex.org/W2007571477,"Plakoglobin is a cytoplasmic protein and a homologue of β-catenin and Armadillo of Drosophila with similar adhesive and signaling functions. These proteins interact with cadherins to mediate cell-cell adhesion and associate with transcription factors to induce changes in the expression of genes involved in cell fate determination and proliferation. Unlike the relatively well characterized role of β-catenin in cell proliferation via activation of c-MYC and cyclin D1 gene expression, the signaling function of plakoglobin in regulation of cell growth is undefined. Here, we show that high levels of plakoglobin expression in plakoglobin-deficient human SCC9 cells leads to uncontrolled growth and foci formation. Concurrent with the change in growth characteristics we observe a pronounced inhibition of apoptosis. This correlates with an induction of expression of BCL-2, a prototypic member of apoptosis-regulating proteins. TheBCL-2 expression coincides with decreased proteolytic processing and activation of caspase-3, an executor of programmed cell death. Our data suggest that the growth regulatory function of plakoglobin is independent of its role in mediating cell-cell adhesion. These observations clearly implicate plakoglobin in pathways regulating cell growth and provide initial evidence of its role as a pivotal molecular link between pathways regulating cell adherence and cell death.

Structurally, plakoglobin and β-catenin proteins consist of a central core of 12–13 arm repeats flanked by the N- and C-terminal domains. Arm repeats are protein interaction domains functioning as binding/docking sites for protein partners that in many cases have been shown to interact in an overlapping and mutually exclusive manner (3.Huber A.

The central core repeats of plakoglobin and β-catenin function as binding sites for various cellular proteins including cadherins, the transcription factors of LEF/TCF1family, and the tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) (1.Gelderloos J.A.

Levine A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain regulates the stability of plakoglobin and β-catenin proteins, whereas the C-terminal domain has an apparent transactivation ability (1.Gelderloos J.A. Witcher L. Cowin P.

Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'Ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Plakoglobin and β-catenin interactions with cadherins are necessary for the maintenance of intercellular adhesion and proper functioning of epithelia (8.Aberle H. Schwartz H. Kemler R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 514-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). β-Catenin regulates the interactions between the classical cadherins and the cytoskeleton at adherens junctions, whereas plakoglobin interacts with both classical and desmosomal cadherins. Its interaction with the desmosomal cadherins is essential for desmosome assembly, whereas plakoglobin-classical cadherin complexes appear to have a regulatory function (1.Gelderloos J.A. Witcher L.

In addition, β-catenin and plakoglobin function as the terminal components of the Wnt signaling pathway regulating cell fate determination and differentiation during development (4.Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high levels of cytosolic β-catenin can participate in signaling pathways regulating cell proliferation (11.Potter E. Bergwitz C. Brabant G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 207-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanism of β-catenin function in regulation of cell proliferation is well characterized in carcinoma cells and occurs via its interactions with LEF/TCF transcription factors. The cytosolic β-catenin interacts with LEF/TCF, and β-catenin-LEF-TCF complex is translocated into the nucleus where it activates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation (12.Morin P.J.

On the other hand, the potential role of plakoglobin in regulation of cell proliferation is not determined although this protein appears to subscribe to all functions performed by β-catenin. The maintenance of cell number in normal tissue homeostasis and in development is achieved by regulated balance between cell proliferation and programmed cell death or apoptosis. The key regulators of the apoptotic process, the BCL-2 protein family, includes both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic members (for recent reviews see Refs. 18.Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar and 19.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4811) Google Scholar). The expression of the BCL-2 family is regulated, primarily, by cytokines although some members are induced as part of the p53-mediated damage response (Ref. 20.Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar and references therein). Pro-survival proteins such as BCL-2 have been suggested to inhibit apoptosis by blocking the function of caspases, cysteine proteases implicated in the execution of programmed cell death in organisms from nematodes to humans (reviewed in Ref. 21.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that shows that high levels of plakoglobin can induce unregulated growth concurrent with induction of expression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and the inhibition of caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. In addition, this growth regulatory function of plakoglobin appears to be independent of its role in mediating cell-cell adhesion. The human squamous carcinoma cells SCC9 have been derived from a tongue carcinoma (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) and do not express plakoglobin (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SCC9 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When appropriate, staurosporine was added to the media at 500 nm, and cultures were incubated for various lengths of time from 1 to 5 h. Cells were then processed for either immunofluorescence or Western blotting using the TUNEL reagent or anti-caspase antibodies, respectively. The mammalian expression plasmid pREP9-Pg expressing low levels of plakoglobin has been described (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing high levels of plakoglobin was constructed by cloning the full-length plakoglobin cDNA (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) into the mammalian expression plasmid pBK-CMV at the NheI site, adjacent to the CMV promoter. The construct was designated pBK-CMV-Pg. Transfections were performed with 25 μg of either pBK-CMV or pBK-CMV-Pg and LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty eight hours post-transfection, medium was replaced with minimum essential medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. G418-resistant colonies were selected and screened for plakoglobin expression using immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays. Positive colonies expressing plakoglobin were subcloned by limiting dilution to obtain single-cell isolated colonies. For growth measurement, SCC9 and low and high plakoglobin-expressing SCC9 cells were each plated at 2 × 105 cells in replicate 35-mm culture dishes. At 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 18 days after plating, cultures were trypsinized and cells counted. Aggregation assays were performed as described (23.Li Z. Gallin W.J. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1005-1019PubMed Google Scholar) and entailed triplicate confluent 60-mm culture dishes of SCC9 and low and high plakoglobin-expressing SCC9 cells as stocks for single cell suspensions. Following trypsinization (0.04% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mmCa2+)of each culture, replicates of 2 × 106 single cells were resuspended into 2-ml aliquots. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with constant shaking at 90 rpm for a total of 2 h. At 30-min intervals 200-μl aliquots were withdrawn, and the number of single cells were counted using a hemocytometer. The percentage of aggregation represents the percent decrease in the number of single cells at each time point. Total cell extracts were prepared by direct solubilization of control or staurosporine-treated cultures in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and processed for immunoblotting with anti-plakoglobin (24.Pasdar M. Li Z. Chlumecky V. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 32: 258-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), anti-α- and β-catenin (Sigma), anti-BCL-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-caspase-3 (kindly provided by D. Nicholson, Merck Frosst, Quebec, Canada) antibodies and developed using ECL. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA from vector-transfected and low and high plakoglobin-expressing SCC9 cells as well as BCL-2-transfected Jurkat cells was electrophoresed and probed with a 32P-labeled humanBCL-2 cDNA probe. Equal amounts of total protein (250 μg) or RNA (25 μg) were loaded in each lane. Cells were extracted in the 100-mm culture dish with 1.5 ml of cytoskeleton extraction (CSK) buffer (300 mm sucrose, 10 mmPIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml DNase, and 0.1 mg/ml RNase (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). This extraction buffer allows the separation of the cytoskeleton-associated (insoluble) pool of cadherins and catenins from the cytoplasmic (soluble) pool of these proteins. Cells were removed from the dishes with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 10 min. The soluble fraction was removed from the insoluble pellet. The pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and boiled for 10 min. Prior to immunoprecipitation, the SDS concentration was reduced to 0.1% by the addition of CSK buffer. The soluble and insoluble fractions were precleared for 30 min by incubation with 10 μl of preimmune sera and 35 μl of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) as described (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After a 7-min centrifugation at 14,000 × g, precleared extracts were divided into equal aliquots of 250 μg of total protein and processed for immunoprecipitation with 3–5 μl of either plakoglobin or a mixture of antibodies against N-cadherin (Sigma) and desmosomal cadherins (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and 35 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) beads as described (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To ensure complete depletion, each aliquot was immunoprecipitated three consecutive times. For plakoglobin staining, cells were fixed with formaldehyde and extracted with cytoskeleton extraction buffer as described previously (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For nuclear labeling, cells were grown on coverslips and remained untreated or were incubated in 500 nm staurosporine from 1 to 5 h. Coverslips were air-dried, fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, permeabilized for 2 min on ice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate, and blocked for 30 min with 20% fetal bovine serum and 3% bovine serum albumin. Nuclei were then labeled with either TUNEL reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol or Hoechst 33342 (1 μg ml−1; Sigma) for 15 min. The mammalian expression plasmids pREP-9-Pg and pBK-CMV-Pg (see “Experimental Procedures”) were used, respectively, to express wild type human plakoglobin at low and high levels in the plakoglobin-deficient SCC9 cells. The parental SCC9 cell line and the low plakoglobin-expressing transfectants have been characterized previously (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Li Z. Gallin W.J. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1005-1019PubMed Google Scholar). Total cell extracts from 4 independent clones of the low plakoglobin-expressing (Fig.1 A, top) and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants (Fig. 1 A, bottom) were analyzed for plakoglobin expression by immunoblotting. Quantitation of the immunoblots showed that there was, at least, 20-fold more plakoglobin protein in the high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants (data not shown). SCC9 cells have the typical fibroblastoid morphology (Fig. 1 B, a) and growth properties of transformed cells. Expression of plakoglobin at low levels induced epidermoid morphology (Fig. 1 B, b; also see Ref. 22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, when plakoglobin was expressed at higher levels, SCC9 cells began to grow on top of each other and formed numerous foci (Fig. 1 B, c andd). This observation was also confirmed by the growth properties of the different transfectants and untransfected/vector-transfected SCC9 cells. Growth analysis of parental SCC9 cells showed that at single cell density, these cells grew slowly until they became subconfluent (∼5 days) and then the rate of growth increased and remained high for up to 14 days. After 2 weeks in culture, SCC9 cells began to die (Fig. 1 C, solid circles, also see Ref. 22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, the low plakoglobin-expressing transfectants exhibited contact inhibition of growth and began to die upon reaching confluency (within 5–7 days; Fig. 1 C, open circles, also see Ref. 22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). SCC9 cells expressing high levels of plakoglobin continued to grow long after attaining confluency and formed numerous foci (Fig. 1 C, open diamonds). We monitored the relative amount and subcellular distribution of plakoglobin in low and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants (Fig. 1 D). In the low expressers, plakoglobin is primarily localized to the areas of cell-cell contact in a punctate distribution typical of the desmosomal junctions (Fig. 1 D, b). In the high-expressing transfectants, however, plakoglobin is distributed homogeneously throughout the cell without any distinct peripheral localization (Fig. 1 D, c), a pattern also observed in the foci throughout the culture (Fig. 1 D, d). Programmed cell death regulates growth and morphogenesis in epithelial cells and is, in turn, regulated by both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion (25.Lu Q.L. Abel P. Foster C.S. Lalani E.N. Hum. Pathol. 1996; 27: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 26.Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 27.Aoshiba K. Rennard S.I. Spurzem J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L28-L37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Merio G.R. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the uncontrolled growth in the high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants was mediated by the inhibition of apoptosis, we examined the occurrence of staurosporine-induced apoptosis in different transfectants (Fig.2). Duplicate cultures of low- and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants remained untreated (controls) or were incubated in 500 nm staurosporine for 5 h. Cultures were then processed for detection of apoptotic nuclei by immunofluorescence staining using terminal transferase-catalyzed dUTP end labeling (TUNEL, Fig. 2, a–d) or stained with Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 2, e–h). As shown in Fig. 2, fragmented, apoptotic nuclei were undetectable in controls and the high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants (Fig. 2, a–c ande–h). In contrast, both TUNEL and nuclei staining revealed the presence of numerous apoptotic nuclei in the low plakoglobin-expressing cells (Fig. 2, d andh). The anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 has been shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by a variety of cytotoxic insults including staurosporine treatment (for a review see Ref. 20.Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of apoptosis in the high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants was mediated by BCL-2, total cell extracts from both the low and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants were processed for immunoblotting with an anti-BCL-2 antibody. Fig.3 A shows immunoblots of total cell extracts from typical low (top) and high (bottom) plakoglobin-expressing transfectants. We did not detect any BCL-2 protein in the low plakoglobin-expressers, whereas the high plakoglobin-expressing cells showed easily detectable levels of this protein. This observation was confirmed by Northern blot analysis in which total RNA isolated from untransfected/vector-transfected and plakoglobin-expressing SCC9 cells were hybridized with a full-lengthBCL-2 cDNA probe (Fig. 3 B). An mRNA of the appropriate size for BCL-2 expression (6 kb; Ref. 29.Cleary M.L. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1986; 47: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) was detected in the high plakoglobin-expressing cells (Fig.3 B, lane 4) and was absent in the vector-transfected as well as in the low plakoglobin-expressing cultures (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3). The size of the hybridized band is identical to the mRNA detected in the positive control, Jurkat cells transfected with a full-lengthBCL-2 cDNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). These results in conjunction with the results of the TUNEL assays indicate that high levels of plakoglobin expression are simultaneous with the expression of BCL-2 and the inhibition of apoptosis. Caspases are cysteine proteases that have been implicated in the execution of programmed cell death (21.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized and maintained in an inactive proenzyme form and are proteolytically activated upon the appropriate signals (21.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that pro-survival proteins such as BCL-2 may function by inhibiting the activation of the caspase cascade (30.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to examine the proteolytic processing of caspase-3 in control and staurosporine-treated low and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants (Fig.4). For these studies, replicate cultures of the low and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants remained untreated or were treated with 500 nm staurosporine for 1–5 h. Upon the termination of staurosporine incubation, cells were processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with caspase-3 antibodies (Fig. 4). In uninduced cultures of high or low plakoglobin-expressing transfectants, caspase-3 was primarily detected as a 32-kDa band. Staurosporine stimulation of the low plakoglobin-expressing cells, which have undetectable levels of BCL-2, led to the appearance of the 20-, 19-, and 17-kDa forms of the active caspase, the intensity of which increased with longer incubation times (Fig. 4, left). In contrast, in BCL-2 positive, high plakoglobin-expressing cells, caspase-3 remained primarily unprocessed (Fig. 4, right). Together, these results suggest that inhibition of apoptosis in the high plakoglobin-expressers is mediated by BCL-2 and inhibition of the caspase cascade. Disruption of cadherin-mediated adhesion has been suggested to contribute to the unregulated growth during tumorigenesis (31.Behrens J. Invasion Metastasis. 1995; 14: 61-70Google Scholar). To this end we examined the adhesive properties of the high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants. Fig.5 A shows the aggregation ability of the plakoglobin-deficient SCC9 cells (Fig. 5 A, solid circles) and low (Fig. 5 A, open circles) and high (Fig.5 A, open diamonds) plakoglobin-expressing transfectants. Aggregation assays measured the decrease in the number of single cells as described under “Experimental Procedures” and led to the following observations. In SCC9 cells, we detected ∼35% decrease in the number of single cells within the first 30 min followed by a small increase in the number of aggregates within the next 90 min so that by the end of the assay time, ∼45% of SCC9 cells were present in aggregates (Fig. 5 A, solid circles, also see Ref. 22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In low plakoglobin-expressing transfectants, at 30 min, there were approximately twice as many aggregates as that detected in SCC9 cultures (68 versus 35%). Within the next 60 min, there was a further increase (to 77%) that remained unchanged for the rest of the assay period (Fig. 5 A, open circles, also see Ref. 22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants we observed ∼55% decrease in the number of single cells within the first 30 min followed by a rapid increase in the number of aggregates within the next 30 min (∼70%) and a further slight increase (∼73%) by the end of 120-min assay time (Fig. 5 A, open diamonds). Therefore, the cell proliferative ability of the excess plakoglobin appears to be independent of its contribution to the increased adhesive properties of the SCC9 cells. Further support for this observation was obtained by characterizing the soluble (cytoplasmic), insoluble (membrane-associated), and the cadherin-independent pools of plakoglobin in the low and high plakoglobin-expressing cell lines (Fig.5 B). For the experiments performed in Fig. 5 B, cultures were grown to confluency and extracted with CSK buffer to separate the soluble from the insoluble fractions. Following cell fractionation, aliquots of 250 μg of total protein from each fraction of each cell line were processed for immunoprecipitation with plakoglobin or cadherin antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of the soluble and insoluble plakoglobin in each cell line was determined by separation of the plakoglobin-containing immune complexes on SDS 6% polyacrylamide gels followed by immunoblotting with the anti-plakoglobin antibodies (Fig. 5 B, top). The amount of the cadherin-independent plakoglobin in each fraction for each cell line was detected by Western blotting of the cadherin-depleted supernatants from the cadherin immunoprecipitates using plakoglobin antibodies (Fig. 5 B, bottom). As shown in Fig. 5 B, top, in the low plakoglobin-expressing cells, all of the cellular plakoglobin was detected in the insoluble pool. In contrast, in the high plakoglobin-expressing cells, plakoglobin was not only detected in both pools, its level was significantly higher in the soluble fraction. Examination of the cadherin-depleted soluble and insoluble extracts from both lines detected plakoglobin in the cadherin-depleted soluble extract from the high plakoglobin-expressing cells exclusively (Fig. 5 B, bottom). Together, these observations suggest that it is the untethered and cadherin-independent plakoglobin that likely mediates the effects observed in the high plakoglobin-expressing cells. Characterizing the cadherin-catenin complexes in SCC9 cells and the low plakoglobin-expressing transfectants, we previously showed that plakoglobin expression led to a reduction in the endogenous β-catenin levels (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 is an immunoblot of an equal amount of total cell lysates from SCC9 cells and the low and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants. It shows that the amount of decrease in β-catenin levels corresponds to the levels of the exogenously expressed plakoglobin. Quantitation of the immunoblot showed a reduction of ∼40 and 80% in the β-catenin levels in the low and high plakoglobin- expressing cells, respectively (data not shown). Plakoglobin is a multifunctional cytoplasmic protein that interacts with a number of cellular partners involved in pathways regulating cell adhesion and cell proliferation. Binding to the cadherins directs plakoglobin into the adhesion pathway, whereas binding to the tumor suppressor protein APC marks the protein for degradation. Similar to β-catenin, the N-terminal domain of plakoglobin includes consensus serine and threonine phosphorylation sites for glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Phosphorylation of these residues is necessary for degradation of the soluble cadherin-independent plakoglobin or β-catenin (1.Gelderloos J.A. Witcher L. Cowin P. Klymkowsky M.W. Cowin P. Klymkowsky M.W. Cytoskeletal-Membrane Interactions and Signal Transduction. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 13-29Google Scholar). Degradation requires interaction with APC and phosphorylation of both proteins by glycogen synthase kinase-3β. This is facilitated by axin which interacts with all three proteins simultaneously (32.Kodama S. Ikeda S. Asahara T. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27682-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr.

A. 1998; 95: 3020-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated APC/plakoglobin (or β-catenin) is then rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (35.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar, 36.Salomon D. Sacco P.A. Roy S.G. Simcha I. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). If not sequestered by cadherins and APC, the excess plakoglobin or β-catenin will be available to interact with other binding partners. The excess TCF/LEF-associated β-catenin activates genes involved in cell proliferation (15.He T-C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar, 16.Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 17.Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J.

Interestingly, it was recently shown that this complex can also activate the expression of genes regulating neuronal apoptosis during retinal development in Drosophila embryos with mutations in D-APC (37.Ahmad Y. Hayashi S. Levine A. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1171-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Similarly, humans with germ lineAPC mutations, and presumably high levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin, exhibit increased frequency of apoptotic cells in colonic polyps (38.Strater J. Koretz K. Gunthert A.R. Möller P. Gut. 1995; 37: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast to the relatively well characterized role of β-catenin in regulation of cell growth, the growth regulatory function of plakoglobin has not been investigated. To gain further insights into the signaling function of plakoglobin, we overexpressed plakoglobin in plakoglobin-deficient SCC9 cells (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Li Z. Gallin W.J. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1005-1019PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies had shown that at low levels plakoglobin expression was able to induce contact inhibition of growth and a fibroblast to epidermoid transition associated with the formation of desmosomes and increased adhesivity (22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The present study shows that when expressed at high levels, however, plakoglobin induced unregulated growth and foci formation. Examination of the adhesive properties of the low and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants showed similar increases in their aggregation abilities relative to the parental SCC9 cells. Complexes of plakoglobin-N-cadherin and desmosomal cadherins were detected in all transfectants; however, a large cadherin-independent pool of plakoglobin was only detected in the high plakoglobin transfectants (Fig. 5 B). Since the high plakoglobin-expressing cells demonstrate enhanced growth, this suggests that the signaling role of plakoglobin in regulation of cell proliferation is mediated via the cadherin-independent pool of plakoglobin and is independent of its adhesive function. It is noteworthy that plakoglobin expression in SCC9 cells led to a corresponding reduction in the levels of the endogenous β-catenin (Fig. 6; also see Refs. 22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and 37.Ahmad Y. Hayashi S. Levine A. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1171-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Complexes of β-catenin-N-cadherin were detected in both the low and high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants despite the reduced levels of β-catenin in these transfectants (Ref. 22.Parker H.R. Li Z. Sheinin H. Lauzon G.J. Pasdar M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and data not shown). The drastic reduction of β-catenin levels in the high plakoglobin-expressing transfectants indicates the presence of a functional APC pathway in SCC9 cells. The maintenance of cell number is determined by the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. The results of the TUNEL assays in staurosporine-stimulated low and high plakoglobin cultures suggested that the growth-regulating function of the overexpressed plakoglobin was mediated, at least in part, via its inhibitory effect on programmed cell death. The inhibition of apoptosis was concurrent with the induction of the pro-survival BCL-2 gene expression. There was no detectable level of BCL-2 in the low plakoglobin-expressing transfectants or plakoglobin-deficient SCC9 cells that underwent staurosporine-induced apoptosis. One mechanism of the anti-apoptotic function of BCL-2 has been shown to operate via its inhibitory effect on activation of the caspase cascade. Caspases are activated by adaptor proteins such as the mammalian Apaf-1 (21.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 30.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2743) Google Scholar). It is suggested that BCL-2 may function by directly binding the adaptor proteins thus inhibiting the activation of the caspase cascade and subsequent execution of the death program. In agreement with this, we only observed a significant decrease in the proteolytic processing of caspase-3 in high plakoglobin-expressing cells which also expressed BCL-2. Interestingly, both plakoglobin and β-catenin can be proteolytically cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, although β-catenin appears to be the in vivo substrate of choice in this process (39.Herren B. Levkau B. Raines E.W. Ross R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1589-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 40.Brancolini C. Sgorbissa A. Schneider C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate a role of plakoglobin in regulation of cell growth. The growth regulatory signal induced by plakoglobin, at least in SCC9 cells, appears to function in conjunction with if not via the up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and inhibition of apoptosis. This is in contrast to β-catenin that up-regulates the expression of genes involved in proliferation. Therefore, although both plakoglobin and β-catenin can affect cell number, they may do so by regulating different pathways. Whether plakoglobin directly up-regulates BCL-2 gene expression or indirectly, via modulating the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins (41.Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5865) Google Scholar), remains to be determined. It is also possible that plakoglobin may exert its growth-regulating effects via down-regulating β-catenin and thus its proposed pro-apoptotic activity. We are currently investigating these alternatives. In either case, plakoglobin appears to be an important component of the molecular mechanisms of adhesion-mediated signaling that control the expression of genes involved in regulating cell growth and malignant transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2051450207,"Fibroblast growth factor-binding protein (FGF-BP) is a secreted protein that binds and activates fibroblast growth factors (FGF-1 and FGF-2) and induces angiogenesis in some human cancers. FGF-BP is expressed at high levels in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines and tumor samples and has been shown to be rate-limiting for the growth of SCC tumors in vivo. In this study, we examine the regulation of FGF-BP by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the signal transduction mechanisms that mediate this effect. We found that EGF treatment of the ME-180 SCC cell line caused a rapid induction of FGF-BP gene expression. This induction was mediated transcriptionally through the AP-1 (c-Fos/JunD) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein elements as well as through an E-box repressor site in the proximal regulatory region of the FGF-BP promoter. Pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) completely blocked EGF induction of FGF-BP mRNA, whereas inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase had no effect. Additionally, both EGF- and anisomycin-induced FGF-BP mRNA was abrogated by inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, demonstrating a role for p38 in the regulation of FGF-BP. Co-transfection of the FGF-BP promoter with dominant negative forms of MEK2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, and p38 significantly decreased the level of EGF induction, whereas expression of a dominant negative c-Jun N-terminal kinase mutant or expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitory protein had no effect. Similarly, activation of the p38 pathway by overexpression of wild-type p38 or MKK6 enhanced FGF-BP transcription. These results demonstrate that EGF induction of FGF-BP occurs selectively through dual activation of the stress-activated p38 and the MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which ultimately leads to activation of the promoter through AP-1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein sites.

Some of the most potent angiogenic stimulators are the fibroblast growth factors, including the classical angiogenic activators of this family, FGF-11 and FGF-2 (1.Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High concentrations of biologically active FGF-1 and FGF-2 are found in extracts of normal human tissues that are not necessarily undergoing active new blood vessel growth (1.Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is due to the storage of FGF-1 and FGF-2 in the extracellular matrix, where they are found tightly bound to membrane-attached heparan sulfate proteoglycans (2.Vlodavsky I. Bashkin P. Ishai-Michaeli R. Chajek-Shaul T. Bar-Shavit R. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Klagsbrun M. Fuks Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 638: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which quenches their biological activity. One mechanism by which FGF-1 and FGF-2 are released from the extracellular matrix is through the secretion of the carrier protein FGF-BP that binds to FGF-1 and FGF-2 in a noncovalent and reversible manner (3.Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-BP is actively secreted from cells and, once bound, prevents degradation of FGF-1 and FGF-2 (3.Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4.Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of FGF-BP secretion in promoting tumor growth was shown in studies using the nontumorigenic adrenal carcinoma cell line SW-13, which has high expression of FGF-2 but is negative for FGF-BP. Stable overexpression of FGF-BP in SW-13 cells led to a dramatic increase in FGF-2-dependent colony formation and formation of highly vascularized tumors in nude mice (4.Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies were carried out to characterize the biological role of FGF-BP in highly tumorigenic cell lines such as ME-180 (human cervical squamous cell carcinoma) and LS174T (colon adenocarcinoma), which express high levels of endogenous FGF-BP (4.Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21303-21308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Reduction of FGF-BP mRNA levels in these cell lines using ribozyme targeting significantly inhibited tumor development and angiogenesis (6.Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G. Wellstein A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that FGF-BP serves as a rate-limiting angiogenic modulator for some tumor types (6.Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G. Wellstein A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7.Rak J. Kerbel R.S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1083-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). FGF-BP is highly expressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines from lung, bladder, skin, and cervix and is positive in primary SCC tumor samples (4.Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, its expression has been shown to be up-regulated during mouse embryonic development of the skin, lung, and intestine and is low in most adult tissues (8.Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A potential role for FGF-BP during skin carcinogenesis was described in studies showing dramatic FGF-BP up-regulation in human 2A. Aigner and A. Wellstein, manuscript in preparation. 2A. Aigner and A. Wellstein, manuscript in preparation. and mouse skin treated topically with DMBA and TPA (8.Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These observations suggested several mechanisms that might be involved in the direct regulation of the FGF-BP gene. First, DMBA treatment has been shown to cause a specific point mutation in the ras oncogene (9.Balmain A. Ramsden M. Bowden G.T. Smith J. Nature. 1984; 307: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Ras signal transduction pathway might regulate FGF-BP expression. This is also indicated by the observation that FGF-BP is induced inras-transformed keratinocytes (8.Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, the role of TPA as a direct regulator of FGF-BP gene expression was confirmed upon TPA treatment of several SCC cell lines, including ME-180, which caused rapid transcriptional induction of the FGF-BP gene (10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We further identified that Sp1, AP-1, and C/EBP sites within the proximal FGF-BP promoter are all required for TPA regulation of FGF-BP (10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SCC cell lines and tumors, including the ME-180 cell line, typically express high levels of EGF receptors (EGFRs) (11.Yuspa S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1178-1189PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Donato N.J. Yan D.-H. Hung M.-C. Rosenblum M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 411-419PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of EGFR in SCC has been shown to confer greater tumorigenicity (13.Santon J.B. Cronin M.T. MacLeod C.L. Mendelsohn J. Masui H. Gill G.N. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 4701-4705PubMed Google Scholar), which led us to investigate the possible role and mechanisms of EGF regulation of FGF-BP. EGF signaling occurs predominantly through binding to its receptor EGFR (HER1) and its dimerization partner ErbB2 (HER2/Neu). Autophosphorylation of activated EGF receptors stimulates a number of signal transduction pathways, including the classical Ras/Raf/MAP kinase kinase (MEK)/MAP kinase (ERK) pathway, which is known to phosphorylate and activate AP-1 (14.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). MEK/ERK activation occurs either through phosphorylated EGFR recruitment of the Shc-Grb2-SOS complex and subsequent Ras activation or through recruitment of phospholipase Cγ and subsequent PKC activation. PKC can in turn modulate Raf through both Ras-dependent and -independent mechanisms (15.Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 16.Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osada S. Suzuki A. Mizuna K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Other signaling pathways induced by EGF include the stress-activated protein kinases such as JNK and p38 (17.Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar), the PI 3-kinase pathway (18.Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway (19.Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Here we show a possible link between EGF signaling and angiogenic activation through the regulation of the FGF-BP gene in SCC. We found that EGF treatment induces rapid up-regulation of FGF-BP transcription occurring through the AP-1 and C/EBP sites in the FGF-BP promoter. Furthermore, inhibition of either the MEK/ERK pathway or the p38 pathway abrogates induction by EGF, implicating dual activation of these MAP kinases as an important step in FGF-BP regulation. The ME-180 cervical squamous cell carcinoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA).

All effects of dominant negatives were compared with their empty vector control or with the empty vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). 24 h before transfection, ME-180 cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 750,000 cells/well. pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase reporter vector (Promega) was included as a control for transfection efficiency. For each transfection, 1.0 μg of FGF-BP promoter-luciferase construct, 0.1 ng of pRL-CMV (transfection efficiency control), and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) were combined and added to cells for 3 h in serum-free conditions as described previously (10.Harris V.K.

For co-transfections, 1.0 μg of −118/+62Luc FGF-BP promoter construct, 500 ng of expression vector, 0.1 ng of pRL-CMV, and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE were added to cells. Transfected cells were treated for 18 h with EGF (5 ng/ml) in serum-free IMEM before cell lysis in 150 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). 20 μl of extract was assayed for both firefly andRenilla luciferase activity using the Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay system (Promega). Due to a small background induction (1.5–2 fold) of the pRL-CMV plasmid by EGF, all luciferase values were normalized for protein content. There were no significant differences, however, in the transfection efficiencies between plasmid constructs in untreated controls as determined byRenilla luciferase assay. Protein content of cell extracts was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). ME-180 cells were grown to 80% confluency on 150-mm dishes, serum-starved in IMEM for 16 h, and treated with or without 5 ng/ml EGF for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol.

Binding reaction with −55/−30 probe was carried out with 5 μg of ME-180 nuclear extracts and 500 ng of poly(dI-dC). Supershift antibodies (2 μg) were added to the binding reaction for 10 min on ice before adding 20 fmol of labeled probe. Reactions were carried out 45 min on ice and analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Supershift antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) were the following: Fos-specific antibodies c-Fos (K-25), c-Fos (4.Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

For oligonucleotide competition, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded competitor was added to the binding reaction and incubated for 10 min on ice before the addition of the labeled probe. Sequence of the C/EBP consensus fragment was 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ME-180 cells were grown in 150-mm dishes and pretreated as described above for Northern analysis. Cells were treated with EGF (5 ng/ml) for 5 min. Cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells into immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 μm okadaic acid, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and incubating for 15 min at 4 °C in a rotating rack. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein content was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 3 μg of sheep anti-Akt1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Immunocomplexes were captured with protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol. The Akt kinase assay was carried out as described previously (26.Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19588-19593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), using the K9 peptide as a substrate. We have shown previously that phorbol ester (TPA) treatment of the human cervical SCC cell line ME-180 results in a time- and dose-dependent increase of FGF-BP mRNA, which is mediated via the PKC signal transduction pathway (10.Harris V.K.

Similarly, treatment of ME-180 cells with EGF resulted in a rapid increase in the steady-state levels of FGF-BP mRNA with no effect on GAPDH mRNA levels (Fig. 1). FGF-BP mRNA induction was detectable after 1 h of treatment and was maximal after 6 h with an average increase of 4.5-fold. The rapid and transient nature of EGF induction of FGF-BP mRNA is identical to that seen after TPA treatment (10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that these agents might induce FGF-BP through a similar transcriptional mechanism. To determine whether FGF-BP is up-regulated by EGF at the transcriptional level, we tested the effect of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D on the EGF induction of FGF-BP mRNA. Pretreatment with actinomycin D completely blocked the induction of FGF-BP by EGF (see Fig. 4). Combined treatment with EGF and cycloheximide had no effect on induction of FGF-BP mRNA (data not shown), indicating that de novo protein synthesis is not required for the EGF response. Furthermore, transient transfection of the full-length FGF-BP promoter from −1060 to +62 into ME-180 cells resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in luciferase activity upon EGF treatment (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that EGF, like TPA, can directly increase the rate of FGF-BP gene transcription.Figure 2Effect of FGF-BP promoter mutations on the transcriptional induction by EGF. The histogram on theleft shows the impact of each promoter deletion on the basal (uninduced) luciferase activity of each construct. The basal activity of the −118/+62 construct was set at 100%. The right histogram shows the transcriptional activity in the presence of EGF and is expressed as -fold induction of EGF-treated over untreated for each construct. ME-180 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated FGF-BP promoter luciferase constructs and were either untreated or treated with 5 ng/ml of EGF for 18 h. Promoter constructs are described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Ref. 10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol.

Values represent the mean and S.E. from at least three separate experiments, each done in triplicate wells. Statistically significant differences relative to the −118/+62 promoter construct are indicated (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Functional analysis of the FGF-BP promoter has shown that TPA-induced transcription involves a combination of both positive and negative regulatory elements located within the first 118 base pairs of the proximal promoter (10.Harris V.K.

Full TPA induction was mediated by a C/EBP consensus site between −48 and −40, as well as through a juxtaposed Sp1/AP-1 element between −76 and −59. The Sp1(b) site between −76 and −68 was described previously as an Ets element based on its homology to other Ets consensus binding sites (10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, we have now determined through supershift analysis that this site is bound by the Sp1 transcription factor (Fig.3 D). To investigate whether these same regulatory elements play a role in EGF induction of the FGF-BP promoter, we transiently transfected a series of mutated promoter constructs into ME-180 cells and tested their ability to be induced after treatment with EGF. Deletion of promoter sequences from −1060 to −118 had no effect on the level of promoter activity and resulted in a similar 5-fold EGF induction (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the EGF regulatory region of the promoter is located within the first 118 base pairs of the promoter. Although the upstream Sp1 site (Sp1(a)) drives a significant portion of basal promoter activity (10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), deletion of this site had no effect on EGF induction (data not shown). Deletion of the Sp1(b) site within the context of the −118/+62 promoter fragment also had no effect on EGF induction (Fig. 2). Basal activity of the promoter, however, did drop significantly in the absence of the Sp1(b) element (Fig. 2 and Ref. 10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of the AP-1 site resulted in a significant 40% decrease in EGF induction as compared with the wild-type −118/+62 promoter. Similarly, complete deletion of the juxtaposed Sp1(b)/AP-1 site resulted in a 46% decrease in EGF response. Mutation of the AP-1 site had no effect on basal promoter activity, demonstrating that changes in EGF responsiveness can occur independently of changes in the basal rate of transcription. These results show that unlike TPA induction, which requires the entire Sp1(b)/AP-1 element, EGF induction is driven mainly through the AP-1 site in the promoter, reflecting possible differences in the mechanisms by which each of these agents regulate the transcription of FGF-BP. To test the contribution of the C/EBP element to EGF induction, we introduced an internal deletion of this site within the context of the −118/+62 promoter. Removal of the C/EBP site significantly reduced the EGF effect by 46% but had no influence on basal promoter activity (Fig. 2). Together, these data demonstrate the requirement for an intact C/EBP site and AP-1 site in the EGF induction of the FGF-BP promoter. In addition to these positive regulatory elements, we recently showed that TPA regulation of the FGF-BP promoter involves a negative regulatory element, lying just downstream of the AP-1 site, which shows similarity to an E-box factor binding site (10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19130-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether this E-box repressor site also played a role in the regulation by EGF. Point mutation of this site at position −58, or deletion of this site from −57 to −47 resulted in a dramatic increase in EGF induction of the promoter from about 5-fold in the wild-type promoter to about 8–10-fold in the repressor mutants (Fig. 2), indicating loss of repressor activity. Therefore, the repressor element between −58 and −47 also plays a regulatory role in EGF induction by limiting the transcriptional response to growth factor stimulation. Because the AP-1 site in the FGF-BP promoter appears to be important during TPA and growth factor regulation of FGF-BP, we determined which members of the Fos and Jun family might be binding to the FGF-BP AP-1 site. To identify transcription factor binding to the AP-1 site, we carried out gel shift analysis using labeled promoter sequence fragment from −70 to −51 (Fig. 3 A), which was incubated in the presence of nuclear extracts from control or EGF-treated ME-180 cells. Protein binding in the uppermost complex, which has previously been shown to represent AP-1 (10.Harris V.K. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Boyle B.J. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. J. Biol.

We have previously reported that prenylated Rab acceptor or PRA1 interacts with Rab GTPases and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP2). Structural prediction programs suggest that PRA1, with its two extensive hydrophobic domains, is likely to be an integral membrane protein. However, subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemical analyses indicated that PRA1 is localized both in the cytosol and tightly associated with the membrane compartment. The membrane-bound form can be partially extracted with physiological buffer and urea, suggesting that PRA1 is an extrinsic membrane protein. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain resulted in a protein that behaved as an integral membrane protein, indicating that this domain plays an essential role in maintaining PRA1 in a soluble state. PRA1 can also bind weakly to GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), a protein involved in the solubilization of membrane-bound Rab GTPases. Addition of PRA1 inhibited the extraction of membrane-bound Rab3A by GDI, suggesting that membrane localization of Rab GTPases is dependent on the opposing action of PRA1 and GDI. The binding of Rab and VAMP2 to PRA1 is mutually exclusive such that Rab3A can displace VAMP2 in a preformed VAMP2-PRA1 complex.

With over 30 known isoforms, Rab GTPases are ideal molecular switches in regulating the orderly progression of vesicles through membranous compartments of the eukaryotic exocytic and endocytic pathways (1.Lazar T.

Proteins that regulate the cycling between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms are essential for Rab function. Translocation of the Rab GTPase between membrane and cytosol is dependent on GDI, which extracts the Rab GTPase from the membrane as well as participates in the delivery of the GTPase to the correct membrane compartment (5.Takai Y.

The Rab GTPase is recruited to the membrane compartment following dissociation from GDI, and GDP-GTP exchange catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. A number of proteins are known to possess nucleotide exchange activity. These include rabex-5, which acts specifically on Rab5 (8.Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H.

Dascher C. Balch W.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1305-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By analogy to Ras, the GTP-bound form of Rab serves to recruit and activate effector proteins that eventually mediate the various aspects of vesicle trafficking from transport, docking to eventual fusion. Proteins known to interact with the activated form of Rab include rabphilin-3A (12.Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1998; 279: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which these proteins mediate vesicle trafficking remains unclear, but mutation or inactivation of these proteins has been shown to disrupt vesicle trafficking. Subsequent hydrolysis of the bound GTP is thought to terminate the Rab signaling cycle. A GTPase activating protein, of which a Rab3A-specific (16.Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y.

The resulting GDP-bound form Rab is subsequently extracted from the membrane by GDI, which maintains Rab in the cytosol to complete the cycle. Rab mutations altering GTP binding, hydrolysis, or interactions with effector molecules are known to block exocytic and endocytic vesicle transport (18.Pind S.N. Nuoffer C. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H.

In vitro reconstitution experiments in yeast indicate that the docking reaction is sensitive to the GTPase, Ypt1p, which in turn regulates Uso1p-dependent tethering of donor vesicles to target membrane (23.Cao X. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This suggests that Ypt1p mediates vesicle tethering prior to membrane fusion. However, mutation of the synaptic vesicle-specific Rab3A affects synaptic vesicle fusion (24.Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice exhibited an increase in the number of exocytic events upon calcium-triggered release without a change in the release probability. Thus, the site of action of the Rab GTPases remains unclear and raises the possibility that there are differences in the mechanism of action of the various Rab GTPases. Vesicle fusion requires an ordered series of molecular events leading to effective interaction between v- and t-SNARE complexes. Studies on yeast vacuolar fusion indicate that formation of the SNARE complexes requires prior priming by NSF and α-SNAP, followed by docking and fusion (25.Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A.

In the yeast ER-to-Golgi transport, docking requires a functional Rab GTPase and is independent of the SNARE proteins (23.Cao X. Ballew N. Barlowe C.

This dual Rab and VAMP2 binding property of PRA1 suggests that it may link the function of these two families of vesicle trafficking proteins. PRA1 is a 21-kDa protein that is conserved from yeast to human (35.Yang X. Matern H.T. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4954-4963Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36.Bucci C. Chiariello M. Lattero D. Maiorano M. Bruni C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It contains two extensive hydrophobic domains and is predicted to be a type III membrane protein. However, we report here that PRA1 is not an integral membrane protein, but is present in both the cytosol and membrane compartment. The membrane-bound form can be partially extracted with low salt buffer and urea. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acids resulted in a truncated protein that behaved as an integral membrane protein. Moreover, the wild-type PRA1 but not the truncated PRA1-(1–164) binds weakly to GDI1. We also show that it can inhibit the extraction of GDP-bound Rab from the membrane by GDI1. Finally, binding of VAMP2 to PRA1 can be displaced by Rab3A, indicating that the three proteins are unlikely to exist as a stable ternary complex. The cloning and purification of PRA1 from bacteria were as described previously (34.Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both recombinant wild-type and truncated PRA1-(1–164) contained a 6xHis followed by a HA tag at the amino terminus. The rat GDI1 was subcloned into Bluescript (Stratagene) vector containing the hemagglutinin (HA) tag by blunt-end ligation onto the EcoRV site. GDI1 was PCR-amplified using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CAT GCC ATG GAT GAG GAA TAC G-3′ and 5′-GGG AAG CTT CAC TGA TCG GCT TCT CC-3′. The HA-tagged GDI1 was then isolated as aXhoI/BamHI fragment and subcloned into theEcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Novagen) vector by blunt-end ligation. The purification of GDI1 were as described by the manufacturer for GST fusion proteins. Briefly, the cells were homogenized in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose column. The column was washed with Wash Buffer 1 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) followed by Wash Buffer 2 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT). The fusion protein was then eluted with 10 mm glutathione in Wash Buffer 2. The rat Rab3A was subcloned as a BamHI/HindIII fragment into pRSET-A (Invitrogen). The NdeI toHindIII fragment was then isolated and blunt-end ligated into the EcoRI site of pAAR6, between the constitutive yeast ADH1 promoter and terminator. The BamHI fragment was then transferred to pRS424 plasmid and transformed into yeast Y190 strain by the LiCl method (37.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). To purify the 6xHis-tagged Rab3A, the transformed yeast was grown to saturation in 200 ml of Trp drop-out medium. The cells were harvested at 3,000 × g for 5 min, transferred to 1 liter of YPD, and grown at 30 °C for 8 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 5 min, and homogenized with acid-washed glass beads (0.5 mm diameter) in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm PMSF) at 1 ml/g of cell pellet. The cell debris and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. Triton X-100 was added to the supernatant at 1% final concentration and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was loaded onto 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen) and washed with 40 volumes of wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). The 6xHis-tagged Rab3A was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in the above wash buffer. The HA-tagged wild-type and truncated PRA1-(1–164) was blunt-end ligated into theXbaI site of the Sindbis virus expression vector, pSinRep5 (Invitrogen). Production of RNA transcripts, transfection into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, and collection of pseudovirions were as described by the manufacturer. BHK cells infected with the pseudovirions were processed for immunocytochemistry or homogenization 4–6 h after infection. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (EM Sciences) in PBS for 30–60 min and washed with PBS supplemented with 100 mm glycine. The cells were incubated with Blocking Buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum, 10 mm NaN3, and 0.4% saponin in PBS) for 30–60 min. Monoclonal anti-HA (Roche) were diluted in Blocking Buffer and incubated with the cells at room temperature for 1–2 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, and fluorescein- or rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies (Chemicon) were used to detect the bound primary antibodies. The coverslips were mounted with SlowFade anti-quench solution (Molecular Probes). Images were captured with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024MP laser confocal microscope. Subcellular fractionation of pseudovirion-infected cells was modified from previously described procedure (38.Grote E. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A 70% confluent 60-mm dish of BHK cells was infected with pseudovirions at 10:1 multiplicity of infection for 4–6 h. The cells were harvested and homogenized by sonication in 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm PMSF. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 10 min. The resulting homogenate was subjected to sequential centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min followed by 150,000 ×g for 1 h. The same fractionation procedure was used for PC12 cells and rat brain. Since the Sindbis expression system often results in extremely high levels of expression, the HA-tagged PRA1 and PRA1-(1–164) were subcloned into the bicistronic pIRESpuro (CLONTECH) for comparison. The PRA1 sequences from the pQE constructs (34.Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were PCR-amplified using the oligonucleotides 5′-CCA TCG ATA TGT ACC CAT ACG ATG TTC CA-3′ and 5′-CGG AAT TCT GAG GTC ATT ACT GGA TCT ATC-3′. The resulting PCR fragments were restriction-digested and subcloned into the ClaI and EcoRI sites of pIRESpuro. Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with the bicistronic pIRESpuro constructs of wild-type PRA1 and truncated PRA1-(1–164) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, 1 × 105 Chinese hamster ovary cells were seeded on coverslips overnight. Plasmid DNA (0.5 μg) was mixed with 1 μl of LipofectAMINE in a 100-μl final volume of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The lipid-DNA mixture was added to the PBS-washed cells containing 200 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated at 37 °C for 3–5 h. The medium was replaced with α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cells were processed for immunocytochemistry after 36–48 h, as described above. Rabbit anti-calnexin (Stressgen) or anti-mannosidase II (generously provided by Dr. M. Farquhar) was used in conjunction with monoclonal anti-HA in double immunofluorescent labeling reaction. For subcellular fractionation, BHK cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and transfected with 1–1.5 μg of wild-type HA-PRA1 or truncated HA-PRA1-(1–164) using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested after 48 h and resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm EDTA). The cell suspension was lysed by sonication, and the crude extracts were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to remove the cell debris. The resulting supernatant was submitted to a 200,000 ×g spin for 30 min at 4 °C to collect the membranes. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 240 μl of Buffer A, and 40 μl was added to 760 μl of each of the following: Buffer A, 1m NaCl in Buffer A, 1 m urea in Buffer A, 0.1m Na2CO3 and 1% Triton X-100 in Buffer A. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and the pellets resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Both supernatant and pellet fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitates were solubilized in denaturing buffer and subjected to Western immunoblot analysis. Both PRA1 isoforms were detected with anti-HA antibody. PC12 cells from two 100-mm dishes were harvested with 5 ml of 5 mm EDTA in PBS. The cells were homogenized by sonication in 1 ml of TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl) with 1 mm PMSF. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was spun at 150,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the membrane pellet was resuspended by brief sonication in 0.2 ml of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). To determine cytosolic proteins that might bind to recombinant PRA1, supernatant after 150,000 × g centrifugation from two 100-mm dishes of PC12 was added to 30 pmol of recombinant His-tagged PRA1 in a 1-ml final volume. A buffer blank was used as a control. The samples were supplemented with MgCl2 and GDP at 1 and 0.2 mm, respectively. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, 40 μl of 50% slurry of Ni2+-NTA was added and incubated with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 30–60 min. The Ni2+-NTA beads were then washed three times with ice-cold HBS (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). The proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, the blot was processed with anti-GDI (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PC12 cells were homogenized as described above. After the 10,000 × g centrifugation step, the membranes were isolated from the resulting supernatant by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was suspended in 0.2 ml of TS (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm sucrose). A typical assay contained 25 μg of PC12 membranes, recombinant GDI1 and PRA1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μm GDP in a 200-μl final volume. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the samples were chilled on ice and subjected to centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and pellet were then subjected to Western immunoblot analysis using anti-Rab3A (Santa Cruz). The binding of GDI1 to full-length and truncated PRA1-(1–164) was done using bacterially expressed proteins in a pull-down assay. GDI1 was purified on glutathione-Sepharose as described above. To demonstrate binding of PRA1 to GDI1, 40 pmol of recombinant PRA1 was added to either GST or GST-HA-GDI1 fusion protein in 200 μl of TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 125 mm NaCl). After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the GST fusion proteins were recovered with glutathione-Sepharose and washed four times with TBS. Both recombinant GDI1 and PRA1 were detected with anti-HA antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To demonstrate binding of GDI1 to PRA1, we used thrombin-cleaved product since this gave more efficient binding. The GST-HA-GDI1 fusion protein was cleaved with 3 milliunits of thrombin/pmol of protein at 37 °C for 2 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 288 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, and stopped by the addition of 2 mmPMSF. The GDI1 was subsequently incubated with 40 pmol of Ni2+-NTA-purified wild-type PRA1 or truncated PRA1-(1–164) at 37 °C for 30 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 125 mm NaCl. The resulting protein complex was pulled down using Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads and washed four times with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.03% CHAPS. Denaturing loading buffer was added to the beads and proteins subject to Western immunoblot analysis. The GDI1 and PRA1 were detected with anti-GDI1 and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. Purified recombinant Rab3A isolated from yeast (100 pmol) was incubated in 200 μl of Buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm KAc, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% gelatin, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing 10 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min to remove the bound guanine nucleotide. To replace it with the desired guanine nucleotide, MgCl2 and GDP were added at 15 mmand 250 μm final concentration, respectively. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the sample was chilled on ice and used in the competition assay. In a typical assay, recombinant PRA1 was pre-bound to GST-VAMP2 in Buffer A at room temperature for 60 min. The GST fusion protein was recovered with 40 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose slurry. The beads were then washed three times in Buffer A to remove any unbound proteins. Recombinant Rab3A was then added to the beads in 200 μl of Buffer A and incubated at room temperature with gentle agitation for 60 min. The beads were then collected by centrifugation, and proteins in the unbound fraction were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The beads were washed three times with Buffer A, and proteins bound to the beads were eluted with SDS loading buffer at 65 °C for 10 min. Both bound and unbound fractions were subjected to Western immunoblot with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies. To determine the subcellular localization of PRA1, the full-length and truncated PRA1-(1–164) were transfected into BHK cells and analyzed by immunocytochemistry. The truncated PRA1-(1–164) encompasses amino acids 1–164, including the two hydrophobic domains. We have shown that this carboxyl-terminal deletion abrogated binding to both Rab and VAMP2 (34.Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both constructs were subcloned with a HA epitope at the amino terminus into the Sindbis viral expression vector pSinRep5, and the resulting pseudovirions were used to infect BHK cells. The cells were processed for immunocytochemistry or immunoblot at 4–6 h after infection. This early time point was chosen to avoid possible cytotoxic effect of the Sindbis pseudovirion. Using a multiplicity of infection of 10, approximately 5–10% of the cells remained uninfected, and 25% showed a low level of expression based on staining intensity. The latter showed a punctate staining pattern that was mainly localized at the perinuclear region and a weakly diffused cytosolic staining (Fig.1 A). The majority of the cells exhibited a higher level of expression. These cells showed a more pronounced cytosolic staining while the perinuclear punctate staining pattern remained evident (Fig. 1 C). The diffused staining pattern suggested that PRA1 might exist as a cytosolic protein. This was surprising in light of the fact that PRA1 contained two extensive hydrophobic domains. Both hydrophobicity and structural prediction programs have suggested that PRA1 is a type III integral membrane protein with the amino- and carboxyl termini localized to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In contrast to the wild-type PRA1, cells expressing the truncated PRA1-(1–164) showed a reticular staining pattern in both low and high expressing cells (Fig. 1,B and D). There was no evidence of a diffused cytosolic staining in the truncated PRA1-(1–164)-infected cells. The truncated protein was also evident in the perinuclear structures, and plasma membrane. Thus, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 21 residues appears to have caused the protein to remain tightly associated with intracellular membranes. To exclude the possibility that the pattern observed may be due to overexpression of the protein by the Sindbis virus expression system, we compared the expression of the PRA1 constructs using the bicistronic vector pIRESpuro. The cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE and processed after 2 days. We observed no significant difference in the cellular distribution of the wild-type and truncated PRA1 between the two systems. To further identify the PRA1-associated intracellular organelle, the transfected cells were co-stained with mannosidase II and calnexin, a known Golgi complex (39.Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster O. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and ER (40.Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.J. Doherty III, J.J Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) marker, respectively. The wild-type PRA1 was found to co-localize with the Golgi marker mannosidase II (Fig. 2,A and B) and not with the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, the reticular pattern of the truncated PRA1-(1–164) showed extensive co-localization with calnexin (Fig. 2, G and H) with little or no co-localization with mannosidase II (Fig. 2, E andF). These results clearly indicate that the wild-type PRA1 is preferentially associated with the Golgi complex, whereas most of the truncated PRA1-(1–164) remains tightly associated with the ER structures.

To investigate events catalyzed by Cdc7p, we compared the structure of replication origins in cells containing conditional mutations in Cdc7p and Cdc8p, a thymidylate kinase that is required for DNA synthesis. High resolution genomic footprinting indicated that the presumptive lagging strand template in ARS1 became highly sensitive to KMnO4 modification after theCDC7 execution point.

The transition from late G1 phase to the CDC7 execution point and from the CDC7to the CDC8 execution points was accompanied by small but ARS-dependent changes in DNA topology. These results suggested that DNA unwinding before the CDC8 execution point either is highly localized or that the torsional stress associated with initial DNA unwinding is minimized by compensatory protein-DNA structural changes. The ARS DNA structural attributes evident in cells blocked at the CDC8 execution point were also evident in α-factor-blocked, G1 phase cells containing the CDC7 bypass mutantmcm5/cdc46-bob1.

Consequently, cells possess mechanisms that trigger DNA replication at a discrete point in the cell cycle and delay the onset of mitosis until replication is complete. Cells also possess mechanisms that coordinate the firing of multiple discrete replication origins with respect to one another during S phase and inhibit re-replication before mitosis. Some of these regulatory pathways directly affect the assembly or activation of the multisubunit replication initiation complexes that form with replication origins. Replication origins in the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae were first identified by their ability to promote replication of episomal DNA (1.Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 375-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Many of these autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs)1 were shown subsequently to act as replicators in their native chromosomal loci (1.Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 375-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and recent replication initiation mapping studies indicate that DNA synthesis begins at one or a few discrete sites within ARSs (2.Bielinsky A.K. Gerbi S.A. Science. 1998; 279: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,3.Bielinsky A.K. Gerbi S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Early analyses indicated that ARSs are composed of an essential A domain containing the conserved ARS consensus sequence (ACS; Ref. 4.Broach J.R. Li Y.Y. Feldman J. Jayaram M. Abraham J. Nasmyth K.A. Hicks J.B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a B domain. The archetypal ARS1 also contains a C domain (5.Celniker S.E. Sweder K. Srienc F. Bailey J.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2455-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6.Koshland D. Kent J.C. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1985; 40: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), which is packaged in a uniquely positioned nucleosome. This nucleosome may reduce the probability that the adjacent ACS will be packaged into a nucleosome capable of suppressing ARS activity (cf. Ref.7.Simpson R.T. Nature. 1990; 343: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Marahrens and Stillman (8.Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) found later that the B domain of the ARS1 could be subdivided into a B3 element that is bound by the transcription factor Abf1p (cf. Ref. 9.Campbell J.L. Newlon C.S. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 41-146Google Scholar), a B2 element thought to serve as a DNA-unwinding element (10.Natale D.A. Schubert A.E. Kowalski D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2654-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11.Umek R.M. Kowalski D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6601-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and a B1 element. The B1 element acts in conjunction with the ACS to bind a six-polypeptide origin recognition complex (ORC; Ref. 12.Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). ORC is required for the initiation of replication (13.Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14.Newlon C.S. Cell. 1997; 58: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and possesses an ATPase activity that is modulated by origin binding (15.Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of this ATPase activity is unknown, one role of ORC is to help recruit additional components of the replication initiation complex. Specifically, ORC-ARS complexes recruit Cdc6p during late mitosis or early G1 phase; this is followed by recruitment of a 6-subunit complex consisting of MCM proteins 2 through 7 (16.Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). These proteins make up the “pre-replicative complex,” which protects a large segment of ARS DNA from DNase I (17.Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Another essential factor, Cdc45p, joins the already-formed pre-replicative complex later in G1 phase to form the “pre-initiation complex” (18.Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 19.Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, DNA polymerase ε, and presumably other replicative enzymes as well join the pre-initiation complex at about the time of origin firing (18.Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 20.Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5182-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to form the replicative complex. Origin firing appears to involve loss of the MCM2-7 complex and Cdc45p from the pre-initiation complex and redistribution of Cdc45p and some of the MCM proteins to the nascent replication forks (18.Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). This last finding together with the discovery that an MCM subcomplex possesses helicase activity in vitrosuggested that an MCM subcomplex serves as the replicative helicase in yeast (21.You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The recent discovery that an MCM-like protein inMethanobacterium thermoautotrophicum not only possesses helicase activity but also assembles into a double hexamer (22.Chong J.P.J. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R-M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) suggests that MCM complexes are highly functionally conserved and serve as replicative helicases in all eukaryotes. After origin firing, a “post-replicative complex” remains associated with ARS DNA through the remainder of S phase and into the G2 and M phases; the post-replicative complex has an altered DNase I profile and may consist solely of ORC and Abf1p bound to ARS1 DNA (17.Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The sequence of events described above is tightly regulated by Cdc28p, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) protein kinase required for commitment of cells to a program of replication and cell division (reviewed in Ref. 23.Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-like protein kinases, notably Cdc7p in association with its cyclin-like partner Dbf4p (24.Chapman J.W. Johnston L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 67: 389-401Google Scholar, 25.Jackson A.L. Pahl P.M. Harrison K. Rosamond J. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Cell.

During late G1 phase, the Cdc28p kinase in association with the Cln cyclins phosphorylates the B-type (Clb) cyclin inhibitor Sic1p, which renders it susceptible to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (28.Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 29.Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation of Cdc6p during late G1 renders it susceptible to proteolysis as well (30.Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 31.Piatti S. Bohm T. Cocker J.H. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Loss of Cdc6p and phosphorylation of MCM proteins prevents their re-association with ARS-ORC complexes until late in mitosis, when the Clb cyclins are degraded. This sequence of phosphorylation and proteolysis events makes activation of replication complexes a unidirectional event and helps prevent re-replication before mitosis. The discovery that the Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase complex physically associates with individual replication initiation complexes (32.Dowell S.J. Romanowski P. Diffley J.F. Science. 1994; 265: 1243-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 33.Weinreich M. Stillman B.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) suggests that Cdc7p directly modifies one or more factors in the replication initiation complex. This inference is supported by in vitro evidence that the Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase modifies Mcm 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 as well as the largest subunit of DNA polymerase α-primase (33.Weinreich M. Stillman B.

Cdc7p-Dbf4p homologs inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, Xenopus laevis, and humans appear to have similar in vitro substrate preferences (38.Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5703-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy, however, that a specific Cdc7p bypass mutation in S. cerevisiae, mcm5/cdc46-bob1, resides in Mcm5p (44.Hardy C.F. Dryga O. Seematter S. Pahl P.M. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), a subunit of the MCM complex that is not efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by Cdc7p (33.Weinreich M. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5334-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not entirely clear if the in vitro targets of Cdc7p are identical to its in vivo targets. Additionally, the consequences of the action of Cdc7p at replication origins are still unclear. What is clear is that Cdc7p plays a critical role in activation of replication, and in this paper we have investigated structural changes at replication origins that can be attributed to the action of Cdc7p. Previous in vivo studies of cell cycle-regulated events at ARSs have used cdc mutants, the pheromone α-factor, the replication elongation inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU), and the microtubule-destabilizing agent nocodazole to block cells at selected points in the cell cycle (e.g. Refs. 17.Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar and 45.Brown J.A. Holmes S.G. Smith M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells blocked with α-factor or at the Cdc7p execution point exhibit a pre-replicative complex footprint, whereas cells blocked with HU or nocodazole exhibit a post-replicative complex footprint (17.Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). To further dissect events that occur after the Cdc7p execution point but before the HU-sensitive step, we investigated the use of additionalcdc mutants whose execution points have been mapped to within the Cdc7p-HU interval. One such mutant is cdc8-1, which encodes a thymidylate kinase required for DNA synthesis (46.Jong A.Y. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Sclafani R.A. Fangman W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5821-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).cdc8-1 mutants display a quick stop replication arrest when shifted to the restrictive temperature and resume DNA synthesis after their return to the permissive temperature. This rapid and reversible phenotype and the fact that Cdc8p is required shortly after Cdc7p (48.Hartwell L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) suggested that the study of cdc8-1-blocked cells might reveal structural events that could be attributed directly to the action of Cdc7p. The ARS1 footprints and DNA topology incdc8-1-blocked cells proved to be distinct from those incdc7-1-blocked cells and suggest that localized DNA unwinding occurs before the CDC8 execution point. Thecdc8-1 block is fully reversible, suggesting that the structure evident in cdc8-1-blocked cells reflects abona fide replication intermediate. The DNA topology as well as micrococcal nuclease (MNase) cleavage and KMnO4modification patterns characteristic of cdc8-1-blocked cells were also evident in both mcm5/cdc46-bob1 single mutants andcdc7Δ mcm5/cdc46-bob1 double mutants that had been blocked in G1 phase by α-factor. Sincemcm5/cdc46-bob1 is a CDC7- andDBF4-specific bypass mutant, this result strongly suggests that the structural changes evident in cdc8-1-blocked cells are normally induced by the Cdc7p kinase and involve changes in the MCM complex. Plasmid pJL347 (provided by J. Li, University of California at San Francisco) was used in episomal footprinting and topoisomer studies and contains a centromere (CEN6), a selectable marker (URA3), and the A and B domains of ARS1. Plasmid pMD-2 was used as a footprinting control and was constructed by inserting into the NheI site of pJL347 a second copy of ARS1 rendered non-functional by a G to T substitution in the ACS. Plasmid pKWD50N (provided by M. Gartenberg, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) contains the 2-mμ ARS,URA3, and an excision cassette that consists of a 2480-bpBglII-XhoI fragment from the yeastLYS2 gene flanked by direct repeats of a 58-bpZygosaccharomyces rouxii recombinase recognition sequence (49.Mirabella A. Gartenberg M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of pKWD50N and the recombinase expression vector pHM153 (50.Matsuzaki H. Nakajima R. Nishiyama J. Araki H. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 610-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by induction of recombinase expression leads to excision and recircularization of the excision cassette to form an ARS-less plasmid that was used as a control in the topoisomer studies. Plasmids were transfected by the method of Ito et al. (51.Ito, H., Fukuda, Y., Marata, K., and Kimura, A. (1983) 153, 163–168Google Scholar) into S. cerevisiae strain TCK1 (W3031A;bar1::HIS3) (provided by J. Kurjan, University of Vermont), strains Y236 (MATa bar1 his6 ura3 trp1 leu2 cdc7-1), Y728 (Mata bar1 his6 trp1-289 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 bob1-1 his3Δ1 lys2), and Y312 (MATa bar1 his6 ura3 trp1 leu2 can1 cdc8-1) (provided by R. Sclafani, University of Colorado Health Science Center), and strain MVY19 (MATa lys2 ura3-52 his3Δ1 leu2-3, 112 cyh2 cdc7Δ1::HIS3 mcm5/cdc46-bob1 gal1 bar1::LEU2). MVY19 was derived from strain P211 (from R. Sclafani) by disruption of the BAR1 gene. The procedures used for genomic footprinting were shown previously to faithfully reflect protein-DNA interactions in cells (52.Pederson D.S. Venkatesan M. Thoma F. Simpson R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7206-7210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 53.Chen J. Pederson D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7442-7448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Chen J. Ding M. Pederson D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11909-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the results for each cell strain or cell cycle point examined in this paper are based on at least three independent experiments. Briefly, cells were grown to early to mid-log phase (1–2 × 107cells/ml) in synthetic complete medium that lacked nutrients required for plasmid selection and contained 25 mm phthalate (pH 5.5 with NH4OH). Nuclei were isolated and treated with varying amounts of MNase, and DNA was isolated. The overall extent of digestion of chromatin and naked DNA control samples was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis (not shown). Samples digested to approximately equal extents were selected for footprint analyses and cleaved with NdeI andEcoRV. The fraction of template molecules that support primer extension to either the NdeI or EcoRV sites provided a direct measure of the extent of nuclease cleavage within the ARS1-DNA-containing region. Cleavage of templates withNdeI and EcoRV also provided an internal control for the specificity of the primers used for mapping cleavage sites. Nuclease cleavage sites in plasmid chromatin and naked DNA control samples were then mapped by polymerase chain reaction-mediated, reiterative extension of end-labeled oligonucleotide primers (5′-GCAATTTAACTGTGATAAACTACCGCATTAAAGCTTATCG-3′, 5′-AAATGATGAATTGAATTGAAAAGCTGTGGCGGCCG-3′, 5′-CGACAGCATCGCCAGTCACTATGGCGTGC-3′, and 5′-GCGCATAGAAATTGCATCAACGCATATAGC-3′), as described (55.Geraghty D.S. Sucic H.B. Chen J. Pederson D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20463-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Genomic footprints of ARS1 in chromosome IV were mapped using chromosome-specific primers 5′-AAATGGCGTTATTGGTGTTGATGTAAGCGGAGGT-3′ and 5′-TTGCGGTGAAATGGTAAAAGTCAACCCCCTGCGATG-3′. Extension products were resolved by electrophoresis on sequencing gels and visualized by autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat film. Cleavage sites were mapped by comparison with sequence ladders generated in parallel polymerase chain reactions using the same end-labeled primers and linearized plasmid DNA templates. For cell cycle experiments, strains were grown at 23 °C to ∼1 × 107 cells/ml and blocked in G1 phase by the addition of α-factor (Sigma) to a concentration of 20 nm. After 3 h, unbudded cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh 37 °C media containing 0.1–1 mg/ml protease (Sigma). After 1 h at 37 °C, at least 90% of cells had reached their characteristic terminal phenotype, as judged by microscopy (56.Hartwell L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 59: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,57.Hartwell L.H. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 966-974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were harvested for footprint analyses as above, except that elevated temperatures were used to sustain the blocked state until the moment of cell lysis. KMnO4 footprinting was carried out essentially as described by Park et al. (58.Park K. Mukhopadhyay S. Chattoraj D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24906-24911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-ml aliquots of yeast cells, grown as described above, were treated with 2–8 mmKMnO4 (Sigma) for 1 min at 42 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume (50 ml) of ice-cold STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) containing freshly added 5 mmdithiothreitol. The resulting mixture was chilled on ice, and cells were pelleted at 3600 rpm in RT6000B centrifuge (Sorvall) at 4 °C for 4–6 min, washed with 1 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended in 700 μl of cold 25× ETM (25 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing freshly added β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Cells were lysed using glass beads, and DNA was isolated and cleaved with EcoRV. Samples were then treated with a final concentration of 0.1 m NaOH for 5 min at room temperature and neutralized by the addition of HCl to a final concentration of 0.1 m. Modification sites in chromatin and naked DNA control samples were visualized and mapped by reiterative extension of end-labeled primers, as described above. Initial studies of pJL347 and TRP1ARS1 topoisomers were performed using DNA isolated from cells grown in glucose-containing media and blocked at selected points in the cell cycle, as described above. However, since galactose is required to induce expression of the Z. rouxii recombinase (50.Matsuzaki H. Nakajima R. Nishiyama J. Araki H. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 610-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined pJL347 topoisomers isolated from cells that had been shifted to galactose, as described below, and found that the different carbon sources had no detectable effect on the topoisomer distributions (data not shown). To examine the topology of plasmids lacking an ARS, cells containing both pKWD50N and pHM153 were grown to mid-log phase at 23 °C in synthetic medium containing 2% raffinose. Cells were blocked in G1 phase by the addition of α-factor to 20 nm. After 2–3 h in α-factor, recombinase expression was induced by the addition of galactose to a final concentration of 2%. After 1 h in the presence of both galactose and α-factor, α-factor was removed, and half the culture was shifted to 37 °C, whereas the other half was maintained at 23 °C. At appropriate times, cells were lysed with glass beads in the presence of 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma), and plasmid DNA was isolated. Plasmid topoisomers were resolved by gel electrophoresis for 15 h at 2 V/cm in 0.9–1.4% agarose gels containing chloroquine diphosphate (Sigma). Chloroquine concentrations were varied in trial experiments to ensure that amounts used were sufficient to induce a positive writhe in the topoisomers to be examined (59.Bauer W. Vinograd J. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 141-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). After transfer to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), the excision cassette, pJL347, pKWD50N, and TRP1ARS1 topoisomers were visualized by hybridization with 32P-labeled LYS2, pBR322, and TRP1ARS1 probes, respectively. For each plasmid, individual topoisomers were assigned an integral value, and the amount of each topoisomer was quantified (and corrected for background) using a Bio-Rad phosphoimager. The topoisomer amounts were summed, and the number average distribution was calculated. The number average linking number for plasmids isolated from α-factor-blocked cells at 23 °C was used as a reference value. Thus, the ΔLk reported in Table I for plasmids in other cell types or at other points in the cell cycle refers to the linking number change relative to the linking number in α-factor-blocked cells. Each ΔLk reported is based on the average value of at least three separate experiments.Table IShift in average linking number with changes in the cell cycleTreatmentpJL347, 6027 bpTRP1ARS1, 1453 bppKWD50N, 8278 bp2465 bp excision cassetteRelative average Lk No.ΔLk from previous cell cycle stepRelative average Lk No.ΔLk from previous cell cycle stepRelative average Lk No.ΔLk from previous cell cycle stepRelative average Lk No.ΔLk from previous cell cycle stepα-Factor-blocked, 23 °C0.0 +/− 0.50−0.900.0 +/− 0.08+0.400.0 +/− 0.13−2.170.0 +/− 0.10NAα-Factor-blocked, 23 °C ≫ 37 °C−1.73 +/− 0.53−1.73 (−1.80 predicted)−0.30 (WT only)−0.30 (−0.62 predicted)−2.29 +/− 0.16−2.29 (−2.48 predicted)−0.54 +/− 0.06−0.54 (−0.74 predicted)α-Factor-blocked, 23 °C; remove block ≫Cdc7p step, 37 °C−0.11 +/− 0.15+1.62−0.20+0.10−0.34+1.95−0.46+0.08α-Factor-blocked, 23 °C; remove block ≫Cdc8p step, 37 °C−0.96 +/− 0.19−0.85−0.40−0.20−0.15+0.17−0.460α-Factor-blocked, 23 °C; remove block ≫HU block, 23 °C4.83 (WT only)+4.06NDNDNDND∼0∼0Linking number changes evident in cdc7–1-blocked cells were calculated relative to the average linking number for all three cell types (i.e. W303-1A and the cdc7–1 andcdc8–1 mutants) in α-factor-blocked cells after incubation at 37 °C; this eliminated the need for temperature corrections.

As outlined in the Introduction, DNA replication requires the assembly and activation of initiation complexes followed by DNA unwinding by helicases, stabilization of unwound DNA by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, and synthesis of an RNA primer by DNA primase. To link these events to factors that control cell cycle progression, we examined the chromatin structure of ARS1 in both its native location in chromosome IV and in an episomal plasmid, pJL347, at specific points in the cell cycle. Cells were blocked either in G1 phase with the mating pheromone α-factor or in S phase with hydroxyurea (HU). We also blocked cells at selected points in the cell cycle using cell strains containing temperature-sensitive mutations in either Cdc28p, Cdc7p, or Cdc8p. To ensure maximal viability of mutants used in this study and thereby avoid possible artifacts associated with cell death, cells were first bloc"

Native UreE possesses a histidine-rich region at its carboxyl terminus that binds several equivalents of Ni2+; however, a truncated form of this protein (H144*UreE) binds only 2 Ni2+ per dimer and is functionally active (Brayman, T. G., and Hausinger, R. P. (1996) J. Bacteriol. 178, 5410–5416). The urease activation kinetics were studied in vivo by monitoring the development of urease activity upon adding Ni2+ to spectinomycin-treated Escherichia colicells that expressed the complete K. aerogenes urease gene cluster with altered forms of ureE. Site-specific alterations of H144*UreE decrease the rate of in vivourease activation, with the most dramatic changes observed for the H96A, H110A, D111A, and H112A substitutions. Notably, urease activity in cells producing H96A/H144*UreE was lower than cells containing aureE deletion. Prior studies had shown that H110A and H112A variants each bound a single Ni2+ per dimer with elevatedK d values compared with control H144*UreE, whereas the H96A and D111A variants bound 2 Ni2+ per dimer with unperturbed K d values (Colpas, G. J., Brayman, T. G., Ming, L.-J., and Hausinger, R. P. (1999)Biochemistry 38, 4078–4088). To understand why cells containing the latter two proteins showed reduced rates of urease activation, we characterized their metal binding/dissociation kinetics and compared the results to those obtained for H144*UreE. The truncated protein was shown to sequentially bind two Ni2+ withk 1 ∼18 and k 2 ∼100m−1 s−1, and with dissociation rates k −1 ∼3 × 10−3 andk −2 ∼10−4 s−1. Similar apparent rates of binding and dissociation were noted for the two mutant proteins, suggesting that altered H144*UreE interactions with Ni2+ do not account for the changes in cellular urease activation. These conclusions are further supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that addition of H144*UreE to urease apoprotein activation mixtures inhibited the rate and extent of urease formation. Our results highlight the importance of other urease accessory proteins in assisting UreE-dependent urease maturation.

Recently, CopZ has been identified and proposed to direct Cu(I) to a Cu2+-responsive repressor (CopY) involved in regulation of bacterial Cu2+ transport proteins (10.Cobine P. Wickramsinghe W.A.

Also in bacteria, three distinct Ni2+ metallochaperones have been tentatively identified (12.Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 279-286Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). HypB, essential for Ni2+insertion into hydrogenase by a process that requires GTP hydrolysis (13.Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 630-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Maier T. Lottspeich F. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), binds 18 Ni2+/dimer (K d = 2.3 μm) as isolated from Bradyrhizobium japonicum(15.Fu C. Olsen J.W. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rhodospirillum rubrum CooJ, which assists with CO dehydrogenase activation (16.Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds 4 Ni2+/monomer (K d = 4.3 μm) (17.Watt R.K. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10019-10025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, of particular interest to the work described here is Klebsiella aerogenes UreE, the putative urease metallochaperone (18.Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Renner M.J. Markowicz Y. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4324-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that binds 5–6 Ni2+/dimer (average K d = ∼10 μm) (19.Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In each case, mutations within the corresponding genes are phenotypically suppressed by increasing the Ni2+ concentration in the medium (16.Kerby R.L. Ludden P.W. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Renner M.J. Markowicz Y. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4324-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Waugh R. Boxer D.H. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although all three proteins possess histidine-rich regions, they exhibit no overall sequence similarity. The metal-binding properties of K. aerogenes UreE have been extensively characterized. Spectroscopic studies with wild-type protein reveal pseudo-octahedral Ni2+-binding sites with an average of 3–5 histidine donors, implicating a role for the carboxyl terminus where 10 of the last 15 residues are histidine (19.Lee M.H. Pankratz H.S. Wang S. Scott R.A. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Ippolito J.A. Christianson D.W. Hausinger R.P. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1042-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of sequence conservation for this feature among other urease-containing microorganisms, a truncated form of K. aerogenes UreE lacking the His-rich region, termed H144*UreE,1 is competent for activating urease in vivo (21.Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated protein possesses two internal Ni2+-binding sites per dimer; thus, the internal ligands, not the histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus, are necessary for UreE to assist in K. aerogenesurease activation. Competition experiments indicate that Cu2+, Zn2+, and Co2+ bind (to varying degrees) to H144*UreE (21.Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spectroscopic studies of Ni2+, Cu2+, and Co2+ binding to H144*UreE and several mutant proteins reveal two distinct binding sites per homodimer, each of which is symmetrically located at the dimer interface (22.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. McCracken J. Pressler M.A. Babcock G.T. Ming L.-J. Colangelo C.M. Scott R.A. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 150-160Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The two Ni2+ sites exhibit pseudo-octahedral geometry, with one Ni2+ possessing four histidine donor ligands and a second Ni2+ coordinated to two histidines. The Ni2+ dependence of in vivoactivation, characterized in stationary phase cells, indicates that one site (involving the pairs of His-96 and His-112 residues along with two other N or O donors) is critical to the role of UreE in urease activation, whereas the second site (including the pair of His-110 residues and four other N/O donors) is less significant to this process (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These same experiments show that Asp-111 is important for proper function, but it is unclear whether this residue serves as a ligand or affects Ni2+ binding by secondary interactions. Co2+ binds in a manner similar to Ni2+, whereas Cu2+ binding is distinct. All of the bound Cu2+has tetragonal coordination with two histidine donors each, but at higher Cu2+ concentrations a cysteine donor (Cys-79) coordinates the metal. The differences in coordination environments observed for each type of metal ion are proposed to function in metal specificity so that only Ni2+ is used for urease activation (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The studies described in this article examine the role of UreE in urease maturation. Two mutant proteins altered at highly conserved residues (H96A/H144*UreE and D111A/H144*UreE) are shown to reduce dramatically the rate of cellular urease activation, even though they bind 2 Ni2+ per dimer with K d values close to control H144*UreE. The kinetics of metal binding/dissociation for these mutant proteins are compared with the more extensively investigated kinetics for H144*UreE. Significantly, the ability of purified proteins to bind and release Ni2+ does not correlate with their ability to function in urease activation. Related to this finding, H144*UreE is shown to inhibit in vitroactivation of urease apoprotein even though it facilitates metallocenter assembly in the cell. These studies emphasize the importance of other accessory proteins in aiding UreE-dependent activation of urease. Escherichia coli HMS174(DE3) cells containing pKK17, pKK17ΔureE-1, pKK17H144*, and variants of pKK17H144* (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were used to monitor the kinetic effects of UreE variants on cellular urease activity. These plasmids contain the K. aerogenes ureDABCEFG gene cluster in which ureE encodes wild-type, deleted, truncated, and mutated/truncated versions of UreE, respectively. Fresh cultures were inoculated into LB medium (50 μl into 25 ml) lacking Ni2+ but supplemented with 100 μg·ml−1 ampicillin. Cells were grown for 2 h at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm IPTG for 2 h, and adjusted to 0.2 mg·ml−1 spectinomycin (Sigma) to halt protein synthesis. After 30 min, NiCl2 was added (final concentration of 200 μm), and at selected time points 1-ml aliquots were collected and immediately frozen. Upon thawing, each sample was centrifuged, resuspended in 1.5 ml of 20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, disrupted in a French pressure cell, and centrifuged to obtain soluble cell extracts for the urease activity assay. Urease activity was measured by quantifying the rate of ammonia release from urea by formation of indophenol, which was measured at 625 nm (24.Weatherburn M.W. Anal. Chem. 1967; 39: 971-974Crossref Scopus (3115) Google Scholar). Assay buffer contained 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.75), 50 mm urea, and 0.5 mm EDTA. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 μmol of urea per min at 37 °C. Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (25.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by using a commercial protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. E. coliHMS174(DE3) or E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) carrying derivatives of pET21 (Novagen) were used for overproduction of recombinant H144*UreE and H144*UreE variants (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These cultures were grown at 37 °C in TB medium containing 100 μg·ml−1ampicillin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to A 600∼1, induced with 0.5 mm IPTG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and harvested after 4–6 h. H144*UreE and H144*UreE variant proteins were purified according to previously published procedures (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α cells containing pKAU17 (26.Mulrooney S.B. Pankratz H.S. Hausinger R.P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 1769-1776PubMed Google Scholar) were used for production of urease apoprotein. These cultures were grown at 37 °C overnight in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg·ml−1 ampicillin, and the desired protein was purified by previously published procedures (27.Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4427-4431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements involving metal interactions with purified H144*UreE and its variants were performed on an OLIS-RSM rapid scan stopped-flow spectrophotometer with a 0.4-cm path length flow cell (Olis Co.). All reactions were studied at room temperature in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer with 100 mm NaCl added. Dissociation rates typically were measured upon mixing equal volumes of 40 μm metal chloride plus 20 μm H144*UreE (dimer) solution with 200 μm 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) (Aldrich) solution. PAR binds divalent cations with stability constants ranging from 1011 to 1013m (28.Corsini A. Yih I.M. Fernando Q. Freiser H. Anal. Chem. 1962; 34: 1090-1093Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), so essentially all protein-associated metal became bound to PAR upon reaching equilibrium. The concentration of PAR was determined to be sufficient for establishing pseudo-first-order metal-release reactions (29.Furahashi S. Tanaka M. Inorg. Chem. 1969; 10: 2159-2165Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30.Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and a 2-fold increase in PAR concentration did not affect the measured rates. Additional studies examined the effects of additives (200 μm imidazole, 100 μm histidine, or 100 μm cysteine) on metal transfer to PAR. Data were analyzed by doing single wavelength fits to the M(II)(PAR)2 absorption at 500 nm (where M indicates metal and ε = 7.0 × 104m−1 cm−1 for Ni2+, 6.6 × 104m−1cm−1 for Zn2+, 6.0 × 104m−1 cm−1 for Co2+, and 6.5 × 104m−1cm−1 for Cu2+) (31.Tanaka M. Funahashi S. Shirai K. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1967; 39: 437-445Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The fits generated by the Olis fitting program for the dissociation studies are provided as Table S1 in the Supplemental Material. The calculated amplitudes were underestimated in these fits because the window of time points did not begin at 0. For the selected dissociation results described in the text, k obs values and associated amplitudes were determined by performing one or more single exponential fits to the data using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) after extrapolating to zero time. For binding studies, equal volumes of H144*UreE apoprotein and metal chloride were mixed. Data were analyzed by doing single wavelength fits at 370 nm for Ni2+ (ε = 75m−1 cm−1 per Ni2+bound or 150 m−1 cm−1 per H144*UreE dimer) (22.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. McCracken J. Pressler M.A. Babcock G.T. Ming L.-J. Colangelo C.M. Scott R.A. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 150-160Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or at 365 nm for Cu2+ (ε = 5000 m−1 cm−1 per H144*UreE dimer) (22.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. McCracken J. Pressler M.A. Babcock G.T. Ming L.-J. Colangelo C.M. Scott R.A. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 150-160Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The fits generated by the Olis fitting program are provided as Table S2 in the Supplemental Material. For the selected studies described in the text, data were analyzed by using KaleidaGraph as described above. In addition, iterative simulations were carried out using program A, provided by Dr. David Ballou at the University of Michigan, to obtain rate constants. This program, written by Chung-Jen Chiu, Rong Chang, Joel Dinverno, and David Ballou is an implementation of a 4th order Runge-Kutta algorithm for numerical integration of differential equations (32.Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, New York1992: 683-688Google Scholar). Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6 were used for simulating the Ni2+ data (where H144*UreE is divided into two pools,X and Y, that bind Ni2+differently). d[Ni]/dt=−k1[Ni][X]+k−1[Ni−X]−k2[Ni][Ni−X]+k−2[Ni2X]−ka[Ni][Y]+k−a[Ni−Y]Equation 1 d[X]/dt=−k1[Ni][X]+k−1[Ni−X]Equation 2 d[Ni−X]/dt=k1[Ni][X]−k−1[Ni−X]−k2[Ni][Ni−X]Equation 3 +k−2[Ni2−X] d[Ni2−X]/dt=k2[Ni][Ni−X]−k−2[Ni2−X]Equation 4 d[Y]/dt=−ka[Ni][Y]+k−a[Ni−Y]Equation 5 d[Ni−Y]/dt=ka[Ni][Y]−k−a[Ni−Y]Equation 6 Similarly, Equations Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10, Equation 11 were used for simulating the Cu2+ data (where the protein is represented byZ = X + Y). d[Cu]/dt=−k1[Cu][Z]+k−1[Cu−Z]−k2[Cu][Cu−Z]Equation 7 +k−2[Cu2−Z]−k3[Cu][Cu2−Z]+k−3[Cu3−Z] d[Z]/dt=−k1[Cu][Z]+k−1[Cu−Z]Equation 8 d[Cu−Z]/dt=k1[Cu][Z]−k−1[Cu−Z]−k2[Cu][Cu−Z]Equation 9 +k−2[Cu2−Z] d[Cu2−Z]/dt=k2[Cu][Cu−Z]−k−2[Cu2−Z]−k3[Cu][Cu2−Z]+k−3[Cu3−Z]Equation 10 d[Cu3−Z]/dt=k3[Cu][Cu2−Z]−k−3[Cu3−Z]Equation 11 The effects of H144*UreE on production of active urease was examined under urease apoprotein activation conditions (33.Park I.-S. Hausinger R.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1156-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Purified urease apoprotein (2.5 μm) samples were assayed every 30 min for 4–6 h while being incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm NaHCO3, 100 μm NiCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 25 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8.3) containing varying levels of H144*UreE. The in vivo and in vitro kinetics of metal transfer were studied for K. aerogenes UreE, a putative metallochaperone thought to deliver Ni2+ to urease. Previous studies had measured the effects of UreE variants on cellular urease activity levels for cultures in stationary phase and had examined purified UreE variants for Ni2+ binding stoichiometry and affinity under equilibrium conditions (21.Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The present work examined the rates of urease activation in cells and the rates of metal binding/dissociation with purified UreE variants. In addition, the effects of UreE addition on urease apoprotein activation were examined. The in vivorates of urease metallocenter assembly were compared for E. coli HMS174(DE3) cells expressing the K. aerogenesurease gene cluster with variations in ureE. The relative amounts of urease and UreE synthesized was unaffected by the mutations, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Using spectinomycin-treated cells that were incapable of new protein synthesis, the development of urease activity from previously synthesized apourease and accessory proteins was examined upon addition of 200 μm NiCl2 (Fig.1). For cells that synthesized wild-type UreE (filled squares), urease activity was detected within 10 min of Ni2+ addition (panel A) and continued to increase over the 4-h time course of the experiment (panel B). Very similar results were found for cells containing H144*UreE (filled circles), supporting our proposal that the carboxyl-terminal histidine-rich region is not essential for urease activation (21.Brayman T.G. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5410-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when ureE was deleted a delay in urease activation was observed (>30 min, filled triangles, panel A) and the specific activity gradually increased over the entire course of the study (∼25% of the control rate, panel B). The lag period observed in the deletion strain highlights the importance of UreE for the rapid transfer of Ni2+ into preformed urease apoprotein. On the other hand, these studies reinforce previous conclusions that UreE is not required for urease activation (18.Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Renner M.J. Markowicz Y. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4324-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). With the exception of cells containing H96A/H144*UreE, all cultures possessing H144*UreE variants demonstrated intermediate abilities to activate urease with greatest inhibition being noted for cells producing the H110A, D111A, and H112A variants. These findings underscore the complexity of assigning specific functions to structural features in the metal-binding protein, but we note that His-110 and His-112 were previously suggested to be Ni2+ ligands, and Asp-111 was proposed to be functionally important (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The cultures synthesizing H96A/H144*UreE are of special interest because their levels of urease activity were less that those observed in theureE deletion mutant. It was not surprising to find that cells producing H110A/H144*UreE and H112A/H144*UreE exhibited reductions in their in vivo urease activation rates. Previous studies had shown that these purified proteins bound only one Ni2+ per dimer with elevatedK d values (16 and 36 μm) compared with a control H144*UreE sample that bound two Ni2+ per dimer (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast, reduced cellular urease activation levels cannot be explained by the Ni2+ binding properties of H96A/144*UreE or D111A/H144*UreE. The number of Ni2+ bound and the average Ni2+ binding affinities for these purified proteins were essentially identical to results obtained with H144*UreE (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The significance of these results is reflected in the high conservation of His-96 and Asp-111 among UreE sequences from different microorganisms (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To define better how altering these two residues can have such dramatic effects within the cell while having no affect on equilibrium Ni2+ binding, we carried out kinetic measurements of their metal binding and dissociation rates. These results were compared with those for H144*UreE which was subjected to more extensive kinetic analysis. The rates of metal ion release from H144*UreE and its variants were examined by using UV-visible stopped-flow spectroscopy to monitor chromophore development at 500 nm arising from metal chelation by PAR. These studies assume that PAR bound only the free metal ion and did not actively remove protein-bound metal. The observed rates of chromophore development for release of protein-bound metals (k obs) were considered to be equivalent to the dissociation rates (k off) because the affinity of the metals for PAR at this concentration far exceeded the affinity for protein (28.Corsini A. Yih I.M. Fernando Q. Freiser H. Anal. Chem. 1962; 34: 1090-1093Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Dissociation of Ni2+ from Ni2+-H144*UreE or its H96A and D111A variants was monitored by PAR chromophore development as shown in Fig. 2. In each case, Ni2+ was present at 2-fold the concentration of protein (10 μm dimer after mixing). Given the previously establishedK d values of ∼10 μm for these proteins (23.Colpas G.J. Brayman T.G. Ming L.-J. Hausinger R.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), approximately half the metal would be protein-bound with the rest free in solution. Mixing with PAR led to an immediate burst in chromophore development, associated with chelation of the free metal to form the Ni(PAR)2 complex, followed by a slower increase in absorbance. As shown in Table I, the initial phase occurred at a rate (k obs−1 ∼0.2 s−1) matching that observed for protein-free control experiments, whereas the slower changes (k obs−2; e.g. 0.002 s−1for the control sample) represent the dissociation rates for the protein-bound metal. The D111A and H96A variants released Ni2+ 2- and 3-fold more rapidly than the H144*UreE, demonstrating that the in vivo effects of these proteins do not arise from a slow rate of Ni2+ dissociation.Table IRates of metal dissociation for H144*UreE and variantsMetalProteinAdditivek obsAmplitudeμmμmμms −1ΔANi2+(20)H144*UreE (10)None0.200.2620.002150.173Ni2+(20)H96A/H144*UreE (10)None0.10.2650.00580.250Ni2+(20)D111A/H144*UreE (10)None0.160.3290.00440.215Ni2+(20)H144*UreE (10)ImidazoleaThe additive was included with the PAR solution.

https://openalex.org/W2094221900,"Because the vitamin D receptor interacting protein (DRIP) coactivator complex shares components with the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) holoenzyme complex, we tested whether the two protein complexes associate in cellular extracts. On initial purification steps, the DRIP complex copurified with the Pol II holoenzyme. Pol II was found to bind to the vitamin D receptor in a ligand-dependent fashion when either nuclear extracts or partially purified preparations were used as sources of DRIP and Pol II holoenzyme. A subpopulation of holoenzyme complexes bound to the receptor because BRCA1, which associates with the Pol II holoenzyme, did not associate with the liganded receptor, and only in certain of the holoenzyme- and DRIP-containing fractions did Pol II bind to the liganded receptor. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the DRIP complex was not pre-associated with the Pol II holoenzyme, but the interaction between these two complexes was induced only in the presence of receptor and ligand. These data support a model in which the activation of transcription by hormone-bound receptor requires binding to the DRIP coactivator, and this induced ternary complex can then bind to the Pol II holoenzyme to activate transcription."

The rapamycin and FKBP-target 1 (RAFT1), also known as FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP, mTOR), regulates the p70S6 kinase (p70S6k) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1).

However, the signals that determine cell fate, which is survival or apoptosis, are largely unknown. The c-Abl non-receptor tyrosine kinase is activated in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR)1 and diverse types of DNA damage (1.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M.

Recent studies have shown that activation of c-Abl by genotoxic stress is associated with interaction of c-Abl and the p53 tumor suppressor in the G1arrest response (4.Yuan Z.-M. Huang Y. Whang Y. Sawyers C. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Nature. 1996; 382: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Other downstream signals of c-Abl include induction of the stress-activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase by genotoxic agents (1.Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D.

Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), direct interaction with damaged DNA could contribute to the induction of c-Abl activity. The interaction of c-Abl with sensors of DNA damage, such as the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), has also lent support to a model in which c-Abl is a target for activation by an upstream effector (2.Kharbanda S.

Other studies have demonstrated that c-Abl associates with the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein and that ATM may also contribute to activation of c-Abl in the response to DNA damage (8.Baskaran R.

Although the precise mechanisms responsible for the activation of c-Abl remain unclear, the potential consequence of the interactions between c-Abl and DNA-PK or ATM may contribute to cell fate in response to DNA damage. Importantly, cells defective in DNA-PK or ATM are hypersensitive to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation (IR) (10.Chen P.C. Lavin M.F. Kidson C. Moss D.

Thus, whereas DNA-PK and ATM may be directly responsible for activation of c-Abl, DNA strand breaks appear to represent an initial signal. Accumulation of DNA double strand breaks also occurs during recombination. In this context, c-Abl associates with the Rad51 recombinational repair protein (14.Yuan Z.M. Utsugisawa T. Huang Y.

Hershey J.W. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Protein Translation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 bind to eIF4E by a mechanism dependent on their phosphorylation state (31.Hu C. Pang S. Kong X.

Thus, stimulation of cells with growth factors or serum results in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1/4E-BP2 and thereby their dissociation from eIF4E to relieve translational inhibition. Since DNA-PK and ATM both interact with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, and RAFT1 is a member of this family, we asked whether c-Abl contributes to the regulation of RAFT1-mediated cap-dependent translation. The results demonstrate that c-Abl regulates RAFT1 and thereby binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E. The functional significance of the c-Abl/RAFT1 interaction is supported by the finding that c-Abl inhibits eIF4E-dependent translation. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Fibroblasts from 4E-BP1−/ −, 4E-BP1+/+ , Abl−/−, and wild-type mice and NIH3T3, 293T, MCF-7, and MCF-7/c-Abl (K-R) cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Irradiation was performed at room temperature using a Gammacell-1000 (Atomic Energy of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) under aerobic conditions with a 137Cs source emitting at a fixed dose rate of 0.76 Gy/min as determined by dosimetry. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were transiently transfected with HA-RAFT1 with or without c-Abl by the calcium phosphate method as described (3.Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Meyer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After 24–36 h, the cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-c-Abl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). MCF-7 and MCF-7/c-Abl (K-R) cells were transiently transfected with HA-RAFT1 by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, cells were irradiated at 20 Gy and harvested at the indicated times. Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr or anti-HA antibodies. The blots were scanned, and signal intensities were determined by densitometric analysis (UltroScan; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, anti-RAFT1 (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-c-Abl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described (3.Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Ren R. Meyer B. Zon L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30278-30281Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After washing the precipitates three times with lysis buffer, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl (AB-3, Oncogene Science), anti-HA, anti-P-Tyr (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or anti-RAFT1 (mouse monoclonal; provided by Drs.

In certain experiments, anti-c-Abl was preincubated with the peptide used as immunogen, and the mixture of antibody and peptide was incubated with cell lysate for 2 h. Anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RAFT1 antibody. Signal intensities were determined by densitometric analysis (UltroScan; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified GST, GST-c-Abl, or GST-Abl SH3 were incubated with lysate from cells overexpressing HA-RAFT1 for 1 h at 4 °C as described (34.Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Shafman T. Emoto Y. Rubin E.

The adsorbates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA. Cells were transiently transfected with a kinase-dead mutant of RAFT1 (HA-RAFT1 D2357E). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, and the beads were incubated with recombinant purified active or heat-inactivated c-Abl in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer at 30 °C for 15 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Cells were transiently transfected with 8 μg of HA-RAFT1 cDNA. After 24 h, cells were washed and lysed in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 6 mg/ml chymostatin, and 1 mg/ml of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and antipain). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA and incubated with kinase active or inactive c-Abl. Kinase reactions were performed as described above. Reaction products were washed twice with buffer B (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 40 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% SDS), twice with buffer B containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m Li, and once with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. RAFT1 kinase assays were performed in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 200 ng of GST-p70S6k Y-A mutant fusion protein and [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, proteins were separated in 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and analyzed by autoradiography. 293T cells were transfected with HA-4E-BP1 and increasing amounts of pSRα c-Abl. After 24–36 h, the cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoblot analyses by anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were transiently cotransfected with empty vector or c-Abl and pGEMLUC/pol/CAT (27.Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) (2 μg) using Lipofectin as described (35.Bharti A. Kraeft S.-K. Gounder M. Pandey P. Jin S. Yuan Z.-M. Lees-Miller S.P.

NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-LUC-pol-CAT, and after 5 h, serum was added with or without 50 ng/ml rapamycin. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activity using a Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI). 293T cells were transiently transfected with pSRα or pSRα c-Abl. After 48 h, total RNA was isolated using the single step guanidinium isothiocyanate method as described (36.Kumar M. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3542-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Internally labeled RNA probes were made by in vitro transcription with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP as described (36.Kumar M. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3542-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DNA templates were removed by RQ1 DNase digestion followed by phenol/chloroform extraction. RNA was hybridized overnight to32P-labeled antisense RNA probes specific for GAPDH (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and luciferase (37.Donze O. Damy P. Spahr P.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The hybridization products were digested with a T1/T2 mixture at 37 °C for 1.5 h, and the resulting samples were resolved in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Routinely, 20 μg of RNA samples were used for RNase protection. The protected bands were quantitated using a Packard Instant Imager. Cells were exposed to 20 Gy IR and harvested at various time intervals. To purify endogenous eIF4E, 30 μl of a 50% slurry of 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added to the cleared cell lysates and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. After washing the resin twice with buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-4E-BP1 (clone 11208 (27.Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

Fibroblasts from 4E-BP1−/−and 4E-BP1+/+ mice and U-937 cells were serum-starved for 48 h and preincubated for 1 h in methionine-free medium. [35S]Methionine (100 μCi) and 10% fetal bovine serum were then added to the cultures. Total cell lysates prepared in buffer I (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) were analyzed for incorporated radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid precipitates. To determine whether c-Abl associates with RAFT1, total cell lysates from MCF-7 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl, and the resulting precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RAFT1. The results demonstrate binding of c-Abl and RAFT1 that is blocked by preincubation of the anti-c-Abl antibody with a peptide used as the immunogen (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained in a reciprocal experiment in which anti-RAFT1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl (Fig. 1 B). Because IR activates c-Abl (1.Kharbanda S.

A. 1996; 93: 6898-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we investigated whether IR affects the interaction between c-Abl and RAFT1. The results demonstrate that exposure of cells to IR had little if any effect on the association of these proteins (Fig.1 B). The finding that RAFT1 and c-Abl also associate constitutively in 293T cells indicates that the interaction between these proteins is not specific to MCF-7 cells (data not shown). To assess the stoichiometry of the interaction between c-Abl and RAFT1, MCF-7 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl, and the lysates before and after immunoprecipitation were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RAFT1. The filters were scanned to determine the percentage of c-Abl associated with RAFT1. The results demonstrate that approximately 50% of RAFT1 is present in the complex with c-Abl (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained when lysates from 293T cells before and after immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Abl were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RAFT1 (data not shown). To confirm the interaction between RAFT1 and c-Abl, we transiently overexpressed HA-RAFT1 with c-Abl in 293T cells and analyzed anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-HA. Reactivity of anti-HA with a 289-kDa protein supported the coprecipitation of RAFT1 with c-Abl (Fig. 1 D). In the reciprocal experiment, anti-HA immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-c-Abl. The results confirmed the identification of a complex containing RAFT1 and c-Abl (Fig. 1 E). To determine whether RAFT1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells, MCF-7 and MCF-7/c-Abl (K-R) cells overexpressing a kinase-dead c-Abl in which lysine 290 has been mutated to arginine (K290R (39.Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Havlik M.H. Clark R. McCormick F. Witte O.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5927-5931Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)) were transiently transfected with HA-RAFT1 and exposed to IR, and anti-HA immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. The results demonstrate that, by contrast to MCF-7/c-Abl (K-R) cells, irradiation of MCF-7 cells is associated with a nearly 3-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFT1 (Fig.2, A and B). These findings provided support for IR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFT1 by a c-Abl-dependent mechanism. Binding of RAFT1 and c-Abl was further studied by incubating cell lysates with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Adsorbates obtained with GST-c-Abl, and not with GST, demonstrated binding to RAFT1 (Fig.3 A). Adsorbates obtained with GST-Abl SH3 also demonstrated binding to RAFT1 (Fig. 3 A). The c-Abl SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences with the consensus PXXXXPXXP (40.Feller S. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 41.Ren R. Ye Z.-S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The identification of such a sequence for c-Abl SH3 binding in RAFT1 (PGTYDPNOP; amino acids 2141–2149) supported a potential direct interaction between these two proteins. To determine whether the interaction between c-Abl and RAFT1 is direct, anti-HA immunoprecipitates from HA-RAFT1-transfected cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Analysis of the filter by incubation with purified GST-Abl-SH3 and immunoblotting with anti-GST showed binding of c-Abl to RAFT1 (Fig. 3 B). These findings demonstrate that c-Abl directly associates with RAFT1. To define the region of RAFT1 responsible for the association with c-Abl, Myc-tagged N-terminal or C-terminal RAFT1 were transiently overexpressed in 293T cells. Total cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl. As a positive control, anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Abl. The results demonstrate that c-Abl associates with the C-terminal (containing the potential c-Abl-SH3 domain binding sequence, amino acids 2141–2149), and not the N-terminal, fragment of RAFT1 (Fig. 3 C and data not shown). Similar results were obtained in a reciprocal experiment in which anti-c-Abl immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc (Fig. 3 D and data not shown). To assess in part the functional significance of the interaction between c-Abl and RAFT1, we investigated whether RAFT1 is a substrate for c-Abl. 293T cells were transfected with a vector expressing a kinase-inactive HA-RAFT1 D2357E mutant (25.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, and the precipitates were incubated with purified kinase-active c-Abl, heat-inactivated c-Abl, or buffer in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Analysis of the reaction products by autoradiography demonstrated that RAFT1 is a substrate of c-Ablin vitro (Fig. 4 A). To confirm tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFT1 in vitro, kinase reactions were also performed in the presence of cold ATP, and the products were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. The results demonstrate c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFT1 (Fig. 4 B). To assess phosphorylation of RAFT1 in vivo, 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with HA-RAFT1 D2357E and kinase-active c-Abl or the dominant negative c-Abl (K-R) (42.Sawyers C.L. McLaughlin J. Goga A. Havilik M. Witte O. Cell. 1994; 77: 121-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. The results demonstrate that coexpression with kinase-active c-Abl, and not c-Abl (K-R), results in tyrosine phosphorylation of HA-RAFT1 D2357E on tyrosine (Fig. 4 C). Taken together, these results support c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of RAFT1. The functional significance of the c-Abl-RAFT1 interaction was further determined by assessing RAFT1 activity in the presence of c-Abl. Anti-HA immunoprecipitates from 293T cells transiently transfected with HA-RAFT1 were incubated with or without purified recombinant c-Abl in the presence of cold ATP. As a control, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the RAFT1 D2357E mutant. Following incubation with c-Abl for 30 min, the complexes were washed under stringent conditions to remove ATP and c-Abl. Phosphorylated RAFT1 was then incubated in a kinase reaction containing [γ-32P]ATP and a GST fusion protein derived from amino acids 332–415 of p70S6k that contains the RAFT1 phosphorylation site, Thr-389 (25.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). To avoid phosphorylation of GST-p70S6k (332–415) by residual c-Abl, the Tyr-336 and Tyr-390 sites in GST-p70S6k (332–415) were mutated to alanine (Tyr-Ala). The results demonstrate that preincubation of RAFT1 with kinase-active c-Abl inhibits autophosphorylation of RAFT1 (Fig.5 A). The results also demonstrate that c-Abl inhibits RAFT1-mediated phosphorylation of GST-p70S6k (332–415; Tyr-Ala) (Fig.5 B). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that c-Abl inhibits RAFT1 activity. Translation of cap-dependent mRNAs is inhibited by binding of unphosphorylated 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (27.Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 43.Sonenberg N. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Abl regulates cap-dependent translation, we transfected early passage embryo fibroblasts obtained from Abl−/− mice with the construct, pcDNA3-LUC-pol-CAT, that exhibits cap-dependent translation of luciferase (LUC) (44.Craig A.W.B.

The generation and proper maintenance of DNA methylation patterns are essential for embryonic development, as demonstrated by the lethal phenotypes of mice with either a targeted disruption ofDnmt1, the gene responsible for the maintenance of DNA methylation, or targeted disruption of Dnmt3a orDnmt3b, the genes involved in generation of newly formed methylation patterns. Recently, a novel mRNA, Dnmt1b, resulting from alternative splicing of Dnmt1 was identified (Hsu, D. W., Lin, M. J., Lee, T. L., Wen, S. C., Chen, X., and Shen, C. K., (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 9751–9756). The abundance of Dnmt1b mRNA was estimated by semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and was suggested to encode a major C-5 DNA methyltransferase isoform. Here we report characterization of this novel DNA methyltransferase transcript, Dnmt1b, and its protein product in human cell lines and in freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The abundance of Dnmt1b transcript, as determined by quantitative RNase protection analysis, was determined to range from 6% to 25% of Dnmt1 in human cells. Second generation antisense inhibitors targeted to the 5′- and 3′-ends of Dnmt1 inhibited the accumulation of both Dnmt1 and Dnmt1b in cells. Dnmt1b protein purified from a baculovirus expression system was demonstrated to be a functional DNA methyltransferase, and to have Michaelis constants for both DNA andS-adenosyl-l-methionine similar to baculovirus-expressed Dnmt1. However, antibodies raised against Dnmt1b epitopes demonstrated that Dnmt1b protein was present at approximately 2–5% of the level of Dnmt1 and therefore represents only a minor DNA methyltransferase isoform in human cells. Tissue- and gene-specific patterns of cytosine-DNA methylation are characteristic features of vertebrate genomes.

DNA methylation patterns correlate inversely with gene expression (1.Yeivin A. Razin A. EXS. 1993; 64: 523-568PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, DNA methylation has been suggested to be an epigenetic determinant of gene expression. DNA methylation has been correlated with several other cellular processes, including chromatin structuring (2.Keshet I. Lieman-Hurwitz J. Cedar H.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The enzyme DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase (DNA MeTase)1 catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to the 5′-position of cytosines residing in the dinucleotide sequence CpG (8.Adams R.L. McKay E.L. Craig L.M. Burdon R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 561: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus far three DNA MeTases have been identified in somatic tissues of vertebrates. Dnmt1 is the most abundant DNA MeTase in mammalian cells (9.Yoder J.A. Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Dnmt1 preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA as its substrate and therefore is believed to be primarily responsible for maintaining methylation patterns established in development (10.Glickman F.J. Flynn J. Reich N.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The recently identified DNA MeTase enzymes, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, have been suggested to encode the long sought de novo methylation activities responsible for methylating previously unmethylated DNA, to generate new patterns of DNA methylation (11.Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar).DNA methylation patterns are highly plastic throughout development and involve both global demethylation and de novo methylation events (see Ref. 12.Razin A. Cedar H. EXS. 1993; 64: 343-357PubMed Google Scholar for review).Genetic experiments have demonstrated that proper regulation of DNA methylation is essential for normal mammalian development. Mice homozygous for the targeted disruption of Dnmt1 (Dnmt1−/−mice) fail to maintain established DNA methylation patterns and do not survive past mid gestation (13.Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3181) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Dnmt3b−/−genotype produces embryo lethality in mice, whereas Dnmt3a−/− mice develop to term but become runted and die at approximately 4 weeks of age (14.Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4404) Google Scholar).In addition to the role the DNA methylation plays in development, it is also implicated in tumorigenesis (see Ref. 15.Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar for review). Abnormal methylation patterns are observed in malignant cells and may contribute to tumorigenesis by improper silencing of tumor suppressor genes or growth-regulatory genes (16.Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Vertino P.M. Issa J.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 141-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated levels of Dnmt1 mRNA and DNA MeTase activity have been observed in many cancer cells in vitro (17.Kautiainen T.L. Jones P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1594-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tumors in vivo (18.el-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.W. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 1996; 93: 4045-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Activation of the oncogenic ras signal transduction pathway has been shown to induce Dnmt1 expression (20.MacLeod R.A. Rouleau J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11327-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 21.Rouleau J. MacLeod R.A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, elevated Dnmt1 levels are required to maintain the phenotype of theseras-transformed cells, suggesting that Dnmt1 is an important downstream target of these pathways (22.MacLeod R.A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This is supported by the finding that increased Dnmt1 levels are required to maintain the phenotype of fibroblasts transformed with the fos oncogene (23.Bakin A.V. Curran T. Science. 1999; 283: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Significant overexpression of Dnmt3b has also recently been demonstrated in human tumors suggesting that deregulation of enzymes modulating distinct aspects of DNA methylation may lead to tumorigenesis (11.Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar).The DNA MeTase enzymes, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b are encoded by independent genes (24.Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M. Li Y. He W.W. Okumura K. Li E. Gene. 1999; 236: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Diversity of mammalian DNA MeTases has been shown to result from alternative translation initiation in the case of the murine Dnmt1 (25.Gaudet F. Talbot D. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32725-32729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additional DNA MeTase diversity has been suggested to arise from alternative splicing of the Dnmt1 mRNA. Dnmt1 mRNA splice variants have been observed in rat (26.Deng J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22869-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and more recently in human cells (27.Hsu D.W. Lin M.J. Lee T.L. Wen S.C. Chen X. Shen C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9751-9756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of human theDnmt1 gene could potentially produce a large number of DNA MeTase protein isoforms because it is composed of at least 40 exons and 39 introns spanning 60 kilobases (kb) (28.Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Dnmt1 catalytic domain alone is composed of 11 exons (28.Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that alternative splicing in this region could generate DNA MeTase isoforms with altered sequence specificity (26.Deng J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22869-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, in both cases that reported alternative splicing of the Dnmt1 gene, characterization of the splice variants was limited to the RNA level and as such the existence of Dnmt1 protein isoforms has not been demonstrated.During the course of determining Dnmt1 levels in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we documented the presence of a splice variant of the primary Dnmt1 transcript. The existence of this splice variant in human cells has since been reported by another group (27.Hsu D.W. Lin M.J. Lee T.L. Wen S.C. Chen X. Shen C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9751-9756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Here we report the quantification of this novel Dnmt1b transcript in human cells as determined by RNase protection analysis (RPA), the characterization of kinetic properties and substrate specificities of the baculovirus-expressed Dnmt1b protein, the sensitivity of this transcript to antisense inhibitors targeting the 5′- and 3′-positions of the primary Dnmt1 transcript, and the quantification of Dnmt1b protein levels in human cells. The data presented in this study demonstrate that Dnmt1b represents a fairly abundant Dnmt1 splice variant at the mRNA level yet encodes a DNA MeTase protein isoform that represents a minor component of cellular DNA MeTase activity. In mammals, modification of the 5′-position of cytosine by methylation is the only known naturally occurring covalent modification of the genome.

Chem. 1986; 261: 1594-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tumors in vivo (18.el-Deiry W.S. Nelkin B.D. Celano P. Yen R.W. Falco J.P. Hamilton S.R. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1595-1601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, elevated Dnmt1 levels are required to maintain the phenotype of theseras-transformed cells, suggesting that Dnmt1 is an important downstream target of these pathways (22.MacLeod R.A. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8037-8043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This is supported by the finding that increased Dnmt1 levels are required to maintain the phenotype of fibroblasts transformed with the fos oncogene (23.Bakin A.V. Curran T. Science. 1999; 283: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Significant overexpression of Dnmt3b has also recently been demonstrated in human tumors suggesting that deregulation of enzymes modulating distinct aspects of DNA methylation may lead to tumorigenesis (11.Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The DNA MeTase enzymes, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b are encoded by independent genes (24.Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M. Li Y. He W.W. Okumura K. Li E. Gene. 1999; 236: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Diversity of mammalian DNA MeTases has been shown to result from alternative translation initiation in the case of the murine Dnmt1 (25.Gaudet F. Talbot D. Leonhardt H. Jaenisch R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32725-32729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additional DNA MeTase diversity has been suggested to arise from alternative splicing of the Dnmt1 mRNA. Dnmt1 mRNA splice variants have been observed in rat (26.Deng J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22869-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and more recently in human cells (27.Hsu D.W. Lin M.J. Lee T.L. Wen S.C. Chen X. Shen C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9751-9756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of human theDnmt1 gene could potentially produce a large number of DNA MeTase protein isoforms because it is composed of at least 40 exons and 39 introns spanning 60 kilobases (kb) (28.Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Dnmt1 catalytic domain alone is composed of 11 exons (28.Bigey P. Szyf M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that alternative splicing in this region could generate DNA MeTase isoforms with altered sequence specificity (26.Deng J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22869-22872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, in both cases that reported alternative splicing of the Dnmt1 gene, characterization of the splice variants was limited to the RNA level and as such the existence of Dnmt1 protein isoforms has not been demonstrated. During the course of determining Dnmt1 levels in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we documented the presence of a splice variant of the primary Dnmt1 transcript. The existence of this splice variant in human cells has since been reported by another group (27.Hsu D.W. Lin M.J. Lee T.L. Wen S.C. Chen X. Shen C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9751-9756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we report the quantification of this novel Dnmt1b transcript in human cells as determined by RNase protection analysis (RPA), the characterization of kinetic properties and substrate specificities of the baculovirus-expressed Dnmt1b protein, the sensitivity of this transcript to antisense inhibitors targeting the 5′- and 3′-positions of the primary Dnmt1 transcript, and the quantification of Dnmt1b protein levels in human cells. The data presented in this study demonstrate that Dnmt1b represents a fairly abundant Dnmt1 splice variant at the mRNA level yet encodes a DNA MeTase protein isoform that represents a minor component of cellular DNA MeTase activity.

https://openalex.org/W1516157468,"We have previously shown that the peptidomimetic farnesyltransferase inhibitor L-744,832 (FTI) inhibits p70s6k activation and cell growth in a mouse keratinocyte cell line but only at concentrations of FTI significantly higher than those required for the inhibition of Ras farnesylation. Here we show that the rapid kinetics of FTI inhibition of DNA synthesis (within 1.5 h) in both normal and v-K-Ras transformed keratinocytes matches the rapid kinetics of p70s6k inhibition observed previously. It is further shown that FTI inhibits p70s6k activation in response to serum, phorbol myristate acetate, and increased amino acid levels. The phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A partially reverses the FTI-induced dephosphorylation of p70s6k, suggesting that FTI may act upstream of a protein phosphatase. A rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70s6k is shown to be resistant to FTI-induced dephosphorylation of the major rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation site of p70s6k, Thr389. Together, these data demonstrate that FTI rapidly inhibits DNA synthesis irrespective of the presence of v-K-Ras and that FTI inhibits p70s6k activation in response to multiple stimuli. Because the FTI L-744,832 mimics many of the effects of rapamycin, this FTI may prove effective against tumors that exhibit inappropriate activation of the mTOR/p70s6k pathway. We have previously shown that the peptidomimetic farnesyltransferase inhibitor L-744,832 (FTI) inhibits p70s6k activation and cell growth in a mouse keratinocyte cell line but only at concentrations of FTI significantly higher than those required for the inhibition of Ras farnesylation.

Because Ras proteins are farnesylated and require prenylation for biological activity, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs)1 were developed to inhibit Ras function and inhibit tumor progression driven by oncogenic Ras. More recently, K-Ras (oncogenic-Kirsten-Ras) and N-Ras were shown to be geranylgeranylated in the presence of FTIs (3.Rowell C.A. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. J. Biol.

Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Ras isoforms may not be the relevant target(s) of FTIs but that FTIs may act through other farnesylated proteins or through a farnesylation-independent mechanism to inhibit cell growth. We have previously shown that the peptidomimetic FTI L-744,832, induces tumor regression associated with a G1 cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis in transgenic mice (6.Norgaard P. Law B. Joseph H. Page D.L. Shyr Y. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Kohl N.E. Oliff A. Coffey Jr., R.J. Poulsen H.S. Moses H.L. Clin Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 35-42PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor regression was associated with p70s6k dephosphorylation. In a mouse keratinocyte cell line (Balb-MK) inhibition of DNA synthesis by FTI correlated closely with p70s6k inhibition, and FTI was shown to inhibit p70s6k activity as early as 15 min (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Poulsen H.S. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4743-4748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, FTI did not affect Erk1/2 activity, even though Erk1/2 activity is completely dependent on Ras function in these cells. These observations indicated that Ras is not the only target of FTI. It has been suggested that farnesylated proteins other than Ras may be important targets for FTI (8.Du W. Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1831-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 9.Oliff A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1423: C19-C30PubMed Google Scholar). Although this is likely, such a mechanism cannot explain the rapid inhibition of p70s6k by FTI. To be consistent with the rapid time course, the putative farnesylated target would have to exhibit a very short half-life. The rapid time course observed may indicate that FTI acts by farnesylation-independent as well as farnesylation-dependent mechanisms. The observations that FTI concentrations higher than those required to completely inhibit Ha-Ras farnesylation are necessary to inhibit the growth of cells in culture (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Poulsen H.S. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4743-4748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also suggests a farnesylation-independent FTI target. Regardless of the identity of the FTI target involved in p70s6k inhibition, blockade of this pathway correlates closely with tumor regression in transgenic mice and with growth inhibition in cell culture. p70s6k is situated downstream of the evolutionarily conserved kinase mTOR (mammalian target ofrapamycin) in mammalian cells. mTOR regulates protein synthesis and cell cycle progression (10.Sabatini D.M.

Rapamycin acts by binding its intracellular receptor FKBP12 to form an inhibitory complex that then binds and inactivates mTOR. Recently, the mTOR/p70s6k pathway was shown to be inappropriately activated in several tumor cell lines (15.Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3895-3897PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Grewe M. Gansauge F. Schmid R.M. Adler G. Seufferlein T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3581-3587PubMed Google Scholar) and activated in response to the Gli oncogene (17.Louro I.D. McKie-Bell P. Gosnell H. Brindley B.C. Bucy R.P. Ruppert J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 503-516PubMed Google Scholar), implicating the mTOR pathway as a potential target for anti-cancer drugs. To further clarify the mechanism(s) by which FTI inhibits mitogen-dependent cell growth we have examined the kinetics and Ras dependence of DNA synthesis inhibition by FTI and investigated the possible involvement of the mTOR pathway and protein phosphatases in the FTI-induced inhibition of p70s6k. The results of these studies demonstrate that FTI rapidly inhibits DNA synthesis irrespective of the presence of v-K-Ras and that FTI inhibits p70s6k activation in response to multiple stimuli. We also present evidence using a rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70s6k and the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A that FTI and rapamycin actions are consistent with the involvement of a protein phosphatase. Balb-MK cells were grown as described previously (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Poulsen H.S. Moses H.L. J. Biol.

For amino acid deprivation, Balb-MK cells were incubated overnight in minimum essential medium containing 5 mg/ml calcium chloride and lacking l-cysteine,l-isoleucine, l-leucine, andl-tryptophan. For amino acid stimulation, cells were treated for 30 min with the same minimum essential medium containing the complete complement of amino acids. For stimulation by growth factors, Balb-MK cells were treated with 8% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 4 ng/ml EGF in minimum essential medium for 15 min. Cos1 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For [3H]thymidine incorporation assays Balb-MK or KC cells were plated at 20,000 cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated as described in the figures and pulsed for 1 h with [3H]thymidine. Results were quantitated as described previously (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Poulsen H.S.

The compounds calyculin A, PD98059, and SB202190 were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals, New England Biolabs, and Calbiochem, respectively. LY294002, ionomycin, wortmannin, and PMA were obtained from Sigma. FTI was obtained as a gift from Merck. A plasmid encoding hemagglutinin antigen-tagged p85s6k was kindly provided by Joseph Avruch (Harvard Medical School). FLAG-tagged wild type p85s6k and a FLAG-tagged p85s6k mutant in which 30 amino acid residues were truncated from the N terminus (7 residues truncated from the corresponding p70s6k sequence) and 101 amino acid residues were deleted from the C terminus (ΔNT/ΔCT) were amplified from the plasmid encoding hemagglutinin antigen-p85s6k using polymerase chain reaction with the primer sets: 5′-TTTTGGATCCATGGACTATAAGGACGATGATGACAAAAGGCGACGACGGAGGCGG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGAATTCTCATAGATTCATACGCAGGTG-3′, and 5′-TTTTGGATCCATGGACTATAAGGACGATGATGACAAAGACCTGGACCAGCCAGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGAATTCTCATTCTTTCACACTTTCAAG-3′, respectively. Underlined por-tions represent regions complementary to the plasmid template. Polymerase chain reaction was performed using Pfu polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reaction products were restricted with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). Both inserts were verified to be correct by DNA sequencing. Cos1 cells were transfected in 100-mm dishes with 2 μg/plate of wild type FLAG-p85s6k or 3 μg/plate of ΔNT/ΔCT p70s6k using 2.5 μl of Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/μg of DNA. Cell lysis, protein quantitation, and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Poulsen H.S. Moses H.L. J. Biol.

FLAG-tagged proteins were detected on immunoblots using the M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Kinase assays were performed as described previously (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B.

The results of kinase assays were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantitated using ImageQuant software. FTI rapidly inhibits p70s6k (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Poulsen H.S. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4743-4748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and p70s6k is thought to play a role in G1 cell cycle progression (18.Lane H. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 19.McIlroy J. Chen D. Wjasow C. Michaeli T. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell.

J. 1998; 335: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). If FTI inhibits cell growth by inhibiting the p70s6k pathway, then FTI might also rapidly inhibit cell cycle progression. As shown in Fig. 1, a 30-min pretreatment of Balb-MK cells with FTI inhibited DNA synthesis by over 60%, consistent with a role for the inhibition of the p70s6k pathway in FTI action. Similar analyses of the effect of FTI on cell proliferation were carried out on KC cells. KC cells (21.Weissman B.E. Aaronson S.A. Cell. 1983; 32: 599-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) display constitutively high levels of active Erk1/2 compared with the parental Balb-MK cells, and this high level of Erk1/2 activity is not altered by FTI (data not shown). This is consistent with our earlier observations that Erk1/2 is insensitive to FTI in the parental Balb-MK cells. As shown in Fig. 1, FTI inhibited DNA synthesis in KC cells and Balb-MK cells to approximately the same extent. Because oncogenic K-Ras is geranylgeranylated and retains its biological activity in the presence of FTIs (3.Rowell C.A. Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. Garcia A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14093-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 4.Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), these data further support the hypothesis that Ras is not a relevant target in rapid FTI-induced growth arrest. To our knowledge the regulation of p70s6k activity in keratinocytes by various stimuli has not been reported. Thus, we tested the ability of several agents to activate p70s6k in Balb-MK cells. EGF, IGF-I, and PMA were able to activate p70s6k in Balb-MK cells (Fig.2). Ionomycin, however, did not appreciably activate p70s6k, although ionomycin activates p70s6k in mouse fibroblasts (22.Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Activation of p70s6k by EGF and IGF-I was associated with a shift in electrophoretic mobility and increased phosphorylation of Thr389. Thr389 is the major rapamycin-sensitive site on p70s6k, and phosphorylation of this site is required for catalytic activity (23.Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). PMA, like EGF and IGF-I, activated p70s6k, induced a shift in electrophoretic mobility, and increased phosphorylation of Thr389 as determined by staining with a Thr(P)389-specific antibody (Fig. 2). IGF-I induced PKB phosphorylation on Ser473, an event required for catalytic activity, but did not induce Erk1/2 phosphorylation on sites required for activity. In contrast, PMA induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation but not PKB phosphorylation. The data indicate that p70s6k, PKB, and Erk1/2 are each differentially regulated in mouse keratinocytes. Growth factors and PMA activate p70s6k by distinct mechanisms that are, respectively, sensitive and insensitive to wortmannin (24.Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Activation of p70s6k by serum in Balb-MK cells was blocked by inhibition of PI 3-kinase with wortmannin (Fig.3 A) but not by down-regulation of classical and novel protein kinase C isoforms by chronic PMA pretreatment (Fig. 2). In contrast, PMA-induced activation of p70s6k was inhibited by chronic PMA treatment but not by wortmannin. These data indicate that in mouse keratinocytes serum and PMA activate p70s6k by different mechanisms. As we have shown previously (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Poulsen H.S. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4743-4748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), expression of the N17 dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras in Balb-MK cells is able to partially inhibit p70s6k activation in response to serum and EGF while completely abolishing Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, N17-Ha-Ras expression did not inhibit PMA-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation as reported by others (25.Chiloeches A. Paterson H.F. Marais R. Clerk A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19762-19770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 26.Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) but still partially inhibited p70s6k activation (Fig.2). This observation suggests that the requirements of p70s6k and Erk1/2 for Ras activity are fundamentally different. Because serum and PMA activate p70s6k through distinct mechanisms, we examined whether FTI could inhibit p70s6k activation by both serum and PMA. As shown in Fig. 3 A (top panel), FTI inhibited p70s6k activation by both serum and PMA to levels similar to that observed in unstimulated cells. FTI inhibition of p70s6k activation by both stimuli was associated with a decrease in phosphorylation of Thr389 (Fig. 3 A, second panel) and a loss of the slowly migrating hyperphosphorylated forms of p70s6k (Fig. 3 A, third panel). We also observed FTI inhibition of p70s6k activation by amino acids (Fig.3 B). Studies performed in a number of laboratories indicate that amino acids stimulate p70s6k through the regulation of mTOR activity (28.Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1092-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29.Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28178-28184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Together, our data raise the possibility that FTI may act on the mTOR pathway to inhibit p70s6k activation by multiple stimuli. p70s6k becomes phosphorylated on multiple proline-directed phosphorylation sites during activation, and MAP kinases, such as p38, can phosphorylate such sites. Therefore, we tested the ability of the p38 inhibitor SB202190 to inhibit p70s6k activation. Although SB202190 had no effect on p70s6k activation, electrophoretic mobility, or Thr389 phosphorylation in response to serum stimulation, it markedly increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation on sites required for catalytic activity (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, SB202190 induced “hyperactivation” of p70s6k stimulation by PMA, which was associated with a marked decrease in p70s6k electrophoretic mobility and increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation. This hyperactivation of p70s6k and increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation likely relates to studies in which SB203580 was shown to activate Raf (31.Hall-Jackson C.A. Goedert M. Hedge P. Cohen P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2047-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and SB202190 was shown to activate Erk1/2 (32.Singh R.P. Dhawan P. Golden C. Kapoor G.S. Mehta K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19593-19600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) presumably by blocking an inhibitory pathway involving p38. Because oncogenic Raf induces p70s6k activation (33.Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and Raf is activated by PMA (34.Sozeri O. Vollmer K. Liyanage M. Frith D. Kour G. Mark G.E.D. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2259-2262PubMed Google Scholar), the increased PMA-induced activation of p70s6k in the presence of SB202190 likely resulted from an increased activation of Raf that led to increased p70s6k and Erk1/2 activation. The difference in the effect of SB202190 on PMA and serum-induced p70s6k activation suggests that Erk1/2 and p70s6k share a common upstream activator during PMA stimulation but are regulated by different upstream signaling elements during serum stimulation. To more fully explore the specificity and mechanisms of action of FTI on the p70s6k pathway, we examined the effect of FTI on wild type p85s6k and on a rapamycin-insensitive deletion mutant of p70s6k termed ΔNT/ΔCT. P85s6k is a variant of p70s6k expressed from the same gene but containing an additional 23 amino acids at the N terminus. P85s6k activity is required for cell proliferation (35.Reinhard C. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), but p85s6k is expressed at much lower levels than p70s6k. The ΔNT/ΔCT deletion mutant is similar to previously characterized mutants (36.Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37.Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 38.Mahalingam M. Templeton D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and was prepared by deleting the 30 N-terminal and the 101 C-terminal residues of p85s6k. To examine the effect of FTI on p85s6k and ΔNT/ΔCT, FLAG-tagged p85s6k or FLAG-tagged ΔNT/ΔCT was expressed in Cos1 cells. The cells were treated with FTI, stimulated with serum, and analyzed for the phosphorylation level of the rapamycin-sensitive site Thr389 using a phospho-specific antibody or analyzed for the level of protein expression using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.4, top and bottom panels, respectively). FTI decreased the level of Thr389 phosphorylation of p85s6k but did not affect the level of Thr389 phosphorylation of the ΔNT/ΔCT mutant. Treatment with rapamycin, like FTI, induced dephosphorylation of p85s6k at Thr389 but did not affect the level of Thr389 phosphorylation of the ΔNT/ΔCT mutant. We next investigated the dependence of Thr389phosphorylation of p85s6k and ΔNT/ΔCT on the PI 3-kinase pathway using the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. PI 3-kinase inhibition abolished the phosphorylation of both p85s6k and ΔNT/ΔCT on Thr389, indicating that neither FTI nor rapamycin act through effects on the PI 3-kinase pathway. Because these results are more consistent with FTI and rapamycin activating a Thr389phosphatase than inhibiting a Thr389 kinase, we investigated the ability of the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A to antagonize the FTI and rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of Thr389. As shown in Fig. 4, 10 nm calyculin A was able to partially reverse FTI and rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of p85s6k at Thr389. Higher concentrations of calyculin A in combination with FTI were cytotoxic in Cos1 cells, precluding their use. Because calyculin A inhibited FTI and rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation at Thr389 of p85s6k overexpressed in Cos1 cells, we sought to determine whether calyculin A also inhibited FTI and rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of endogenous p70s6k. As shown in Fig.5 (second panel), calyculin A alone induced a marked decrease in p70s6k electrophoretic mobility relative to untreated cells, whereas FTI induced a substantial increase in electrophoretic mobility relative to untreated cells. In combination with FTI, calyculin A treatment antagonized the ability of FTI to induce p70s6k dephosphorylation. Similar results were observed with the combination of rapamycin and calyculin A treatments. We also analyzed the effect of the various treatments on the degree of Thr389 phosphorylation using phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 5, top panel). NIH Image 1.62 was used to estimate the relative staining intensities in the various lanes. Calyculin A treatment alone increased Thr389 phosphorylation by about 12% over control. Rapamycin nearly abolished Thr389staining, whereas calyculin A co-treatment was able to restore about 18% of the control Thr(P)389 staining. Calyculin A in combination with FTI increased Thr(P)389 staining about 3-fold over that observed with FTI alone. The partial inhibition of FTI-induced dephoshorylation by calyculin A resulted from effects on both total p70s6k levels and from effects on p70s6k phosphorylation. The high concentrations of FTI required to induce more complete p70s6k dephosphorylation (>60 μm) caused some down-regulation of total p70s6k protein without having a noticeable effect on the levels of Erk1/2 or other proteins. Calyculin A was able to partially reverse the observed p70s6k down-regulation. Out of a total of six experiments, calyculin A in combination with FTI produced consistently greater Thr(P)389 staining than FTI treatment alone. Calyculin A-induced reversal of FTI effects on endogenous p70s6k resulted from a combination of the reversal of p70s6k down-regulation (Fig. 5, second panel) and a reversal of FTI-induced dephosphorylation (Fig. 4, top panel). Importantly, neither FTI nor rapamycin were able to reverse the marked p70s6k mobility shift induced by calyculin A, presumably indicating that calyculin A has a dominant effect on total levels of p70s6k phosphorylation when combined with FTI or rapamycin treatments. Calyculin A-induced hyperphosphorylation of p70s6k showed some selectivity. In the six experiments performed, calyculin A had little effect on Erk1/2 phosphorylation in three experiments (as in Fig. 5,third panel) and decreased Erk1/2 phosphorylation in the other three experiments. Together, the results in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that the inhibitory effects of both FTI and rapamycin on p70s6k may be mediated by a calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatase. These results are supported by recent reports in which calyculin A partially reversed rapamycin-induced p70s6k inhibition (39.Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and reversed rapamycin and osmotic shock induced p70s6k inactivation and dephosphorylation (40.Parrott L.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4743-4748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although FTIs were originally designed to inhibit Ras-dependent tumors by blocking the farnesylation of Ras, it is now apparent that other targets are necessary to explain the growth inhibitory properties of FTI. Previously we showed that the p70s6k pathway represents a novel target of FTI and that FTI inhibits p70s6k activity as early as 15 min. Here we show that FTI also rapidly inhibits DNA synthesis, suggesting a possible link between the rapid inhibition of p70s6k and the rapid inhibition of cell proliferation. Because farnesylation is irreversible, the effect of an FTI would only become apparent after a substantial portion of the target farnesylated protein has been turned over. Thus, the rapid effect of FTI on DNA synthesis and p70s6k argue for the existence of an FTI target that is unrelated to protein farnesylation. Peptidomimetic FTIs are effective in the treatment of cancers in animal models, and several pharmaceutical companies have FTIs in clinical trials (46.Barinaga M. Science. 1997; 278: 1036-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the FTI L-744,832 may act, in part, by inhibiting the p70s6k pathway. The p70s6k pathway is inappropriately up-regulated in tumor cells such as the MiaPaCa-2 cell line (16.Grewe M. Gansauge F. Schmid R.M. Adler G. Seufferlein T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3581-3587PubMed Google Scholar) and small cell lung cancer cell lines (15.Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3895-3897PubMed Google Scholar). The mTOR/p70s6k pathway is also activated by the Gli oncogene (17.Louro I.D. McKie-Bell P. Gosnell H. Brindley B.C. Bucy R.P. Ruppert J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 503-516PubMed Google Scholar) and the E1A viral oncoprotein (47.de Groot R.P. Schouten G.J. de Wit L. Ballou L.M. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to elucidate the precise mechanism of action of FTIs as a class of compounds. Our contention that inhibition of the p70s6k pathway is important in the anti-cancer properties of FTI is further supported by studies demonstrating that agents that inhibit the mTOR/p70s6k pathway, such as rapamycin (15.Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3895-3897PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Grewe M. Gansauge F. Schmid R.M. Adler G. Seufferlein T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3581-3587PubMed Google Scholar) and asparaginase (28.Iiboshi Y. Papst P.J. Kawasome H. Hosoi H. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Terada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1092-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), potently inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo, respectively. To more fully understand the mechanisms of action of FTI, we compared its properties with those of the well known inhibitor of the mTOR/p70s6k pathway, rapamycin. Like rapamycin, FTI inhibits p70s6k in response to serum, PMA, and increased amino acid levels, which activate p70s6k by distinct mechanisms. Another similarity between FTI and rapamycin is that both induce dephosphorylation of Thr389in wild type p85s6k but fail to inhibit Thr389dephsophorylation of rapamycin-insensitive p70s6k deletion mutants. In the analysis of a p70s6k deletion mutant similar to the one described here, Thr389 was shown to remain phosphorylated in the presence of rapamycin, although Thr389 was shown to be dephosphorylated in response to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (48.Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Dennis et al. hypothesize that the kinase that phosphorylates Thr389 is still active in the presence of rapamycin, suggesting that rapamycin may activate a phosphatase that dephosphorylates Thr389. Recent reports showing that wild type p70s6k binds protein phosphatase 2A (39.Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 49.Westphal R.S. Coffee Jr., R.L. Marotta A. Pelech S.L. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 687-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), a rapamycin-insensitive deletion mutant does not bind protein phosphatase 2A and that rapamycin activates a PHAS-1 (phosphorylatedheat and acid stable protein1) phosphatase (39.Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) support this hypothesis. Our results with the ΔNT/ΔCT mutant and the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A are consistent with FTI acting through the regulation of a protein phosphatase situated in the mTOR pathway rather than on the stimulatory pathways initiated by serum or PMA (Fig.6). Other possible explanations for the effect of FTI on p70s6k exist, however. For example, FTI might inhibit an as yet unknown pathway that is required for p70s6k activation. Although we still do not know precisely how FTI inhibits p70s6k activity, our results presented here and elsewhere (7.Law B.K. Norgaard P. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Poulsen H.S. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4743-4748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) demonstrate that FTI mimics the effect of rapamycin in: (a) its ability to induce p70s6k and PHAS-1 dephosphorylation, (b) p70s6k inactivation, (c) inhibition of p70s6k in response to distinct stimuli, (d) insensitivity of a rapamycin insensitive mutant, (e) partial reversal of p70s6k dephosphorylation by calyculin A treatment, and, most importantly, (f) inhibition of the growth of cells in culture. The elucidation of the exact target and mechanism of FTI-induced growth arrest will allow the development of a new generation of mechanism based anti-cancer drugs.

We hypothesized that peroxynitrite may regulate cytokine function during inflammation. To test this hypothesis, the neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) of interleukin-8 (IL-8) incubated with peroxynitrite was evaluated. Peroxynitrite attenuated IL-8 NCA in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01) but did not significantly reduce NCA induced by leukotriene B4 or complement-activated serum. The reducing agents, dithionite, deferoxamine, and dithiothreitol, reversed and exogenous l-tyrosine abrogated the peroxynitrite-induced NCA inhibition. Papa-NONOate [N-(3-ammoniopropyl)-N-(n-propyl)amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-dialase or sodium nitroprusside, NO donors, or a combination of xanthine and xanthine oxidase to generate superoxide did not show an inhibitory effect on NCA induced by IL-8. In contrast, small amounts of SIN-1, a peroxynitrite generator, caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of NCA by IL-8. Consistent with its capacity to reduce NCA, peroxynitrite treatment reduced IL-8 binding to neutrophils. Nitrotyrosine was detected in the IL-8 incubated with peroxynitrite by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These findings are consistent with nitration of tyrosine by peroxynitrite with subsequent inhibition of IL-8 binding to neutrophils and a reduction in NCA and suggest that oxidants may play an important role in regulation of IL-8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis.

Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). Current concepts suggest an important role for IL-8 in the pathogenesis of neutrophil-mediated inflammation because of the potent neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) of IL-8 and its detection in affected tissues or body fluids taken from patients suffering from neutrophilic inflammatory lesions (3.Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2270) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite is produced by the rapid reaction of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (4.Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar, 5.Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in oxidative reactions, peroxynitrite also nitrates free or protein-associated tyrosine to form the stable product nitrotyrosine by addition of a nitro group to the 3-position adjacent to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine (6.Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that peroxynitrite-induced protein nitration may compromise protein function. For example, nitration of tyrosine residues on human IgG abrogates C1q binding (7.McCall M.N. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and inhibits protein phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase (8.Gow A.J. Duran D. Malcolm S. Ischiropoulos H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Recently, the tyrosine residue at position 13 of IL-8 has been shown to be important in neutrophil chemotaxis (9.Schraufstatter I.U. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Barritt D.S. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10428-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We hypothesized peroxynitrite might regulate NCA by nitrating tyrosine residues. To test this hypothesis, the chemotactic responses of human neutrophils to IL-8 incubated with peroxynitrite and other compounds were evaluatedin vitro. We found that peroxynitrite and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a donor of peroxynitrite, significantly attenuated IL-8-induced NCA. In contrast activated serum and LTB4-induced NCA was not inhibited by peroxynitrite significantly. These data suggest that peroxynitrite plays an important role in regulating NCA during inflammation. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated from venous blood as described previously (10.Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 97: 77-89Google Scholar, 11.Harvath L. Falk W. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 37: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 ml of venous blood was obtained from healthy volunteers and then sedimented with 3% dextran in isotonic saline for 45 min to separate white blood cells from red blood cells. The leukocyte-rich upper layer was collected, and neutrophils were separated from mononuclear cells by Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation (Histopaque 1077, Sigma). Contaminating red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis (0.1% KHCO3 and 0.83% NH4Cl). The suspension was then centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min and washed three times in HBSS (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). The resulting cell pellet, as determined by trypan blue and erythrosin exclusion, consisted of >96% neutrophils and >98% viable cells. The cells were suspended in Gey's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 3 × 106 cells/ml. NCA was assayed in 48-well microchemotaxis chambers (Neuroprobe, Inc., Cabin John, MD) as described previously (11.Harvath L. Falk W. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 37: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The bottom wells of the chamber were filled with 25 μl of the chemotactic stimulus or media in duplicate. A 10-μm thick polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with 3-μm pores was placed over the samples. The silicon gasket and the upper pieces of the chamber were applied, and 50 μl of the cell suspension was placed into the upper wells. The chambers were incubated in humidified air in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 30 min. Non-migrated cells were wiped away from the filter. The filter was immersed in methanol for 5 min, stained with a modified Wright's stain, and mounted on a glass slide. Cells that had completely migrated through the filter were counted using light microscopy. NCA was expressed as the mean number of migrated cells per high power field from duplicate wells. Peroxynitrite was evaluated for its capacity to modulate IL-8-induced NCA in vitro. Human recombinant IL-8 (R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with each concentration of peroxynitrite (Calbiochem) before the NCA assay. In control experiments, IL-8 was incubated with medium alone. The capacity of peroxynitrite to modulate LTB4 and activated serum-induced NCA was evaluated for comparison with IL-8. LTB4 (10−6m, Sigma) or complement-activated serum (12.Snyderman R. Gewurz H. Mergenhagen S.E. J. Exp. Med. 1968; 128: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (1:10 dilution) was incubated with peroxynitrite (10−3m) for 2 h at 37 °C before performing the NCA assay. The 2-h time point was chosen to ensure that all residual peroxynitrite had spontaneously decomposed prior to the chemotaxis assay. To evaluate the effects of NO to modulate IL-8 induced NCA, we utilized sodium nitroprusside or papa-NONOate (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA) as a NO donor (13.Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Christodoulou D.

IL-8 (10−7 g/ml) was incubated with sodium nitroprusside (10−3, 10−4, 10−5, 10−6m) or papa-NONOate (10−3, 10−4, 10−5, and 10−6m) for 2 h at 37 °C before performing the NCA assay. To evaluate the effect of superoxide on IL-8-induced NCA, xanthine (10−6, 10−5, 10−4, and 10−3m Sigma) and xanthine oxidase (3.4 × 10−6, 3.4 × 10−5, 3.4 × 10−4, and 3.4 × 10−3 units/ml, Sigma) was combined to produce superoxide (14.Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8 (10−7g/ml) was incubated with xanthine, xanthine oxidase, and xanthine and xanthine oxidase for 2 h at 37 °C before performing the NCA assay. The capacity of SIN-1 (Alexis Corp.), a peroxynitrite generator (15.Holm P. Kankaanranta H. Metsa-Ketela T. Moilanen E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 346: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), to modulate IL-8-induced NCA was evaluated. IL-8 (10−7 g/ml) was incubated with SIN-1 (10−4, 10−5, 10−6, 10−7, and 10−8m) for 2 h at 37 °C before performing the NCA assay. IL-8 was also incubated with SIN-1 (10−4m) and sodium nitroprusside (10−4, 10−5, 10−6, 10−7, and 10−8m). The capacity of the reducing agents dithiothreitol, deferoxamine, or dithionite to attenuate the effect of peroxynitrite on IL-8-induced NCA by peroxynitrite was assessed. Dithiothreitol (10−3m, Sigma), deferoxamine (50 μm, Sigma), dithionite (10−3m, Fluka, St. Louis, MO), and peroxynitrite (10−4m) were added to IL-8 (10−7g/ml) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C before evaluating for NCA. The capacity of l-tyrosine to reserve the attenuation of NCA induced by peroxynitrite was assessed by addition of l-tyrosine (10−3–10−5m, Sigma) to IL-8 (10−7 g/ml) before exposure to peroxynitrite (10−5m). Nitrotyrosine on IL-8 incubated with peroxynitrite was evaluated because formation of peroxynitrite has been demonstrated to nitrate tyrosine residues (5.Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). IL-8 (10−7 g/ml) was incubated with peroxynitrite (10−4m) and frozen until assayed. Goat anti-human IL-8 IgG (R & D Systems, Inc.) was dissolved in Voller's buffer (1.59 g of sodium carbonate, 2.93 g of sodium bicarbonate, 0.2 g of sodium azide in 1 liter of distilled water, pH 9.6) at the final concentration 2 × 10−7 g/ml. Two hundred μl was added to flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and allowed to adsorb to the plastic overnight at 4 °C. After washing the flat-bottomed plate 3 times with PBS/Tween (0.075% Tween 20, Sigma), 200 μl of IL-8 with and without peroxynitrite incubation were added to the IL-8 antibody-coated plate and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS/Tween, 200 μl of a 1:400 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine (Calbiochem) was added to the wells and incubated for 90 min. After again washing three times with PBS/Tween, 200 μl of a 1:500 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was added to the wells and incubated for 90 min. 200 μl of o-phenylenediamine (100 μg/ml, Sigma) in 0.003% H2O2 was added and visually monitored. The reaction was terminated by addition of 25 μl of 8 nH2SO4 and the absorbance read at 490 nm. In separate experiments, plates were coated with IL-8 that had either been exposed or not exposed to peroxynitrite. Subsequently, anti-nitrotyrosine, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, ando-phenylenediamine were added sequentially with washing between each addition. The reaction was terminated with H2SO4 and the absorbance read at 490 nm. To investigate the peroxynitrite effect on IL-8 binding to neutrophils, IL-8 was incubated with 10−4m of peroxynitrite for 2 h at 37 °C. In control experiments, IL-8 was incubated with medium alone. Subsequently, IL-8 with or without peroxynitrite was incubated with neutrophils (105 or 106 cells) at 4 °C for 30 min. Then supernatants were removed, and neutrophils were washed three times by HBSS. Neutrophils were suspended in 1 ml of PBS/Tween, sonicated for 20 s, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge to obtain a supernatant (soluble) and cellular fraction. Then IL-8 was measured in the cellular fraction using a commercially available IL-8 ELISA (R & D Systems). The differences between groups were tested using Student's paired t test. In all cases, a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Data in figures are expressed as mean ± S.E. IL-8 was incubated with peroxynitrite (10−4m). At each IL-8 concentration tested, peroxynitrite reduced NCA (Fig.1; n = 6,p < 0.01). Incubation of IL-8 (100 ng/ml) with various amounts of peroxynitrite induced a significant, concentration-dependent attenuation of NCA (data not shown;n = 6, p < 0.01). The lowest dose of peroxynitrite tested, 10−5m, significantly inhibited NCA (p < 0.01). Peroxynitrite itself was not chemotactic for neutrophils (data not shown). To ensure that the effect of peroxynitrite was not a nonspecific effect on neutrophil chemotaxis, the effect of peroxynitrite on NCA induced by LTB4 and complement-activated serum was assessed. Peroxynitrite did not significantly inhibit the NCA of LTB4 or complement-activated serum (Fig. 2;n = 4, p < 0.01). Neither sodium nitroprusside nor papa-NONOate significantly changed NCA induced by IL-8 at any of the concentrations tested (data not shown;n = 3–4, p > 0.05 all comparisons). Incubation of IL-8 with xanthine, xanthine oxidase, or xanthine and xanthine oxidase did not significantly alter NCA to IL-8 (data not shown; n = 4, p > 0.05 all comparisons). SIN-1 induced a significant, concentration-dependent attenuation of NCA by IL-8 (Fig. 3 A;n = 6, p < 0.01). The lowest dose of SIN-1 to inhibit NCA was 10−6m(p < 0.05). 10−4m of SIN-1 induced 80% attenuation of NCA by IL-8. SIN-1 itself was not chemotactic for neutrophils (data not shown). Addition of sodium nitroprusside (10−4, 10−5, 10−6, 10−7, and 10−8m) to SIN-1 (10−4m) did not differ from SIN-1 (10−4m) alone in reducing IL-8 NCA alone at any of the concentrations tested (data not shown, p > 0.05). Addition of the reducing agents, dithiothreitol, deferoxamine, and dithionite to IL-8 prior to incubation with peroxynitrite attenuated the inhibition of NCA induced by peroxynitrite (Fig. 3 B; n = 4,p < 0.01). Addition of l-tyrosine to IL-8 before incubating with peroxynitrite abrogated the attenuation of NCA induced by peroxynitrite (Fig. 3 C; n = 4, p < 0.01). The addition of 10−4m of l-tyrosine prevented the inhibition of NCA induced by 10−5m peroxynitrite. Optical density of IL-8 with peroxynitrite incubation was significantly higher than IL-8 without peroxynitrite incubation. Peroxynitrite resulted in nitrotyrosine formation on IL-8 (Fig. 4; n = 6,p < 0.01). There was also an increase in the absorbance of IL-8 exposed to peroxynitrite at 428 nm consistent with the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (16.Bray M.R. Clarke A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2006-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Addition of peroxynitrite to IL-8 resulted in a reduction of IL-8 bound to the neutrophils (Fig.5; n = 4,p < 0.01). The results of this study show that the peroxynitrite significantly attenuated IL-8-induced NCA in vitro. This was not explained by an inhibition of chemotaxis by peroxynitrite. Incubation of peroxynitrite (10−4m) with the neutrophils prior to the chemotaxis assay did not inhibit NCA to IL-8 (data not shown), and the inhibitory effects of peroxynitrite were not significant on NCA induced by LTB4 or complement-activated serum. Sodium dithionite, deferoxamine, dithiothreitol, or tyrosine attenuated the inhibition but did not affect chemotaxis alone (data not shown). NO or superoxide did not cause the reduction in IL-8 NCA because papa-NONOate and xanthine/xanthine oxidase did not show an inhibitory effect. The peroxynitrite donor, SIN-1, induced a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of NCA by IL-8. Nitrotyrosine was detected in the IL-8 incubated with peroxynitrite by ELISA. These data suggest that peroxynitrite plays an important role in regulating human neutrophil locomotion by IL-8. Neutrophils migrate from the bloodstream across vascular endothelium and smooth muscle to vascular sites of inflammation, play an important role in host defenses during tissue injury and inflammation, and also play an important role in tissue remodeling after injury (17.Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3865) Google Scholar, 18.Currie D.C. Saverymuttu S.H. Peters A.M. Needham S.G. George P. Dhillon D.P. Lavender J.P. Cole P.J. Lancet. 1987; 1: 1335-1339Abstract PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Current concepts suggest that neutrophils are recruited from the bloodstream by chemotactic factors, such as IL-8, generated and released locally in injured tissues that may also generate NO and superoxide. Therefore, IL-8 is likely to encounter high local concentrations of peroxynitrite. Neutrophils have been shown to respond to NO (19.Ney P. Schroder H. Schror K. Eicosanoids. 1990; 3: 243-245PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb J.P. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4102-4109PubMed Google Scholar); however, NO donors or NO synthase inhibitors have produced variable effects on neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro (21.Bath P.M. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22.Moilanen E. Vuorinen P. Kankaanranta H. Metsa-Ketela T. Vapaatalo H. Br. J.

Co-incubation of IL-8 with several peroxynitrite scavengers ameliorated peroxynitrite-induced NCA inhibition. The protective effect of dithiothreitol on IL-8 may suggest the involvement of cysteine residues; however, dithiothreitol has also been shown to prevent peroxynitrite-mediated nitration of tyrosine (25.Rohn T.T. Quinn M.T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 353: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The iron chelator, deferoxamine, also inhibited peroxynitrite-induced inhibition of IL-8 NCA but is also a scavenger of peroxynitrite reaction independent of iron chelation (26.Denicola A. Souza J.M. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 19: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dithionite, which has been proposed to modify 3-nitrotyrosine by substituting an amine group (27.Andrews W.W. Hill F.C. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8219-8225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ameliorated the peroxynitrite inhibition. In addition, l-tyrosine abrogated the peroxynitrite NCA inhibition. These results are consistent with tyrosine nitration by peroxynitrite as a mechanism for IL-8 inhibition. IL-8 is a stimulatory peptide for neutrophils that appears to play an important role in the inflammatory process (1.Matsushima K. Morishita K. Yoshimura T. Lavu S. Kobayashi Y. Lew W. Appella E.

Local injection or genetic overexpression of IL-8 in experimental animals causes specific neutrophil migration to the targeted site (28.Lira S.A. Zalamea P. Heinrich J.N. Fuentes M.E. Carrasco D. Lewin A.C. Barton D.S. Durham S. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2039-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Current concepts suggest that the mechanisms that lead to neutrophil locomotion in response to IL-8 are by binding to receptors on neutrophils (29.Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 30.Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 31.Moser B. Schumacher C. von Tscharner V. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10666-10671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this concept, our results demonstrate that peroxynitrite-treated IL-8 exhibited decreased binding to neutrophils. Binding of IL-8 to neutrophil receptors has recently been studied by Schraufstatter et al. (9.Schraufstatter I.U. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Barritt D.S. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10428-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) who reported the importance of Tyr13 and Lys15. Mutation of amino acids 13–15 of the rabbit (His-Ser-Thr) to the human sequence (Tyr-Ser-Lys) confers the high affinity for the human IL-8 receptor to this mutated form of rabbit IL-8. Consistent with the concept that tyrosine is important in binding of IL-8 to its receptor, Clark-Lewis et al. (32.Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported a 6-fold decrease in affinity for a human IL-8 molecule in which Tyr13 was replaced with Thr. Our findings of nitrotyrosine formation on IL-8 after peroxynitrite treatment are consistent with these observations and suggest that tyrosine nitration by peroxynitrite on IL-8 is a likely mechanism altering IL-8 binding and chemotactic function. However, peroxynitrite may potentially affect protein function by other mechanisms including nitration of methionine (33.Vogt W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) or tryptophan (34.Alvarez B. Rubbo H. Kirk M. Barnes S. Freeman B.A. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) or formation of S-nitroso-thiol groups on cysteines (35.Gow A.J. Buerk D.G. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2841-2845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). IL-8 does not contain methionine, but cysteines are present and form disulfide bonds. Although NO and peroxynitrite are physiological regulators, they have been shown to alter cell respiration (36.Bolanos J.P. Heales S.J. Peuchen S. Barker J.E. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 21: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 37.Shen W. Hintze T.H. Wolin M.S.

Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the studies with SIN-1, neutrophils may have been exposed to peroxynitrite during their migration across the polycarbonate filter. However, neutrophils had no significant cytotoxicity as assessed by trypan blue exclusion after incubation with peroxynitrite. Furthermore, incubation of neutrophils with peroxynitrite had no significant effect on NCA induced by IL-8. In summary, we found that peroxynitrite modulates IL-8 induced NCAin vitro. These data suggest that peroxynitrite generated at sites of inflammation may attenuate IL-8 chemotactic activity and play an important role in regulating human neutrophil locomotion during inflammation."

Here, we provide evidence that glutamate may be a physiologically relevant activator of ACC. Glutamate induced the activation of both major isoforms of ACC, prepared from rat liver, heart, or white adipose tissue. In agreement with previous studies, a type 2A protein phosphatase contributed to the effects of glutamate on ACC. However, the protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin LR did not abolish the effects of glutamate on ACC activity. Moreover, glutamate directly activated purified preparations of ACC when protein phosphatase activity was excluded. Phosphatase-independent ACC activation by glutamate was also reflected by polymerization of the enzyme as judged by size-exclusion chromatography. The sensitivity of ACC to direct activation by glutamate was diminished by treatment in vitro with AMP-activated protein kinase or cAMP-dependent protein kinase or by β-adrenergic stimulation of intact adipose tissue. We conclude that glutamate, an abundant intracellular amino acid, induces ACC activation through complementary actions as a phosphatase activator and as a direct allosteric ligand for dephosphorylated ACC. This study supports the general hypothesis that amino acids fulfill important roles as signal molecules as well as intermediates in carbon and nitrogen metabolism.

AMPK appears to play a dominant role in mediating inhibition of ACC-α, notably through phosphorylation of serine 79, with possible contribution from phosphorylation of serine 1200 (3.Hardie D.G.

The roles of malonyl-CoA and ACC in fatty acid synthesis and β-oxidation illustrate important features of the regulatory interplay between lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in mammals that extend the concepts embodied in the glucose-fatty acid cycle (33.Randle P.J. Hales C.N. Garland P.B. Newsholme E.A. Lancet. 1963; 1: 785-789Abstract PubMed Scopus (3795) Google Scholar). Amino acids, as well as lipids and carbohydrates, are crucial for intermediary metabolism, providing an important source of carbon for energy metabolism and for the synthesis of glucose and glycogen (e.g. see Refs. 34.Hers H.G. Hue L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 612-653Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar and 35.Stumvoll M. Perriello G. Meyer C. Gerich J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 778-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amino acid carbon can be utilized for fatty acid synthesis, either directly through the generation of keto acids or acetyl-CoA or indirectly following gluconeogenesis (36.Feller, D. D. (1965) in Handbook of Physiology (Renold, A. E., and Cahill, G. F., eds) Section 5, pp. 239–251, American Physiological Society, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar, 37.Mathias M.M. Sullivan A.C.

Despite the important metabolic contributions of amino acids, we know rather less about the possible regulatory roles of amino acids, especially in the context of fatty acid metabolism. Recently, a glutamate-sensitive protein phosphatase was recognized in rat liver that was able to dephosphorylate and activate ACC (39.Baquet A. Gaussin V. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Hue L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40.Gaussin V. Hue L. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This protein phosphatase appears to account for the activation of ACC and lipogenesis observed following the treatment of isolated hepatocytes with glutamine (39.Baquet A. Gaussin V. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Hue L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40.Gaussin V. Hue L. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In view of the quantitative importance of glutamine in amino acid metabolism and the abundance of intracellular glutamate in many cells (35.Stumvoll M. Perriello G. Meyer C. Gerich J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 778-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that ACC control might be sensitive to glutamate in tissues other than liver. We demonstrate that glutamate does stimulate a phosphatase-mediated activation of ACC in subcellular fractions from heart and adipose tissue as well as liver. Unexpectedly, the effects of glutamate on ACC activity were not completely inhibited by the protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin LR. This observation led to further studies that confirmed direct, allosteric effects of glutamate on both major ACC isoforms. These observations suggest that amino acids have important and complex effects on intermediary metabolism, involving actions as signal molecules as well as sources of carbon and nitrogen. Laboratory chemicals, biochemicals, and solvents were obtained as described previously (32.Boone A.N. Rodrigues B. Brownsey R.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). l-Glutamate was obtained from Sigma. Microcystin LR was from Calbiochem. Custom peptides including the “SAMS” peptide for assay of AMPK (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) was synthesized by the Nucleic Acid and Protein Service Laboratory (University of British Columbia). Male Wistar rats, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and allowed free access to laboratory chow, were killed by cervical dislocation or by asphyxiation in carbon dioxide, and tissues were removed immediately. Livers and hearts were obtained from rats weighing 200–400 g and were chilled on ice prior to homogenization. Perirenal and epididymal fat pads from rats weighing 180–240 g were either placed on ice or rinsed and then incubated with shaking (30 min, 37 °C) in oxygenated and bicarbonate-buffered medium (41.Brownsey R.W. Hughes W.A. Denton R.M. Mayer J. Biochem. J. 1977; 168: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following isolation or incubation, tissues were homogenized (3 ml/g of tissue) in pH 7.2 buffer containing MOPS (20 mm), sucrose (250 mm), EDTA (2 mm), EGTA (2 mm), benzamidine (2.5 mm), pepstatin A (3 μm), leupeptin (5 μm), glutathione (2.5 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm). All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. A glass-Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer was used to homogenize livers, and a Polytron was used for hearts and adipose tissue. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min and then at either 250,000 × g for 60 min (liver) or 315,000 × g for 15 min (heart and adipose tissue). ACC was recovered from the high-speed supernatant fraction by precipitation with ammonium sulfate (40% saturation), resuspended in the initial homogenization buffer, and subjected to chromatography on a monomeric avidin affinity column (15.Winz R. Hess D. Aebersold R. Brownsey R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14438-14445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Kohanski R.A. Lane M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Biotin-eluted proteins were concentrated to ∼0.5 mg/ml by centrifugation (50-kDa filters, Millipore Corp.) and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Liver and adipose tissue ACC activities were assayed by [14C]bicarbonate fixation (43.Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,44.Quayle K.A. Denton R.M. Brownsey R.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Prior to assay, ACC was preincubated (20 min, 37 °C) in pH 7.2 buffer containing MOPS (20 mm), bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml), and EDTA (0.5 mm). Other additions to preincubations, where indicated, included microcystin LR (1 μm) or MeOH vehicle (1%, v/v) and the allosteric regulators trisodium citrate and/or sodium glutamate and magnesium acetate. Samples of preincubated ACC were then transferred to assay buffer and incubated for 5–10 min at 37 °C. One unit of ACC catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of malonyl-CoA/min. Because of the low abundance in rat hearts, the activity of myocardial ACC was assayed by determination of malonyl-CoA following reverse-phase HPLC. ACC was preincubated as described above and then assayed in a final volume of 100 μl for 10 min 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 7 μl of perchloric acid (60%, w/v); the precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min); and aliquots (20 μl) were subjected to HPLC analysis as described (32.Boone A.N. Rodrigues B. Brownsey R.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). AMPK (from rat liver) and PKA (from beef heart) were purified and assayed as described previously (32.Boone A.N. Rodrigues B. Brownsey R.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 45.Carling D. Clarke P.R. Zammit V.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J.

Protein determinations were carried out with the dye binding assay using IgG as a standard (47.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of affinity-purified ACC was achieved by incubation with either PKA or AMPK plus AMP (200 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Phosphorylation reactions were carried out in pH 7.2 buffer containing MOPS (20 mm), EDTA (0.5 mm), magnesium acetate (2 mm), and ATP (100 μm) and were quenched with EDTA (5 mm) prior to ACC assay. To induce ACC phosphorylation in situ, adipose tissue was incubated with Krebs-Henseleit buffer as described above (2 × 15 min, 37 °C) and then for a further 20 min in fresh buffer supplemented with defatted bovine serum albumin (1%, w/v) in the presence of isoproterenol (500 nm). The tissue was blotted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in buffer containing chelators and microcystin LR (1 μm) to inhibit subsequent dephosphorylation. The homogenates were centrifuged (15,000 ×g, 5 min, 4 °C), and ACC activity was determined as described above. To induce ACC dephosphorylation, the enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, resuspended in the initial homogenization buffer plus NaCl (150 mm), and then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min to facilitate the actions of endogenous phosphatases. Proteolytic modification of ACC was prevented by inclusion of leupeptin (5 μm), pepstatin (3 μm), benzamidine (2.5 mm), and Pefabloc SC (0.4 mm). Further affinity purification was as described above. A Sepharose CL-4B column (0.7 × 48 cm) was equilibrated at room temperature with pH 7.2 buffer containing MOPS (20 mm), EDTA (2 mm), glycerol (2%, w/v), and, when appropriate, either sodium glutamate (50 mm) or sodium citrate (20 mm). The ionic strength of the buffers was kept constant by addition of appropriate concentrations of sodium chloride. ACC was purified from rat liver by ammonium sulfate precipitation and centrifuged just prior to chromatography (315,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was incubated in the presence of microcystin LR (2 μm) and glutamate or citrate (as described above) for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples (250 μl) were subjected to chromatography at room temperature (10 ml/h); 1-ml fractions were collected; and ACC activity was determined. Previous reports have demonstrated activation of ACC by treatment of intact rat hepatocytes with glutamine or by addition of sodium glutamate to cellular supernatant fractions (39.Baquet A. Gaussin V. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Hue L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40.Gaussin V. Hue L. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We confirmed the glutamate sensitivity of rat liver ACC and found that it persisted following partial purification of the enzyme from rat liver by ammonium sulfate precipitation (Fig.1 A, circles; and Table I, part A). In the absence of citrate, glutamate induced ∼4-fold activation of ACC, giving activity that was >60% of the maximum seen with citrate alone. The activity of ACC at 20 mm citrate as well as the calculatedV max were also increased by glutamate treatment by ∼60%, whereas the K a for citrate was not significantly altered. In agreement with the previous reports, the effects of glutamate were time-dependent (reaching a maximum within 15 min) and dose-dependent over the range 0–100 mm glutamate (data not shown).Table IEffects of glutamate on kinetic properties of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from rat liver and white adipose tissueACCAdditions to incubationACC activityKinetic properties of ACCGluM-LR0 mm citrate20 mmcitrateV maxK a (citrate)mmA.

Specific activities of ACC (20 mm citrate) were 12 (liver) and 35 (adipose tissue) milliunits/mg protein. In view of the important metabolic roles and distinct isoform patterns of ACC in non-hepatic tissues, we next tested the ability of glutamate to influence ACC extracted from heart muscle (predominantly ACC-β) or from white adipose tissue (exclusively ACC-α). ACC isolated from heart and white adipose tissue by ammonium sulfate precipitation was also activated upon incubation with glutamate (Fig. 1, B–D,circles; and Table I, part A). In these tissue preparations, the activation of ACC by glutamate was again apparent at all concentrations of citrate examined. The effects of glutamate on the activity of ACC from white adipose tissue were apparent if the tissue was obtained directly from the animal (Fig. 1 C) or if it was incubated prior to homogenization (Fig. 1 D). ACC obtained from preincubated tissue was more sensitive to citrate than that obtained from non-incubated tissue (Fig. 1, C andD; and Table I), but was still further activated in the presence of glutamate. It is important to note that the effects of glutamate, observed in these and subsequent experiments, could not be explained by traces of citrate. Direct analysis of stock glutamate solutions (200 mm), using citrate lyase coupled with malate dehydrogenase, revealed very low levels of citrate (<5 μm), far below the K a for ACC activation (>2 mm) (Table I). Previous studies have shown that the effects of glutamate on hepatic ACC are essentially abolished by microcystin LR, a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 2A and 1 (39.Baquet A. Gaussin V. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Hue L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40.Gaussin V. Hue L. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As anticipated, microcystin LR significantly attenuated the activation of ACC induced by glutamate treatment (Fig. 1, squares; and Table I). Although the effects of glutamate on ACC were diminished by addition of the protein phosphatase inhibitor, they were not completely eliminated. The effects of glutamate on ACC activity were therefore still significant even in the presence of microcystin LR, with ∼3-fold activation of ACC still apparent at low citrate concentrations (Fig. 1 and Table I). In view of the incomplete inhibition of the effects of glutamate by microcystin LR, we explored the effects of glutamate on ACC purified by affinity chromatography to remove endogenous protein phosphatases. As with the enzyme partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity-purified ACC from rat liver was indeed sensitive to glutamate, being maximally activated 3–6-fold by 75 mm glutamate and half-maximally activated by ∼25 mm glutamate (Fig. 2,squares). The selectivity of the actions of glutamate on ACC was examined in two respects. In one set of experiments, a variety of organic acids were tested, each at several concentrations, for the ability to activate ACC. The acids tested (with maximum concentrations in parentheses) were aspartate (30 mm), glutamine (5 mm), oxalacetate (65 μm), oxoglutarate (1.6 mm), malate (5 mm), lactate (11 mm), β-hydroxybutyrate (7 mm), acetoacetate (0.8 mm), glucose 6-phosphate (10 mm), and glucosamine 6-phosphate (10 mm). None of these organic acids had significant effects on ACC activity even at the highest indicated values, which exceeded typical intracellular concentrations by at least 4-fold. We were also concerned that the effects of glutamate might be explained by changes in ionic strength. To reproduce the effects observed in previous studies (39.Baquet A. Gaussin V. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Hue L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1083-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40.Gaussin V. Hue L. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem.

Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a 5′-fluorescein-labeled 32-mer oligonucleotide revealed that ICP8 formed a nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA with a binding site size of 10 nucleotides/ICP8 monomer, an association constant at 25° C, K = 0.55 ± 0.05 × 106m−1, and a cooperativity parameter, ω = 15 ± 3. The equilibrium constant was largely independent of salt, δlog(Kω)/δlog([NaCl]) = −2.4 ± 0.4. Comparison of these parameters with other ssDNA-binding proteins showed that ICP8 reacted with an unusual mechanism characterized by low cooperativity and weak binding. In addition, the reaction product was more stable at high salt concentrations, and fluorescence enhancement of etheno-ssDNA by ICP8 was higher than for other ssDNA-binding proteins. These last two characteristics are also found for protein-DNA complexes formed by recombinases in their active conformation. Given the proposed role of ICP8 in promoting strand transfer reactions, they suggest that ICP8 and recombinase proteins may catalyze homologous recombination by a similar mechanism.

In addition to its role as an ssDNA-binding protein, complexes of ICP8 with other proteins may act during viral replication. ICP8 physically interacts via the UL8 protein with the HSV-1 helicase primase heterotrimer thereby stimulating unwinding of intact and damaged duplex DNA (8.Tanguy le Gac N. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S.

In vitro experiments suggest that ICP8 may be responsible for homologous recombination in vivo. ICP8 exhibits helix destabilizing and DNA renaturing activities (2.Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67 (515): 711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein also catalyzes homologous pairing and strand exchange activity in vitro (15.Bortner C. Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) where it is able to transfer a DNA strand from a linear duplex to a complementary single-stranded circular DNA. The reaction requires MgCl2 but not (d)NTPs, and strand exchange is limited to a few 100 base pairs. Understanding the role of ICP8 in the DNA replication and recombination reactions of HSV-1 will require knowledge of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the various macromolecular interactions involved. Currently, the thermodynamic characteristics of the simple reaction between ICP8 and ssDNA are largely unknown compared with other ssDNA-binding proteins such as gp32 from phage T4 (16.Newport J.W. Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol.

In order to address this question, we have undertaken solution equilibrium binding studies of the reaction of ICP8 with ssDNA using fluorescence spectroscopy. ICP8 was purified as described (8.Tanguy le Gac N. Villani G. Hoffmann J.S. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). εDNA was synthesized by published methods (21.Cazaux C. Blanchet J.S. Dupuis D. Villani G. Defais M.

Concentration units of ICP8 and DNA are M protein and M nucleotide, respectively. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a model MOS-400 spectrophotometer from Bio-Logic (Claix, France). Samples were stirred continuously at 25 ± 1° C in a 1.0 × 0.4-cm thermostated cuvette with the short path in the direction of incident light in order to reduce inner filter effects. Results were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects as described previously (21.Cazaux C. Blanchet J.S. Dupuis D. Villani G. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 44: 28799-28804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar). pH was checked before and after the reaction and did not change during the titration. In experiments with εDNA, samples were excited at 305 nm, and fluorescence intensity was measured using a 345 nm cut-off filter. Fluorescence signals of εDNA and of protein were linear functions of concentration in the concentration ranges used, which is consistent with the absence of aggregation. Fluorescence signal from protein alone was subtracted and data reported as fluorescence enhancement, (Fl complex −Fl εDNA)/Fl εDNA, whereFl complex is the fluorescence of the protein-DNA complex and Fl εDNA is the fluorescence of εDNA alone. In experiments using 5′-fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide, samples were excited at 490 nm, and fluorescence intensity was measured through a 550-nm cut-off filter. Vertically and horizontally polarized fluorescence were measured simultaneously by a photoelastic modulator PEM-90 (Hinds Instruments) and used to calculate fluorescence and anisotropy (23.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). 2Y. Dupont, Bio-Logic, personal communication. Fluorescence anisotropy is reported either asA obs or A =A obs − A 0, whereA obs is the observed anisotropy, andA 0 is the signal of the oligonucleotide alone. Etheno-DNA is a fluorescent derivative of M13 ssDNA frequently used to measure protein binding to ssDNA in nucleoprotein filaments (17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J.

ICP8 binding enhanced the fluorescence of εDNA by a factor of 2.9 ± 0.2 (Fig. 1and Table I). Identical titration curves were observed in the presence and absence of NaCl (10 mmTris acetate, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, data not shown), indicating that the reaction is stoichiometric in the experimental conditions of Fig.1, and a binding site size of 10 nt per ICP8 monomer was determined from the molar ratios of ICP8 and εDNA required to saturate fluorescence enhancement. The resulting protein-DNA complex could not be dissociated with 800 mm NaCl (Fig. 1 b).Table IStoichiometry and fluorescence enhancement of complexes formed between ICP8 and εDNAStoichiometry (nt/ICP8)Fluorescence enhancementa(Fluorescence of complex − fluorescence of εDNA)/fluorescence of εDNA.ICP8 titrated with εDNA10.3 ± 0.73.1 ± 0.1εDNA titrated with ICP811.5 ± 1.02.9 ± 0.2a (Fluorescence of complex − fluorescence of εDNA)/fluorescence of εDNA. Open table in a new tab The stability of the complex in high salt solution may be the result of a kinetic trap such as the formation of a non-equilibrium complex (28.Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we carried out the reverse titration of ICP8 with εDNA. The same stoichiometry and fluorescence enhancements were observed as in the forward titration (Table I). To control further for the possibility of irreversible complex formation, ICP8 was titrated with εDNA at five NaCl concentrations from 150 to 700 mmNaCl (not shown). Binding isotherms were similar in all experiments, although at higher salt concentrations ([NaCl] >500 mm) stoichiometry decreased slightly from 10 ± 1 to 8.5 ± 1 and fluorescence enhancement decreased from 3.0 ± 0.1 to 2.6 ± 0.1 which may reflect the influence of high salt on the binding mode. These results show that the complex formed between ICP8 and εDNA was independent of the order of addition and insensitive to salt up to a concentration of 500 mm NaCl. In the previous experiments ICP8 bound stoichiometrically to εDNA at high salt concentrations, and we were unable to find solution conditions to measure equilibrium binding. Therefore, we investigated the reaction of ICP8 with a 32-mer oligonucleotide, reasoning that cooperative binding which depends on protein-protein interactions should be less important for an oligonucleotide than for a polynucleotide. The oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ extremity with fluorescein, and protein binding was measured by fluorescence anisotropy. The intrinsic anisotropy of the 5′-fluorescein-labeled 32-mer oligonucleotide was 0.02 ± 0.007 (Fig.2 a) which is characteristic of mobile fluorophore (23.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Titration of oligonucleotide with ICP8 increased anisotropy to 0.16–0.18 reflecting lower mobility as a result of protein binding. No fluorescence quenching occurred during the titration (data not shown). The stoichiometry of the reaction was 10 ± 1 nt/ICP8 molecule. The ICP8-oligonucleotide complex could be dissociated with NaCl (Fig.2 b). The anisotropy of the oligonucleotide alone increased with salt concentration (data not shown) and equaled the slightly elevated anisotropy values observed after dissociation of the complex. This effect was taken into account in order to determine the salt titration midpoint (STMP), the salt concentration necessary to decrease anisotropy by 50%. Monovalent cations Na+ and K+ destabilized the protein-DNA complex with equal efficiency; the STMPs of NaCl and KCl were 0.35 ± 0.03m and 0.31 ± 0.02 m, respectively. In contrast the destabilizing efficiency was sensitive to anion, STMP NaCH3COO− = 0.76 ± 0.02 m, and the divalent cation was more potent than monovalent cations, STMP MgCl2 = 0.08 ± 0.01 m. It should be noted that data in Fig. 2 b are salt titrations of complexes formed in the presence of 150 mm NaCl which was required to maintain the integrity of ICP8. Unlike most spectroscopic measurements, fluorescence anisotropy is independent of the concentration of fluorophore (23.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to study ICP8 binding to ssDNA using this method, it was important to experimentally determine the relationship between anisotropy and the concentration of bound fluorescent oligonucleotide. This can be accomplished using the macromolecular binding density function method of Lohman and co-workers (29.Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30.Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, several concentrations of oligonucleotide are titrated by protein (Fig.3). All titrations with a particular anisotropy, A, have the same binding density ν = Lb/MT which is determined by the chemical potential of the free ligand, approximated by Lf; here Lb is bound ligand concentration, Lf is free ligand concentration (M ICP8), and MT the total macromolecule concentration (M nt). The set of {LT, MT} which gives a particular value ofA obeys conservation of mass, LT = Lb + Lf = ν·MT + Lf, where LT is the total ICP8 concentration (M protein). A plot of LT versus MT for the set of values {LT, MT} corresponding to a particular anisotropy should be linear with a slope of ν and an intercept of Lf. Fractional saturation, θ, can be calculated from binding density by θ =n·ν where n is the binding site size (nt/protein molecule). Since each value of θ corresponds to a unique value of the experimental signal, it is possible to determine the relationship between anisotropy and density of protein on the oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 a). Each value of θ also corresponds to a particular free ligand concentration (Lf) which allows one to construct a binding isotherm (Fig. 4 b) and to determine K and ω independently of the relation between experimental signal and binding density.Figure 4a, fluorescence anisotropy as a function of fractional saturation. b, model-free binding isotherm. θ and Lf were calculated from the titration curves in Fig. 3using the method of macromolecular binding density function analysis (29.Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30.Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (see text). Data in b are presented with theoretical curves (31.Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) n = 10; upper curveK = 0.8 × 106m−1, ω = 10; lower curveK = 0.4 × 106m−1, ω = 20; middle curveK = 0.55 × 106m−1, ω = 15.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) On the basis of the salt-dependent stability of the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2 b), we chose to study equilibrium binding in the presence of 300 mm NaCl. Fluorescence anisotropy of 5–25 μm oligonucleotide titrated with ICP8 in these conditions is shown in Fig. 3. Intrinsic oligonucleotide anisotropy has been subtracted from these data. Plots of LT versus MT for {LT, MT} corresponding to anisotropies between 0.01 and 0.125 were linear (not shown); nonlinear curves were observed at larger values that may indicate aggregation at higher protein concentrations. The relationship between A and θ was determined from the slopes of these plots and the binding site size n = 10 nt/protein (Fig.4 a). Small positive curvature was observed at low binding density. The simplest explanation of this observation is that initial bound protein inhibited mobility less than protein bound at high density. Maximum anisotropy was extrapolated from data at high fractional saturation, A max = 0.165 ± 0.005. We fit the model-free binding isotherm (Fig. 4 b) using the method of Epstein (31.Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) for a protein ligand binding to a 32-mer oligonucleotide macromolecule and n = 10. This approach assumes that monomeric ICP8 binds to DNA; ICP8 sediments in a glycerol gradient as a monomer (32.O'Donnell M.E. Elias P. Funnell B.E. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which is consistent with this assumption. The best visual fit was found to be association constantK = 0.55 ± 0.05 × 106m−1 and cooperativity parameter ω = 15 ± 3. Visual fit was confirmed by examining the residuals between experimental and theoretical points for K and ω near these values. Identical results were found with two independent titrations of 5–25 μm oligonucleotide with ICP8. The effects of variations of K and ω illustrated in Fig.4 b give an idea of the robustness of the fit. These parameters were then used to fit experimental binding isotherms (Fig.3). Theoretical curves were constructed assumingA max = 0.165 and a linear relationship between anisotropy and fractional saturation. They agree well with experimental data at anisotropy values in the range 0.06–0.125 which corresponds to 40–80% saturation. However, at lower anisotropy values the effect of the nonlinear relation between anisotropy and fractional saturation (Fig. 4 a) becomes apparent. These differences between experimental and theoretical curves can be corrected by taking into account experimental relationship between A and θ in Fig.4 a (not shown). However, it should be recalled thatK and ω determined in Fig. 4 b are independent of this relationship. The salt dependence of the binding parameters was then determined. 5 μm oligonucleotide was titrated with ICP8 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 25° C in the presence of 200–400 mm NaCl. K and ω were calculated from these titration curves as above assuming n = 10 (TableII). Values of the cooperativity constant which gave best fits were in the range of ω = 8–15 and did not significantly depend on salt concentration. A plot of log(Kω) versus log([NaCl]) was linear (Fig.5). The slope of this plot, −2.4 ± 0.4, is a function of the number of electrostatic interactions per protein monomer contributing to the stability of the nucleoprotein filament (33.Record Jr., T.M. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). These results, together with the dependence of the reaction on the nature of the anion (Fig. 2 b), show that equilibrium binding of ICP8 with ssDNA is not simply entropically driven displacement of cations from polynucleotide as reported for simple peptide-DNA complexes (33.Record Jr., T.M. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 34.Johnson N.P. Mazarguil H. Lopez A. J. Biol.

We first tried to determine K and ω at several temperatures between 20 and 40 °C. In this approach, the percent anisotropy increase during titration was assumed to be proportional to DNA binding at all temperatures as is approximately the case at 25 °C (Fig.4 a). In order to determine this parameter, the maximum anisotropy, A max which depends on temperature according to the Perrin equation (23.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar), must be evaluated at each temperature. Preliminary experiments showed that plateau values of the binding isotherm were not sufficiently precise to determineA max. We therefore measured binding parameters at 37 °C using the macromolecular binding density function methods as above (29.Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 258-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 30.Bujalowski W. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3099-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31.Epstein I.R. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 8: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Four concentrations of oligonucleotide 10–25 μm were titrated with ICP8 at 37 ± 0.5 °C in 20 mm Tris acetate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. A slightly non-linear relation between anisotropy and θ was observed at 37 °C similar to results at 25 °C (Fig. 4 a). The model free binding isotherm was fit using n = 10 (Table II). Enthalpy and entropy were assumed to be independent of temperature, and these were estimated from a van't Hoff plot using Kω at the 25° C and 37° C, ΔH = −5.6 ± 1.3 kcal(m)−1, ΔS = 12.6 ± 4.4 cal(K·m)−1 (K is degrees Kelvin) where the uncertainties are from the variations of Kω which fit the binding isotherms. These results indicate that entropy and enthalpy contributed about equally to the free energy of ICP8 binding to ssDNA. To test the effect of the 5′-fluorescein on the reaction, we performed competitive binding experiments between labeled and unlabeled 32-mer in stoichiometric reaction conditions (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 25 °C). Fluorescence anisotropy was measured for complexes formed with 0.5 μm ICP8 and 10 μm of both labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotide. Assuming a binding site size of 10 nt, ICP8 should bind 5 μm nucleotides in these conditions and, if the fluorescent label has no effect, 25% of the fluorescent molecule would be bound to protein. Anisotropy, corrected for the intrinsic signal of unbound oligonucleotide, was 0.042 ± 0.005, independently of the order of addition of labeled and unlabeled molecule. This value is in good agreement with the anisotropy expected for fractional saturation θ = 0.25 (Fig. 4 a). Hence, these competition experiments show that the fluorescent label did not interfere with DNA binding. Likewise, the absence of fluorescence quenching during titration suggests an absence of interaction between protein and the fluorescein moiety. Binding site size for the oligonucleotide and for polynucleotide εDNA were the same (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2) which suggests that the product of the reaction between ICP8 and ssDNA is independent of the length of DNA. The binding parameters determined using a 32-mer oligonucleotide can probably be considered a good estimate for those of the reaction with ssDNA. We have not investigated the effect of DNA sequence which is known to influence the association constants of ssDNA-binding proteins. Nevertheless, our results give a qualitative description of the reaction between ICP8 and ssDNA which can be compared with DNA binding studies reported for ICP8 and other proteins. DNA-binding site sizes of 12–22 nt/ICP8 monomer have been previously determined from electron microscope studies (36.Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or from indirect measurements based on the concentration of ICP8 required to optimize protein activity or nuclease protection (2.Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67 (515): 711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.O'Donnell M.E. Elias P.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report direct measurement of the DNA-binding site size of ICP8 in solution using spectroscopic techniques, n = 10 ± 1 nt/ICP8 monomer (Table I). Identical results were observed for binding to ss εDNA (Fig. 1) with NaCl concentrations from 150 to 500 mm or without NaCl in the presence of 10% glycerol as well as for the reaction with a single-stranded 32-mer oligonucleotide (Fig.2). ICP8 binding site size for the reaction with εDNA was independent of salt concentration, 0–500 mm NaCl, indicating a single DNA binding mode as a function of this salt, unlike the case ofE. coli SSB (18.Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Binding of ICP8 to ssDNA stretched the DNA judging from enhanced fluorescence of etheno-modified DNA (Fig. 1). These spectroscopic results are in agreement with electron microscopy experiments showing that ICP8 interacts preferentially with ssDNA to form regular repeating structures that hold DNA in an extended conformation (4.Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The induction of a stretched DNA conformation is found in nucleoprotein filaments of ssDNA-binding proteins gp32 from phage T4 (17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), SSB fromE. coli (38.Kuil M.E. Holmlund K. Vlaanderen C.A. van Grondelle R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8184-8189Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and RPA from yeast (24.Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This extended conformation is a property shared with protein-DNA filaments formed by recombinases such as bacterial RecA (39.Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), UvsX from phage T4 (25.Ando R.A. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and eucaryote Rad51 (27.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6177-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although this fluorescence increase does not depend in a quantitative fashion on DNA length, it is nevertheless a useful qualitative manner to compare conformational changes brought about by various ssDNA-binding proteins. The maximum fluorescence enhancement factor at 25° C of ICP8 (2.9 ± 0.2) was larger than the value reported for ssDNA-binding proteins gp32 (2.0 (17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)), yeast RPA (1.7 (24.Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)), and for inactive RecA protein in the absence of cofactor or in the presence of ADP (2.0 (26.Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)). Larger fluorescence enhancement values are reported for active recombinases in the presence of ATP cofactor at 25° C: UvsX protein (2.0–2.5 (25.Ando R.A. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)); RecA protein (2.8 (21.Cazaux C. Blanchet J.S. Dupuis D. Villani G. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 44: 28799-28804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26.Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)); and Rad51 at 30° C (5.0 (27.Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6177-6182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). There have been reports that the fluorescence enhancement of εDNA varies with the quantity and quality of etheno modification (25.Ando R.A. Morrical S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the fluorescence enhancement of ICP8 and RecA using the same εDNA substrate. Fluorescence increase by ICP8 was indistinguishable from the signal with RecA in the presence of ATPγS (not shown). The ICP8-εDNA complex was stable in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 1). This stability was observed for complexes formed by both titration of protein with DNA and titration of DNA with protein. Furthermore, titrations of εDNA with protein in the presence of 200–500 mm NaCl gave similar binding isotherms as titration of DNA in 150 mm NaCl or in the presence of 10% glycerol without NaCl. We conclude that equilibrium binding occurs in these reaction conditions, and the protein-ssDNA complex cannot be dissociated by high NaCl concentrations. This stability likely reflects a small contribution of electrostatic interactions to binding as observed with oligonucleotide, −δlog(Kω)/δlog([NaCl]) = 2.4 (Fig. 5 and TableIII). In contrast, the nucleoprotein filaments of other ssDNA-binding proteins are readily dissociated by NaCl; these form complexes with polynucleotides that exhibit values of −δlog(Kω)/δlog([NaCl]) in the range of 4–7 (TableIII).

Open table in a new tab Comparison of binding constants of ICP8 with those of other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins shows that ICP8 forms an unusual protein-DNA complex (Table III). The single-stranded binding protein from phage T4, gp32, exhibits high cooperativity and tight binding (16.Newport J.W. Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S.C. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,17.Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As a consequence of high cooperativity, the binding isotherm is sigmoidal which allows gp32 to associate and dissociate from ssDNA upon small changes of protein concentration. High cooperativity and preference for ssDNA rather than RNA provide the thermodynamic basis of the autologous regulation of gp32 transcription. In contrast, the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein, hRPA, displays low cooperativity and tight binding (20.Kim C. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2058-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Consequently it has been suggested that a concentration-dependent “switch” such as found for gp32 is not involved in regulation of hRPA; rather binding of the hRPA heterotrimer to ssDNA may be regulated by other mechanisms that involve phosphorylation and/or protein-protein interactions. The behavior ofE. coli SSB protein is more complex, with multiple DNA binding modes and cooperativities depending on salt concentration (18.Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The high salt form (≥0.2 m NaCl), (SSB)65, binds weakly to poly(dA) with intermediate cooperativity. In comparison with these proteins, ICP8 binds weakly to ssDNA with low cooperativity (Table III). Early studies claimed that the reaction of ICP8 with ssDNA was highly cooperative. However, this conclusion was based on the observation of protein clusters on ssDNA by electron microscopy (4.Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 661-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and on the binding of partially purified ICP8-antibody complexes to ssDNA (3.Lee C.K. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 731-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which may not accurately measure equilibrium binding of the protein. A recent study (40.Dudas K.C. Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 257-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the binding of ICP8 to oligo(dT) by gel mobility assay reported that the reaction was weakly cooperative. However, it is difficult to compare our results with this work since the reaction conditions, binding site size, and method for calculating binding parameters are not the same. The weak DNA binding of ICP8 may be compensated for by its high abundance during viral replication (41.Bayliss G.J. Marsden H.S. Hay J. Virology. 1975; 68: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Alternatively, strong cooperative binding to ssDNA may not be required for the functions of ICP8. For example, electron microscopy studies have shown that ICP8 and the HSV-1 origin binding protein UL9 unwind duplex DNA by a different mechanism than other DNA helicase/single-stranded DNA-binding proteins; DNA and the two proteins first condense and subsequently several kilobases of ssDNA covered with ICP8 are released (36.Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The selective advantage of the unusual ssDNA-binding properties of ICP8 are unknown. We speculate that they could be required for its putative recombinase activity. Homologous recombination is carried out by recombinases in nucleoprotein filaments by a mechanism that has been found in all organisms from phage to man (42.Roca I.A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, recombinases are the only DNA repair proteins with a common domain arrangement in bacteria, archea, and eucaryotes (43.Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This conservation across evolution is likely the result of requirements of the homologous recombination reaction. If this argument is correct, ICP8 which catalyzes strand transfer in vitro (15.Bortner C. Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), might likewise be expected to share some common properties with recombinases that are not found in other ssDNA-binding proteins. We have observed that the ICP8-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament produces higher fluorescence enhancement of εDNA, is more stable in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 1), and exhibits smaller values of δlog(Kω)/δlog([NaCl]) than other well studied ssDNA-binding proteins, gp32, ecSSB, and RPA (Table III). The fluorescence enhancement of ICP8 resembles that reported for active recombinases RecA and Rad51 and indicates that DNA may assume a similar conformation in these filaments. Stability at high NaCl concentrations is likewise a characteristic of both the ICP8 nucleoprotein filament and recombinase filaments in their active conformation. Of course bona fide recombinases also have general characteristics that are not found for ICP8. They form long nucleofilaments with well defined right-handed helical structures (42.Roca I.A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,44.Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. Micron. 1993; 24: 309-324Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas ICP8 nucleoprotein filaments are left-handed and twice as thick as RecA filaments, suggesting that more than one ICP8 molecule may contribute to its width (32.O'Donnell M.E. Elias P. Funnell B.E. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinases but not ICP8 have ATPase activity (1.Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 347-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 42.Roca I.A. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite these and other differences, the protein-DNA complexes of ICP8 and recombinases appear to share some structural and biochemical similarities. Further comparison of ICP8 and recombinases should give important insights into the chemistry of homologous recombination."

This paper reports that two sPLA2 isoforms, group IIA and group V, are in fact expressed by astrocytes. Our studies showed that tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) enhanced the mRNA of both isoforms, but the time courses of enhancement differed; group V was induced much faster than group IIA. Moreover, TNFα stimulated both the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 MAP kinase) signaling pathways in astrocytes. Interestingly, PI 3-kinase activity also was enhanced by TNFα, and NF-κB pathway was involved in mediating its effect. Specific inhibitors were used to show that both extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAP kinase may contribute to the effect of TNFα and that blocking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity fully reversed the effect of TNFα. Furthermore, in astrocytes, TNFα-induced release of sPLA2 activity was partially reversed by thyroid hormone and almost abolished by growth factors. This phenomenon was accompanied by a less marked increase in both group IIA and group V sPLA2 mRNA. In the presence of growth factors, the increase in group V mRNA was inhibited early and transiently, in contrast to what was observed with group IIA, which was more persistently inhibited. Although a transcriptional effect of thyroid hormone or growth factors in astrocytes cannot be definitively excluded, both types of factor interfered with sPLA2 expression in a manner suggesting the existence of regulation of post-transcriptional events.

The latter two isoforms were the most recently discovered. The sPLA2 isoforms share sequence homology with a high cysteine content, several of them (10.Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The sPLA2 thus belong to a growing family of enzymes that have been conserved throughout the evolutionary process. In mammals, a tissue-dependent preeminence of expression has been reported for all sPLA2 isozymes. Nevertheless, their function has yet to be fully elucidated. In man, elevated group IIA sPLA2 activity has been demonstrated, for example, in rheumatoid arthritis exudates and in the serum of patients presenting with septic shock (2.Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of this enzyme is known to have the potential to release arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids (3.Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The arachidonic acid may then act as a precursor in the synthesis of mediators of the inflammatory reaction (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, etc.). Group IIA sPLA2 are also known to be rapidly released from the secretory granules of activated platelets, neutrophils, or mast cells. Group IIA sPLA2 can also be synthesized by mesangial cells, chondrocytes and astrocytes, which have also been implicated in immuno-inflammatory processes (4.Pfeilschifter J. Walker G. Kuntz D. Pignat W. van den Bosch H. Prog. Surg. 1997; 24: 31-37Crossref Google Scholar). For all of those reasons, the group IIA isoform is still referred to as the inflammatory sPLA2. Group V sPLA2 was first identified in cardiac and placental tissue, but is also found in the lungs and liver in man (5.Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2365-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rats (6.Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). More recently, that isoform, and not group IIA as was previously thought, was reported to be expressed by PD388D1macrophages (7.Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Winstead M.V. Tischfield J.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32381-32384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The functional distinction between group IIA and group V sPLA2 remains unclear. However, it would appear that not only group IIA, but also group V sPLA2, could be involved in immuno-inflammatory diseases and processes, leading some authorities to the conclusion that the two isoforms may have redundant function. An increase in phospholipase A2 activities and prostaglandin E2 production has been reported in numerous brain diseases, such as the neurodegenerative diseases, and transient ischemia (8.Bonventre J.V. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1997; 17: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9.Farooqui A.A. Yang H.-C. Rosenberger T.A. Horrocks L.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent results suggest that phospholipases A2 are involved in brain diseases (10.Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E. Li E. Moskowitz M.A. Sapirstein A. Nature. 1997; 390: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 11.Farooqui A.A. Yang H.-C Horrocks L.A. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 30: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little is known about the pathophysiology of sPLA2 in the brain. Although neuronal cells have been reported to produce group IIA sPLA2 (12.Matsuzawa A. Murakami M. Atsumi G. Imai K. Prados P. Inoue K. Kudo I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), in primary neuron cultures, the presence of sPLA2 has been shown to potentiate the neurotoxicity of glutamate (13.Kolko M. DeCoster M.A. Rodriguez E.B. Bazan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32722-32728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Most of the data on cerebral sPLA2 have been obtained ex vivo, in astrocyte cultures (14.Sun G.Y. Hu Z.Y. Prog. Brain Res. 1995; 105: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, sPLA2 production has only been clearly demonstrated in astrocytes (15.Koike K. Yamamoto Y. Otsuka H. Murakami M. Kudo I. Prog. Surg. 1997; 24: 94-103Crossref Google Scholar), although cells crossing the blood-brain barrier presumably also produce sPLA2. In cultured astrocytes, group IIA sPLA2 secretion is stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα), bacterial lipopolysaccharide, intracellular cAMP elevating agents, and phorbol ester tumor promoters, probably through transcriptional activation (16.Oka S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9956-9960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Much less is known about inhibition of sPLA2. In astrocytes, dexamethasone and kinase inhibitor H-7 inhibit the effect of endotoxin while the effect of phorbol esters is obviously antagonized by protein kinase C inhibitors (16.Oka S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9956-9960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many contrasting effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors on the brain have been described, as evidenced by neuron degeneration and survival data. This could also be true for other soluble factors, such as thyroid hormones, the presence of which is crucial during the development of the brain (17.Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.L. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 462-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The contribution of thyroid hormone to brain homeostasis and neuron survival after the development period is currently emerging. Since astrocytes are involved in neuron survival and function, it was of interest to determine whether growth factors and thyroid hormone could interfere with sPLA2 induction in astrocytes. We report herein that the two types of factor inhibited the increase in sPLA2activity induced by TNFα. We have demonstrated that TNFα, in addition to inducing group IIA sPLA2, as has previously been reported in this journal (16.Oka S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9956-9960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also induces the group V isoform in astrocytes. The mRNA induction of both isoforms was decreased in the presence of thyroid hormone or growth factors. For group IIA sPLA2, our data are compatible with the existence of an inhibitory effect occurring at a post-transcriptional level. 1-Hexadecanoyl-2-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (pyrene-phosphatidyl glycerol) was purchased from Interchim.

Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6467-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were cultured as recommended by ATCC. (b) Primary culture astrocytes were obtained from the cerebral hemispheres of 2-day-old Harlan Sprague Dawley rats and cultured as has been previously described (19.Pierre M. Gavaret J.-M. Matricon C. Pomerance M. Jacquemin C. Toru-Delbauffe D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured up to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. At the end of the culture period, 90–95% of the cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive. (c) Rabbit chondrocytes were prepared and cultured, as has been previously described (20.Borge L. Lemare F. Demignot S. Adolphe M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 703-709Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). (d) Mouse C127 cells expressing recombinant group IIA sPLA2, under the control of mouse metallothioneine I promoter, and human metallothioneine 1A gene (21.Roghani A. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), conferring resistance to 10 μm CdCl2, were cultured in DMEM-F12 containing antibiotics and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. (e) Incubation of astrocytes in the presence of hormones, growth factors, and cytokines was performed in DMEM-F12 containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and antibiotics, supplemented with 0.1% essentially thyroid hormone-free bovine serum albumin. The other cells were incubated in the same medium except that the glucose content was 1 g/liter only. Unless otherwise specified, the culture medium was changed at the beginning of the period of incubation with the factors. (f) For the mRNA studies, the culture medium was changed for the incubation medium (see above) once, 18 h before initiating incubation as in e. In consequence, both group IIA and group V sPLA2 mRNA were at a steady state under resting conditions. After centrifugation of the culture medium, in order to pellet the floating cells, sPLA2 activity was measured by incubating an aliquot of the supernatant with 2 nmol of fluorescent substrate, pyrene-phosphatidyl glycerol, in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The fluorescence (measured at 397 nm with excitation at 345 nm) of full substrate hydrolysis was determined using 0.1 unit of sPLA2 activity derived from Naja naja venom. The initial hydrolysis rate of the samples was determined using a spectrofluorometer (model 430, Turner) by calculating the relative linear increase in fluorescence as a function of time at 24 °C (Ministat, Huber). After incubation of astrocytes with factors, total RNA was isolated from the cells using guanidinium thiocyanate denaturation and phenol-chloroform extraction. RNA concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry and its integrity assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide labeling. The synthesis of cDNA was conducted using reverse transcriptase with random hexamer priming. The cDNA was amplified, after determining the optimum PCR conditions (25–30 cycles), withTaq polymerase, using specific pairs of primers for each of the three rat sPLA2 cDNAs studied: for group IIA, 5′-GTGGCAGAGGATCCCCCAAGG-3′ and 5′-GCAACTGGGCGTCTTCCCTTTGCA-3′; for group V, 5′-CAGGGGGCTTGCTAGAACTGAA-3′ and 5′-AAGACGGTTGTAACTCCAGAGG-3′; for group IIC, 5′-GGCATTGCCATCTTCCTTGTCT-3′ and 5′-TAAGCTTGTGGTAGCAGCAGTC-3′. The relative amounts of mRNA were evaluated separately for group IIA and group V sPLA2 using radioactive PCR. The cDNAs were amplified as above in the presence of 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP for 25–30 cycles. The PCR products were purified and, in part, subjected to analysis using agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, to ensure the conformity of the step. The radioactivity incorporated into the purified amplimers was quantified by Cerenkov radiocounting. When all the amplimers had been shown to lie within the linear PCR range at the same number of cycles, the count values were compared with each other for each sPLA2 isoform. Group IIA and V sPLA2 specific radiolabeled probes were synthesized using the PCR method. Before radioactive synthesis, and after a purification step, each PCR product was sequenced in both directions (Applied Biosystems). The sequences were then compared with those theoretically corresponding in the nucleotide data bank (GenBank) and were found to fully match those expected. The radiolabeled probe was synthesized by PCR by amplifying the specific DNA template (that sequenced) of each isoform of rat sPLA2 (284 base pairs for group IIA and 328 base pairs for group V sPLA2) in the presence of the corresponding primers (see above) and 100 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. Before the Northern blot analysis, the radiolabeled probes were purified, incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then immediately plunged into iced water for a few minutes. Total RNA (15–20 μg/lane), extracted as described above, were analyzed using 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nylon filter. The filter was incubated for 15 min in prehybridization buffer, then incubated overnight at 65 °C in the same buffer containing sPLA2 radiolabeled probe (see above). The filter was washed several times with SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl plus 17 mm sodium citrate) at various concentrations and temperatures, until the background radioactivity was sufficiently low. Autoradiography of the filter was then conducted at −80 °C for 18–72 h. The cells were scraped into 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The cells were then homogenized by sonicating for 3 × 3 s on ice and centrifuged at 105,000 × g and at 4 °C for 35 min. The supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Protein quantification was conducted using the method described by Bradford (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Cytosolic proteins were analyzed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel (gradient 7–15%) electrophoresis, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then incubated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% bovine serum albumin, in the presence of primary antibody (1/2,000). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by further incubation with peroxidase-coupled second antibody (1/30,000), chemiluminescence reaction, and autoradiography. Nuclear extracts from treated or control cells were prepared as in Ref. 23.Raju U. Lu R. Noel F. Gumin G.J. Tofilon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24624-24630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and then re-suspended in 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. After centrifuging the cells at 21,000 × g, the pellets were incubated at 4 °C in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. After centrifuging at 21,000 × g, the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Protein quantification was performed as above. Synthetic double-stranded 31-mer oligonucleotide, containing the κB sequences of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (24.Feuillard J. Gouy H. Bismutch G. Lee L.M. Debré P. Körner M. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase. Then, 10 μg of nuclear protein was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 0.1 μCi of radiolabeled probe in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 16% glycerol, and 200 ng/ml poly(dI-dC). Nonspecific binding was determined by incubation in the presence of 0.1 μg/μl non-labeled probe. The samples were analyzed using native polyacrylamide gel (4%) electrophoresis at 150 V for 2 h in 90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA. The gel was dried immediately afterward, and autoradiography conducted (Instant Imager, Packard). PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described in Auclair et al. (66.Auclair M. Vigouroux C. Desbois-Mouthon C. Deibener J. Kaminski P. Lascols O. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Caron M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 3197-3206PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in a lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. 500 μg of protein from the lysates were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 1.5 μg of anti-p85 PI 3-kinase-subunit antibody, then further for 16 h with protein A-Sepharose beads. After washing twice in phosphate-buffered saline, twice in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 500 μm LiCl, then twice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol, and 2.5 μg of phosphatidylserine, and were incubated for 25 min at 4 °C. Then, 5 mm MgCl2 and 15 μm ATP (20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were added and the beads were further incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. At the end of the incubation, the lipids were extracted in HCl-acidified chloroform/methanol (1: 1), and analyzed by silica gel (first treated with 1% potassium oxalate) thin layer chromatography, with chloroform/methanol/NH4OH (9: 7: 2) as driving solution, then submitted to autoradiography. About 250,000 DITNC1 cells were seeded in six-well dishes. After culturing them for 24 h, cells were submitted to transfection procedure, using the calcium phosphate precipitate method, with both a plasmid construct containing luciferase reporter gene under the control of IGK3 promoter, the activity of which is dependent on NF-κB binding, and a β-galactosidase mammalian cell expression vector, to evaluate the yield of transfection in each well. After 24 h, the cells were incubated for 8 h with the test agents, then luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were determined. Luciferase/β-galactosidase activity ratio was calculated for each well. As has been previously reported (25.Tong W. Hu Z.Y. Sun G.Y. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1995; 25: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), sPLA2 activity was detected in the culture medium from DITNC1 astrocytes (Fig. 1). The amount of sPLA2 activity detected with resting DITNC1 cells varied from one experiment to another (from about 10–100 pmol/min/mg of protein), increasing with cell confluence. Following incubation of those cells with 100 ng/ml TNFα, the sPLA2 activity in the culture medium increased after a lag time of at least 6 h, peaking (from 15-fold up to 100-fold the basal activity) between 24 and 48 h after addition (data not shown). However, short duration incubation (<1 h) of DITNC1 cells with TNFα was sufficient for an increase in sPLA2 activity to be observed at 24 h (data not shown). In the presence of (3,5,3′)-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), the active form of thyroid hormone, an increase in protein content was observed. This has already been reported in primary cultured astrocytes (26.Gavaret J.-M. Toru-Delbauffe D. Baghdassarian-Chalaye D. Pomerance M. Pierre M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1991; 58: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An increase was also observed with TNFα, known to induce astrocyte proliferation (27.Tejada-Berges T. Yong V.W. Brain Res. 1994; 653: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to TNFα, with T3 (1 nm or higher), the sPLA2 activity released was 25% lower, in comparison to that of resting cells. Moreover, concentration-dependent inhibition (over the range of one to two thirds) of the TNFα-induced sPLA2 activity was observed with T3 (Fig. 1). This inhibitory effect was maximum for 1–10 nm T3 where activity was 50% lower on average. T3-induced inhibition of sPLA2 activity was observed only in the presence of cells, i.e. no inhibitory effect (even at 1 μm T3) was observed by incubating this hormone with conditioned medium from resting or TNFα-treated cells (data not shown). Moreover, several hours were required for T3 to induce inhibition of both basal and TNFα-induced sPLA2 activity (data not shown). We next used CGS23425, a pharmacological compound structurally related to thyroid hormones, and designed to simulate the effect of T3 by binding to its receptors (28.Taylor A.H. Stephan Z.F. Steele R.E. Wong N.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A dose-inhibitory response effect on TNFα-induced sPLA2 activity was also observed with CGS23425 (data not shown). Three groups of MAP kinases have been identified: Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAP kinase. The various isoforms of MAP kinases are known to be activated through dual threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinases (29.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The stimulation of Erk activity by EGF and bFGF has already been characterized in primary cultured astrocytes (30.Tournier C. Pomerance M. Gavaret J.-M. Pierre M. Glia. 1994; 10: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Exposure of DITNC1 cells to EGF or bFGF was followed by an increase in dual phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2. The stimulation induced by bFGF was less potent (Fig.2 A). The phophorylation was clearly correlated with an increase in the phosphotyrosine content of Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 2 A). EGF also stimulated the phosphorylation of Jnk1 and Jnk2, but more transiently (Fig.2 A). A basal level of dual phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was observed, but neither EGF nor bFGF enhanced it (data not shown). Both basal and TNFα-induced sPLA2 activity were decreased by incubation of DITNC1 cells with the growth factors (Fig.2 B). The magnitude of inhibition was 60–85% in the presence of EGF, 70–95% in the presence of bFGF, and always more than 90% with both together. In order to check whether this growth factor effect was specific of cytokine-specific pathway, or not, we incubated cells with forskolin, known to stimulate the adenylyl cyclase catalytic subunit. Indeed, cAMP has been reported to modulate group IIA sPLA2 expression in various cell types, including primary cultured astrocytes (16.Oka S. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9956-9960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was accompanied by an increase (more than 2-fold) in sPLA2 activity in DITNC1 cells. Fig. 2 B shows that the effect of forskolin was also decreased by incubation with growth factors. Furthermore, although the growth factor inhibition of TNFα-induced sPLA2 activity was very potent, the inhibition was additive when cells were exposed to both T3 and growth factors, simultaneously (Fig. 2 C). With the aim of determining whether growth factors exerted their inhibitory effect via the Erk pathway, we incubated DITNC1 cells with PD098059 (31.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 92: 7686-7689Crossref Scopus (2582) Google Scholar), which is an inhibitor of MEK, the MAP kinase kinase activating Erk (32.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). The incubation of DITNC1 cells with 30 μm PD098059 for 1 h effectively blocked the growth factor-induced phosphorylation of Erk (data not shown). The pretreatment, which partially inhibited the effect of TNFα, failed, however, to free sPLA2 activity from inhibition by EGF and/or bFGF (data not shown). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has been reported to mediate growth factor signaling in astrocytes (33.Pomerance M. Gavaret J.-M. Breton M. Pierre M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When pre-incubated with DITNC1 cells, LY294002, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, the increase in sPLA2 activity induced by TNFα was fully reversed. Wortmannin is another PI 3-kinase inhibitor in astrocytes (34.Pahan K. Raymond J.R. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although less than with LY294002, an inhibitory effect of wortmannin was also observed. Part of the discrepancy between the magnitude of effect of the two inhibitors might be related to the molecular unstability reported for wortmannin with cells (35.Kimura K. Hattori S. Ka"
https://openalex.org/W1598140958,"During transcription initiation byEscherichia coli RNA polymerase, a fraction of the homogeneous enzyme population has been kinetically shown to form two types of nonproductive complexes at some promoters: moribund complexes, which produce only abortive transcripts, and fully inactive ternary complexes (Kubori, T., and Shimamoto, N. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 256, 449–457). Here we report biochemical isolation of the complexes arrested at the λP R promoter and an analysis of their structure by DNA and protein footprintings. We found that the isolated promoter-arrested complexes retain a stoichiometric amount of ς70 subunit. Exonuclease III footprints of the arrested complexes are backtracked compared with that of the binary complex, and KMnO4 footprinting reveals a decrease in the melting of DNA in the promoter region. Protein footprints of the retained ς70 have shown a more exposed conformation in region 3, compared with binary complexes. This feature is similar to that of the complexes arrested in inactive state during transcription elongation, indicating the existence of a common inactivating mechanism during transcription initiation and elongation. The possible involvement of the promoter arrest in transcriptional regulation is discussed. During transcription initiation byEscherichia coli RNA polymerase, a fraction of the homogeneous enzyme population has been kinetically shown to form two types of nonproductive complexes at some promoters: moribund complexes, which produce only abortive transcripts, and fully inactive ternary complexes (Kubori, T., and Shimamoto, N.

This feature is similar to that of the complexes arrested in inactive state during transcription elongation, indicating the existence of a common inactivating mechanism during transcription initiation and elongation. The possible involvement of the promoter arrest in transcriptional regulation is discussed. Transcription initiation has been conventionally supposed to consist of a sequential multistep reaction, starting with formation of a binary preinitiation complex and ending after clearance of the RNA polymerase from the promoter (1.deHaseth P.L. Zupancic M.L. Record Jr., M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 180: 3019-3025Crossref Google Scholar). A strict interpretation of this model predicts that 1 mol of polymerase-promoter complex synthesizes a stoichiometric amount of full-length transcript in a single-round transcription reaction. Results from the studies of the λP R and lacUV5 promoters, however, contradict this prediction; the amount of full-length transcripts synthesized was significantly less than stoichiometric (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, kinetic analyses have suggested the existence of inactivation during transcription initiation and a relationship between the inactivation and abortive synthesis (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Kubori T.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A plausible model of initiation at such promoters proposes two mutually exclusive pathways: a productive pathway leading to the synthesis of full-length transcripts and a dead-end pathway in which enzyme is likely to be arrested at these promoters (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol.

Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). During initiation from a modified λP R promoter, λP RAL, a homogeneous preparation of holoenzyme generates different complexes in these different pathways (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Two types of transcription complexes can be kinetically distinguished in the dead-end pathway (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1380-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The moribund complexes keep producing short transcripts for more than 20 min, even after the completion of synthesis of all full-length transcripts. They are therefore the major source of abortive transcripts at these promoters (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1380-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although it is still unclear whether small amounts of abortive transcripts are synthesized in the productive pathway or not. Moribund complexes cannot escape from the abortive cycle to make full-length transcripts; rather, they slowly convert into the second type of arrested complexes. The second type still retains a transcript of abortive size but has no detectable elongating activity, thus constituting the “dead-end” of the pathway. This complex is thus tentatively called the dead-end complex here. 1These complexes retaining various lengths of short transcripts have been denoted as inactivated complexes in our previous publications (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1380-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We rename them dead-end complexes because they make the arrested pathway dead-end. However, “dead-end complexes” have first been documented in Ref. 16.Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar as inactive elongation complexes formed from different promoters. The relationship between these inactive initiation and elongation complexes is not known. It is important to know what structural differences exist between the complexes in these two different pathways. We here report physical separation of initiation complexes arrested at the promoter and analysis of their structures by DNA and protein footprinting. The complexes arrested at the promoter share a common structural feature with arrested complexes formed during transcription elongation, irrespective of the presence of ς70, suggesting the existence of a common basic mechanism of inactivation during different stages of transcription. Immobilized templates were prepared essentially as described earlier (12.Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cell. 1997; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and used as before (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), except that 0.025% Tween 20 was included in the transcription buffer to reduce nonspecific adsorption of proteins to the beads. In exonuclease III footprinting experiments, 35 nm holoenzyme was preincubated at 37 °C with 12 nm32P-labeled λP RAL73 DNA for 10 min in T buffer (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and then 40 μg/ml heparin was added to trap free enzyme originated from nonspecific complex. Substrates (GTP, CTP, and UTP) were added 15 s later, if necessary, and 40 units of exonuclease III (Toyobo, Tokyo) were added at different time points. After 4 min of digestion, the reaction was stopped by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and loaded onto an 8% sequencing gel. The reactions with KMnO4 were carried out for 1 min. All of the other reagents and methods, including KMnO4 footprinting (5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and protein footprinting of ς70 (12.Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cell. 1997; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), have been described elsewhere (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In order to isolate complexes arrested at the promoter, we used a template DNA, λP RAL73, which has a λP R promoter and a 73-base pair A-less initially transcribed sequence incorporating a NotI site, as indicated (Fig. 1 A). The template was immobilized at its downstream end, so that the promoter-containing fragment could be separated from the promoter-distal fragment by NotI digestion and a brief centrifugation (12.Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cell. 1997; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The template was preincubated with a saturating concentration of holoenzyme for 10 min at 37 °C, and the excess enzyme was removed by washing (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transcription was then initiated with substrates containing no ATP. Transcription from this template DNA produced abortive transcripts up to 13 nucleotides in length and a 73-mer stalled product (Fig.1 B, lane 1), while the template digested with NotI produced run-off transcripts around 34-mer (lane 3). Under these conditions, the synthesis of the full-length transcripts is completed within 5 min (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1380-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in lane 2, transcription was first carried out with unlabeled substrates for 20 min, and template was then digested in situ withNotI. Finally, the promoter-containing fragment was separated from the immobilized fragment by centrifugation and collected. After adding substrates containing the labeled initiating nucleotide, [γ-32P]GTP, this material was found to produce exclusively abortive transcripts, proving that the collected promoter DNA fragment contains no productive complexes. Therefore, moribund complexes, which have previously been defined kinetically (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), were recovered on the promoter-containing fragment. Taking into account the efficiency of recovery of the complexes during isolation, the abortive synthesis was reduced by 75–85%. This is consistent with the previous observation of a slow conversion of moribund complexes into dead-end complexes (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Next we analyzed the subunit content of the enzymes bound to the promoter-proximal and promoter-distal DNA fragments (Fig.1 C). In the absence of transcription, the enzyme bound to the promoter contained a stoichiometric amount of ς70(lane 1). The proteins seen in lane 2 were nonspecifically adsorbed to the resin, as judged from the experiment by using DNA-free resin (not shown). After 20 min of transcription, the supernatant (promoter-proximal) fraction contained enzyme with a stoichiometric amount of ς70(lane 3), proving that the complexes arrested at the promoter still retained ς70. The ς70content of the enzyme stalled at +73 was very small (lane 4), consistent with the expected loss of ς70from the elongation complexes. According to kinetic analysis (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), these arrested complexes are a mixture of moribund complexes still engaged in abortive cycles and dead-end complexes that retain short transcripts but lack elongation activities. Next we investigated the structure of moribund and the dead-end complexes on the λP RAL73 DNA using exonuclease III and KMnO4 footprintings. In the absence of transcription, exonuclease III digestion formed footprints of the binary complex near +18 on the nontemplate strand (Fig.2 A, lane 4) and close to −39 on the template strand (Fig.2 B, lane 4). Transcription was initiated by adding substrates, excluding ATP, to the binary complex. Footprinting agents were then added at different time points. In the presence of RNA synthesis, the exonuclease III footprints moved to approximately +80 on the nontemplate strand and near +60 on the template. These boundaries represent the elongation complex, stalled at +73 due to the exclusion of ATP. In the promoter region, another complex was detected. It was noted that exonuclease III cleavage boundaries between −6 and +10 on the nontemplate strand appeared at later time points (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5–10). These footprints are backtracked by 8–24 base pairs compared with the binary complex (lane 4). The scattered downstream edges of these footprints indicate the existence of a heterogeneous population of moribund and dead-end complexes, which might reflect the heterogeneity in the transcripts retained by these complexes. Alternatively, the observed backtracked footprints may not indicate the real positions of the inactivated complexes. Instead, the footprints may present a weak physical block against exonuclease III, which may gradually push them upstream. The promoter arrest is composed of a slow and rapid phases. The amounts of abortive transcripts increase in time but gradually level off in this condition. The exponential time course has a rate constant of 0.11 min−1 (Fig. 3 A), and this has been assigned to the rate constant of the formation of the dead-end complex (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The disappearance of a species incorporating the initiating nucleotide, presumably open binary complex, was measured by a pulse-labeling technique (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1380-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and has a rate constant of 0.30 min−1 (Fig. 3 A). The time course of appearance of the backtracked footprints contains a slow rising phase and sometimes a rapid rising phase (Fig. 3 A), and the rate constants of these phases agree with those found in the kinetics of the promoter arrest. Therefore, these backtracked footprints are likely to belong to the two types of complexes arrested at the promoter, moribund complexes and the dead-end complexes. The smaller contribution of the rapid component suggests that moribund complexes are less efficiently footprinted, presumably due to their dissociation during the exonuclease digestion. Surprisingly, no footprints of these complexes were observed on the template strand in the relevant positions (between −50 and −39 inlanes 5–10 of Fig. 2 B). This suggests either that this strand is more exposed in these complexes or that the complexes dissociated when attacked from upstream by the nuclease. In any case, the interaction with the template strand in two arrested complexes is significantly different from that in the binary complex. Footprinting with KMnO4 detects the DNA melting in transcription complexes. Here, the thymine residues at −10, −7, −4, and −3 normally showed permanganate sensitivity in open binary complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 13). The sensitivities of these thymine residues gradually reduced with time after the addition of substrates, while a new “bubble” appeared around +65 (lanes 14–19). In contrast to exonuclease III footprinting, KMnO4footprinting traced the movement of productive complexes better as distinct bubbles: −10 to +4 at 15 s (lane 14), very scattered between +2 and +65 at 1 min (lane 15), and mostly around +65 after 5 min (lanes 16–19). The time courses of bubble collapse in KMnO4 footprinting at −10 to −3 are similar to the disappearance of open complex, the fast reaction with the rate constant of 0.30 min−1. The level of footprinting at −10 to −3 was still significantly above the background at 10 min (comparelanes 12 and 16). Therefore, moribund complex is likely to be partially open, and dead-end complex is less open. The change in protein conformations upon the promoter arrest was investigated by protein footprinting of ς70 whose mutations in the conserved region 3.1 have been shown to affect the arrest (5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The complexes arrested at the promoter were prepared using the same immobilized template, and hydroxyl radical cleavage of ς70 was carried out under a single-cut condition as described previously (12.Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cell. 1997; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When compared with the binary complexes, no changes were detected in the N-terminal half of ς70. The most prominent change was observed in region 3 (the domain a in Fig.4). Region 3 is exposed in free form but becomes protected in holoenzyme and binary complex (Ref. 12.Nagai H. Shimamoto N. Genes Cell. 1997; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; Fig. 4). The promoter-arrested complexes showed a protection intermediate between those of free ς70 and binary complexes. In addition, the −35 interacting domain (domain b) was reproducibly shown to be less protected in these promoter-arrested complexes than in binary complexes. One of the possible interpretations is that these complexes have weaker interaction with −35 region of the promoter than the binary complexes, although other interpretations are equally possible. In general terms, the promoter-arrested complexes are a mixture of moribund and the dead-end complexes. We have more likely footprinted the dead-end rather than moribund complexes, because more than half of moribund complexes are converted into the dead-end complexes during our preparation longer than 10 min. Since moribund complexes might be dissociated during the preparation process, there could be a contribution of signals from the resultant free holoenzyme. Nevertheless, this does not vitiate our overall conclusion, because an altered conformation of the arrested complexes was detected as increased sensitivity in regions where free holoenzyme and binary complexes show a similar or higher degree of protection. The role of region 3 is not fully understood, but it is located within a short distance from the initiating nucleotide and RNA 3′-end (13.Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting its involvement in the initiation process. A mutation in this region decreases the level of accumulation of moribund complexes (5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Presumably, the increased sensitivity of this region to hydroxide radical attack in the arrested complexes arises from the displacement of this region from the active center, which in turn could be a reason for the inactivation. Here we have presented biochemical evidence for the existence of a branched pathway involving inactivation during transcription initiation. The results obtained agree well with those of previous kinetic studies. Previously, the existence of moribund complexes has been demonstrated kinetically by a persistent production of abortive transcripts after completion of full-length synthesis (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This persistence also indicates the existence of binary complex that is destined to abort its incoming transcript, because abortive synthesis turns over in multiple rounds without dissociation of holoenzyme from a promoter (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11.Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). A possible interpretation is that both binary and ternary complexes in the moribund state share a common feature in their structures that is maintained throughout the abortive cycle. In this study, the complexes arrested at the promoter were isolated and were shown to produce only abortive transcripts. By using immobilized template in a batch process (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or in a minute column (4.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1380-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), it has been shown that the dead-end complexes (inactivated ternary complexes) retaining short transcripts are formed slowly at a rate of 0.1 min−1 (Fig. 3 A). Although the structural difference between moribund and dead-end complexes is less clear because of their transient nature, we have shown here distinctive characteristics of these complexes arrested at the promoter: the exonuclease III footprint is backtracked, the −10 region is less open, the interaction with the template strand of DNA is weak or absent, and the conformation of region 3 of ς70 in these complexes is more like that of the free ς70. The overall results are consistent with the view that the loss of elongation activity of these promoter-arrested complexes is due to inappropriate alignment of the catalytic site, RNA, and DNA. During elongation, the loss of activity is known as elongation arrest (14.Arndt K.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 79-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15.Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and is caused by backtracking of the enzyme and extrusion of the 3′-end of the RNA from the active site (16.Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This movement is concerted with a loss of 8–9-nucleotide base pairing between the 3′-end of a transcript and the template strand (18.Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GreB relieves the arrest by restoring the 3′-end of transcript at the catalytic center (17.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1755-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 18.Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Burukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 20.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15329-15338Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The backtracking of dead-end complexes during initiation, discovered here, may share these characteristics of a complex arrested during elongation. We speculate that the inactivation during initiation could similarly result from an intrinsically weak hybridization of short RNA transcripts to the DNA. Furthermore, Gre factors reduce abortive synthesis at promoters including λP R (21.Erie D.A. Hajeiseyedjavadi O. Young M. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1992; 262: 867-873Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and enhance productive transcription from weak promoters (22.Feng G.H. Lee D.N. Wang D. Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22282-22294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Indeed, Gre factors also inhibit the promoter arrest at the λP RAL promoter, 2R. Sen, H. Nagai, and N. Shimamoto, unpublished results. suggesting that Gre factors may also rearrange transcripts at the catalytic center during initiation. A more striking similarity is found in the generation of branched pathways due to misincorporation. In elongation, misincorporation leads to a branched pathway, forming a kinetic trap that can be relieved by GreA (20.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15329-15338Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The biological significance of this branching pathway during elongation is believed to be its ability to maintain high fidelity in transcription by preventing further elongation of misincorporated transcripts (18.Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15329-15338Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In initiation, moribund complexes also commit misincorporation due to slippage at the λP RAL promoter (2.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2640-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is also inhibited by the Gre factors.2 Furthermore, the factors introduce reversibility between otherwise irreversible branched pathways, and a similar introduction of reversibility has been found as an effect of a mutation in region 3 of ς70 (5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The fact that moribund complex can elongate short transcript means that the spatial arrangement among the catalytic center, template DNA, and 3′-OH of nascent transcript is similar to the one in productive complex, at least during a limited time period. The changes as fast as several minutes in footprints near the promoter (Fig. 2 A), however, indicate that interaction between DNA and holoenzyme is altered in the moribund complex. Since a back and forth movement of RNA polymerase occurs at an arrested site in elongation (20.Komissarova N. Kashlev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15329-15338Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), an interesting model for moribund complexes would be a group of complexes alternating between active and inactive configurations, in which a correct arrangement for elongation is occasionally attained. This hypothesis could explain the slow elongation rate, weaker affinity for substrate nucleotides, and frequent release of transcripts, which are all characteristics of moribund complexes. An alternative model for moribund complex is that a large bend of DNA brings both the +1-position and upstream DNA into the same complex. In the both models, dead-end complex may be a stably backtracked complex with an improper positioning of the 3′-OH of its transcript, which is harmonized with the observed high stability of the complex (3.Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the branching in initiation is not yet clear, but a contribution to regulation has been suggested. In vivo, blocking of many promoters by dead-end complexes would be lethal, and probably transcription factors including the Gre proteins prevent their accumulation. In fact, transcription of more than 200 genes is reduced in a double-disrupted strain of greA andgreB, and the reduction seems to occur in initiation in the majority of cases, raising the possibility that the present mechanism is working at some endogenous genes. 3T. Kubori, M. Susa, and N. Shimamoto, unpublished results. The mechanism preventing initiation complexes from being arrested at the λP RAL promoter is common for a mutant ς70 (5.Sen R. Nagai H. Hernandez V.J. Shimamoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9872-9877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Gre factors,2 and for CRP at themalT promoter (24.Tagami H. Aiba H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25.Tagami H. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7202-7207Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), increasing the rate of interconversion of binary complexes between the productive and nonproductive pathways. This generality suggests that the existence of these two pathways is biologically significant as a component of the overall regulatory mechanism of transcription initiation. This hypothesis has to be tested for other regulatory systems in future. We are grateful to Dr. R. S. Hayward, Dr. T. Gaal, Dr. R. Gourse, and Dr. B. Landick for critically reading the manuscript and for stimulating discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1971611954,"The inhibition of proteinases by serpins involves cleavage of the serpin, acylation, and translocation of the proteinase. To see whether acylation precedes or follows translocation, we have investigated the pH dependence of the interaction of fluorescein isothiocyanate-elastase with rhodamine α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) using two independent methods: (i) kinetics of fluorescence energy transfer which yields k 2,f, the rate constant for the fluorescently detected decay of the Michaelis-type complex (Mellet, P., Boudier, C., Mély, Y., and Bieth, J.

There are now more than 130 serpin entries in the Swiss-Prot data bank originating mainly from eukaryotic organisms but also from some viruses. In higher organisms they are present extracellularly but also in various intracellular compartments. A large number of these proteins are active serine proteinase inhibitors (1.Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but inhibition of some cysteine proteinases has also been reported (2.Schick C. Pemberton P.A. Shi G.P. Kamachi Y. Cataltepe S. Bartuski A.J. Gornstein E.R. Brömme D. Chapman H.A. Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of the inhibition of proteinases by serpins is the formation of an irreversible inhibitory complex. The structure of native serpins includes a long flexible and exposed reactive site loop anchored to a highly conserved scaffold made of nine α-helices and three β-sheets (3.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Some non-inhibited proteinases cleave the exposed loop, which inserts into β-sheet A as a new β-strand (4.Löbermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Inhibited proteinases form a SDS-stable complex with serpins, which is probably an acylenzyme (5.Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 6.Wilczynska M. Fa M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6375-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) between the carbonyl group of the P1 site of the loop and the catalytic serine of the proteinase. During the time separating the formation of the first binding complex and the formation of the final complex, a conformational change leading to the translocation of the proteinase was observed (8.Mellet P. Boudier C. Mély Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The location of the proteinase within the stable complex is still a matter of debate (9.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.I. Johansson L.B. Ny T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Only the x-ray crystallography of the complex, not available at present, would reveal precisely how the irreversible complex is held together and at which site the proteinase finally binds. Proteolysis may be regulated by another type of inhibitors, the canonical inhibitors. By contrast with serpins, these smaller proteins have a rigid and short reactive site loop that forms a reversible lock-and-key complex with proteinases. The adaptive advantages by which evolution has selected serpins rather than canonical inhibitors in many regulatory processes are presently not easy to understand. Canonical inhibitors may have loose or strict specificities and low or high affinities for proteinases. Many of them have such lowK i values that the inhibition may be pseudo-irreversible. Thus, irreversible inhibition is not a unique feature of serpins. Similarly, the modulation of the activity by an effector like heparin extensively studied with the serpin antithrombin III (12.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrel R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) has also been observed with the canonical mucus proteinase inhibitor (13.Mellet P. Ermolieff J. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, serpins are large inhibitors that are more sensitive than canonical inhibitors to denaturation and to point mutations even at amino acids distant from the reactive loop (reviewed in Ref. 14.Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, serpins have been selected by evolution to regulate delicate proteolytic events like the blood coagulation cascade, the complement cascade, or fibrinolysis. It is perhaps the complicated multistep process leading to the irreversible complex that is the basis of the specificity of serpin inhibitors. There are at least three steps in the inhibition process by serpins. Each of these steps will decide on the choice of the proteinase and on its fate. The first reversible binding step is governed by the equilibrium dissociation constant for the given proteinase-serpin pair. Several examples covering a wide range of equilibrium dissociation constants have been described in the literature, indicating that this step is effectively used to discriminate the target proteinases. It is important to note that from this step on, the proteinase activity is inhibited (15.Duranton J. Adam C. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11239-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The second known step is acylation. The rate of acylation will depend on pH conditions, but, more significantly in physiological conditions, it will be specific of the serpin-proteinase pair. Since acylation is an irreversible step, the lifetime of the reversibly bound complex will depend on the acylation rate. Thus, acylation is another way to subtly regulate the inhibition of proteinases by shortening or expanding the time during which the complex is reversible and may be dissociated by surrounding substrate molecules. The conformational change that leads to the translocation of the proteinase may also be a way of regulating the inhibition, unique to serpins. Recently, we have described a new method combining stopped-flow kinetics and detection of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between FITC1-labeled elastase and tetramethylrhodamine-labeled α1PI (8.Mellet P. Boudier C. Mély Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This enabled us to detect the sequential appearance of two complexes, a reversible one,EIM and an irreversible one,EI2,f, each characterized by a distinct interchromophore distance. E+I ⇌k−1k1 EIM →k2,f EI2,f SCHEME 1The kinetic constants for the formation and disappearance ofEIM were as follows: k 1 = 1.5 × 106m−1s−1, k −1 = 0.58 s−1, and k 2,f = 0.13 s−1, the latter being the rate constant for the translocation of elastase. However, several questions remained unanswered about the translocation step. 1) Is the translocation of the proteinase triggered by the cleavage of the serpin reactive site loop? 2) Is translocation rate-limiting or is it preceded by another step that controls it (i.e. is acylation a prerequisite for translocation)? 3) After which step is the enzyme-inhibitor binding irreversible? This paper attempts to answer these questions. Elastase was isolated according to the procedure of Shotton (16.Shotton D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 113-140Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) with an additional purification step on S-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and active site titrated as described previously (17.Boudier C. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4370-4375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant α1PI and eglin c expressed inEscherichia coli were obtained from Novartis (Basel) and were titrated with human neutrophil elastase (17.Boudier C. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4370-4375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Faller B. Dirrig S. Rabaud M. Bieth J.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Buffer solutions at pH 5.5, 6, 6.5, and 7.1 were made with 50 mm MES and 0.15 m NaCl. Buffer solutions at pH 7, 7.5, 8, and 8.5 were made with 50 mm HEPES and 0.15 m NaCl. Anhydro-elastase was prepared by alcali treatment of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride-treated elastase (20 mg) as described by Ako et al. (19.Ako H. Foster R.J. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It was isolated by affinity chromatography as described by Williams et al. (20.Williams H.R. Lin T.Y. Navia M.A. Springer J.P. Hoogsteen K. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), except that the column was made with eglin c instead of turkey ovomucoid inhibitor. The affinity gel was prepared by coupling 100 mg of eglin c with 0.5 g of epoxy-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fractions of elastase that retained affinity for eglin c but had negligible catalytic activity were pooled. The pooled sample retained less than 0.09% of the activity expected from a sample of elastase with the same absorbance at 280 nm. Labeling of elastase with FITC (Molecular Probes), of α1PI with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes), and of eglin c with the succinimidyl derivative of tetramethylrhodamine (Molecular Probes) were done as described previously (8.Mellet P. Boudier C. Mély Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Anhydro-elastase was labeled with FITC in the same conditions as elastase. The tentative concentration of the stock solution of FITC-anhydro-elastase was measured by comparing its absorbance at 280 and 495 nm with that of a titrated solution of active FITC-elastase. The absorbances at 280 and 495 nm gave concentrations of 3.1 × 10−5 and 2.6 × 10−5m, respectively. Since a more precise value was not needed, we arbitrarily used a concentration value of 3 × 10−5m for all experiments. 5.9 mg of the synthetic P1-P14peptide Ac-Thr-Glu-Ala-Ala-Gly-Ala-Met-Phe-Leu-Glu-Ala-Ile-Val-Met (Neosystems, France) was added to 1.5 ml of a 105 mmsolution of TMR-α1PI in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The mixture was incubated for 60 h at 37 °C in the presence of sodium azide and dialyzed against the above buffer. Peptide insertion was considered complete since no residual inhibitory activity on elastase could be detected. Absorbance at 555 nm was used to determine the peptide-inserted TMR-α1PI concentration. The initial rates of Suc-Ala3-pNA (Bachem) hydrolysis by FITC-elastase were measured spectrophotometrically at 410 nm in the buffered solutions described above. The concentration of Suc-Ala3-pNA was varied between 0.216 and 2.16 mm in the presence of a final concentration of 1%N-methylpyrrolidone. The FITC-elastase concentration was 3 × 10−8m throughout. At each pHK m and Vm were obtained through non-linear least-square fits of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Kinetics of interaction of FITC-elastase or FITC-anhydro-elastase with TMR-α1PI or TMR-eglin c were monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from fluorescein to tetramethylrhodamine using a Bio-Logic SF3 stopped flow apparatus with a dead time of 1.7 ms (Bio-Logic, Claix, France). The concentrations were 8 × 10−7m for FITC-elastase and FITC-anhydro-elastase and 8 × 10−6m for TMR-α1PI and TMR-eglin c. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 450 nm (monochromator) and 515 nm (Melles-Griot interferential filter), respectively. The rate of inhibition was measured by adding elastase to a mixture of α1PI and substrate and recording the release of product as a function of time. Mixing and recording were done with the above stopped-flow apparatus. For comparison purposes FITC-labeled elastase was used in these experiments, although its fluorescence properties were not needed. Its concentration was 1/10 or less the concentration of the inhibitor to maintain pseudo-first order conditions. The substrate was 2 mm Suc-Ala3-pNA in the presence of a final concentration of 1% N-methylpyrrolidone. At each pH the rate of inhibition was measured with initial concentrations of α1PI varying between 1 × 10−6m and 5 × 10−5m. Spectra were performed on a DASM-4 microcalorimeter. For analysis and integration, the software ORIGIN (Microcal Inc.) was used. The thermograms were recorded in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 with a protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. The heating rate was 1 °C/min between 20 and 120 °C. In proteolysis by serine proteinases, the acylation and deacylation steps are controlled by the ionization state of the histidyl residue of the catalytic triad. Thus, both steps are pH-dependent. The extent of the variation of the catalytic constant by pH is specific to the proteinase and to the buffer system used. Hence, as a control experiment K m andk cat for Suc-Ala3-pNA hydrolysis by FITC-elastase were determined within the pH range 5.5–8.5. The K m data will be used later in this paper. Fig. 1 shows thatk cat increases 18-fold over this pH range. This was done by measuring the time-dependent change in fluorescence energy transfer upon mixing FITC-elastase and TMR-α1PI with a stopped-flow apparatus. As shown previously (8.Mellet P. Boudier C. Mély Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the reaction of FITC-elastase with TMR-α1PI quenches the fluorescence of FITC and enhances that of TMR, indicating donor-acceptor energy transfer. Also, binding of unlabeled elastase or α1PI with labeled partners only marginally affected the fluorescence of the latter, indicating that the fluorescence changes are associated with nonradiative energy transfer. We observed two consecutive first-order reactions: the appearance of EIM governed byk obs =k 1[I]0 +k −1 and the conversion ofEIM into EI2,fgoverned by k 2,f (see Scheme 1). All experiments were done using [I]0 = 10 [E]0 = 8 × 10−6m, which yields nearly saturation of the enzyme as anEIM complex and hence the highest amplitude at pH 7.4 (8.Mellet P. Boudier C. Mély Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Under these concentration conditions, we were able to follow the reaction down to pH 5.5 despite an important loss in the quantum yield of fluorescein. At all pH values we observed the same biphasic trace as described previously. Fig.2 illustrates this observation with two examples, one at pH 8.5, the other one at pH 5.5. The difference in the amplitudes of the signal is mainly due to changes in the quantum yield of fluorescein with pH but also to the variations of the settings of the detector. k obs did not significantly vary with pH (data not shown), suggesting that formation ofEIM does not involve ionic interactions. Interestingly, k 2,f was also pH-independent from pH 5.5 to 8.5 (Fig.3).Figure 3Plot of thek 2,f (Scheme 1)versus pH. Thek 2,f values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of the second exponential phase from the fluorescence transfer traces obtained at each pH. Two examples of such traces are shown in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Insertion of a 14-mer peptide corresponding to the P1 to P14 sequence of the reactive site loop into β-sheet A of serpins is known to change them from inhibitors to substrates by preventing loop insertion (21.Schulze A.J. Frohnert P.W. Engh R.A. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7560-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As a control experiment and to investigate the nature of the rearrangement monitored by our fluorescence transfer method, we observed the reaction of FITC-elastase with 14-mer peptide-inserted TMR-α1PI at pH 7.5 and at concentrations identical to those used with free TMR-α1PI. In Fig.4, three steps are visible: (i) a fast exponential decrease in fluorescence corresponding to the formation of the initial Michaelis-type complex, (ii) a steady-state phase corresponding to the expected turnover of peptide-bound TMR-α1PI whose concentration is 10-fold higher than that of elastase, and (iii) a very slow (∼100 s) non-exponential return of the fluorescence intensity to its initial value. Such a return to the initial fluorescence intensity indicates that elastase and α1PI are again separated from each other following substrate-like cleavage of the reactive site loop. Thus, the exponential translocation (t 1/2 ∼ 5 s) observed with free TMR-α1PI does not take place with peptide-inserted TMR-α1PI. It may therefore be concluded that the interchromophore distance change observed with active α1PI is related to the insertion of the reactive site loop into β-sheet A. The rate of inhibition, i.e.the rate of disappearance of free elastase, was measured by recording the release of product in mixtures of FITC-elastase, α1PI, and Suc-Ala3-pNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected for irreversible inhibition, all progress curves were simple exponentials from which the pseudo-first-order rate constants k were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. At each pH value,k was determined using a series of α1PI concentrations. All k versus[α1PI]0 plots were hyperbolic (see two examples in Fig. 5), strongly suggesting two-step irreversible inhibition (22.Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar) as illustrated in Scheme 2. E+I ⇌Ki EIM →k2,e EI2,e SCHEME 2 K i is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the rapidly-forming EIMMichaelis-type complex, and k 2,e is the rate constant for the irreversible or pseudo-irreversible transformation of EIM intoEI2,e regardless of its nature. The possible subsequent transformation ofEI2,e into one or several other species does not interfere with the mathematical treatment of the rate of inhibition of the free enzyme in the presence of a substrate. Thus, Equation 1 predicts the observed hyperbolic variation of kwith [I]0 (22.Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). k=k2,e[I] o[I] o+Ki(1+[S] o/KmEquation 1 k 2,e and K i(1+[S]0/K m) were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis. K i was calculated using the K m values previously determined at each pH value. Fig. 6 shows thatk 2,e does not significantly vary with pH except at pH 5.5, where it is about twice as high as at pH = 6.Figure 6Plot ofk 2,e , the first-order rate constant for the conversion of EIMinto EI 2,e (Scheme 2), as a function of pH. k 2,e was derived from k versus[α1PI]o curves such as those shown in Fig. 4 using Equation 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) FITC-labeled anhydro-elastase was mixed with TMR-α1PI in the stopped-flow apparatus at pH 7.5, and the reaction was followed by fluorescence. The trace shown in Fig. 6 A is biphasic as for active elastase (Fig. 2) suggesting that anhydro-elastase reacts with α1PI via a two-step mechanism similar to that previously demonstrated with active elastase and illustrated in Scheme 1. Moreover, the rate constant for the translocation of anhydro-elastase (0.11 ± 0.02 s−1) is very close to that for the translocation of active elastase (0.13 ± 0.03 s−1). To confirm that the second exponential represents translocation ofEIM into EI2,fand not an artifact, we reacted the same sample of FITC-anhydro-elastase with TMR-eglin c, a canonical reversible inhibitor that reacts with active elastase in only one step (8.Mellet P. Boudier C. Mély Y. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9119-9123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fig.7 B confirms that eglin c also reacts in one step with anhydro-elastase. Thus, translocation of elastase from the first binding site to another site does not require the enzyme's catalytic machinery. A mixture of 30 μm FITC-anhydro-elastase and 30 μmα1PI was chromatographed at pH 7.5 on a Sepharose-eglin c column. FITC-anhydro-elastase was retained at the top of the column, as evidenced by its color while α1PI was collected in the flow-through volume. Titration of the dissociated α1PI with neutrophil elastase confirmed that all of the inhibitor could be recovered. This implies that eglin c was able to fully dissociate the complex. The rate of inhibition of active elastase by the recovered α1PI was measured in the presence of substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using two different concentrations of α1PI, we got a second-order association rate constant of 5 × 105 ± 0.8m−1 s−1 at pH 7.5. This figure agrees with the rate constant usually found in the buffer conditions used in our laboratory for unreacted α1PI. The α1PI sample recovered from the complex was also analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. The thermogram revealed a thermal transition at 60.5 °C for both the control α1PI and the sample recovered from the complex with anhydro-elastase. Thus, the translocated α1PI-anhydro-elastase complex is in true thermodynamic equilibrium with free anhydro-elastase and α1PI, since its dissociation is quantitative and yields α1PI molecules whose inhibitory capacity and thermal stability are identical to those of the native inhibitor. In recent years many kinetic, chemical, and crystallographic data have been collected in view of understanding the mechanism by which serpins inhibit serine proteinases. It is commonly accepted that the enzyme and the inhibitor first form a Michaelis-type complex within which the serpin is subsequently cleaved to yield an acylenzyme linking the serine residue of the proteinase with the P1 residue of the serpin (5.Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 6.Wilczynska M. Fa M. Ohlsson P.I. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29652-29655Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7.Egelund R. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Rasmussen M.S. Guldberg R.E. Petersen T.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6375-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Formation of the acylenzyme is believed to relax the strained conformation of the serpin, to incorporate the N-terminal part of the reactive site loop into β-sheet A and hence to cause a translocation of the proteinase that stabilizes the acylenzyme bond. This model is summarized in Scheme 3. E+I ⇌Ki EIM →kac EIac →ktr EItr SCHEME 3 EIM, EIac, andEItr are the Michaelis-type complex, the acylenzyme, and the translocated acylenzyme, respectively;K i is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the Michaelis-type complex; k ac andk tr are the acylation and the translocation rate constants, respectively. As will be demonstrated below, our kinetic data on the interaction of α1PI with elastase and anhydro-elastase invalidate Scheme 3 and provide strong evidence that translocation precedes acylation as shown in Scheme 4. E+I ⇌Ki EIM →ktr EItr →kac EIac SCHEME 4The catalytic-triad of serine proteinases comprises Asp102, His57, and Ser195. Catalysis involves acylation and deacylation of Ser195, both of which are sensitive to pH because they depend upon the state of ionization of His57 (pK a ∼6.7). As a control, we have shown that k cat for the elastase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the model substrate Suc-Ala3-pNA increases 18-fold between pH 5.5 and 8.5. Therefore, if EIac would follow immediately EIM (Scheme 3), its rate of appearance should strongly increase with pH. We did not measure the kinetics of EIac formation but we used two ways to measure the kinetics of EIM decay: fluorescence, which yielded k 2,f(Scheme 1), and substrate hydrolysis, which gavek 2,e (Scheme 2). Bothk 2,f andk 2,e were found to be essentially pH-independent. k 2,f is the first-order rate constant for the fluorescently detected decay of the Michaelis-type complexEIM (Scheme 1). In our experiment fluorescence detects only those species that significantly differ in energy transfer efficiency. It is thus not unlikely that fluorescently silent events such as acylation take place during the fluorescence change that characterizes the translocation of EIM. As a consequence, EI2,f is not necessarily a single molecular species and k 2,fis possibly an apparent rate constant that comprises both the pH-dependent constant, k ac, and the pH-independent one, k tr. Thus, the pH independence of k 2,f is, at first sight, compatible with both of the afore-mentioned reaction schemes but imposes some restrictions. Either Scheme 4 is valid andk 2,f = k trwhatever the magnitude of k ac, or Scheme 3 is valid, in which case k tr must necessarily be rate-limiting for the formation of the final complexEItr, which implies thatk ac ≫ k tr. Therefore,k ac should be much larger thank 2,f, the translocation rate constant measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, i.e.0.13 s−1. In summary, Scheme 3 can only be compatible with the observed pH independence of k 2,fif k ac ≫ 0.13 s−1 over the whole pH range studied, so that even at pH 5.5, where acylation is greatly reduced, it is still not rate-limiting. k 2,e is derived from the rate of elastase inhibition by α1PI in the presence of a competing substrate. It represents the first-order rate constant for the irreversible or pseudo-irreversible conversion of Michaelis-type complex EIM into EI2,e, the complex that immediately follows EIM in the reaction pathway (Scheme 2). The calculation and the interpretation ofk 2,e do not depend upon whetherEI2,e is the final complex or the first of several consecutive complexes. If Scheme 3 were valid,k 2,e = k ac. Being the rate constant of an acylation step,k 2,e should, therefore, be pH-dependent. Furthermore, the restriction deduced from the study of k 2,f as a function of pH predicts that k ac ≫k 2,f for Scheme 3 to be valid (see above). This leads to k 2,e ≫k 2,f. The pH independence ofk 2,e and the fact thatk 2,e (0.41 s−1) is of the same order of magnitude as k 2,f(0.13 s−1) are thus complementary evidence invalidating Scheme 3 and favoring Scheme 4. Besides, the numerical value ofk 2,e may be considered as equal to that of k 2,f if allowance is made for the errors on each constant, one being measured directly by fluorescence, the other being derived enzymatically by a much more indirect method. In conclusion, the kinetic data indicate that the irreversible or pseudo-irreversible step that immediately follows the formation of the Michaelis-type complex EIM is the translocation step that occurs with a rate constant of 0.13–0.41 s−1. In our system, translocation is also the rate-limiting step for enzyme inhibition. On the other hand, the complex formed between α1PI and anhydro-elastase is able to translocate with a rate constant (0.11 s−1) close to that measured for the translocation of active elastase (0.13–0.41 s−1).The observed translocation of catalytically inactive elastase thus confirms that acylation of the enzyme is not required for its translocation but that translocation is rather a prerequisite for acylation as indicated in Scheme 4. This model suggests that k ac may be higher or lower than k tr, depending upon the pH conditions and/or the nature of the enzyme-inhibitor pair. In addition, an implicit assumption of this model is that part of the binding energy of the Michaelis-type complex EIM is used to trigger the translocation process via the flexible reactive site loop or a yet unknown exosite. This is reminiscent of the observation by Verhamme et al. (23.Verhamme I. Kvassman J.O. Day D. Debrock S. Vleugels N. Declerck P.J. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17511-17515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that a monoclonal antibody directed against an unidentified epitope of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 is able to accelerate the conversion of this serpin into a latent inhibitor in which the reactive center loop is inserted into β-sheet A. It may be hypothesized that the interaction between the antibody and the serpin partly mimics the interaction of the proteinase with the serpin and triggers the conformational change that results in loop-sheet interaction. The elucidation of the location of the epitope would be of great significance. The pH independence of the rate-limiting step for the inhibition of chymase by antichymotrypsin was suggested by Schechter et al. (24.Schechter N.M. Plotnick M. Sehwood T. Walter M. Rubin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24499-24507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, this study measured the overall inhibition rate constant with no information on the nature of the reaction steps. Serpin-proteinase reaction mechanisms with two consecutive reversible steps have been recently proposed by Kvassman et al. (25.Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for the inhibition of plasminogen activator by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, by Nair et al. (26.Nair S.A. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17459-17462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) for the inhibition of chymotrypsin by antichymotrypsin, and by Stone et al. (27.Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 344-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for the inhibition of thrombin by several serpins. However, the methods used in these works were not adapted to determine whether the proteinase was translocated and whether acylation occurred before or after translocation. Although the fluorescence change that accompanies translocation is described by a simple exponential, it is possible that a further conformational change takes place after acylation since formation of the acylenzyme is accompanied by liberation of the new N terminus P′1 residue. Such a conformational change is not detected by fluorescence transfer. This either means that each translocated molecule is rapidly acylated so that the accumulated fluorescence changes of the two consecutive movements are included in the fluorescence change accompanying the rate-limiting exponential or that the hypothetical conformational change induced by acylation does not significantly modify the interchromophore distance. In the first assumption, the translocation occurs in two steps: (i) one involving the uncleaved reactive site loop that is brought to a position where acylation can safely occur in a solvent-free environment to prevent deacylation, and (ii) the other resulting from the rearrangement consecutive to loop cleavage. The second assumption implies that the proteinase has reached its final position after the translocation step. Chromatography of the anhydro-elastase-α1PI complex on a Sepharose-eglin c column was able to dissociate the complex and to recover functionally active and structurally intact α1PI, indicating that the reactants are in true thermodynamic equilibrium as outlined in Scheme 5. ahE+I⇌ahEIM ⇌k−trktr ahEItr SCHEME 5ahE is anhydro-elastase. Since significant translocation of the initial Michaelis-type complex was observed,k tr must be larger thank −tr. For instance, ifk tr = 10 k −tr, the translocation is virtually complete. It is likely that translocation of active elastase is also reversible or pseudo-irreversible. Active and anhydro-elastase differ only in one residue. Both form a reversible complex with eglin c, and a Michaelis-type complex with α1PI, which further undergoes translocation. It is difficult to conceive that the serine residue of the active site of elastase prevents reversibility of translocation. The data of Whisstock et al. (28.Whisstock J. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Proteins. 1996; 26: 288-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) favor this view. These authors modeled the interaction of α1PI with neutrophil elastase and came to the conclusion that insertion of the uncleaved binding loop up to residue P12 into the β-sheet A allowed a possible docking of the proteinase to the translocated site. They reported that the required conformational changes occur with the correct stereochemistry and without steric clashes. Furthermore, the proteinase and the serpin were held together by a large number of van der Waals and hydrogen bonds. There is thus an energetically favorable docking at the translocated site which does not involve the serine residue of the enzyme's active center and does not require reactive site loop cleavage of the serpin. Further experiments are needed to firmly demonstrate that the translocated α1PI-active elastase complex is in equilibrium with the Michaelis-type complex. In our study we show that in the second reversible step the anhydro-proteinase has been translocated. Accordingly, the Michaelis-type complex between an anhydro-proteinase and a serpin, which is rapidly converted into the translocated complex, should no longer be considered as a model for the first encounter complex (10.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11.Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13110-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in which the serpin is probably still close to its native conformation. Each step described in the minimal Scheme 4 is determinant for the selection of the target proteinase by the serpin and for its fate. The fact that each step may be governed by a special property of the proteinase leads necessarily to a variety of situations. Thus, the ability of the proteinase to form a tight or a looseEIM complex is probably independent of its ability to trigger translocation. Similarly, the features that are determinant in these two first steps are certainly not related to the ability of the proteinase to catalyze the formation of a covalent complex with the serpin. This provides a flexibility in the regulation of proteinase inhibition at each step that may be the cause of the selection of serpins in potentially dangerous processes such as the cascade of the coagulation, the complement cascade, or fibrinolysis. The example of the inhibition of proteinase by α2-antiplasmin, which leads to an SDS-stable complex (31.Moroi M. Aoki N. Biochim. Biophys.

However, in [3H]inositol-labeled rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCM) both initial and sustained [3H]InsP responses to α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation with norepinephrine (100 μm) were insensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding agent neomycin (5 mm).

In contrast, the calcium ionophore A23187 (10 μm) provoked [3H]InsP responses in intact NCM which were sensitive to neomycin, and elevation of free calcium in permeabilized NCM led to [3H]InsP responses characterized by marked increases in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (2.9 ± 0.2% of total [3H]InsPs after 20 min of high Ca2+ treatment in comparison to 0.21 ± 0.05% of total [3H]InsPs accumulated after 20 min of GTPγS stimulation). These data provide evidence that Ins(1,4,5)P3generation is not a major contributor to G protein-coupled InsP responses in NCM, but that substantial Ins(1,4,5)P3generation occurs under conditions of Ca2+ overload. Thus in NCM, Ca2+-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation has the potential to worsen Ca2+ overload and thereby aggravate Ca2+-induced electrophysiological perturbations.

Thus in NCM, Ca2+-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation has the potential to worsen Ca2+ overload and thereby aggravate Ca2+-induced electrophysiological perturbations. 4,5)P3, d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 4)P2,d-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate d-myo-inositol 4-monophosphate d-myo-inositol 1-monophosphate inositol phosphate 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate phospholipase C protein kinase C norepinephrine guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate neonatal rat cardiomyocytes Generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3),1a Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger, is critical in mediating responses to hormone stimulation in a wide variety of cell types (1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) generates both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol from the precursor phospholipid PtdIns(4,5)P2. However, all known PLC isozymes have the capacity to hydrolyze PtdIns and PtdIns(4)P as well as PtdIns(4,5)P2, although with lower potency (2.Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Cho K.S. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. Proc.

While there is some difference in substrate selectivity between the three PLC classes (β, γ, and δ), activity toward PtdIns(4,5)P2 is somewhat higher than toward PtdIns(4)P when measurements are made using PLCs reconstituted in lipid vesicles (2.Ryu S.H.

Nonetheless, this suggests the possibility that cleavage of PtdIns(4)P in addition to PtdIns(4,5)P2 could be a substantial contributor to the overall InsP response. Early studies of InsP responses led to the suggestion that generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 takes place during the initial stage of agonist stimulation, while the sustained InsP response depends on cleavage of PtdIns to Ins(1)P (4.Wilson D.B.

However, the lack of potent, readily available inhibitors of Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolism has meant that such ideas have never been substantiated, and Ins(1,4,5)P3 has generally been assumed to be the primary source of all InsPs that accumulate in response to receptor stimulation, including InsPs generated in the myocardium. Beat-to-beat regulation of cardiac muscle Ca2+ is primarily controlled by ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ responses in cardiac myocytes are relatively slow and weak and have been characterized as Ca2+ oscillations (7.Kentish J.C. Barsotti R.J. Lea T.J. Mullican I.P. Patel J.R.

Intracellular application of Ins(1,4,5)P3 causes action potential prolongation and degeneration (9.Felzen B. Shilkrut M. Less H. Sarapov I. Maor G. Coleman R. Robinson R.B. Berke G. Binah O. Circ.

In the face of evidence for a pathological role of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the myocardium (reviewed in Ref. 18.Woodcock E.A. Matkovich S.J. Binah O. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 40: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), it is important to better understand the mechanisms responsible for its generation in cardiac myocytes and also the mechanisms suppressing its generation under physiological circumstances. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCM) represent a convenient system for the modelling of myocardial signaling. InsP responses to norepinephrine (NE) in myocytes are mediated via α1-adrenergic receptors, coupling via Gq to PLC-β isoforms (19.Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.-H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C.

Cardiol. 1995; 27: 471-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our initial studies indicated that NE stimulation in NCM was largely insensitive to the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding agent neomycin (24.Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLauchlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), unlike findings in other cell types, implying that responses are largely independent of Ins(1,4,5)P3. This prompted us to examine the source of InsPs in NCM generated in response to α1-adrenergic activation. In this study, we present the first direct evidence that G protein activation of NCM stimulates an InsP response that is largely independent of Ins(1,4,5)P3generation. In contrast, the InsP response to elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is primarily via Ins(1,4,5)P3. NCM were prepared from 1- to 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups, essentially as described previously (25.Simpson P. McGrath A. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). NCM were isolated by repeated trypsin digestion with gentle mechanical dispersion, pre-plated twice for 30 min each to remove nonmyocytes and left to attach for 18 h in medium 199, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate onto uncoated dishes, at a typical seeding density of 700 cells/mm2. Medium was then replaced with a defined serum-free medium consisting of medium 199, 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml human insulin, 10 μg/ml bovine apo-transferrin, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Bromodeoxyuridine was omitted after 3 days and cells were labeled with [3H]inositol in defined serum-free medium for 48 h prior to experiments. Wells were washed extensively with nonradioactive medium before use. Cell permeabilization was achieved by treatment with 50 μg/ml saponin in an intracellular-like medium containing an ATP-generating system for 4 min at 37 °C. Intracellular medium had the following constituents (in mm): KCl, 110; NaCl, 10; KH2PO4, 1; MgSO4, 5; EGTA, 1; Hepes, 20; ATP, 2; creatine phosphate, 10; with 20 Sigma units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and CaCl2 to give a free [Ca2+] of 100 nm (determined by reference to a Ca2+-EGTA titration curve), adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH. Plates were washed 4 times with intracellular medium and fresh intracellular medium was added before the commencement of [3H]InsP generation protocols. 10 mm LiCl was added 10 min before the addition of an appropriate stimulator to intact NCM in medium 199, or permeabilized NCM in intracellular medium with an ATP-generating system, and maintained during the treatment period in order to inhibit InsP breakdown by inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase and inositol monophosphatase (26.York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27.Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). 1 μm Propranolol was also added to intact NCM to block β-adrenergic receptors. For stimulation of intact NCM, stock solutions of 10 mm NE in 0.5m 2-mercaptoethanol (to inhibit catecholamine oxidation) or 10 mm A23187 in dimethyl sulfoxide were prepared freshly on the experimental day and diluted into medium 199 containing LiCl and propranolol just before use. After stimulation, medium was removed from intact NCM and the reaction terminated by the addition of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, 2.5 mm disodium EDTA, 5 mm sodium phytate (sodium inositol hexakisphosphate). Permeabilized NCM reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, 5 mmdisodium-EDTA, 5 mm sodium phytate to the intracellular medium. Wells were scraped, washed once with 5% trichloroacetic acid, 2.5 mm disodium EDTA, 5 mm sodium phytate and the extracts collected. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was removed by low-speed centrifugation, a 1:1 mixture of freon/tri-n-octylamine was added to remove trichloroacetic acid, and the upper aqueous phase containing [3H]InsPs was prepared for high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (28.Woodcock E.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Separation and quantitation of [3H]InsP isomers was performed using established anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography techniques (28.Woodcock E.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29.Woodcock E.A. Suss M.B. Anderson K.E. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 252-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3H-labeled compounds were eluted with a complex gradient of ammonium phosphate at pH 3.8. Retention times and integrated peak values were obtained via an on-line β-counter. Identification of [3H]InsP isomers was made with reference to appropriate commercial standards. Fetal calf serum was specially selected for low endotoxin and obtained from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Parkville, Australia. Medium 199, Hepes, l-glutamine, bovine serum albumin, NaHCO3, and other materials for the preparation of cell culture solutions and media were cell culture grade, obtained from Sigma and dissolved in highly purified Milli-Q H2O. Human insulin was ActrapidTM from Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, and bovine apo-transferrin was from Sigma. GTPγS and Ins(1,4,5)P3 were obtained through Sigma and Sapphire Bioscience, Australia. [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (21.00 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products Inc. and [3H]inositol (18.00 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma or BDH/AnalaR and were of analytical reagent grade. Differences between treatment groups were assessed by unpaired Student's t test or 1-way ANOVA as appropriate, and accepted as statistically significant atp < 0.05. Unless otherwise noted, results shown are from representative experiments, which were independently repeated three times. NCM were used for [3H]InsP generation experiments at 5 days after initial isolation and radiolabeled with 20 μCi/ml [3H]inositol 48 h before experiments. As it has been suggested that short- and long-term stimulation of PLC have different characteristics, we examined changes in individual [3H]InsP isomers in detail over the first minute of PLC stimulation and compared this to a 20-min stimulation period. After a 10-min pretreatment period with 10 mm LiCl and 1 μm propranolol in medium 199, PLC was activated by stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors with 100 μm NE, or by raising intracellular Ca2+ by treatment with 10 μm A23187, in the continued presence of LiCl and propranolol, for the specified time periods. In agreement with previous reports (30.Steinberg S.F. Kaplan L.M. Inouye T. Zhang J.F. Robinson R.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 250: 1141-1148PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Woodcock E.A. Tanner J.K. Fullerton M. Kuraja I.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) we found a transient increase in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 followed by a decrease during the first minute of NE stimulation (Fig.1). Stimulation by A23187 followed a similar pattern, although the response was of lower magnitude. From 1 to 20 min, further increases in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 were only marginal. As attack by 5-phosphatase and 3-kinase enzymes on Ins(1,4,5)P3 is not inhibited by Li+, this observation alone does not reflect the amount of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 which could have been generated by PLC activity over this time frame. Levels of [3H]Ins(1,4)P2 and its immediate dephosphorylation product [3H]Ins(4)P followed a similar rise and fall to [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 during the first minute of stimulation (Fig. 1), but continued to increase steadily thereafter in the presence of Li+, an uncompetitive inhibitor of Ins(1,4)P2 and Ins(4)P breakdown (26.York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32.Inhorn R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14559-14565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As [3H]Ins(1,4)P2 could be produced either by PLC hydrolysis of [3H]PtdIns(4)P or by breakdown of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 via a 5-phosphatase, these data demonstrate continued PLC activity over a 20-min period but do not indicate whether the primary product of PLC hydrolysis of phosphoinositides is Ins(1,4)P2 or Ins(1,4,5)P3. 30 s of treatment with either NE or A23187 stimulated overall [3H]InsP generation (Fig.2, a and b) and increased [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1). However, the inclusion of 5 mm neomycin, an aminoglycoside that binds to PtdIns(4,5)P2 (24.Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLauchlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and inhibits production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (33.Biden T.J. Prugue M.L. Davison A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34.Philippe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) did not reduce [3H]InsP accumulation in response to NE either at 30 s (Fig. 2 a) or at 20 min (Fig. 2 c). In contrast, when NCM were stimulated with A23187 for either 30 s (Fig. 2 b) or 20 min (Fig. 2 d), 5 mmneomycin caused ∼50% inhibition of the response. Approximately 50% inhibition by this concentration of neomycin has been reported in a number of different cell types (33.Biden T.J. Prugue M.L. Davison A.G.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34.Philippe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Addition of neomycin in the absence of agonist had no effect on unstimulated [3H]InsPs (data not shown). [3H]Inositol-labeled NCM were permeabilized, pretreated for 10 min with 10 mm LiCl, and [3H]InsP responses were stimulated by adding 10 μm GTPγS, or AlF4− (to activate heterotrimeric G proteins), or by increasing free [Ca2+] from 100 nm to 10 μm, in the continued presence of Li+. [3H]InsP generation was measured after 1 or 20 min of stimulation to examine both the early and sustained phase of [3H]InsP generation, as in intact NCM experiments. 10 μm GTPγS did not cause a detectable increase in total [3H]InsPs or in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 at 1 min (data not shown). To ensure this did not reflect slow guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαq (35.Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the experiments were repeated using AlF4− which causes an immediate activation of Gq, independent of GDP/GTP exchange (20.Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 36.Bigay J. Deterre P. Pfister C. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2907-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). After 1 min of AlF4− treatment, total [3H]InsP content was not significantly increased compared with control (Fig. 3 b), and there was no increase in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3(Fig. 3 a). 20 min of G protein stimulation with GTPγS led to an approximate doubling of total [3H]InsPs (Fig. 3 d), again without detectable increase in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig.3 c). In contrast to 1 min of G protein activation, when elevated [Ca2+] was used to activate [3H]InsP generation for 1 min, total [3H]InsPs were significantly increased (Fig. 3 b). This stimulation was characterized by a very marked rise in the level of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 3 a). Although total [3H]InsPs in response to 20 min of 10 μm Ca2+ were only slightly increased above those seen with 20 min of 100 nm Ca2+ (Fig.3 d), the rise in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3was sustained, with the level of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 at 20 min of 10 μm Ca2+ remaining significantly higher than that at 20 min of 100 nm Ca2+ (Fig.3 c). Thus, unlike the sustained effect of GTPγS, the [3H]InsP response to elevated Ca2+ involved significant increases in [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3. The low sensitivity to neomycin in NE-stimulated NCM (together with demonstrable neomycin inhibition of A23187 responses) suggested that the major proportion of InsPs detected upon G protein activation of phospholipase C do not arise from generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and its subsequent breakdown. In order to investigate this further, and considering that permeabilized NCM experiments showed similar effects of G protein activation and Ca2+ elevation to those observed in intact NCM, we attempted to block metabolism of any [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 generated in permeabilized NCM to ascertain its contribution to the overall [3H]InsP response. As the K m of the enzymes responsible for Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolism is in the order of 10 μm (27.Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 37.Laxminarayan K.M. Chan B.K. Tetaz T. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17305-17310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 300 μm unlabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 was added to the medium to competitively inhibit breakdown of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3. If other [3H]InsPs detected in permeabilized NCM arise from metabolism of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3, this maneuver would be expected to increase the amount of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 detected at the expense of labeled metabolites. Fig. 4 shows the effects of addition of 300 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3 to unstimulated and GTPγS-stimulated permeabilized NCM. When 10 μm GTPγS was added to permeabilized NCM for 20 min, there was a significant increase in total [3H]InsPs consisting primarily of [3H]Ins(1,4)P2 and [3H]Ins(4)P but not [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3. In the presence of 300 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3, GTPγS-stimulated total [3H]InsPs were unchanged, as expected. Only a small amount of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 was detected in the presence of 300 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3 and GTPγS, which was not observed with 300 μmIns(1,4,5)P3 alone. Experiments performed using AlF4− in place of GTPγS gave similar results (data not shown). To confirm that [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 could be successfully protected by the addition of excess unlabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 in NCM, we added 10 nm[3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 to permeabilized NCM not previously labeled with [3H]inositol, in the absence or presence of 300 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3 together with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min. As shown in Fig.5, 300 μmIns(1,4,5)P3 protected [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 from dephosphorylation to [3H]Ins(1,4)P2. The present study challenges the assumption that InsP responses in NCM depend on the primary generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3, followed by its metabolism to generate a range of other InsPs. We provide evidence for generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in response to elevation of intracellular Ca2+, as shown by the marked increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 observed during the response to elevated free Ca2+ in permeabilized NCM and by the sensitivity of A23187 stimulation to the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding aminoglycoside neomycin in intact NCM. In contrast to Ca2+-activated responses, α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation leads to InsP generation which is relatively insensitive to neomycin, and direct G protein stimulation by either GTPγS or AlF4− initiates InsP responses which are largely independent of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Early studies in non-cardiac cell types suggested that there is a change in the preferred substrate for phospholipase C away from PtdIns(4,5)P2 as agonist stimulation is maintained, such that Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation predominates only in the initial phase of the response (5.Imai A. Gershengorn M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8540-8544Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6.Griendling K.K. Rittenhouse S.E. Brock T.A. Ekstein L.S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5901-5906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In NCM at both the 30-s and 20-min time points, the total [3H]InsP response to A23187 was inhibited by neomycin, indicating Ins(1,4,5)P3generation. In contrast, the response to NE was insensitive to neomycin at both time points. Thus, although time course data showed increased [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 early in both the NE and A23187 responses, only the A23187 response was neomycin-sensitive in terms of total [3H]InsPs generated. This shows that a finding of increased [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 cannot be taken alone as evidence that it is the primary source of accumulated [3H]InsPs, even at an early time point. Similar insensitivity of NE responses to neomycin has been observed in adult rat cardiomyocytes (38.Woodcock E.A. Lambert K.A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 3275-3283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as well as normoxic preparations of adult rat heart tissue (29.Woodcock E.A. Suss M.B. Anderson K.E. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 252-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but InsP responses under reperfusion conditions, during which large increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 are observed, are effectively blocked by aminoglycosides (13.Du X.-J.

Increases in levels of all InsP isomers are inhibited by aminoglycosides under reperfusion conditions, not merely Ins(1,4,5)P3. Although neomycin at high concentrations may well have cellular effects unrelated to its PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding capability, the differential sensitivity of the Ca2+ and NE responses to neomycin argues against a nonspecific action in this case. Thus, these data suggest that increased cytosolic Ca2+ is a stimulus for Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation, whereas α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation of PLC triggers an InsP response that is largely independent of PtdIns(4,5)P2hydrolysis. As there are several G protein-coupled receptor systems present in NCM that could activate PLC, we chose to examine InsP responses to direct G protein activation in permeabilized NCM to test whether the relative incapacity of α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation to induce sustained Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation extended to all G protein-mediated PLC activities in NCM. Neither short-term (1 min) nor long-term (20 min) G protein stimulation was able to significantly increase [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 content in permeabilized NCM even though total [3H]InsPs were increased at 20 min. However, this did not reflect a fundamental inability of the permeabilized NCM preparation to hydrolyze [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2, as elevation of free Ca2+ in the medium for either 1 or 20 min led to a dramatic increase in the amount of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3recovered. The steady increase of [3H]InsPs following G protein activation contrasted with the response to elevated free Ca2+, in which both [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 and total [3H]InsPs increased rapidly up to 1 min, but the response was not sustained for 20 min. The use of permeabilized NCM provided the opportunity to directly measure the contribution of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3generation to G protein-mediated [3H]InsP responses by competing for its breakdown with a large molar excess of unlabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3. The inability of 300 μmIns(1,4,5)P3 to reduce the levels of unstimulated and GTPγS-stimulated [3H]Ins(1,4)P2 and [3H]Ins(4)P implies that [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 is not the source of these [3H]InsPs. As the major labeled inositol phosphate which accumulates is [3H]Ins(4)P, which can only be produced by dephosphorylation of [3H]Ins(1,4)P2, the most likely progenitor of InsPs in NCM is Ins(1,4)P2 derived from PLC hydrolysis of PtdIns(4)P, as suggested in adult rat heart (29.Woodcock E.A. Suss M.B. Anderson K.E. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 252-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct hydrolysis of PtdIns, which has been reported as an alternative to PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis (4.Wilson D.B.

Increases in [3H]Ins(1)P or [3H]Ins(3)P (which cannot be resolved by high performance liquid chromatography) were only minor in comparison to increases in [3H]Ins(4)P observed during the [3H]InsP responses in either intact or permeabilized NCM described in the present study. The InsP generation model suggested by these experiments allows for production of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol without concomitant generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in response to G protein PLC-mediated stimuli. Activation of conventional and novel PKC isoforms in heart has been reported under a number of conditions, especially in relation to hypertrophic growth (39.Gu X. Bishop S.P. Circ.

Suppression of Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation under physiological conditions in NCM, as previously suggested for adult rat heart (29.Woodcock E.A. Suss M.B. Anderson K.E. Circ.

Res. 1998; 40: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Direct intracellular application of Ins(1,4,5)P3 causes action potential degeneration (9.Felzen B. Shilkrut M. Less H. Sarapov I.

It is therefore possible that the abbreviated InsP pathway present in cardiac myocytes protects the heart from Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation and consequent arrhythmias, presumably arising from enhanced Ca2+ release from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. If this is the case, then it is interesting that Ca2+ overload itself causes Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation, potentially initiating a positive feedback relationship between Ca2+ and Ins(1,4,5)P3 which would further aggravate any electrophysiological damage to the heart. An alternative explanation for preferential Ins(1,4)P2generation in the heart is that Ins(1,4)P2 itself has a signaling function. While Ins(1,4)P2 is generally considered to be an inactive metabolite of Ins(1,4,5)P3, there have been a number of studies suggesting that it has a role in cellular growth (42.Sylvia V. Curtain G. Norman J. Stec J. Busbee D. Cell. 1988; 54: 651-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 43.York J.D. Samitz J.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19992-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other metabolic pathways (44.López-Coronado J.M. Bellés J.M. Lesage F. Serrano R. Rodrı́guez P.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13619-13628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Clearly, further investigation would be required to establish any such role in the heart. The mechanisms underlying the different responses to NE and Ca2+ remain to be determined. Whereas PLC-β isoforms respond to G protein activation (46.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), PLC-δ isoforms (particularly PLC-δ1) are likely mediators of Ca2+-activated InsP responses in the absence of other upstream signaling molecules (46.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar,47.Allen V. Swigart P. Cheung R. Cockcroft S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, PLC-δ has somewhat less specificity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 relative to PtdIns(4)P than does PLC-β when studied in vitro using synthetic lipid micelles (2.Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. Cho K.S. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6649-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is, however, possible that the substrate specificities of the different PLC isoforms might be altered by particular features of the cardiac sarcolemma. In summary, the present study demonstrates that generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in NCM requires Ca2+-mediated activation of PLC and that G protein activation of PLC causes an InsP response which is largely independent of Ins(1,4,5)P3generation. Further studies will be required to elucidate the molecular events responsible for the selection between Ins(1,4)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation in NCM."

Huang Y. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). More than 90% of plasma apoE is produced by the liver. However, extrahepatic cells such as macrophages are able to synthesize and secrete apoE (2.Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Ho Y.K. Havel R.J. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 22K domain is responsible for the binding of apoE to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, heparin, and the cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (PGs) (4.Innerarity T.L.

First, apoE is undetectable in nonatherosclerotic human arterial intima but is abundant in human lesions (12.Crespo P. Gonzalez C. Ordovas J.M. Ortiz J.M. Rodriguez J.C. Leon J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13.Salomon R.N. Underwood R. Doyle M.V. Wang A. Libby P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Second, apoE in the arterial vessel can be expressed locally by macrophages, especially those loaded with lipid (16.Mazzone T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17.Linton M., F. Fazio S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Third, in apoE-deficient mice the development of atherosclerosis is markedly increased even in the absence of a high fat diet (18.Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar, 19.Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Fourth, restoring apoE production in macrophages in apoE-deficient or irradiated wild type mice with bone marrow transplantation inhibits atherosclerosis (17.Linton M., F. Fazio S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), although some studies suggest that the macrophage-derived apoE promotes diet-induced atherosclerosis in male wild type mice (20.Boisvert W.A. Curtiss L.K. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 806-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fifth, rapid regression of atherosclerosis is also achieved by liver-directed gene transfer of apoE into apoE-deficient mice (21.Tsukamoto K. Tangirala R. Chun S.H. Pure E. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2162-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22.Desurmont C. Caillaud J.-M. Emmanuel F. Benoit P. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Branellec D. Heard J.-M. Duverger N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). How apoE protects the vessel wall from atherosclerosis is yet unknown. Among the suggested mechanisms is the binding of apoE to the extracellular matrix of the artery wall (23.Saxena U. Ferguson E. Bisgaier C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14812-14819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, deposits of apoE in human atherosclerotic lesions have been reported to localize frequently with biglycan (Bg) (15.O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), a small leucine-rich PG with a 38-kDa protein core of a known structure and two glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, predominantly dermatan sulfate (DS) (24.Kresse H. Hausser H. Schonherr E. Bittner K. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 32: 259-264PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Bg is synthesized by vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells (26.Asundi V. Cowan K. Matzura D. Wagner W. Dreher K.L. Eur.

The function(s) of this PG is poorly understood, although several studies have indicated that it interacts with transforming growth factor-β, fibronectin, collagen, and other matrix components (24.Kresse H. Hausser H. Schonherr E. Bittner K. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1994; 32: 259-264PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). As determined by a gel mobility shift assay, it has recently been reported that HDL3 particles rich in apoE bind to Bg, a property not exhibited by apoE-free HDL3(15.O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction was mediated by apoE (15.O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, shortcomings of those studies were the lack of direct evidence for apoE binding, questions about the conformation of the Bg purified from the media of cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells in the presence of 8 m urea, and lack of insight into the mechanism of the binding. These issues are addressed in the present studies in which apoE and selected mutants complexed with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles were examined for binding to Bg extracted from human aorta and refolded into its native state. Both untreated and GAG-depleted (GD) Bg, representing the protein core, were studied. We demonstrate that apoE binds to the protein core of Bg, that critical elements of the binding reside in a charged 8-amino acid segment located in the 10K domain of apoE, and that the binding is ionic in nature and does not require the GAG component of Bg. Chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4) and chondroitin AC lyase (EC 4.2.2.5) were from Seikagaku Co., Tokyo, Japan. l-Amino acids, bovine serum albumin (BSA), urea, guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), PMSF, Tween 20, SDS, goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugates, and ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate were purchased from Sigma. DMPC was from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL. Kallikrein inactivator was purchased from Calbiochem. Streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was from Pierce. Polyclonal rabbit antisera against human Bg (LF-51) and human decorin (LF-136) were kindly provided by Dr. Larry W. Fisher (NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against human apoE recognized both full-length apoE and the two recombinant apoE fragments, 22K and 10K. Monoclonal antibody 3H1 was characterized previously (5.Weisgraber K.H. Rall S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal rabbit antiserum against human apoA-I was described by Edelstein et al. (28.Edelstein C. Lim C.T. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5842-5849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bg was isolated from the human post-mortem thoracic aorta of a healthy donor (female, 44 years old) who died from cerebral hemorrhage. The samples were collected within 12 h from death. After removing the adventitia and the outer media, total PGs were extracted from the aortic segments with 6 m urea, 1 m NaCl in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 mm PMSF, 10 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide) for 24 h at 4 °C. The extracted PGs were then dialyzed against 6 m urea for 48 h at 4 °C and further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated in 6 m urea (29.Camejo G. Linden T. Olsson U. Wiklund O. Lopez F. Bondjers G. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 79: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Bg,i.e. PG-II fraction, was separated from the other PGs by size-exclusion chromatography on a Sepharose CL-4B in the presence of 6m urea/1 m NaCl as described by Coinu et al. (30.Coinu R. Cherchi G.M. Formato M. Demuro P. DeLuca G. Haematologica. 1993; 78: 270-276PubMed Google Scholar). Urea solutions were prepared fresh for each experiment and filtered (0.22-μm pore) prior to use. All the chromatographic steps were conducted at 4 °C in the presence of the protease inhibitors indicated above. The purified Bg was dialyzed against 20,000 volumes of 1 mm NH4HCO3 for 48 h at 4 °C and subsequently lyophilized. The lyophilized product was kept at −20 °C until use. The analysis of constituent GAGs, performed after separate enzymatic degradation with chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase AC (31.Cherchi G.M. Formato M. Demuro P. Masserini M. Varani I. DeLuca G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), by high performance capillary electrophoresis (32.Al Hakim A. Linhardt R.J. Anal.

The purity of the Bg preparation was analyzed by a reduced 4–12% Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1, lane 3) or an immunoblot assay with an antiserum against human Bg (dilution 1:2,000) (Fig. 1, lane 1) using the ECL Western Detection Reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified Bg migrated on the gel as a broad band of ∼190–220 kDa that did not react with an anti-human decorin antibody (data not shown). 100 μg of protein was incubated with chondroitinase ABC in 100 μl of TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 0.5 mm PMSF and 10 units/ml kallikrein inactivator for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 mm ZnCl2. On a reduced 4–12% Tris glycine SDS-PAGE, GD-Bg migrated as a single band of ∼48 kDa that reacted with an antiserum against human Bg (Fig. 1). To remove digested GAGs, GD-Bg was dialyzed against 20,000 volumes of 1 mm NH4HCO3 for 48 h at 4 °C and subsequently lyophilized. The lyophilized product was kept at −20 °C until use. Lyophilized samples of either Bg or GD-Bg were dissolved in 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, in either the presence or in the absence of 4m GdnHCl (0.25 mg of protein/ml), incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, and used for CD spectroscopy. The CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a 1-mm path length on an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature control unit (Aviv Associates, Inc., Lakewood, NJ). All spectra were the average of 4 scans and were corrected for background. The mean residue ellipticity was calculated as described (33.Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The percent secondary structure was calculated using a program provided by Aviv Inc. for Aviv CD data sets based on an algorithm of Chang et al. (34.Chang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 12-31Crossref Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, the spectrum of Bg in 10 mm phosphate buffer exhibited a symmetrical negative trough with a minimum at 213 nm. The calculated secondary structure was 44% β-sheet, 18% β-turn, 16% α-helix, and 22% random coil. These structural parameters were no longer present in 4 m GdnHCl but were fully restored after removal of this chaotropic agent by extensive dialysis (Fig. 2 A). The CD spectrum of GD-Bg in 10 mm phosphate buffer had a minimum at 215 nm with a broader curve than that exhibited by intact Bg (Fig. 2 B). The predicted secondary structure of GD-Bg was 34% β-sheet, 21% β-turn, 9% α-helix, and 36% random coil; as in the case of Bg, it was markedly affected by the presence of 4 m GdnHCl and was restored upon removal of this denaturant (Fig. 2 B). The CD spectra and the secondary structure calculation for our GD-Bg were nearly identical to those reported recently for recombinant human Bg protein core prepared by using the vaccinia virus/T7 bacteriophage expression system and purified under non-denaturing conditions (35.Krishnan P.

Taken together, our data support the conclusion that the Bg protein extracted from human aorta acquired its native conformation upon removal of the chaotropic agent utilized during the purification procedure. ApoE3 was isolated from the delipidatedd <1.02 g/ml human plasma lipoproteins as reported by Weisgraber et al. (36.Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9077-9083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant apoE3 fragments comprised residues 1–191 (22K), residues 223–299 (10K), residues 1–272, residues 1–260, residues 1–251, and apoE missing residues 186–230 (Fig. 3). They were expressed inEscherichia coli as described previously (37.Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Agard D.A. J. Biol.

The purity of isolated apoE and the apoE fragments was assessed by 4–20% Tris glycine SDS-PAGE (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) under reducing conditions (37.Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T.

DMPC vesicles (10 mg/ml) were prepared by sonication of dried DMPC in TBS supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (39.Innerarity T.L. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4186-4190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each protein was combined with DMPC (1:3.75, w/w) and isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation as described by Innerarity et al. (40.Innerarity T.L. Weisgraber K.H. Arnold K.S. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7261-7267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrated densities of the resulting complexes were in the range of 1.09–1.1 g/ml, a range corresponding to that published previously for apoE and apoE fragments (4.Innerarity T.L.

Fractions containing the complexes were pooled, dialyzed against TBS containing 1 mm EDTA, and stored at 4 °C until use. The comparison of the relative migration of the lipid-protein complexes on the non-denaturing 4–12% Tris glycine PAGE (NOVEX) to that of known standards gave Stokes diameters of 11–14 nm. ApoE was biotinylated using the ECL Protein Biotinylation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and complexed with DMPC as described above. The hydrated density and the Stokes diameters of the biotinylated apoE·DMPC complexes were similar to those obtained for the unlabeled apoE·DMPC. ApoA-I was isolated and purified from delipidated human serum HDL (d 1.063–1.125 g/ml) by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography in 8m urea as described previously by Edelstein et al. (28.Edelstein C. Lim C.T. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5842-5849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I was incorporated into DMPC vesicles, and the complexes were characterized as described above for apoE and the apoE fragments. The majority of the lipid-protein complex was recovered in the density range of 1.095–1.11 g/ml. Non-denaturing 4–12% Tris glycine PAGE (NOVEX) of apoA-I·DMPC indicated a uniform population of complexes with a Stokes diameter of 8.7–9.6 nm. Isolated apoA-I·DMPC was stored in TBS containing 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C until use. Solid-phase assays were performed essentially as described by Klezovitch et al. (42.Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Zhu L. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23856-23865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, the microtiter plates (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) were coated with 100 μl of Bg or GD-Bg (10 μg/ml in TBS) for 2 h at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.02% Tween 20), various protein concentrations of either of the following apoE·DMPC, 22K·DMPC, 10K·DMPC, or apoA-I·DMPC were added to the wells in TBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the wells were washed three times with TBST. The bound protein was detected by using either polyclonal rabbit anti-apoE or anti-apoA-I serum in TBST (each at 1:2,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. At this time, the wells were washed three times with TBST and the goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate in TBST (dilution 1:2,000) was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8) was added, and the color development was followed at 405 nm on a microtiter reader, Biomek 100 (Beckman Instruments). When the biotinylated apoE was used in the system, the binding was detected with a streptavidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (dilution 1:2,000). Absorbance data were then transformed into moles by using standard curves established for each ligand. Molarity of the protein·DMPC complexes was calculated based on the molarity of the corresponding protein component. Scatchard analysis was carried out by plotting the amount of ligand bound (x axis) versus the ratio of bound to free ligand (y axis). TheB max was obtained from the xintercept, and K d was the ratio of theB max over the y intercept. A constant amount (0.3 μg) of either of the following apoE·DMPC, 22K·DMPC, 10K·DMPC or apoA-I·DMPC was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 μg of GD-Bg in a final volume of 30 μl of TBS. Two μl of glycerol were added, and the samples were analyzed by non-denaturing 4–12% Tris glycine PAGE (NOVEX) at 4 °C, following by immunoblotting with either an anti-apoE (dilution 1:5,000) or an anti-apoA-I (dilution 1:2,000) rabbit polyclonal antibody. Protein concentrations of Bg, GD-Bg, apoE, the apoE fragments, and apoA-I were determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ApoE·DMPC exhibited concentration-dependent saturable binding to both Bg and GD-Bg (Fig.4) with similar apparentK d values of 7.5 and 11.3 nm, respectively. The B max values were also similar, 413 and 405 fmol, respectively. Since GAG depletion did not affect the binding parameters, we concluded that the interaction of apoE·DMPC with Bg occurs via its protein core. In order to verify binding specificity, we studied the binding of another α-helical apolipoprotein, apoA-I, incorporated into DMPC vesicles. Under the conditions of our binding assay, apoA-I·DMPC failed to interact with either form of Bg (data not shown). The binding of apoE·DMPC to GD-Bg was calcium-independent (TableI) and occurred under physiological ionic conditions, i.e. in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl. In contrast, at a high concentration of salt (1 m NaCl), the binding was dramatically decreased (Table I), suggesting the ionic nature of the interaction between apoE and the Bg protein core.Table IFactors affecting the binding of apoE·DMPC to immobilized GD-BgBinding%ApoE·DMPC100aThe data are means ± S.D.

The amount of apoE·DMPC bound was determined with a rabbit polyclonal anti-apoE antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It has been previously shown that positively charged lysine and arginine residues are involved in the protein-protein interaction of apoE with the LDL receptor (43.Mahley R.W.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On this premise, we incubated apoE·DMPC (50 nm with respect to apoE) with GD-Bg in the absence or presence of eitherl-lysine or l-arginine, each at a concentration of 0.2 m. Both amino acids partially inhibited the binding of apoE·DMPC to GD-Bg to a similar extent (Table I). When the negatively charged amino acids, l-aspartic orl-glutamic, were used in the system, the binding was also decreased, although to a lesser extent (Table I). Of note, uncharged amino acids l-glycine, l-proline, orl-valine had no effect on the binding (Table I). These results suggest that the interaction of apoE with the Bg protein core is charge-dependent. In order to define the region on apoE responsible for the binding to the Bg protein core, we studied the two major fragments of apoE, 22K (N-terminal) and 10K (C-terminal) complexed with DMPC. The 10K·DMPC complexes exhibited saturable and concentration-dependent binding to immobilized GD-Bg (Fig. 5) with calculated K d and B max of 7.7 nm and 459 fmol, respectively. These values were similar to those obtained with full-length apoE. In contrast, there was no significant binding with the 22K·DMPC complexes (Fig. 5). These observations indicate that the 10K domain is responsible for the binding of apoE to the protein core of Bg. To determine if apoE and its fragments interact with the Bg protein core in solution under physiological salt conditions, we incubated apoE and its fragments, 22K and 10K, all complexed with DMPC, with GD-Bg in TBS and subsequently examined the electrophoretic mobility of each resulting complex by native 4–12% Tris glycine PAGE. As shown in Fig.6, GD-Bg retarded the migration of both full-length apoE and 10K but had no effect on 22K. Moreover, the incubation of apoA-I·DMPC with GD-Bg under similar ex"

The N termini of Shaker proteins are located intracellularly and contain several domains shown to regulate important aspects of channel function, such as speed of inactivation, channel assembly (T1 domain), and steady state protein level (T0 domain, amino acids 3–39 in rabbit). Mutations and/or deletion of certain amino acids in the T0 domain lead to a 13-fold amplification of Kv current as compared with wild type channels, primarily by increasing the absolute number of channel proteins present in the membrane (Segal, A. S., Yao, X., and Desir, G. V. (1999) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 254, 54–64). Although T0 mutants have kinetic properties virtually indistinguishable from wild type, they were noted to have a slightly larger single channel conductance, suggesting that the T0 domain might also interact with the pore region. In the present study we show that although T0 does not affect pore selectivity, it does modulate the binding affinity of the pore blocker, charybdotoxin.

Science. 1999; 285: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In brief, the channel is a homotetramer and its pore resembles an inverted cone with a narrow selectivity filter and a large, intracellular, water filled cavity. Because each Kv subfamily has distinctive kinetic properties, structure-function relationships of Kv proteins have been extensively studied using naturally occurring isoforms and mutants obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The extreme N terminus mediates rapid inactivation (12.Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 13.Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T.

Shaker Kv1.3 is expressed in brain, lymphocytes, and kidney, and there are excellent data showing that the Kv1.3 subfamily mediates the n type current of T lymphocytes (17.Grissmer S. Dethlefs B. Wasmuth J.J. Goldin A.L. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9411-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18.Cai Y.-C. Osborne P.B. North R.A.

Osborne P.B. North R.A. Dooley D.C. Douglass J. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, the kinetics of activation/inactivation and voltage sensitivity of the n current do not change in activated T lymphocytes. Conversely, blockers of the n current inhibit mitogen-induced cell division and secretion of interleukin 2. We recently identified an N-terminal region of Shaker Kv1.3 (T0 domain, amino acids 3–39 of rabbit Kv1.3) that modulates channel expression. Deletion of T0 increases whole cell current by more than 10-fold (22.Segal A.S. Yao X. Desir G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that negatively charged amino acids are essential components of the T0 domain. Although the deletion amplifies the magnitude of expressed currents, it affects neither the time constants of activation and inactivation nor the voltage dependence. A slight increase in single channel conductance was noted in the mutant, but it could not account for the observed gain-of-function. Rather, the change in T0 mutant current was caused largely by a dramatic increase in channel protein at the plasma membrane (23.Yao X. Huang Y. Kwan H.Y. Chan P. Desir G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms mediating this change in steady state protein level are still being investigated but do not appear to involve clathrin-mediated endocytosis (22.Segal A.S. Yao X. Desir G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Because a small increase in single channel conductance was noted in T0 mutants, it was hypothesized the T0 domain might also interact with the pore region. We find that although T0 mutations do not affect pore selectivity, they do modulate the affinity of channel blockers binding to the extracellular surface of the pore region. The NT3–39 mutant was generated by deleting the DNA sequence coding for amino acids 3–39 from wild type rabbit Kv1.3 (GenBankTM accession number U38240) DNA using polymerase chain reaction (see Fig. 1). The sense primer (GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGAGCCACCATGACGGAGCAGGAGTGCTGCGGGGAG) contained a T7 polymerase site and the coding sequence for amino acids 1–2 and 40–51. The antisense primer (TTTTTTTTTCCTGTCCTTGATGGATGGTCT) contained a stop codon and a poly(A) tail. NT3–39 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using an Air Thermo Cycler 1605 (Idaho Technologies). The amplified product was cloned into pBluescript and sequenced by the method of Sanger et al. (24.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) to confirm that no other mutations besides the 3–39 deletion were introduced during the amplification process. Two other mutants, NT3–27 and NT3–37* were generated as described previously (22.Segal A.S. Yao X. Desir G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were dissected from ovarian lobes and stored in modified Barth's solution. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl containing either 5 ng of in vitro transcribed, 5′-capped rabKv1.3 (WT)1 RNA, 5 ng of NT3–39 (mutated) RNA, 5 ng of WT/5 ng of mutated RNA, or water as a negative control. Whole cell currents were recorded using a standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp (OC-725, Warner Inst.) 1–3 days after injection. Oocytes were impaled with microelectrodes filled with 0.5m KCl (resistance, 0.5–5 MΩ). The bath contained 88 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaH2CO3, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In some experiments, the ionic strength of the bath solution was reduced while keeping osmolarity constant. This low ionic strength solution contained 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaHCO3, 96 mm sucrose, and 5 mm HEPES. Amplified currents were filtered at 2 kHz then recorded and analyzed using PULSE (HEKA, Lambretch, Germany) and Igor-Pro (Wavemetrics). For ion substitution and tail current analysis, the chloride salt of the test cation was substituted for NaCl. Ion selectivity was measured by tail current analysis. Deletion of the T0 domain, mutant NT3–39 (Fig.1 A) was previously shown to cause a 13-fold increase in Kv1.3 current expressed inXenopus oocytes (22.Segal A.S. Yao X. Desir G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To confirm these results, cRNA of wild type or mutants was injected in Xenopus oocytes, and channel expression was analyzed using two-microelectrode voltage clamp and patch clamp. NT3–39 cRNA caused a large increase in whole cell current 3 days post-injection as compared with wild type cRNA as shown in the current-voltage (I-V) plot for peak currents (Fig. 1 B). Peak current at +80 mV was 1.35 ± 0.28 μA (n = 8) for wild type as compared with 31.22 ± 8.4 μA (n = 8) for NT3–39 mutant (p < 0.0001). Patch clamp recordings of wild type and NT3–39 single channels showed the unitary conductance was slightly increased in the mutant: between −40 mV and +40 mV: wild type = 8.7 pS and gNT3–39 mutant = 10.0 pS (22.Segal A.S. Yao X. Desir G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although such an increase could not explain the magnification in whole cell conductance, we were intrigued by the possibility the N-terminal T0 domain was interacting with the pore region. Because mutations in the S4-S5 loop of Shaker have been shown to alter rubidium selectivity, single channel conductance for potassium and rubidium, and the sensitivity of the channel to inhibition by intracellular cations (25.Slesinger P.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1993; 11: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it is likely that other regions of Shaker channels also contribute to the overall structure of the pore. To detect possible interactions of the T0 domain with the pore region, we first tested whether T0 domain mutations affected cation selectivity. To estimate the selectivity of WT and NT3–39 mutants with respect to potassium, rubidium, and sodium, tail currents were examined at voltages ranging from −100 to +20 mV, whereas external potassium or rubidium concentration was varied from 2 to 88 mm. Changes in reversal potentials were plotted against changes in potassium and rubidium concentrations. The zero current conductance ratios for potassium:sodium and rubidium:sodium were calculated based on the observed change in reversal potential per decade change in external cation concentration. The potassium permeability:sodium permeability ratio for both WT and NT3–39 was the same (ratio of 35). Similarly, the rubidium permeability:sodium permeability ratio for WT and NT3–39 was identical (ratio of 11). Substituting gluconate for chloride did not change the magnitude of the outward current. These results indicate that the T0 domain does not measurably affect channel selectivity. We then asked whether the T0 domain could modulate the affinity of the channel blocker, charybdotoxin (CTX). CTX is a 37-amino acid peptide isolated from the venom of the scorpion Leirus quinquestriatus. It inhibits several types of potassium channels, including Kv1.3, at nanomolar concentration (9.MacKinnon R. Miller C. Science. 1989; 245: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 26.Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Science. 1988; 239: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) by binding to the extracellular face of the pore region, with a one-to-one stoichiometry and occluding the “mouth” of the channel. High affinity binding of CTX is critically dependent on electrostatic interactions of the positively charged toxin with negatively charged amino acid residues located at the mouth of the channel. Indeed, in DrosophilaShaker, binding affinity is reduced by a factor of 3.5 by mutating glutamate 422 to glutamine and by a factor of 12 by substituting lysine (9.MacKinnon R. Miller C. Science. 1989; 245: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We measured the effect of CTX on WT Kv1.3 and NT3–39 expressed in oocytes. Although 1 nm CTX inhibited WT current by 60%, in good agreement with published IC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 20 nm for human, mouse, and rat Kv1.3, NT3–39 currents were insensitive to inhibition by 1 nm CTX. The dose response curves for WT and NT3–39 were then determined (Fig.2). Compared with WT, NT3–39 is 20-fold less sensitive to inhibition by CTX (K i of 0.5 nm versus 9.3 nm). It has been reported that the properties of Kv1.3 currents can vary depending on the cRNA concentration level injected in oocytes (27.Honoré E. Attali B. Romey G. Lesage F. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For instance, at low Kv1.3 cRNA concentration (0.11 ng/oocyte), the expressed current inactivates and is fully inhibited by 10 nm CTX. In contrast, at high cRNA concentration (35 ng/oocyte), the current did not inactivate and was insensitive to 10 nm CTX. Honoré et al. (27.Honoré E. Attali B. Romey G. Lesage F. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) thought that at high RNA concentration, the channel interacted differently with the cytoskeleton. The RNA concentration used in our studies were the same (5 ng) for both WT and NT3–39. There were no differences in the activation and inactivation kinetics parameters of mutant and wild type. Furthermore, disruption of the cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D resulted in a similar degree of inhibition of both wild type and mutant channels currents (22.Segal A.S. Yao X. Desir G.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It is possible that removal of the T0 domain causes large structural changes in the pore that lead to nonspecific alterations in the affinity of different and structurally unrelated inhibitors. To determine whether this was the case, other known inhibitors of Kv1.3 were tested. As shown in TableI, although NT3–39 displays relative resistance to the effect of CTX, it is inhibited to the same degree as wild type by other known blockers of the channel. These data strongly suggest that the T0 domain interacts specifically with the CTX-binding site.Table IEffect of T0 domain mutation on inhibitor profile of Kv1.34AP (5 mm)TEA (50 mm)Glyb (250 μm)CTX (1 nm)Wild type78 ± 5, n = 354 ± 3, n = 350 ± 2, n = 364 ± 7, n = 8NT3–3994 ± 5, n = 342 ± 4, n = 345 ± 2, n = 38 ± 2, n = 8NSNSNSp < 0.01The percentage of inhibition of peak WT and NT3–39 currents by various potassium channel inhibitors was determined. Open table in a new tab The percentage of inhibition of peak WT and NT3–39 currents by various potassium channel inhibitors was determined. This effect could be mediated by conformational changes in the pore that physically prevent CTX from reaching its binding site (steric hindrance), resulting in weaker CTX block. For instance, T0 could bind to the intracellular loop between S4, the voltage gate, and S5, the outer helix that form the pore and faces the lipid bilayer. As mentioned above, point mutations of that cytoplasmic loop can significantly alter pore function. Alternatively, T0 could interact to the carboxy end of S6, the inner helix lining the central pore. Although we have no data supporting such a mechanism, there is precedence for the N terminus of a Shaker protein binding to and blocking the intracellular mouth of the pore (13.Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Further support for the importance of conformational factors is given by the observation that replacing a glycine (60 Å3) found at the mouth of Kv1.3 with larger residues such as glutamine and tyrosine (145–195 Å3) confers resistance to inhibition by CTX. At present we cannot exclude the possibility that T0 modulates CTX binding by interacting with a site close to the pore and inducing a conformational change that strengthens the interaction of CTX to its binding site in the channel pore. Crystallographic information is needed to rigorously test this hypothesis. Alternatively, the T0 domain that contains six negative charges and one positive charge (Fig.1 A) could affect the binding of CTX (net valence of +5) to the pore via through-space electrostatic interactions. Such a mechanism has been shown to operate over distances of 5–20 Å (9.MacKinnon R. Miller C. Science. 1989; 245: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 29.Pantoliano M.W. Whitlow M. Wood J.F. Rollence M.L. Finzel B.C. Gilliland G.L. Poulos T.L. Bryan P.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8311-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30.Linse S. Brodin P. Johansson C. Thulin E. Grundstrom T. Nature. 1988; 335: 651-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As previously mentioned, high affinity binding of CTX depends on electrostatic interactions of the positively charged toxin with negatively charged amino acid residues located at the mouth of Shaker channels. The model predicts that T0 mutants should also be resistant to other toxins that bind to the pore and inhibit through-space electrostatic interactions. ShK, a 35-amino acid residue polypeptide isolated from the sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus, also blocks Kv1.3. Its structure is different from that of scorpion toxins. However, it contains a set of conserved residues (a lysine and a tyrosine 7 Å apart) that have been shown to be critical for block of potassium channel by scorpion toxins (31.Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C.L.C. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Menez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4302-4309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). ShK-DAP22 (a mutant form of ShK) specifically inhibits Kv1.3 by binding to external mouth of pore region through electrostatic interactions. The potency of 50 pm ShK-DAP22 to inhibit WT and NT3–39 was tested. As shown in Fig. 3, NT3–39 was significantly less sensitive to inhibition by 50 pm ShK-DAP22 than WT (NT3–39, 31.4 ± 7%, n = 15; WT, 56.78 ± 6.5, n = 7; p < 0.009). The electrostatic model also predicts that CTX binding should be sensitive to the ionic strength (i.s.) of the external solution. In WT, negatively charged amino acids located in the pore region and the T0 domain both contribute to the overall negative charge of the CTX-binding site. At low ionic strength the interaction of positively charged CTX with its negatively charged binding site should be stronger. One would then predict that, as compared with WT, the affinity CTX for T0 mutants will be less sensitive to changes in ionic strength. More specifically, as ionic strength decreases, the increase in affinity of CTX for NT3–39 will be less than that for WT. To test this hypothesis, inhibition of WT and NT3039 by 1 nm CTX was measured in external solutions of high and low ionic strength. The high i.s. solution contained 88 mm sodium and 2 mm potassium, whereas the low i.s. bath had 40 mm sodium, 2 mm potassium with sucrose added to keep tonicity constant. As shown in Fig.4 A, both WT and NT3–39 were more sensitive to inhibition by CTX at low ionic strength. However, the increase in CTX sensitivity was far greater for NT3–39 than for WT (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that T0 does not mediate its action primarily via electrostatic interactions. If the T0 domain (net charge of −5) affects CTX sensitivity by electrostatic interactions, one would predict that progressive charge neutralization would lead to a measurable decrease in CTX sensitivity. NT3–27 is a mutant (net charge of −1) in which the T0 domain is partially deleted (Fig.1 A). Despite the significant reduction in overall charge of the T0 domain (from −5 to −1), NT3–27 is as sensitive to inhibition by 1 nm CTX as WT (53 ± 5%, n = 3). Furthermore, two point mutations (R31L and E33Q) that do not affect the overall charge were incorporated in NT3–27 (NT3–27*; Fig.1 A). Although NT3–27* carries the same net charge at the T0 domain as does NT3–27, the former exhibited a decrease in CTX sensitivity similar to that observed for NT3–39. Indeed, 1 nm CTX inhibited NT3–27* by only 9 ± 2%. (n = 3). Taken together, these data do not support the notion that the T0 domain interacts with the CTX-binding site located at the pore region via through-space electrostatic interactions. Because the functional Kv1.3 channel is a homotetramer, it contains four T0 domains that could potentially interact with the pore. A reduction in the number of T0 domains present in the functional channel should lead to the formation of a channel with intermediate CTX sensitivity. This prediction was tested by co-injecting WT and NT3–39 cRNAs inXenopus oocytes and determining the K ifor CTX. We found that WT/NT3–39 current had a K ifor CTX of 4.8 nm. Heteromultimers of WT and NT3–39 had, as predicted, an intermediate phenotype, being less sensitive to CTX inhibition than WT (K i = 0.5 nm) but more than NT3–39 (K i = 9.3 nm) (Fig.5). Although it is clear that WT and NT3–39 form heteromultimers, the stoichiometry of each functional channel is unknown, and, therefore, the contribution of each T0 domain to the stabilization of CTX at its binding site cannot be estimated. However, we can definitively conclude that the CTX sensitivity is altered in the ensemble. The crystal structure of the T1 domain of Shaker indicated that it forms a tetrameric structure, and this led to the suggestion that the complex might function as selectivity filter on the cytoplasmic side (32.Kreusch A. Pfaffinger P.J. Stevens C.F. Choe S. Nature. 1998; 392: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 33.Bixby K.A. Nanao M.H. Shen N.V. Kreusch A. Bellamy H. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was not confirmed by recent studies examining the kinetic properties of mutant Shakerpotassium channels lacking the entire T1 domain (28.Kobertz W.R. Miller C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1122-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, although channel expression was significantly reduced compared with wild type, both mutant and wild type had similar kinetic and pharmacologic properties. Of relevance to the present study, sensitivity to CTX was unchanged in the T1 deletion mutants. This discrepancy could be explained by several factors including different Shakerisoforms (Kv1.3 versus Shaker B), markedly different deletions (36 aa versus 205 aa), and use of a CTX variant (CTX-M29L) on Shaker B with a mutated CTX site. We have previously shown that the T0 domain ofShaker Kv1.3 regulates steady state channel protein density in the plasma membrane. Compared with wild type, deleting the T0 domain leads to a 13-fold amplification of whole cell Kv current, largely by increasing the absolute number of channel proteins present in the membrane. Although the T0 domain is located at the N terminus (amino acids 3–39), the current data strongly suggest that it also interacts with the pore region. Indeed, although T0 does not affect pore selectivity, it does modulate the action of drugs whose binding to the pore depends in part on electrostatic interactions. Even though the T0 domain has a net negative charge of −5, our results do not support the notion that it modulates CTX sensitivity via through-space electrostatic interactions."
