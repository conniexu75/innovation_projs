https://openalex.org/W1588557783,"The binding affinity of serum protein for testosterone (and also of serum albumin as a reference protein) was determined by a technique based on the principle of equilibrium dialysis but with the use of the cross-linked dextran, Sephadex G-25, in a batchwise fashion on a semimicro scale. The binding parameters were shown to be dependent on the concentrations of both protein and steroid. The logarithm of the reciprocal of the protein concentration and the logarithm of the reciprocal of the bound steroid concentration (at 50% steroid binding) were in linear relationship. A sensitive and rapid method thus evolved for the detection and quantitative estimation of serum protein, or proteins, exhibiting a specific or high binding affinity for testosterone. This new technique, entailing a novel treatment of the experimental data, may also prove to be useful in the general study of steroid-protein interaction. Testosterone-binding levels in various human sera were determined in a comparative survey; markedly elevated levels were observed in advanced pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1595987122,"Abstract 1. Hepatic levels of cystathionine synthase and methionine-activating enzyme are significantly lower in rats fed a diet low in methionine and supplemented with cystine than in rats growing at the same rate while maintained on a diet adequate in methionine, with or without cystine supplementation. Cystathionase levels are also decreased, but to a smaller extent. Betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase is not affected. 2. The enzymatic activities which are lowered are restored toward normal by injections of l-methionine or l-homocysteine. 3. Methionine-activating enzyme and cystathionine synthase are inhibited in vitro by l-cystine. However, the decreased enzyme levels in the livers of rats fed the low methionine, cystine-supplemented diet cannot be attributed to either a dissociable inhibitor or cystine binding by the enzyme proteins. It seems likely that the cystine effect represents repression of enzyme synthesis. 4. The physiological meaning of these changes in enzymatic activity is briefly discussed. The changes are such that they may well explain the known methionine-sparing effect of cystine. 5. A possible application of these findings to the treatment of patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine synthase deficiency is mentioned."

The number of these genital responses per 30-minute test was markedly influenced by withdrawal or administration of testosterone."
https://openalex.org/W1990956644,"p-Chlorophenylalanine, a potent inhibitor of phenylalanine hydroxylase in vivo, has been used to simulate phenylketonuria in rats. This inhibitor, when administered with phenylalanine, produces marked elevation of blood and tissue phenylalanine without an increase in tyrosine. Disproportionate ratios of phenylalanine to tyrosine are characteristic of phenylketonuria in humans. The use of p-chlorophenylalanine permits the production of this characteristic amino acid imbalance in experimental animals."
https://openalex.org/W2007471064,"Tensions exerted by cleavage furrows in isometric contraction were measured by means of flexible glass needles whose characteristics of bending had already been determined. The tension of Astriclypeus manni furrows in second division is 3.04 × 10-3 ± 0.95 × 10-3 dyne; that for Pseudocentrotus depressus eggs in first division is 2.00 × 10-3 ± 0.43 × 10-3 dyne. The tension required for cleavage probably does not exceed 1.5 × 10-3 dyne. According to existing morphological evidence, these values can be accounted for by a substance whose capacity for exerting tension does not exceed that of an actomyosin thread."
https://openalex.org/W1594948172,"Abstract Thymidylate synthetase was purified about 600- to 800-fold from 7-day chick embryo and was found to methylate uridine 5'-phosphate at 40% the rate of deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate. The pH optima and salt effects on the two reactions differed, but most of the evidence indicated that the same enzyme was responsible for both activities. The Km for deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate was 102- to 103-fold lower than that for uridine 5'-phosphate, depending on the assay employed. Chromatography on Sephadex G-200 and sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed the molecular weight of the synthetase to be about 58,000. Phosphatases were found during the purification that hydrolyzed the pyrimidine ribonucleotides faster than the deoxyribonucleotides. The synthetase was protected against heat inactivation by deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate and, to a lesser extent, by 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate, but not by uridine 5'-phosphate. The activation energy for both deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate and uridine 5'-phosphate was 12 kcal per mole. Inhibition by 5-fluorodeoxyuridine 5'-phosphate appeared to be competitive with respect to deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate, but by incubating the enzyme with inhibitor prior to the addition of substrate, noncompetitive inhibition was obtained. Similar results were observed with 4-N-hydroxydeoxycytidine 5'-phosphate. Double reciprocal plots with fixed and variable substrates revealed that neither deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate nor 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate affected the Km of the other, an observation indicative of a random addition mechanism. However, product inhibition by thymidine 5'-phosphate was asymmetric since it was competitive with respect to deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate and noncompetitive with respect to 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. The mechanism by which 1 of the hydrogen atoms of the thymine methyl group is derived was investigated with tetrahydrofolate labeled with tritium in positions 6 and 7 of the pteridine ring. The transfer was found to occur, without dilution, from position 6 only."
https://openalex.org/W1522638167,"Abstract The flavin semiquinoid form of l-amino acid oxidase has been found not to be reduced further by l-amino acids. By rapid reaction spectrophotometry, the long wave length-absorbing intermediate formed transiently in the reduction of the enzyme by l-amino acids has been shown not to be attributable to the uncombined semiquinoid species, but to involve also some contribution from the substrate. Kinetic studies of the reaction show that a ternary complex of enzyme, substrate, and oxygen is involved in the over-all catalytic reaction. The significance of these findings in terms of the catalytic reaction mechanism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2004407868,Selective breeding produced two strains of rats that differ in their susceptibility to morphine addiction. Inbreeding the more susceptible rats in an unselected population produced susceptible offspring; inbreeding resistant rats produced resistant offspring. Further selection and inbreeding increased the strain difference in the F(2) and F(3) generations. The F(3) generation also differed in their susceptibility to alcohol addiction.
https://openalex.org/W2003424598,"Contact inhibition of replication of the established mammalian cell line 3T3 was examined during growth of the colony and compared with that of the Chinese-hamster cell line CHL-1. The growth curves of cells in the colonies conformed to the predicted exponential and linear rates for CHL-1 and 3T3 respectively. Autoradiographs of colonies in which DNA was labeled with tritiated thymidine showed that in 3T3 colonies, only peripheral cells were labeled, while CHL-1 colonies were labeled throughout."

https://openalex.org/W1609281112,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersions of α-chymotrypsinogen, β-casein, the histone fraction, F1, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were studied in the spectral zone of 190 to 350 mµ. The Cotton effects indicated that these proteins are nonhelical in the native state and that they can be converted in part to the α-helical conformation by treatment with n-propyl alcohol or anionic detergents. Tetradecyl sodium sulfate was more effective than dodecyl sulfate, and the latter was more potent than decyl sulfate in ordering the polypeptide chains. In the presence of high concentrations of propanol, the spectrum of the β conformation appeared, especially in chymotrypsinogen and soybean trypsin inhibitor; i.e. negative minima were found in the rotatory dispersion curves at 228 to 232 mµ and positive maxima at 200 to 206 mµ. Low pH, 1.8 to 3.5, enhanced the effects of the detergents and propanol. Although the transitions were practically instantaneous at room temperature, the amount of the β form, as estimated from the positive extremum at 203 to 206 mµ, increased slowly on long standing. Native chymotrypsinogen, β-casein, histone, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, according to optical rotatory dispersion data, were found to be devoid of the β conformation. Circular dichroism measurements confirmed the conclusion that the β form appeared in soybean trypsin inhibitor on treatment with propanol."
https://openalex.org/W1548507457,"Abstract The properties of purified liver hyaluronidase have been compared with those of testis hyaluronidase. The lysosomal enzyme showed a similar action pattern to the testis enzyme (1), but had a lower pH optimum at pH 3.5 and reduced affinity for hexasaccharide. The Km for hyaluronate was 8 x 10-2 mg per ml. Sodium chloride was not required for enzyme activity but served to prevent inhibition by sulfated polysaccharides, notably chondroitin sulfate B, which had a Ki of 3.8 x 10-4 mg per ml. The polycation, protamine sulfate, also prevented polyanion inhibition. Liver hyaluronidase, like the testis enzyme (12), exhibited transglycosylase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1666395537,"Abstract Trypsin-soybean trypsin inhibitor complex was prepared by mixing essentially equimolar quantities of modified (Arg-Ile bond broken) soybean trypsin inhibitor and trypsin at pH 8.0. The pH of the solution was then suddenly dropped to 2 by addition of strong acid, thus allowing the complex to dissociate. The soybean inhibitor was separated from this solution by ammonium sulfate precipitation. This inhibitor was then allowed to react with trypsin at pH 3.75 and the time course of proton release was recorded. An overshoot was observed. This indicates that the inhibitor was predominantly virgin (Arg-Ile bond intact). Since the virgin inhibitor is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the modified inhibitor, the resynthesis of the reactive site peptide bond was achieved by kinetic control."
https://openalex.org/W1655545500,"Abstract Uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.9) from the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, has been characterized. The specific enzyme activity increases 10-fold during the course of morphogenesis. This increase is sensitive to coincident inhibition of protein synthesis by actidione and prior inhibition of ribonucleic acid synthesis by actinomycin D. A new method of assay was developed which can be applied generally to nucleoside diphosphate-sugar pyrophosphorylase reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2093576030,"Intracerebral injections of puromycin, which have been shown to impair memory 3 hours after training, increase the susceptibility of mice to seizures after administration of normally subconvulsive doses of pentylenetetrazol. Cycloheximide, which antagonizes the puromycin-induced amnesia 3 hours after training, also antagonizes the puromycin effect on susceptibility to seizure. The anticonvulsant diphenylhydantoin antagonizes the puromycin effect on memory. The puromycin effect on memory may be due to occult seizures."

It is concluded that CDP-diglyceride is synthesized by a CTP:1,2-diacylglycerophosphate-cytidyl transferase (EC 2.7.7) reaction. Palmitoyl coenzyme A inhibits CDP-diglyceride formation from endogenous substrates as well as from added phosphatidic acid. Chromatographic methods for the identification of CDP-diglyceride are described."

https://openalex.org/W2042370148,"Intraperitoneal injection of physostigmine in rats produced a retrograde amnesia of a trained task of escaping shock. This amnesic effect was a U-shaped function of the length of the interval between initial training and injection. In all cases, retraining Occurred 30 minutes after injection. A substantial effect was produced by physostigmine if its application was made 30 minutes after training; there was no effect if application and tests were made 1, 2, or 3 days after the original training. When the substance was injected and the rats were retrained 5, 7, or 14 days after the original training, a substantial effect again appeared. These results are similar to those reported in experiments in which another anticholinesterase, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, was applied intracerebrally. The data demonstrate a similar pattern of change of the amnesia with time, and they substantiate the view that neither the place of application nor the brain lesions caused the reported amnesia."
https://openalex.org/W1610214444,"Abstract Egg yolk phosvitin and components of it, separated by countercurrent distribution, were subjected to a physical study to obtain information concerning the homogeneity of this protein with respect to molecular size and shape. 1. Both components of phosvitin sediment at the same rate as the unfractionated protein (s020,w = 3.7 S, corrected for the effect of selective solvation). 2. The diffusion coefficients of the major and minor phosvitin components appear to be slightly different (D20,w = 5.5 x 10-7 and 5.0 x 10-7 cm2 per sec, respectively). 3. No significant differences were found between the apparent partial specific volumes of the components of phosvitin and the unfractionated protein (V = 0.52 ml per g). 4. Analysis of sedimentation velocity data by the method of Fujita yielded results consistent with the conclusion that the components of phosvitin are very similar, if not identical, with respect to molecular size and shape. 5. The molecular weights of the major and minor phosvitin components were calculated as 36,000 and 40,000, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1542175072,"Abstract A phytohemagglutinin has been isolated in 80 to 90% purity from the mushroom Agaricus campestris. This protein had a sedimentation constant of 4.2 S and an electrophoretic mobility, at pH 8.6, remindful of the properties of a fast γ-globulin. It was a nonspecific agglutinin reacting with erythrocytes and leukocytes from a number of species. The hemagglutination reaction was independent of temperature from 0–80° and of pH from 4 to 10, but was ionic strength dependent. The hemagglutination reaction was not inhibited by sugars but was inhibited by a red cell ghost sonic suspension. Enzymatic and chemical treatments of the sonically disintegrated inhibitor indicated that part or all of the inhibitor was a protein or polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1616916824,"Some reactions of acetic anhydride with model compounds containing amino and phenolic hydroxyl groups have been studied. From the observed reaction rates, optimal experimental conditions were selected for acetylation of the terminal amino group and the tyrosine hydroxyl group of oxytocin. Two new analogues, N-acetyl-O-acetyloxytocin and N-carbamyl-O-acetyloxytocin have been prepared. Evidence was obtained concerning the sites of reaction and degree of purity. Neither of these analogues causes contraction of the isolated rat uterus but both inhibit the action of oxytocin. The analogues are stable under physiological conditions of temperature and pH. On treatment with hydroxylamine, N-acetyl-O-acetyloxytocin gave rise to N-acetyloxytocin, and N-carbamyl-O-acetyloxytocin gave rise to N-carbamyloxytocin, the reactions being accompanied by disappearance of the inhibitory properties and appearance of oxytocic activity. The preparation of 14C-labeled N-acetyl-O-acetyloxytocin is described."

https://openalex.org/W1544873503,"Net utilization of esterified fatty acids was demonstrated in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells incubated in vitro. Cells in which the lipids had previously been labeled by incorporation of fatty acid-1-14C lost lipid ester radioactivity progressively during incubation. The fractional loss of such radioactivity from ester stores exceeded net loss of chemically determined lipid esters, showing that the endogenous esters must include more than one kinetically distinguishable pool. Phospholipids, predominantly lecithin, provided most of the ester fatty acid utilized. Part of the fatty acid hydrolyzed from endogenous esters was oxidized to CO2, and the remainder was released into the medium as free fatty acid. Incubation in a medium containing a high concentration of free fatty acid did not prevent net depletion of lipid esters. On the other hand, incubation with free fatty acid plus glucose produced a highly significant net increment in lipid esters. But even in the face of this net increase in total lipid ester, radioactive fatty acid previously incorporated was released, indicating a true dynamic state. The primary effect of glucose and free fatty acid in the medium appears to be the stimulation of ester formation, not the suppression of lipid ester breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W1551542485,"Abstract Antibiotic U-22,324 is a polypeptide produced by the fungus Trichoderma viride. Cycloheximide was found to block gross cellular protein synthesis of T. viride with little interference with antibiotic synthesis. No radioactive label was recovered in the ribosomes when labeled amino acids and cycloheximide were added to a culture at the onset of peptide synthesis although net antibiotic synthesis took place under these conditions. The cell-bound antibiotic portion was exclusively localized within the gross cellular debris fraction. This suggests that antibiotic U-22,324 is not synthesized on ribosomes but by an extraribosomal peptide synthetic mechanism similar to the one proposed for bacterial peptide antibiotics, toxins, and cell wall components."

The enzyme was purified 400-fold by molecular sieve chromatography. The purified enzyme contains about 20% ribonucleic acid with a ratio of guanylic plus cytidylic acid to adenylic plus uridylic acid about 1.3. The nucleotide moiety is resistant to ribonuclease but is cleaved by venom phosphodiesterase. The s20,w of the whole ribonucleoprotein is 1.42 with a molecular weight of 13,500. Three sulfhydryl groups were detected in the enzyme. Separation of the enzyme into the protein and nucleic acid components results in complete loss of catalytic activity, which is largely restored on recombination."

https://openalex.org/W1578226548,"Abstract Stereospecific reactions were detected in a fluorescence spectrometric examination of the catalytic oxidation of the optical isomers of adrenaline, noradrenaline, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) by mushroom tyrosinase. The stereospecificity, which is preferential rather than absolute, can be detected by following either an initial step of the oxidative sequence or a later fluorescence formation step. Compared with catechol and 2-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)ethylamine (dopamine) on the basis of the initial oxidation step, the velocities of their oxidation decrease in the following order: catechol g l(-)-dopa g dopamine g d(+)-dopa g l(+)-adrenaline g d(-)-adrenaline g l(+)-noradrenaline g d(-)-noradrenaline. The velocities of formation of fluorescent intermediates produced from adrenaline and noradrenaline decrease in the following order: l(+)-adrenaline g d(-)-adrenaline g l(+)-noradrenaline g d(-)-noradrenaline. l(-)-Dopa was shown to have a more pronounced effect than d(+)-dopa as an activator both of the tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidative cyclization of adrenaline and of the fluorescence formation step. Approximate steady state oxygen Michaelis constants (Km (O2)), ascertained during the oxidation of the optical isomers of adrenaline, were found to be different for each isomer, the Km (O2) for the d(-) isomer being almost 2 times higher than that for the l(+) isomer. The observed effects of the side chain substituents on the oxidation velocities suggest that tyrosinase contains a stereospecific reaction rate control site. It is proposed that the side chains bind to the control site through chelation with copper and function as reaction rate modulators."

Activity in the hypothalamus increased significantly during the first 2 days of fighting, while the activity in the amygdala and frontal cortex remained essentially unchanged. After 8 days, activity in all three brain areas declined. After 14 days of fighting the monoamine oxidase activity returned to normal, but another decrease was observed in the three areas after 20 days of fighting."
