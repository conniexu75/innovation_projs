https://openalex.org/W2110366604,"Factors regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) remain incompletely understood. Because ISCs exist among microbial ligands, immune receptors such as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) could play a role. We now hypothesize that ISCs express TLR4 and that the activation of TLR4 directly on the intestinal stem cells regulates their ability to proliferate or to undergo apoptosis. Using flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ hybridization for the intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5, we demonstrate that TLR4 is expressed on the Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cells. TLR4 activation reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in ISCs both in vivo and in ISC organoids, a finding not observed in mice lacking TLR4 in the Lgr5-positive ISCs, confirming the in vivo significance of this effect. To define molecular mechanisms involved, TLR4 inhibited ISC proliferation and increased apoptosis via the p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), as TLR4 did not affect crypt proliferation or apoptosis in organoids or mice lacking PUMA. In vivo effects of TLR4 on ISCs required TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) but were independent of myeloid-differentiation primary response-gene 88 (MYD88) and TNFα. Physiological relevance was suggested, as TLR4 activation in necrotizing enterocolitis led to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of the intestinal crypts in a manner that could be reversed by inhibition of PUMA, both globally or restricted to the intestinal epithelium. These findings illustrate that TLR4 is expressed on ISCs where it regulates their proliferation and apoptosis through activation of PUMA and that TLR4 regulation of ISCs contributes to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis."
https://openalex.org/W2153368605,"PUF proteins are a conserved family of eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins that regulate specific mRNAs: they control many processes including stem cell proliferation, fertility, and memory formation. PUFs repress protein expression from their target mRNAs but the mechanism by which they do so remains unclear, especially for humans. Humans possess two PUF proteins, PUM1 and PUM2, which exhibit similar RNA binding specificities. Here we report new insights into their regulatory activities and mechanisms of action. We developed functional assays to measure sequence-specific repression by PUM1 and PUM2. Both robustly inhibit translation and promote mRNA degradation. Purified PUM complexes were found to contain subunits of the CCR4-NOT (CNOT) complex, which contains multiple enzymes that catalyze mRNA deadenylation. PUMs interact with the CNOT deadenylase subunits in vitro. We used three approaches to determine the importance of deadenylases for PUM repression. First, dominant-negative mutants of CNOT7 and CNOT8 reduced PUM repression. Second, RNA interference depletion of the deadenylases alleviated PUM repression. Third, the poly(A) tail was necessary for maximal PUM repression. These findings demonstrate a conserved mechanism of PUF-mediated repression via direct recruitment of the CCR4-POP2-NOT deadenylase leading to translational inhibition and mRNA degradation. A second, deadenylation independent mechanism was revealed by the finding that PUMs repress an mRNA that lacks a poly(A) tail. Thus, human PUMs are repressors capable of deadenylation-dependent and -independent modes of repression.

https://openalex.org/W1974517295,"Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is a preferred method for rapid and accurate quantification of gene expression studies. Appropriate application of RT-qPCR requires accurate normalization though the use of reference genes. As no single reference gene is universally suitable for all experiments, thus reference gene(s) validation under different experimental conditions is crucial for RT-qPCR analysis. To date, only a few studies on reference genes have been done in other plants but none in papaya. In the present work, we selected 21 candidate reference genes, and evaluated their expression stability in 246 papaya fruit samples using three algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder. The samples consisted of 13 sets collected under different experimental conditions, including various tissues, different storage temperatures, different cultivars, developmental stages, postharvest ripening, modified atmosphere packaging, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) treatment, hot water treatment, biotic stress and hormone treatment. Our results demonstrated that expression stability varied greatly between reference genes and that different suitable reference gene(s) or combination of reference genes for normalization should be validated according to the experimental conditions. In general, the internal reference genes EIF (Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A), TBP1 (TATA binding protein 1) and TBP2 (TATA binding protein 2) genes had a good performance under most experimental conditions, whereas the most widely present used reference genes, ACTIN (Actin 2), 18S rRNA (18S ribosomal RNA) and GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were not suitable in many experimental conditions. In addition, two commonly used programs, geNorm and Normfinder, were proved sufficient for the validation. This work provides the first systematic analysis for the selection of superior reference genes for accurate transcript normalization in papaya under different experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2082316745,"At rest, spontaneous brain activity measured by fMRI is summarized by a number of distinct resting state networks (RSNs) following similar temporal time courses. Such networks have been consistently identified across subjects using spatial ICA (independent component analysis). Moreover, graph theory-based network analyses have also been applied to resting-state fMRI data, identifying similar RSNs, although typically at a coarser spatial resolution. In this work, we examined resting-state fMRI networks from 194 subjects at a voxel-level resolution, and examined the consistency of RSNs across subjects using a metric called scaled inclusivity (SI), which summarizes consistency of modular partitions across networks. Our SI analyses indicated that some RSNs are robust across subjects, comparable to the corresponding RSNs identified by ICA. We also found that some commonly reported RSNs are less consistent across subjects. This is the first direct comparison of RSNs between ICAs and graph-based network analyses at a comparable resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2001788953,"The drug 4-methylmethcathinone (4-MMC; aka, mephedrone, MMCAT, “plant food”, “bath salts”) is a recent addition to the list of popular recreational psychomotor-stimulant compounds. Relatively little information about this drug is available in the scientific literature, but popular media reports have driven recent drug control actions in the UK and several US States. Online user reports of subjective similarity to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “Ecstasy”) prompted the current investigation of the thermoregulatory and locomotor effects of 4-MMC. Male Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats were monitored after subcutaneous administration of 4-MMC (1–10 mg/kg ) using an implantable radiotelemetry system under conditions of low (23°C) and high (27°C) ambient temperature. A reliable reduction of body temperature was produced by 4-MMC in Wistar rats at 23°C or 27°C with only minimal effect in Sprague-Dawley rats. Increased locomotor activity was observed after 4-MMC administration in both strains with significantly more activity produced in the Sprague-Dawley strain. The 10 mg/kg s.c. dose evoked greater increase in extracellular serotonin, compared with dopamine, in the nucleus accumbens. Follow-up studies confirmed that the degree of locomotor stimulation produced by 10 mg/kg 4-MMC was nearly identical to that produced by 1 mg/kg d-methamphetamine in each strain. Furthermore, hypothermia produced by the serotonin 1A/7 receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) was similar in each strain. These results show that the cathinone analog 4-MMC exhibits thermoregulatory and locomotor properties that are distinct from those established for methamphetamine or MDMA in prior work, despite recent evidence of neuropharmacological similarity with MDMA."
https://openalex.org/W2064289067,"The development of large-scale functional brain networks is a complex, lifelong process that can be investigated using resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). In this study, we aimed to decode the developmental dynamics of the whole-brain functional network in seven decades (8–79 years) of the human lifespan. We first used parametric curve fitting to examine linear and nonlinear age effect on the resting human brain, and then combined manifold learning and support vector machine methods to predict individuals' “brain ages” from rs-fcMRI data. We found that age-related changes in interregional functional connectivity exhibited spatially and temporally specific patterns. During brain development from childhood to senescence, functional connections tended to linearly increase in the emotion system and decrease in the sensorimotor system; while quadratic trajectories were observed in functional connections related to higher-order cognitive functions. The complex patterns of age effect on the whole-brain functional network could be effectively represented by a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold embedded in the functional connectivity space, which uncovered the inherent structure of brain maturation and aging. Regression of manifold coordinates with age further showed that the manifold representation extracted sufficient information from rs-fcMRI data to make prediction about individual brains' functional development levels. Our study not only gives insights into the neural substrates that underlie behavioral and cognitive changes over age, but also provides a possible way to quantitatively describe the typical and atypical developmental progression of human brain function using rs-fcMRI."
https://openalex.org/W2049694094,"Introduction The aim of this study was to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Iranian people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus using two different measures and examines which socio-demographic and diabetes-related characteristics are associated with better quality of life based on a nationally distributed sample. Methods A multi-stage cluster sampling method was used to select 3472 subjects as a part of Iranian surveillance of risk factors of non-communicable disease (ISRFNCD). EuroQol-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) were employed to measure HRQoL. Binary logistic and Tobit regression models were used to investigate factors associated with EQ-5D results. Results The mean age of subjects was 59.4 years (SD = 11.7), 61.3% were female and had 8.08 years (SD = 6.7) known duration of diabetes. The patients reported “some or extreme problems” most frequently in Pain/Discomfort (69.3%) and Anxiety/Depression (56.6%) dimensions of EQ-5D. The mean EQ-5D and VAS score were 0.70 (95% CI 0.69–0.71) and 56.8 (95% CI 56.15–57.5) respectively. Female gender, lower education, unemployment, long duration of diabetes, diabetes-related hospitalization in past years and having nephropathy and lower extremity lesions were associated with higher probabilities of reporting “some or extreme problems” in most dimensions of EQ-5D in binary logistic regression models. The same factors in addition to retinopathy were significantly associated with lower levels of HRQoL in Tobit regression analysis too. Conclusions The study findings indicate that patients with diabetes in Iran suffer from relatively poor HRQoL. Therefore much more attention should be paid to main determinants of HRQoL to identify and implement appropriate policies for achieving better management of diabetes and ultimately improving the quality of life of diabetic patients in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2069203582,"The Populus sucrose (Suc) transporter 4 (PtaSUT4), like its orthologs in other plant taxa, is tonoplast localized and thought to mediate Suc export from the vacuole into the cytosol. In source leaves of Populus, SUT4 is the predominantly expressed gene family member, with transcript levels several times higher than those of plasma membrane SUTs. A hypothesis is advanced that SUT4-mediated tonoplast sucrose fluxes contribute to the regulation of osmotic gradients between cellular compartments, with the potential to mediate both sink provisioning and drought tolerance in Populus. Here, we describe the effects of PtaSUT4-RNA interference (RNAi) on sucrose levels and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO) induction, photosynthesis, and water uptake, retention and loss during acute and chronic drought stresses. Under normal water-replete growing conditions, SUT4-RNAi plants had generally higher shoot water contents than wild-type plants. In response to soil drying during a short-term, acute drought, RNAi plants exhibited reduced rates of water uptake and delayed wilting relative to wild-type plants. SUT4-RNAi plants had larger leaf areas and lower photosynthesis rates than wild-type plants under well-watered, but not under chronic water-limiting conditions. Moreover, the magnitude of shoot water content, height growth, and photosynthesis responses to contrasting soil moisture regimes was greater in RNAi than wild-type plants. The concentrations of stress-responsive RFOs increased in wild-type plants but were unaffected in SUT4-RNAi plants under chronically dry conditions. We discuss a model in which the subcellular compartmentalization of sucrose mediated by PtaSUT4 is regulated in response to both sink demand and plant water status in Populus."
https://openalex.org/W2080119143,"Due to an altered expression of oncogenic factors and tumor suppressors, aggressive cancer cells have an intrinsic or acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. This typically contributes to cancer recurrence after chemotherapy. microRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that are involved in both cell self-renewal and cancer development. Here we report that tumor cells transfected with miR-378 acquired properties of aggressive cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-378 enhanced both cell survival and colony formation, and contributed to multiple drug resistance. Higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic drugs were needed to induce death of miR-378-transfected cells than to induce death of control cells. We found that the biologically active component isolated from Ganoderma lucidum could overcome the drug-resistance conferred by miR-378. We purified and identified the biologically active component of Ganoderma lucidum as ergosterol peroxide. We demonstrated that ergosterol peroxide produced greater activity in inducing death of miR-378 cells than the GFP cells. Lower concentrations of ergosterol peroxide were needed to induce death of the miR-378-transfected cells than in the control cells. With further clinical development, ergosterol peroxide represents a promising new reagent that can overcome the drug-resistance of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2153084403,"Background The findings of the few studies that have to date investigated the way in which individuals with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) navigate their social environment are somewhat contradictory. We undertook this study to shed new light on the social-cognitive profile of patients with AN, analysing Theory of Mind and emotional functioning. Starting from previous evidence on the role of the amygdala in the neurobiology of AN and in the social cognition, we hypothesise preserved Theory of Mind and impaired emotional functioning in patients with AN. Methodology Thirty women diagnosed with AN and thirty-two women matched for education and age were involved in the study. Theory of Mind and emotional functioning were assessed with a set of validated experimental tasks. A measure of perceived social support was also used to test the correlations between this dimension and the social-cognitive profile of AN patients. Principal Findings The performance of patients with AN is significantly worse than that of healthy controls on tasks assessing emotional functioning, whereas patients’ performance is comparable to that of healthy controls on the Theory of Mind task. Correlation analyses showed no relationship between scores on any of the social-cognition tasks and either age of onset or duration of illness. A correlation between social support and emotional functioning was found. This latter result seems to suggest a potential role of social support in the treatment and recovery of AN. Conclusions The pattern of results followed the experimental hypothesis. They may be useful to help us better understand the social-cognitive profile of patients with AN and to contribute to the development of effective interventions based on the ways in which patients with AN actually perceive their social environment."
https://openalex.org/W1971001507,"The Grainyhead family of transcription factors controls morphogenesis and differentiation of epithelial cell layers in multicellular organisms by regulating cell junction- and proliferation-related genes. Grainyhead-like 2 (Grhl2) is expressed in developing mouse lung epithelium and is required for normal lung organogenesis. The specific epithelial cells expressing Grhl2 and the genes regulated by Grhl2 in normal lungs are mostly unknown. In these studies we identified the NK2-homeobox 1 transcription factor (Nkx2-1) as a direct transcriptional target of Grhl2. By binding and transcriptional assays and by confocal microscopy we showed that these two transcription factors form a positive feedback loop in vivo and in cell lines and are co-expressed in lung bronchiolar and alveolar type II cells. The morphological changes observed in flattening lung alveolar type II cells in culture are associated with down-regulation of Grhl2 and Nkx2-1. Reduction of Grhl2 in lung epithelial cell lines results in lower expression levels of Nkx2-1 and of known Grhl2 target genes. By microarray analysis we identified that in addition to Cadherin1 and Claudin4, Grhl2 regulates other cell interaction genes such as semaphorins and their receptors, which also play a functional role in developing lung epithelium. Impaired collective cell migration observed in Grhl2 knockdown cell monolayers is associated with reduced expression of these genes and may contribute to the altered epithelial phenotype reported in Grhl2 mutant mice. Thus, Grhl2 functions at the nexus of a novel regulatory network, connecting lung epithelial cell identity, migration, and cell-cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2067770309,"The study aimed to identify endogenous lipid mediators of metabolic and inflammatory responses of human keratinocytes to solar UV irradiation. Physiologically relevant doses of solar simulated UVA+UVB were applied to human skin surface lipids (SSL) or to primary cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). The decay of photo-sensitive lipid-soluble components, alpha-tocopherol, squalene (Sq), and cholesterol in SSL was analysed and products of squalene photo-oxidation (SqPx) were quantitatively isolated from irradiated SSL. When administered directly to NHEK, low-dose solar UVA+UVB induced time-dependent inflammatory and metabolic responses. To mimic UVA+UVB action, NHEK were exposed to intact or photo-oxidised SSL, Sq or SqPx, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), and the product of tryptophan photo-oxidation 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ). FICZ activated exclusively metabolic responses characteristic for UV, i.e. the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) machinery and downstream CYP1A1/CYP1B1 gene expression, while 4-HNE slightly stimulated inflammatory UV markers IL-6, COX-2, and iNOS genes. On contrast, SqPx induced the majority of metabolic and inflammatory responses characteristic for UVA+UVB, acting via AhR, EGFR, and G-protein-coupled arachidonic acid receptor (G2A). Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that Sq could be a primary sensor of solar UV irradiation in human SSL, and products of its photo-oxidation mediate/induce metabolic and inflammatory responses of keratinocytes to UVA+UVB, which could be relevant for skin inflammation in the sun-exposed oily skin."
https://openalex.org/W2148313388,"Rilpivirine (RPV) is a second generation nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) that efficiently inhibits HIV-1 resistant to first generation NNRTIs. Virological failure during therapy with RPV and emtricitabine is associated with the appearance of E138K and M184I mutations in RT. Here we investigate the biochemical mechanism of RT inhibition and resistance to RPV. We used two transient kinetics approaches (quench-flow and stopped-flow) to determine how subunit-specific mutations in RT p66 or p51 affect association and dissociation of RPV to RT as well as their impact on binding of dNTP and DNA and the catalytic incorporation of nucleotide. We compared WT with four subunit-specific RT mutants, p66(M184I)/p51(WT), p66(E138K)/p51(E138K), p66(E138K/M184I)/p51(E138K), and p66(M184I)/p51(E138K). Ile-184 in p66 (p66(184I)) decreased the catalytic efficiency of RT (k(pol)/K(d)(.dNTP)), primarily through a decrease in dNTP binding (K(d)(.dNTP)). Lys-138 either in both subunits or in p51 alone abrogated the negative effect of p66(184I) by restoring dNTP binding. Furthermore, p51(138K) reduced RPV susceptibility by altering the ratio of RPV dissociation to RPV association, resulting in a net reduction in RPV equilibrium binding affinity (K(d)(.RPV) = k(off.RPV)/k(on.RPV)). Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics hybrid molecular modeling revealed that p51(E138K) affects access to the RPV binding site by disrupting the salt bridge between p51(E138) and p66(K101). p66(184I) caused repositioning of the Tyr-183 active site residue and decreased the efficiency of RT, whereas the addition of p51(138K) restored Tyr-183 to a WT-like conformation, thus abrogating the Ile-184-induced functional defects."
https://openalex.org/W2011397271,"Protein kinase C ε (PKCε) has emerged as an oncogenic kinase and plays important roles in cell survival, mitogenesis and invasion. PKCε is up-regulated in most epithelial cancers, including prostate, breast, and lung cancer. Here we report that PKCε is an essential mediator of NF-κB activation in prostate cancer cells. A strong correlation exists between PKCε overexpression and NF-κB activation status in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, transgenic overexpression of PKCε in the mouse prostate causes preneoplastic lesions that display significant NF-κB hyperactivation. PKCε RNAi depletion or inhibition in prostate cancer cells diminishes NF-κB translocation to the nucleus with subsequent impairment of both activation of NF-κB transcription and induction of NF-κB responsive genes in response to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). On the other hand, PKCε overexpression in normal prostate cells enhances activation of the NF-κB pathway. A mechanistic analysis revealed that TNFα activates PKCε via a C1 domain/diacylglycerol-dependent mechanism that involves phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C. Moreover, PKCε facilitates the assembly of the TNF receptor-I signaling complex to trigger NF-κB activation. Our studies identified a molecular link between PKCε and NF-κB that controls key responses implicated in prostate cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W1964174822,"The enzymes in the human de novo purine synthesis pathway were found to form a cellular complex, the purinosome, upon culturing cells in purine-depleted medium (An, S., Kumar R., Sheets, E. D., and Benkovic, S. J. (2008) Science 320, 103-106). Purinosome formation and dissociation were found to be modulated by several factors, including the microtubule network and cell signaling involving protein phosphorylation. To determine whether the pathway enzymes are in physical contact, we probed for the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the purinosome with a novel application of the Tango PPI reporter system (Barnea, G., Strapps, W., Herrada, G., Berman, Y., Ong, J., Kloss, B., Axel, R., and Lee, K. J. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 64-69). We found PPIs among all six enzymes within the pathway and evidence for a core involving the first three enzymes. We also captured purinosomes under both purine-rich and purine-depleted conditions. The results provide additional insights into the transient nature and topography of the purinosome."
https://openalex.org/W1976729214,"In this work, we assessed whether SERPINE1 expression could be under the influence of microRNAs (miRNAs) predicted to bind the SERPINE1 3′UTR region. We specifically focused on the 3′UTR region harboring a common polymorphism, rs1050955, that have been found associated to SERPINE1 monocyte expression, and investigated whether the presence of different alleles at rs1050955 could modify the miRNAs binding efficiency and affect PAI-1 protein levels. We demonstrated that, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, both miR-421 and miR-30c directly interacted with PAI-1 mRNA to inhibit the expression of the associated protein. However, these inhibitory mechanisms were independent on the allele present at the rs1050955 locus. We further showed that miR-421 levels correlated with PAI-1 activity in the plasma sample of 40 patients with venous thrombosis. Our results strongly suggest that the regulation of PAI-1 molecule could be under the influence of several miRNAs whose measurement in the plasma of patients could be envisaged as a biomarker for inflammatory and thrombotic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2162732205,"Although benthic diatoms are widely used in ecological studies of aquatic systems, there is still a dearth of data concerning species sensitivities towards several contaminants. Within the same community, different species may respond differently depending on their physiological and ecological characteristics. This lack of knowledge makes specific appropriate risk assessment impossible. To find out whether species sensitivity distribution (SSD) could be used to estimate the risk of herbicide toxicity for diatoms, we need to know whether their sensitivity depends on their physiological and ecological characteristics. We carried out single-species bioassays on 11 diatom species exposed to 8 herbicides. Dose-responses relationships were used to extrapolate the Effective Concentration 5 (EC(5)) and the Effective Concentration 50 (EC(50)) for each exposure. These data were used to fit a SSD curve for each herbicide, and to determine the Hazardous concentration 5 (HC(5)) and 50 (HC(50)). Our results revealed a high level of variability of the sensitivity in the set of species tested. For photosystem-II inhibitor (PSII) herbicides, diatoms species displayed a typical grouping of sensitivity levels consistent with their trophic mode and their ecological guild. N-heterotroph and ""motile"" guild species were more tolerant of PSII inhibitors, while N-autotroph and ""low profile"" guild species were more sensitive. Comprehensive SSD curves were obtained for 5 herbicides, but not for sulfonylurea herbicides or for dimetachlor, which had toxicity levels that were below the range of concentration tested. The SSD curves provided the following ranking of toxicity: diuron> terbutryn> isoproturon> atrazine> metolachlor. The HC that affected 5% of the species revealed that, even at the usual environmental concentrations of herbicides, diatom assemblages could be affected, especially by isoproturon, terbutryn, and diuron."
https://openalex.org/W1993612400,"Biotroph pathogens establish intimate interactions with their hosts that are conditioned by the successful secretion of effectors in infected tissues and subsequent manipulation of host physiology. The identification of early-expressed pathogen effectors and early-modulated host functions is currently a major goal to understand the molecular basis of biotrophy. Here, we report the 454-pyrosequencing transcriptome analysis of early stages of poplar leaf colonization by the rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina. Among the 841,301 reads considered for analysis, 616,879 and 649 were successfully mapped to Populus trichocarpa and M. larici-populina genome sequences, respectively. From a methodological aspect, these results indicate that this single approach is not appropriate to saturate poplar transcriptome and to follow transcript accumulation of the pathogen. We identified 19 pathogen transcripts encoding early-expressed small-secreted proteins representing candidate effectors of interest for forthcoming studies. Poplar RNA-Seq data were validated by oligoarrays and quantitatively analysed, which revealed a highly stable transcriptome with a single transcript encoding a sulfate transporter (herein named PtSultr3;5, POPTR_0006s16150) showing a dramatic increase upon colonization by either virulent or avirulent M. larici-populina strains. Perspectives connecting host sulfate transport and biotrophic lifestyle are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2150014036,"Mel-18 has been proposed as a negative regulator of Bmi-1, a cancer stem cell (CSC) marker, but it is still unclear whether Mel-18 is involved in CSC regulation. Here, we examined the effect of Mel-18 on the stemness of human breast CSCs. In Mel-18 small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-transduced MCF-7 cells, side population (SP) cells and breast CSC surface marker (CD44(+)/CD24(-)/ESA(+))-expressing cells, which imply a CSC population, were enriched. Moreover, the self-renewal of CSCs was enhanced by Mel-18 knockdown, as measured by the ability for tumorsphere formation in vitro and tumor-initiating capacity in vivo. Similarly, Mel-18 overexpression inhibited the number and self-renewal activity of breast CSCs in SK-BR-3 cells. Furthermore, our data showed that Mel-18 blockade up-regulated the expression of the Wnt/TCF target Jagged-1, a Notch ligand, and consequently activated the Notch pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Notch and Wnt pathways abrogated Mel-18 knockdown-mediated tumorsphere formation ability. Taken together, our findings suggest that Mel-18 is a novel negative regulator of breast CSCs that inhibits the stem cell population and in vitro and in vivo self-renewal through the inactivation of Wnt-mediated Notch signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2074911440,"Background Women who survive severe obstetric complications can provide insight into risk factors and potential strategies for prevention of maternal morbidity as well as maternal mortality. We interviewed 32 women, in an urban facility in Ghana, who had experienced severe morbidity defined using a standardized WHO near-miss definition and identification criteria. Women provided personal accounts of their experiences of severe maternal morbidity and perceptions of the care they received. Methods and Findings The study took place in a referral facility in urban Accra, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with women who had either a maternal near miss (n = 17) or a potentially life-threatening complication (n = 15). The most common themes surrounding the traumatic delivery were the fear of dying and concern over the potential (or actual) loss of the baby. For many women, the loss of a baby negatively influenced how they viewed and coped with this experience. Women’s perceptions of the quality of the care highlighted several key factors such as the importance of information, good communication and attitudes, and availability of human (i.e., more doctors) and physical resources (i.e., more beds, water) at the facility. Conclusions Our results suggest that experiences of women with severe maternal morbidity may inform different aspects of quality improvement in the facilities, which in turn have a positive impact on future health seeking behavior, service utilization and reduction in maternal morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2095239046,"Extracellular high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein can operate in a synergistic fashion with different signal molecules promoting an increase of cell Ca(2+) influx. However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect of HMGB1 are still unknown.Here we demonstrate that, at concentrations of agonist per se ineffective, HMGB1 potentiates the activation of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in isolated hippocampal nerve terminals and in a neuroblastoma cell line. This effect was abolished by the NMDA channel blocker MK-801. The HMGB1-facilitated NMDAR opening was followed by activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent enzymes calpain and nitric oxide synthase in neuroblastoma cells, resulting in an increased production of NO, a consequent enhanced cell motility, and onset of morphological differentiation. We have also identified NMDAR as the mediator of HMGB1-stimulated murine erythroleukemia cell differentiation, induced by hexamethylenebisacetamide. The potentiation of NMDAR activation involved a peptide of HMGB1 located in the B box at the amino acids 130-139. This HMGB1 fragment did not overlap with binding sites for other cell surface receptors of HMGB1, such as the advanced glycation end products or the Toll-like receptor 4. Moreover, in a competition assay, the HMGB1((130-139)) peptide displaced the NMDAR/HMGB1 interaction, suggesting that it comprised the molecular and functional site of HMGB1 regulating the NMDA receptor complex.We propose that the multifunctional cytokine-like molecule HMGB1 released by activated, stressed, and damaged or necrotic cells can facilitate NMDAR-mediated cell responses, both in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues, independently of other known cell surface receptors for HMGB1."

We previously identified periostin as an invasion- and angiogenesis-promoting factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study, we discovered a novel role for periostin in tumor lymphangiogenesis.Periostin overexpression upregulated VEGF-C mRNA expression in HNSCC cells. By using conditioned media from periostin-overexpressing HNSCC cells, we examined tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells. Conditioned media from periostin-overexpressing cells promoted tube formation. To know the correlation between periostin and VEGF-C, we compared Periostin expression with VEGF-C expression in 54 HNSCC cases by immunohistochemistry. Periostin expression was correlated well with VEGF-C expression in HNSCC cases. Moreover, correlation between periostin and VEGF-C secretion was observed in serum from HNSCC patients. Interestingly, periostin itself promoted tube formation of lymphatic endothelial cells independently of VEGF-C. Periostin-promoted lymphangiogenesis was mediated by Src and Akt activity. Indeed possible correlation between periostin and lymphatic status in periostin-overexpressing xenograft tumors and HNSCC cases was observed.Our findings suggest that periostin itself as well as periostin-induced upregulation of VEGF-C may promote lymphangiogenesis. We suggest that periostin may be a marker for prediction of malignant behaviors in HNSCC and a potential target for future therapeutic intervention to obstruct tumoral lymphatic invasion and lymphangiogenesis in HNSCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2056979783,"Due to its non-invasiveness, high temporal resolution and lower cost, fluorescence imaging is an interesting alternative to the current method (blue dye and radiocolloid) of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in breast cancer. Near-infrared (NIR) emitting cadmium-based Quantum Dots (QDs) could be used for this purpose; however, their wide application is limited because of the toxicity of heavy metals composing the core. Our recent work demonstrated that indium-based QDs exhibit a weak acute local toxicity in vivo compared to their cadmium-based counterparts. In the present study we confirmed the weak toxicity of CuInS2/ZnS QDs in different in vitro models. Further in vivo studies in healthy mice showed that In-based QDs could be visualised in SLN in a few minutes after administration with a progressive increase in fluorescence until 8 h. The quantity of indium was assessed in selected organs and tissues by inductively coupled plasma – mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) as a function of post-injection time. QD levels decrease rapidly at the injection point in the first hours after administration with a parallel increase in the lymph nodes and to a lesser extent in the liver and spleen. In addition, we observed that 3.5% of the injected indium dose was excreted in faeces in the first 4 days, with only trace quantities in the urine. Metastatic spread to the lymph nodes may hamper its visualisation. Therefore, we further performed non-invasive fluorescence measurement of QDs in SLN in tumour-bearing mice. Metastatic status was assessed by immunohistology and molecular techniques and revealed the utmost metastatic invasion of 36% of SLN. Fluorescence signal was the same irrespective of SLN status. Thus, near-infrared emitting cadmium-free QDs could be an excellent SLN tracer."
https://openalex.org/W2058706878,"Clinicoepidemiological data suggest that type 2 diabetes is associated with increased risk of West Nile virus encephalitis (WNVE). However, no experimental studies have elucidated the role of diabetes in WNV neuropathogenesis. Herein, we employed the db/db mouse model to understand WNV immunopathogenesis in diabetics. Nine-week old C57BL/6 WT and db/db mice were inoculated with WNV and mortality, virus burden in the periphery and brain, and antiviral defense responses were analyzed. db/db mice were highly susceptible to WNV disease, exhibited increased tissue tropism and mortality than the wild-type mice, and were unable to clear the infection. Increased and sustained WNV replication was observed in the serum, peripheral tissues and brain of db/db mice, and heightened virus replication in the periphery was correlated with enhanced neuroinvasion and replication of WNV in the brain. WNV infection in db/db mice was associated with enhanced inflammatory response and compromised antiviral immune response characterized by delayed induction of IFN-α, and significantly reduced concentrations of WNV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. The compromised immune response in db/db mice correlated with increased viremia. These data suggest that delayed immune response coupled with failure to clear the virus leads to increased mortality in db/db mice. In conclusion, this study provides unique mechanistic insight into the immunopathogenesis of WNVE observed in diabetics and can be used to develop therapeutics for the management of WNVE among diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2040198517,"Cholera is an acute diarrheal illness caused by Vibrio cholerae and occurs as widespread epidemics in Africa. In 2005, there were 31,719 cholera cases, with 458 deaths in the Republic of Senegal. We retrospectively investigated the climate origin of the devastating floods in mid-August 2005, in the Dakar Region of Senegal and the subsequent outbreak of cholera along with the pattern of cholera outbreaks in three other regions of that country. We compared rainfall patterns between 2002 and 2005 and the relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and precipitation over Senegal for 2005. Results showed a specific pattern of rainfall throughout the Dakar region during August, 2005, and the associated rainfall anomaly coincided with an exacerbation of the cholera epidemic. Comparison of rainfall and epidemiological patterns revealed that the temporal dynamics of precipitation, which was abrupt and heavy, was presumably the determining factor. Analysis of the SST gradient showed that the Atlantic Ocean SST variability in 2005 differed from that of 2002 to 2004, a result of a prominent Atlantic meridional mode. The influence of this intense precipitation on cholera transmission over a densely populated and crowded region was detectable for both Dakar and Thiès, Senegal. Thus, high resolution rainfall forecasts at subseasonal time scales should provide a way forward for an early warning system in Africa for cholera and, thereby, trigger epidemic preparedness. Clearly, attention must be paid to both natural and human induced environmental factors to devise appropriate action to prevent cholera and other waterborne disease epidemics in the region."
https://openalex.org/W1974952444,"Production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα by activated macrophages is an important component of host defense. However, TNFα production must be tightly controlled to avoid pathological consequences. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 inhibits TNFα mRNA expression through activation of the STAT3 transcription factor pathway and subsequent expression of STAT3-dependent gene products. We hypothesized that IL-10 must also have more rapid mechanisms of action and show that IL-10 rapidly shifts existing TNFα mRNA from polyribosome-associated polysomes to monosomes. This translation suppression requires the presence of SHIP1 (SH2 domain-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase 1) and involves inhibition of Mnk1 (MAPK signal-integrating kinase 1). Furthermore, activating SHIP1 using a small-molecule agonist mimics the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on Mnk1 phosphorylation and TNFα translation. Our data support the existence of an alternative STAT3-independent pathway through SHIP1 for IL-10 to regulate TNFα translation during the anti-inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1985786752,"Following amino acid deprivation, the amino acid response (AAR) induces transcription from specific genes through a collection of signaling mechanisms, including the GCN2-eIF2-ATF4 pathway. The present report documents that the histone demethylase JMJD3 is an activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-dependent target gene. The JMJD3 gene contains two AAR-induced promoter activities and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that the AAR leads to enhanced ATF4 recruitment to the C/EBP-ATF response element (CARE) upstream of Promoter-1. AAR-induced histone modifications across the JMJD3 gene locus occur upon ATF4 binding. Jmjd3 transcription is not induced in Atf4-knock-out cells, but the AAR-dependent activation was rescued by inhibition of histone deacetylation with trichostatin A (TSA). The TSA rescue of AAR activation in the absence of Atf4 also occurred for the Atf3 and C/EBP homology protein (Chop) genes, but not for the asparagine synthetase gene. ChIP analysis of the Jmjd3, Atf3, and Chop genes in Atf4 knock-out cells documented that activation of the AAR in the presence of TSA led to specific changes in acetylation of histone H4. The results suggest that a primary function of ATF4 is to recruit histone acetyltransferase activity to a sub-set of AAR target genes. Thus, absolute binding of ATF4 to these particular genes is not required and no ATF4 interaction with the general transcription machinery is necessary. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that ATF4 functions as a pioneer factor to alter chromatin structure and thus, enhance transcription in a gene-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2067992132,"Peptides that cause muscle relaxation or contraction or that modulate electrically-induced muscle contraction have been discovered in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Phylum Echinodermata; Class Holothuroidea). By analysing transcriptome sequence data, here the protein precursors of six of these myoactive peptides (the SALMFamides Sticho-MFamide-1 and -2, NGIWYamide, stichopin, GN-19 and GLRFA) have been identified, providing novel insights on neuropeptide and endocrine-type signalling systems in echinoderms. The A. japonicus SALMFamide precursor comprises eight putative neuropeptides including both L-type and F-type SALMFamides, which contrasts with previous findings from the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus where L-type and F-type SALMFamides are encoded by different genes. The NGIWYamide precursor contains five copies of NGIWYamide but, unlike other NG peptide-type neuropeptide precursors in deuterostomian invertebrates, the NGIWYamide precursor does not have a C-terminal neurophysin domain, indicating loss of this character in holothurians. NGIWYamide was originally discovered as a muscle contractant, but it also causes stiffening of mutable connective tissue in the body wall of A. japonicus, whilst holokinins (PLGYMFR and derivative peptides) cause softening of the body wall. However, the mechanisms by which these peptides affect the stiffness of body wall connective tissue are unknown. Interestingly, analysis of the A. japonicus transcriptome reveals that the only protein containing the holokinin sequence PLGYMFR is an alpha-5 type collagen. This suggests that proteolysis of collagen may generate peptides (holokinins) that affect body wall stiffness in sea cucumbers, providing a novel perspective on mechanisms of mutable connective tissue in echinoderms."
https://openalex.org/W1977844392,"Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the most widespread health problems in modern times. The gold standard for quantification of IR is the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp technique. During the test, a regulated glucose infusion is delivered intravenously to maintain a constant blood glucose concentration. Current control algorithms for regulating this glucose infusion are based on feedback control. These models require frequent sampling of blood, and can only partly capture the complexity associated with regulation of glucose. Here we present an improved clamp control algorithm which is motivated by the stochastic nature of glucose kinetics, while using the minimal need in blood samples required for evaluation of IR. A glucose pump control algorithm, based on artificial neural networks model was developed. The system was trained with a data base collected from 62 rat model experiments, using a back-propagation Levenberg-Marquardt optimization. Genetic algorithm was used to optimize network topology and learning features. The predictive value of the proposed algorithm during the temporal period of interest was significantly improved relative to a feedback control applied at an equivalent low sampling interval. Robustness to noise analysis demonstrates the applicability of the algorithm in realistic situations."
https://openalex.org/W2167200133,"Species distribution models require selection of species, study extent and spatial unit, statistical methods, variables, and assessment metrics. If absence data are not available, another important consideration is pseudoabsence generation. Different strategies for pseudoabsence generation can produce varying spatial representation of species.We considered model outcomes from four different strategies for generating pseudoabsences. We generating pseudoabsences randomly by 1) selection from the entire study extent, 2) a two-step process of selection first from the entire study extent, followed by selection for pseudoabsences from areas with predicted probability <25%, 3) selection from plots surveyed without detection of species presence, 4) a two-step process of selection first for pseudoabsences from plots surveyed without detection of species presence, followed by selection for pseudoabsences from the areas with predicted probability <25%. We used Random Forests as our statistical method and sixteen predictor variables to model tree species with at least 150 records from Forest Inventory and Analysis surveys in the Laurentian Mixed Forest province of Minnesota.Pseudoabsence generation strategy completely affected the area predicted as present for species distribution models and may be one of the most influential determinants of models. All the pseudoabsence strategies produced mean AUC values of at least 0.87. More importantly than accuracy metrics, the two-step strategies over-predicted species presence, due to too much environmental distance between the pseudoabsences and recorded presences, whereas models based on random pseudoabsences under-predicted species presence, due to too little environmental distance between the pseudoabsences and recorded presences. Models using pseudoabsences from surveyed plots produced a balance between areas with high and low predicted probabilities and the strongest relationship between density and area with predicted probabilities ≥75%. Because of imperfect accuracy assessment, the best assessment currently may be evaluation of whether the species has been sufficiently but not excessively predicted to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2056151358,"Nectins belong to a family of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like cell-adhesion molecules comprising four members, nectin-1 through nectin-4. Nectins are involved in formation of the mechanical adhesive puncta adherentia junctions of synapses. Nectins share the same overall structural topology with an extracellular region containing three Ig modules, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region. In nectin-1, the first and second Ig module in the extracellular region are necessary for the trans-interaction with nectin-3 and formation of cis-dimers, respectively. The function of the third Ig module of nectin-1 remains unknown. We here report the structure in solution of the third, membrane-proximal Ig module of mouse nectin-1 (nectin-1 Ig3) solved by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It belongs to the C1 set of the Ig superfamily. Nectin-1 Ig3 was produced as a recombinant protein and induced neurite outgrowth in primary cultures of hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons, an effect abolished by treatment with the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor SU5402, or by transfection with a dominant-negative FGFR1 construct. We showed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis that nectin-1 Ig3 directly interacted with various isoforms of FGFR. Nectin-1 Ig3 induced phosphorylation of FGFR1c in the same manner as the whole nectin-1 ectodomain, and promoted survival of cerebellar granule neurons induced to undergo apoptosis. Finally, we constructed a peptide, nectide, by employing in silico modeling of various FGFR ligand-binding sites. Nectide mimicked all the effects of nectin-1 Ig3. We suggest that FGFR is a downstream signaling partner of nectin-1."

However, their roles in hypothalamus, and the specific functions of their different receptors, have not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the expression and function of the activin receptor ALK7 in the female reproductive axis using Alk7-knockout mice. ALK7 was found in subsets of SF1-expressing granulosa cells in the ovary, FSH gonadotrophs in the pituitary, and NPY-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Alk7-knockout females showed delayed onset of puberty and abnormal estrous cyclicity, had abnormal diestrous levels of FSH and LH in serum, and their ovaries showed premature depletion of follicles, oocyte degeneration, and impaired responses to exogenous gonadotropins. In the arcuate nucleus, mutant mice showed reduced expression of Npy mRNA and lower numbers of Npy-expressing neurons than wild-type controls. Alk7 knockouts showed a selective loss of arcuate NPY/AgRP innervation in the medial preoptic area, a key central regulator of reproduction. These results indicate that ALK7 is an important regulator of female reproductive function and reveal a new role for activin signaling in the control of hypothalamic gene expression and wiring. Alk7 gene variants may contribute to female reproductive disorders in humans, such as polycystic ovary syndrome.—Sandoval-Guzmán, T., Göngrich, C., Moliner, A., Guo, T., Wu, H., Broberger, C., Ibáñez, C.

https://openalex.org/W1998644557,"Somatic cell reprogramming is achieved by four reprogramming transcription factors (RTFs), Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. However, in addition to the induction of pluripotent cells, these RTFs also generate pseudo-pluripotent cells, which do not show Nanog promoter activity. Therefore, it should be possible to fine-tune the RTFs to produce only fully pluripotent cells. For this study, a tagging system was developed to sort induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells according to the expression levels of each of the four RTFs. Using this system, the most effective ratio (Oct3/4-high, Sox2-low, Klf4-high, c-Myc-high) of the RTFs was 88 times more efficient at producing iPS cells than the worst effective ratio (Oct3/4-low, Sox2-high, Klf4-low, c-Myc-low). Among the various RTF combinations, Oct3/4-high and Sox2-low produced the most efficient results. To investigate the molecular basis, microarray analysis was performed on iPS cells generated under high (Oct3/4-high and Sox2-low) and low (Oct3/4-low and Sox2-high) efficiency reprogramming conditions.

The technology, using transplanted iPS cells, has been used successfully in mouse and rat models of sickle cell anemia and Parkinson disease (3Hanna J. Wernig M. Markoulaki S. Sun C.W. Meissner A.

For example, although iPS cells can differentiate into any cell type in the body, it is necessary to exclude any undifferentiated cells before iPS cell-derived cells are transplanted, as the presence of undifferentiated cells may lead to tumor formation (5Miura K.

To use iPS cells in clinical applications, it is important to understand the mechanism that induces pluripotency. It is clear that the process of iPS cell generation involves certain steps (6Stadtfeld M. Maherali N. Breault D.T. Hochedlinger K. Defining molecular cornerstones during fibroblast to iPS cell reprogramming in mouse.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 230-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). These can be broadly summarized as follows. Upon introduction of the four RTFs, fibroblasts down-regulate THY-1 expression; next, the genes used as markers for pluripotency are activated, including alkaline phosphatase and stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1); finally, the retroviruses used for RTF introduction are silenced, whereas endogenous gene expression of pluripotency-associated molecules, such as Oct3/4 and Nanog, are activated. At this time, reactivation of an X chromosome is also seen. On the other hand, the more detailed mechanisms underlying the induction of pluripotency are largely unknown. There are some clues, such as the involvement of cell-cell contact during the generation of iPS cells, observed during time-lapse analysis, and it is also suggested that a certain probabilistic action has been influenced during iPS cell generation (6Stadtfeld M.

In addition, although it is clear that the demethylation of DNA and changes in histone modifications occur in the regulatory regions of pluripotency-associated genes, such as Oct3/4 and Nanog, it is not known when these events take place (8Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Generation of germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported recently that the four RTFs mediated the induction of other cell types, in addition to iPS cells, including epiblast stem cells and cardiomyocytes (9Han D.W. Greber B. Wu G. Tapia N. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Ko K. Bernemann C. Stehling M. Schöler H.R. Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into epiblast stem cells.Nat.

Therefore, understanding the mechanism initiated in response to the introduction of the four RTFs is important, not only for the efficient induction of iPS cells but also for controlling other cell fates. In this study, we focused on the ratio of the four RTFs. To analyze the different ratios for each factor, tagged vectors were generated and used to sort the transfected RTFs on the basis of their expression levels by FACS analysis. Using this sorting method, the efficiency of iPS cell generation was compared with the expression level of each of the four RTFs, and the optimal ratio of the four factors was identified as follows: Oct3/4-high, Sox2-low, Klf4-high, and c-Myc-high. Under these conditions, iPS cell generation efficiency was 88 times greater than the worst effective ratio (Oct3/4-low, Sox2-high, Klf4-low, and c-Myc-low). Finally, the molecular signature for sorting the high efficiency reprogramming conditions from low efficiency conditions was identified by comparing the gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) at 2 days after the RTFs infection.

After washing, the cells were incubated with an anti-FcγR antibody (2.4G2) (eBioscience) at 4 °C for 30 min, and then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat CD2 monoclonal antibody (OX-34; BioLegend), a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD271 monoclonal antibody (C40–1457; BD Biosciences), and an allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-human CD8 monoclonal antibody (RPA-T8; BioLegend) for 30 min at 4 °C. For the four factor reprogramming, a phycoerythrin-Cy7-conjugated anti-human CD25 monoclonal antibody (M-A251) was also added. After washing, samples were sorted using a FACSVantage SE cytometer (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were cultured on STO cells at a density of 30,000 cells (without c-Myc) or 4,000 cells (with c-Myc) per well in six-well plates. The numbers of Nanog-GFP positive (Nanog-GFP+) colonies were counted on days 17 or 21. Data are presented as the each dot. The median numbers are also presented as a bar. Statistical significance for difference of the medians was determined by exact Wilcoxon test using the R exactRankTests package. MEFs carrying the four introduced reprogramming factors were reseeded on STO feeders 4 days after infection at a density of 4,500 cells/well in six-well plates. At that time, 100 ng/ml of each chemokine was added every 2 days to the culture until day 17. The medium was changed every second day. On day 7 after infection puromycin was added to the culture. Colony numbers were counted at day 23. The Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare differences in distribution for the number of positive colonies under the different reprogramming conditions. Expression profiles of MEFs at 2 days after the RTF infection were analyzed using the whole mouse genome 44K3D-Gene Mouse Oligo chip 24K (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Fluorescence intensities were detected using the Scan-Array Life Scanner (PerkinElmer Life Science) and photomultiplier tube levels were adjusted to achieve 0.1–0.5% pixel saturation. Each TIFF image was analyzed with GenePix Pro software version 6.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The data were filtered to remove low-confidence measurements and normalized globally per array such that the median signal intensity was set at 50. All 43,379 probes were collapsed into 21,609 genes with Entrez gene identifier (ID) by taking the maximum intensity among probe sets corresponding to the same gene ID. The standard Student's t test was performed for each comparison and the false discovery rate was estimated using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to obtain differentially expressed genes as a signature. In this study, a false discovery rate <5% was used as a threshold. To characterize the molecular backgrounds of the signature genes, enrichment analysis for canonical pathways and Gene Ontology biological processes (c2-cp and c5-bp gene sets in MSigDB version 3.0 (16Subramanian A.

Somatic cell reprogramming is brought about by the four RTFs, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Initially, these transcription factors were introduced into somatic cells by retroviral vectors; however, because these viral vectors are usually, but not always completely, inactivated toward the end of the reprogramming process, silencing of the retrovirus promoter was recognized as one of the reprogramming criteria (8Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S. Generation of germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar). For the current study, the four RTFs were introduced into MEFs carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the Nanog promoter. To monitor silencing, a DsRed vector was also introduced. After induction of the four RTFs, Nanog-GFP+ and DsRed negative (DsRed−) iPS candidate cells were observed (Fig. 1a), as well as Nanog-GFP− and DsRed+ pseudo-pluripotent iPS cells (Fig. 1b). These data indicated that the RTFs did not achieve pluripotency in all somatic cells. Moreover, occasionally non-iPS cells with specific features were also seen after induction of the four RTFs; for example, Fig. 1 shows spontaneously beating cardiomyocyte-like cells generated from adult tail-tip fibroblasts (Fig. 1, e and f, and supplemental Movies S1 and S2). In addition, morphologically rounded, blood-like cells were also observed (Fig. 1, g and h). When these blood-like cells were collected by pipetting and stained for cell surface markers, they were found to be positive for the pan-hematopoietic marker, CD45 (Fig. 1i). Analysis of lineage markers revealed that these blood-like cells contained macrophages (Mac-1), granulocytes (Gr-1), and erythroid cells (Ter119) (Fig. 1i). However, B (B220) and T (CD3) lymphoid cells were not detected (Fig. 1i). The so-called “transdifferentiation” of these two lineages by the factors used in somatic cell reprogramming has also been reported by other groups (10Efe J.A. Hilcove S. Kim J. Zhou H. Ouyang K. Wang G. Chen J. Ding S. Conversion of mouse fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes using a direct reprogramming strategy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 18Szabo E. Rampalli S. Risueño R.M. Schnerch A. Mitchell R. Fiebig-Comyn A. Levadoux-Martin M. Bhatia M. Direct conversion of human fibroblasts to multilineage blood progenitors.Nature. 2010; 468: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). These data indicated that the four RTFs do not only induce the pluripotent state but are also capable of producing terminally differentiated cells. Because the reprogramming factors can also induce other cell types as well as pluripotent cells, it should be possible to fine-tune the RTFs to produce only fully pluripotent cells. Therefore, we speculated that there would be an optimal ratio of the four RTFs for efficient pluripotent cell generation. To investigate the importance of the relative expression levels of each of the RTFs in somatic cell reprogramming, Sox2, Klf4, and Oct3/4 were tagged with different rat and human cell surface antigens using a 2A sequence (Fig. 2a). After infection of MEFs with each of these constructs, flow cytometry with specific antibodies was used to sort the cells according to the expression levels of the exogenous genes (Fig. 2b). Using this strategy, the MEFs were grouped based on the ratios of the three factors, and Nanog-GFP+ colonies were counted on day 17 after infection. The effects of the expression of each of the three factors are shown in Fig. 2c, and the results indicated that the greatest numbers of Nanog-GFP+ colonies were obtained with high levels of Oct3/4. The most effective ratio of the three factors (Oct3/4-high, Sox2-low, and Klf4-high) was seven times more efficient than for the worst effective ratio (Oct3/4-low, Sox2-high, and Klf4-low). In addition to these three RTFs, the effect of c-Myc was also analyzed. A human CD25-tagged c-Myc vector was generated and used to monitor the relative expression of all four RTFs (supplemental Fig. S1). The expression levels of each of the factors were confirmed by RT-PCR (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). The results are shown in Fig. 3. The addition of c-Myc did not affect the ratios of the other three factors. High expression of Oct3/4, Klf4, and c-Myc favored the induction of pluripotency, whereas low expression of Sox2 was better for reprogramming. Similar to induction with three RTFs, the most effective ratio of the four factors (Oct3/4-high, Sox2-low, Klf4-high, and c-Myc-high) was 50 times more efficient than for the worst effective ratio (Oct3/4-low, Sox2-high, Klf4-low, and c-Myc-high). Regardless of the efficiency, generated iPS cells showed similar gene expression patterns to ES cells and have a potential to differentiate to all three germ layers (supplemental Figs. S4 and S5). We searched for the most effective combination of the four RTFs using the relationship between Nanog-GFP+ colony numbers and the reprogramming factor ratio. Among the four factors, the Oct3/4 and Sox2 expression ratios correlated significantly with positive colony numbers. In cells with high levels of Oct3/4 and low levels of Sox2, ∼16.2 times greater numbers of positive colonies were found when all four factors were introduced (supplemental Fig. S6a). A similar result was also found when only three factors were used (supplemental Fig. S6b) even if the statistically dominant factor was only Oct3/4. To determine the molecular basis underlying these ratios and indeed, somatic cell reprogramming, microarray analysis was performed using the high (Oct3/4-high and Sox2-low) and the low (Oct3/4-low and Sox2-high) reprogramming conditions. The signature genes were identified using bioinformatics calculations (Fig. 4a). First, the signature genes in MEFs at 2 days after the RTF infections were compared with those of the parental MEFs and with pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. When compared with MEFs, ∼1,000 genes were up-regulated and 4,000 genes were down-regulated under both high and low efficiency conditions. Whereas about half the up-regulated genes were common to both the high and low reprogramming conditions, more than 80% of the down-regulated genes were common to both (Fig. 4b and supplemental Table S1). On the other hand, when compared with ES cells, more than 70% of the up-regulated genes and 80% of the down-regulated genes were common to both cell types under both sets of conditions (Fig. 4c and supplemental Table S2). These data indicated that the expression of many signature genes in MEFs at 2 days after the RTFs infection was altered under both high (Oct3/4-high and Sox2-low) and low (Oct3/4-low and Sox2-high) reprogramming conditions when compared with MEF and ES cells. To determine the difference between the high (Oct3/4-high and Sox2-low) and low (Oct3/4-low and Sox2-high) efficiency conditions, the microarray data for these two conditions were compared. GO analysis showed that under the high efficiency condition, positive regulation of MAP kinase activity was down-regulated (supplemental Fig. S7) in iPS cells, which is significant because it is known that inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway is important for pluripotency (19Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pathway analysis of the microarray data revealed that certain pathways were up-regulated preferentially under the high condition, compared with the low condition (Fig. 5). Under the high efficiency condition, we focused on enrichment of the GPCR pathways, and in particular, the chemokine members of the GPCR superfamily. To analyze the involvement of chemokines during somatic cell reprogramming, the effect of several chemokines on the generation of iPS cells was examined. Of these, the addition of CCL2 achieved a 12.3 times greater reprogramming efficiency than in untreated cells (Fig. 6a). These results suggested that the microarray data contained clues for the optimization of pluripotency induction.FIGURE 6The effect of chemokines and epigenetic modifiers on somatic cell reprogramming. a, MEFs were infected with the four RTFs and the chemokines indicated were added from days 4 to 17 of the culture. The numbers of Nanog-GFP+ colonies on day 23 of culture are indicated. b and c, MEFs were infected with the epigenetic factors indicated, together with four (b) or three (c) of the RTFs. The numbers of Nanog-GFP+ colonies at 17 days after infection are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the mechanism further, transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers were analyzed as these factors direct cell fate and alter the regulation of multiple genes. Although under the low efficiency condition only nine TFs were up-regulated, 60 TFs were up-regulated under the high efficiency condition (supplemental Fig. S8a and Table 1). Furthermore, when the epigenetic modifiers were investigated, only one gene was up-regulated under the low efficiency condition and four under the high condition (supplemental Fig. S8b and Table 2). These data indicated that more transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers appear to be up-regulated under the high condition.TABLE 1Transcription factors up-regulated under high and low efficiency conditionsSymbolDescriptionHigh efficiency conditionPOU5F1POU class 5 homeobox 1HOXC4Homeobox C4IRX4Iroquois homeobox 4NEUROG1Neurogenin 1BARHL1BarH-like homeobox 1FOXN1Forkhead box N1KLF17Kruppel-like factor 17NR5A1Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 1ZNF43Zinc finger protein 43POU4F1POU class 4 homeobox 1RFX4Regulatory factor X, 4 (influences HLA class II expression)ESRRGEstrogen-related receptor gammaFOXH1Forkhead box H1SOX15SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 15LHX1LIM homeobox 1TOPORSTopoisomerase I binding, arginine/serine-richHNF4AHepatocyte nuclear factor 4, αNKX61NK6 homeobox 1PROP1PROP paired-like homeobox 1CAMTA1Calmodulin binding transcription activator 1ARID5BAT-rich interactive domain 5B (MRF1-like)SOX17SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 17FOXQ1forkhead box Q1MAFv-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (avian)TCF2HNF1 homeobox BFEVFEV (ETS oncogene family)HES2Hairy and enhancer of split 2 (Drosophila)PITX3Paired-like homeodomain 3HOXA3Homeobox A3HNF4GHepatocyte nuclear factor 4, γTCF7L2Transcription factor 7-like2 (T-cell specific, HMG-box)TP73Tumor protein p73NR3C2Nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 2HSF1Heat shock transcription factor 1GLI1GLI family zinc finger 1SOX1SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 1ZNF124Zinc finger protein 124CDK2Cyclin-dependent kinase 2FOXE3Forkhead box E3RBPJRecombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin κJ regionCREBBPCREB-binding proteinHOXB9Homeobox B9FOXL2Forkhead box L2FOXF2Forkhead box F2NCXT-cell leukemia homeobox 2TFDP2Transcription factor Dp-2 (E2F dimerization partner 2)ATBF1Zinc finger homeobox 3NR1I3Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group I, member 3SOX12SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 12LMO3LIM domain only3 (rhombotin-like 2)ABL1c-abl oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinaseGTF2IRD1GTF2I repeat domain containing 1IRF1Interferon regulatory factor 1NFIANuclear factor I/ASS18L1Synovial sarcoma translocation gene on chromosome 18-like 1NFATC2Nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 2STAT5BSignal transducer and activator of transcription 5BFOXO4Forkhead box O4HOXB6Homeobox B6RUNX2Runt-related transcription factor 2Low efficiency conditionID3Inhibitor of DNA binding 3, dominant negative helix-loop-helix proteinXPAXeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group ALEF1Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1KLF2Kruppel-like factor 2 (lung)HEY1Hairy/enhancer of split related with YRPW motif 1PRDM1PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domainELOF1Elongation factor 1 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)SREBF1Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1TBX2T-box 2 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Epigenetic modifiers upregulated under high and low efficiency conditionsSymbolDescriptionHigh efficiency conditionSETDB2SET domain, bifurcated 2WHSC1L1Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1-like 1CREBBPCREB-binding proteinSMYD3SET and MYND domain containing"
https://openalex.org/W2059594529,"Background Nonnative Phragmites australis (common reed) is one of the most intensively researched and managed invasive plant species in the United States, yet as with many invasive species, our ability to predict, control or understand the consequences of invasions is limited. Rapid spread of dense Phragmites monocultures has prompted efforts to limit its expansion and remove existing stands. Motivation for large-scale Phragmites eradication programs includes purported negative impacts on native wildlife, a view based primarily on observational results. We took an experimental approach to test this assumption, estimating the effects of nonnative Phragmites australis on a native amphibian. Methodology/Principal Findings Concurrent common garden and reciprocal transplant field experiments revealed consistently strong positive influences of Phragmites on Rana catesbeiana (North American bullfrog) larval performance. Decomposing Phragmites litter appears to contribute to the effect. Conclusions/Significance Positive effects of Phragmites merit further research, particularly in regions where both Phragmites and R. catesbeiana are invasive. More broadly, the findings of this study reinforce the importance of experimental evaluations of the effects of biological invasion to make informed conservation and restoration decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2033690461,"In the human body, arsenic is metabolized by methylation. Understanding this process is important and provides insight into the relationship between arsenic and its related diseases. We used the rapid equilibrium kinetic model to study the reaction sequence of arsenite methylation. The results suggest that the mechanism for arsenite methylation is a completely ordered mechanism that is also of general interest in reaction systems with different reductants, such as tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, cysteine, and glutathione. In the reaction, cysteine residues of recombinant human arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (hAS3MT) coordinate with arsenicals and involve the methyl transfer step. S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) is the first-order reactant, which modulates the conformation of hAS3MT to a best matched state by hydrophobic interaction. As the second-order reactant, reductant reduces the disulfide bond, most likely between Cys-250 and another cysteine residue of hAS3MT, and exposes the active site cysteine residues for binding trivalent inorganic arsenic (iAs(3+)) to give monomethylarsonic dicysteine (MADC(3+)). In addition, the reaction can be extended to further methylate MADC(3+) to dimethylarsinic cysteine (DAMC(3+)). In the methylation reaction, the β-pleated sheet content of hAS3MT is increased, and the hydrophobicity of the microenvironment around the active sites is decreased. Similarly, we confirm that both the high β-pleated sheet content of hAS3MT and the high dissociation ability of the enzyme-AdoMet-reductant improve the yield of dimethylated arsenicals."

Here, we demonstrate that a senescence-associated gene is a direct target of E2F1 and is also repressed by heterochromatin in senescent cells. In contrast, ARF and p27KIP1, which are also E2F1 targets, are not repressed by Rb and heterochromatin formation.

Cellular senescence causes irreversible exit from the cell cycle and functions as a general protective mechanism against proliferative stress responses and cancer in vivo (1Prieur A. Peeper D.S.

Senescence-associated growth arrest mainly occurs through the stable down-regulation of cell cycle regulatory and DNA replication genes, such as CDC2, cyclin A2 (CCNA2), PCNA, 2The abbreviations used are: PCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRbretinoblastomaCSIGcellular senescence-inhibited geneSAHFsenescence-associated heterochromatin focishshort hairpin. and MCM3, many of which are E2F1 targets. Based on the current understanding of the field, the members of the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene family, including pRb, p107, and pRb2/p130, negatively regulate the activities of the E2F family of proteins (4Burkhart D.L. Sage J. Cellular mechanisms of tumour suppression by the retinoblastoma gene.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). When cells undergo senescence, Rb mediates the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) by recruiting other heterochromatin proteins, such as HP1γ, to E2F1-responsive promoters, which then stably repress these E2F1 targets (5Narita M. Nnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W.

Importantly, this mechanism may be the reason why growth factors cannot induce E2F1 targets during cellular senescence (6Dimri G.P. Hara E. Campisi J.

In fact, overexpression of E2F1 may induce a senescence response through the activation of ARF (9Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Regulation of a senescence checkpoint response by the E2F1 transcription factor and p14(ARF) tumor suppressor.Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In addition, one of the most important cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p27KIP1, was reported to accumulate in senescent cells (10Haddad M.M. Xu W. Schwahn D.J. Liao F. Medrano E.E. Activation of a cAMP pathway and induction of melanogenesis correlate with association of p16(INK4) and p27(KIP1) to CDKs, loss of E2F-binding activity, and premature senescence of human melanocytes.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which some E2F1 targets, such as PCNA and CCNA2, are transcriptionally repressed by SAHF, whereas others are not, such as ARF and p27KIP1, is important for understanding how E2F1 targets are transcriptionally regulated during cellular senescence. In our previous study, we identified a new senescence-associated gene called cellular senescence-inhibited gene (CSIG; RSL1D1) (11Guo S. Zhang Z. Tong T. Cloning and characterization of cellular senescence-associated genes in human fibroblasts by suppression subtractive hybridization.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CSIG is abundantly expressed in growing human diploid fibroblast cells, but its expression decreases upon replicative senescence. Overexpression of CSIG significantly prolonged the progression of replicative senescence by down-regulating PTEN and p27KIP1 (12Ma L. Chang N. Guo S. Li Q. Zhang Z. Wang W. Tong T. CSIG inhibits PTEN translation in replicative senescence.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 6290-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CSIG was also reported to facilitate nucleostemin transport between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm (13Tsai R.Y. McKay R.D. A multistep, GTP-driven mechanism controlling the dynamic cycling of nucleostemin.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to explore the mechanism by which CSIG is down-regulated in senescent human cells to further characterize its function and understand the regulatory mechanisms of other senescence-associated genes. In this study, we demonstrate that CSIG is a direct target of E2F1. The transcriptional profiles of CSIG, PCNA, CCNA2, ARF, and p27KIP1 are distinct during senescence. CSIG, PCNA, and CCNA2 are repressed by Rb-mediated heterochromatin, but ARF and p27KIP1 are not repressed. A comparison of the promoter sequences demonstrated the existence of a novel TAAC element in the CSIG, PCNA, and CCNA2 promoters, which was absent in the ARF and p27KIP1 promoters. Rb associates with these proteins through the TAAC element, and it is required for Rb recruitment. We further determined that the association of the TAAC element with Rb is E2F binding site-dependent, but E2F1 protein-independent. These results provide a novel molecular explanation for the different expression patterns of E2F1 targets and afford new mechanistic insight regarding the selectivity of Rb-mediated heterochromatin formation and gene repression during cellular senescence.

The infected population was selected with 0.8 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 2–3 days, 25 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche) for 2–3 days, or 150 μg/ml G418 for 5 days. For coinfection, the cells were sequentially selected with puromycin, hygromycin, and G418. Post-selection day 7 refers to 7 days after the puromycin selection. The wild-type and TAAC-mutated CSIG promoter constructs in Fig. 5 (C and D) were integrated into U2OS cells using a retroviral system (pWZL). Integrated cell populations were selected with hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science) for 10 days. 2BS cells were plated on coverslips and subsequently labeled with BrdU (100 μg/ml, Sigma) for 6 h. Nuclei incorporating BrdU were visualized by immunolabeling using an anti-BrdU antibody (Pharmingen, 1:400) as previously described (18Humbert P.O. Verona R. Trimarchi J.M. Rogers C. Dandapani S.

DNA was visualized by DAPI (1 μg/ml) after permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The EMSAs in Fig. 1J were performed using a human GST-E2F1 fusion protein that was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 transfected with pGEX-4T-E2F1. The EMSA probes were generated by end-labeling 30-bp duplexes using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed by mixing 5 μg of purified recombinant GST-E2F1 fusion protein, 2 μl of 5× binding buffer, 2.5 μg/μl BSA, and 4,000 cpm/μl probes. The competition experiments included a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. The binding mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6.5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at room temperature. The EMSAs in Fig. 5A were 3′-biotinylated using the biotin 3′-end DNA labeling kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were annealed for 2 h at room temperature. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are 5′-ATAACCGGTACCCGCCCCCT-3′ for the TAAC oligonucleotides and 5′-ATGACCGGTACCCGCCCCCT-3′ for the TAAC mutant oligonucleotides. The binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol in 1× binding buffer (LightShiftTM chemiluminescent EMSA kit; Pierce) using 20 fmol of biotin end-labeled target DNA and 4 μg of nuclear extract from senescent 2BS cells. Unlabeled target DNA (4 pmol), anti-Rb (2 μl; Cell Signaling), or anti-p16 (2 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added per 20 μl of binding reaction where indicated. The assays were loaded onto native 6% polyacrylamide gels that had been pre-electrophoresed for 60 min in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. Samples were electrophoresed at 100 V before being transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (HybondTM-N+) in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 100 V for 30 min. Transferred DNA was cross-linked to the membrane at 120 mJ/cm2 and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (LightShiftTM chemiluminescent EMSA kit) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

DNA released from the precipitated complexes was amplified by PCR using sequence-specific primers. The primer sets that were used amplified the promoter regions of CSIG, CCNA2, PCNA, ARF, p27KIP1, and β-actin.

Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer 5 (sequences are available from the authors upon request). Real time PCR was performed in triplicate using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). The β-actin gene served as an endogenous control for normalization. The cells were plated in 24-well culture plates in triplicate for each condition at an initial concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well. The cells were cotransfected with 0.8 μg of the gene promoter reporter constructs (or 0.2 μg of reporter construct and 0.6 μg of protein overexpression plasmid or shRNA) and 8 ng (or 2 ng, respectively) of the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-CMV vector, which served as an internal control. Luciferase activity was assessed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The enzyme activity was normalized for the efficiency of transfection on the basis of Renilla luciferase activity levels and is reported as relative light units. All of the reporter assays were performed in triplicate in at least two individual experiments, and standard errors are denoted by bars in the figures. As previously reported, CSIG mRNA is significantly decreased in senescent cells compared with actively growing cells (11Guo S. Zhang Z. Tong T. Cloning and characterization of cellular senescence-associated genes in human fibroblasts by suppression subtractive hybridization.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 298: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which suggests that CSIG may be transcriptionally repressed during cellular senescence. To test this hypothesis, we first constructed a series of plasmids in which various lengths of the CSIG promoter (−1100, −838, −482, −188, and −84 bp upstream from the ATG start codon of the CSIG promoter) were placed upstream of the pGL3-basic vector. The activity of the firefly reporter remained high in all cases except when the region between −188 and −84 bp was excised (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that the major transcriptional regulatory elements of CSIG are located in the region between −188 and −84 bp from the ATG start codon. Analysis of the sequence from −188 to −84 bp revealed a putative E2F1 binding site from −102 to −95 bp (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the activity of the CSIG promoter-luciferase reporter containing the wild-type E2F1 binding site was almost 5-fold higher than the E2F1 binding site mutant (−188m) (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, when we introduced E2F1 siRNA oligonucleotides and the CSIG promoter luciferase reporter into HeLa cells, the activities of the different fragments of the CSIG promoter (−1100, −838, −482, and −188 bp) were down-regulated. However, this decrease did not occur with the promoter reporters in which the E2F1 binding site was mutated (−188m) or deleted (−84 bp) (Fig. 1C). These experiments suggest that the CSIG luciferase reporter is induced by E2F1. We next assessed whether E2F1 could also stimulate endogenous CSIG expression by using a 2BS cell line stably expressing retroviral E2F1 expression plasmids. CSIG was up-regulated when E2F1 was overexpressed, as were other E2F1 targets, including PCNA and CCNA2 (Fig. 1D). This result was confirmed by the activation of a 2BS cell line stably expressing the E2F1-ER fusion construct upon the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore, CSIG was down-regulated after the knockdown of E2F1 (Fig. 1, G and H). These results suggest that E2F1 stimulates endogenous CSIG expression. We next sought to determine whether E2F1 binds to the CSIG promoter in vivo and in vitro by using ChIP and EMSAs (Fig. 1, I and J). The results of the ChIP assays suggested that E2F1 binds to the endogenous CSIG promoter in growing cells but not senescent cells in vivo. Using an EMSA, we found a high affinity E2F1 binding site located −102 bp upstream of the ATG codon. Importantly, a point mutation of this binding site blocked E2F1 binding (Fig. 1J). These results demonstrate that E2F1 can bind to the CSIG promoter in vivo and in vitro at the E2F1 binding site. Because E2F1 is a well known transcription factor, we sought to characterize the expression patterns of E2F1 targets during cellular senescence by examining CSIG, PCNA, CCNA2, ARF, and p27KIP1 in growing, quiescent, and Ras-induced senescent 2BS cells. We found that the protein levels of CSIG, PCNA, and CCNA2, but not ARF or p27KIP1, decreased in Ras-induced senescent cells relative to growing cells (Fig. 2A). The same result was confirmed in two other fibroblast cell lines, WI38 and IMR90 (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the same trend in the protein levels of E2F1 targets was observed in replicative senescent 2BS cells and etoposide-induced 2BS senescent cells with DNA damage (Fig. 2C). In addition, the mRNA levels of CSIG, PCNA, and CCNA2, but not those of ARF and p27KIP1, decreased in senescent cells (Fig. 2D). To further determine the transcriptional activities of these genes, we cotransfected p16INK4 constructs together with CSIG, PCNA, CCNA2, ARF, or p27KIP1 promoter-luciferase reporters into U2OS cells, in which the responsiveness to p16INK4 overexpression is quite similar to that of senescent fibroblast cells (20Dahiya A. Wong S. Gonzalo S. Gavin M. Dean D.C. Linking the Rb and polycomb pathways.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 557-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In fact, p16INK4 overexpression-induced cellular senescence has been widely reported (5Narita M. Nnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W.

Senescence of human fibroblasts induced by oncogenic Raf.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The p16INK4 protein accumulates in senescent cells and engages the Rb/E2F1 pathway by inhibiting cyclin D-dependent kinases. As shown in Fig. 2E, when p16 was overexpressed in U2OS cells, the activities of the CSIG, PCNA, and CCNA2 promoters were down-regulated. In contrast, the activities of the ARF and p27KIP1 promoters were not affected by p16 overexpression. These data indicate that the transcriptional programs that regulate CSIG, PCNA, CCNA2, ARF, and p27KIP1 are different during cellular senescence. One central question that remains to be elucidated is why E2F1 target genes are differentially transcribed during cellular senescence. Because it is known that SAHF are involved in the stable repression of several E2F1 targets, including PCNA, CCNA2, and MCM3 (5Narita M. Nnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Rb-mediated heterochromatin formation and silencing of E2F target genes during cellular senescence.Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar), we next sought to determine whether the chromatin remodeling was different at the CSIG, ARF, and p27KIP1 promoters. We examined the association of the histone H3 trimethylated lysine 9 (H3K9Me3) and HP1γ with the promoters of CSIG, ARF, and p27KIP1 using a ChIP assay (Fig. 3A). As expected, the quantities of both H3K9Me3 and HP1γ bound to the CSIG promoter were higher in senescent cells compared with growing 2BS cells, which was consistent with the PCNA and CCNA2 data. In contrast, H3K9Me3 and HP1γ did not accumulate at the ARF and p27KIP1 promoters during cellular senescence. Furthermore, when we knocked down high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), one of the essential structural components of SAHF, using shRNA in 2BS cells transfected with Ras, SAHF accumulation was almost completely prevented (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with previous reports. Similarly, knockdown of HMGA1 activated CSIG, but did not up-regulate ARF and p27KIP1 (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrate that heterochromatin formation is responsible for the stable repression of CSIG, but not ARF and p27KIP1 in senescent cells. It has been reported that Rb is required for SAHF formation at the promoters of E2F1 targets, such as PCNA and CCNA2 (5Narita M. Nnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Rb-mediated heterochromatin formation and silencing of E2F target genes during cellular senescence.Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Rb is responsible for the differential chromatin remodeling between CSIG, ARF, and p27KIP1 by examining the association of Rb with the promoters of these genes using a ChIP assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, Rb was absent from these gene promoters in growing 2BS cells. In contrast, Rb was detected only on the CSIG promoter and not on the ARF and p27KIP1 promoters in senescent cells. To further investigate the role of Rb, we utilized 2BS cells infected with retroviral shRNA against Rb, p107, or p130. shRNA targeting of Rb, but not p107 or p130, reduced SAHF formation and induced CSIG in Ras-induced senescent cells. However, shRb did not induce the up-regulation of ARF or p27KIP1 expression (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, considering that E1A can block Rb function (5Narita M. Nnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Rb-mediated heterochromatin formation and silencing of E2F target genes during cellular senescence.Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of E1A on the expression of CSIG/PCNA/CCNA2/ARF/p27KIP1 in response to Ras (Fig. 4, D and E). As expected, full-length E1A abrogated Ras-induced SAHF formation and up-regulated CSIG, but not ARF or p27KIP1. To verify that these effects are derived from E1A countering Rb, we chose E1A-ΔN, which cannot bind to p300 and p400 but still possesses the binding domain that interacts with the Rb LXCXE motif (5Narita M. Nnez S. Heard E. Narita M. Lin A.W. Hearn S.A. Spector D.L. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Rb-mediated heterochromatin formation and silencing of E2F target genes during cellular senescence.Cell. 2003; 113: 703-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). In this setting, although E1A-ΔN was not as effective as its full-length in preventing cell cycle arrest (Fig. 4E), it can still prevent SAHF formation and repression of E2F1 targets (Fig. 4, D and E). These data demonstrate that the selectivity of Rb binding is responsible for the differential chromatin remodeling of the promoters for these genes during cellular senescence. Our data showed that Rb is responsible for the differential expression of the E2F1 targets ex"
https://openalex.org/W2062464832,"Neuromusculoskeletal models are a common method to estimate muscle forces. Developing accurate neuromusculoskeletal models is a challenging task due to the complexity of the system and large inter-subject variability. The estimation of muscles force is based on the mechanical properties of tendon-aponeurosis complex. Most neuromusculoskeletal models use a generic definition of the tendon-aponeurosis complex based on in vitro test, perhaps limiting their validity. Ultrasonography allows subject-specific estimates of the tendon-aponeurosis complex’s mechanical properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of subject-specific mechanical properties of the tendon-aponeurosis complex on a neuromusculoskeletal model of the ankle joint. Seven subjects performed isometric contractions from which the tendon-aponeurosis force-strain relationship was estimated. Hopping and running tasks were performed and muscle forces were estimated using subject-specific tendon-aponeurosis and generic tendon properties. Two ultrasound probes positioned over the muscle-tendon junction and the mid-belly were combined with motion capture to estimate the in vivo tendon and aponeurosis strain of the medial head of gastrocnemius muscle. The tendon-aponeurosis force-strain relationship was scaled for the other ankle muscles based on tendon and aponeurosis length of each muscle measured by ultrasonography. The EMG-driven model was calibrated twice - using the generic tendon definition and a subject-specific tendon-aponeurosis force-strain definition. The use of subject-specific tendon-aponeurosis definition leads to a higher muscle force estimate for the soleus muscle and the plantar-flexor group, and to a better model prediction of the ankle joint moment compared to the model estimate which used a generic definition. Furthermore, the subject-specific tendon-aponeurosis definition leads to a decoupling behaviour between the muscle fibre and muscle-tendon unit in agreement with previous experiments using ultrasonography. These results indicate the use of subject-specific tendon-aponeurosis definitions in a neuromusculoskeletal model produce better agreement with measured external loads and more physiological model behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2138675396,"Background Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) causes a highly contagious often fatal disease in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. HPAIV H5N1 also poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans. One effective way to combat avian influenza with pandemic potential is through the vaccination of poultry. Several live vaccines based on attenuated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that express influenza hemagglutinin (HA) have been developed to protect chickens or mammalian species against HPAIV. However, the zoonotic potential of NDV raises safety concerns regarding the use of live NDV recombinants, as the incorporation of a heterologous attachment protein may result in the generation of NDV with altered tropism and/or pathogenicity. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we generated recombinant NDVs expressing either full length, membrane-anchored HA of the H5 subtype (NDV-H5) or a soluble trimeric form thereof (NDV-sH53). A single intramuscular immunization with NDV-sH53 or NDV-H5 fully protected chickens against disease after a lethal challenge with H5N1 and reduced levels of virus shedding in tracheal and cloacal swabs. NDV-sH53 was less protective than NDV-H5 (50% vs 80% protection) when administered via the respiratory tract. The NDV-sH53 was ineffective in mice, regardless of whether administered oculonasally or intramuscularly. In this species, NDV-H5 induced protective immunity against HPAIV H5N1, but only after oculonasal administration, despite the poor H5-specific serum antibody response it elicited. Conclusions/Significance Although NDV expressing membrane anchored H5 in general provided better protection than its counterpart expressing soluble H5, chickens could be fully protected against a lethal challenge with H5N1 by using the latter NDV vector. This study thus provides proof of concept for the use of recombinant vector vaccines expressing a soluble form of a heterologous viral membrane protein. Such vectors may be advantageous as they preclude the incorporation of heterologous membrane proteins into the viral vector particles."

Infection with dominant-negative CREB or C/EBPβ-shRNA significantly reduced or normalized PEPCK expression, with no change in PGC-1α or FOXO1 levels. Notably, expression of HCV nonstructural component NS5A in Huh7 or primary hepatocytes stimulated PEPCK gene expression and glucose output in HepG2 cells, whereas a deletion in NS5A reduced PEPCK expression and lowered cellular lipids but was without effect on insulin resistance, as demonstrated by the inability of insulin to stimulate mobilization of a pool of insulin-responsive vesicles to the plasma membrane. HCV-replicating cells demonstrated increases in cellular lipids with insulin resistance at the level of the insulin receptor, increased insulin receptor substrate 1 (Ser-312), and decreased Akt (Ser-473) activation in response to insulin. C/EBPβ-RNAi normalized lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, and liver X receptor α but was unable to reduce accumulation of triglycerides in Huh.8 cells or reverse the increase in ApoB expression, suggesting a role for increased lipid retention in steatotic hepatocytes.

We found that T. bubalis has a relatively shallow genealogy with some differentiation between Atlantic and North Sea. Genetic diversity was homogeneous across all populations studied. The possibility of a glacial refugium near the North Sea is discussed. In many, but not all, marine temperate organisms, patterns of diversity are similar across the species range. If this phenomenon proves to be most common in cold adapted species, it may reflect the availability of glacial refugia not far from their present-day northern limits."

Here we identify glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) as a novel and critical component of the circadian clock of Neurospora crassa that regulates the abundance of its core transcription factor white collar complex (WCC) on a post-transcriptional level. We show that GSK specifically binds and phosphorylates both subunits of the WCC. Reduced expression of GSK promotes an increased accumulation of WC-1, the limiting factor of the WCC, causing an acceleration of the circadian clock and a shorter free-running period.

https://openalex.org/W2002584875,"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is one of the most severe forms of inherited retinal degeneration and can be caused by mutations in at least 15 different genes. To clarify the proteomic differences in LCA eyes, a cohort of retinal degeneration 12 (rd12) mice, an LCA2 model caused by a mutation in the RPE65 gene, were injected subretinally with an AAV vector (scAAV5-smCBA-hRPE65) in one eye, while the contralateral eye served as a control. Proteomics were compared between untreated rd12 and normal control retinas on P14 and P21, and among treated and untreated rd12 retinas and control retinas on P42. Gene therapy in rd12 mice restored retinal function in treated eyes, which was demonstrated by electroretinography (ERG). Proteomic analysis successfully identified 39 proteins expressed differently among the 3 groups. The expression of 3 proteins involved in regulation of apoptosis and neuroptotection (alpha A crystallin, heat shock protein 70 and peroxiredoxin 6) were investigated further. Immunofluorescence, Western blot and real-time PCR confirmed the quantitative changes in their expression. Furthermore, cell culture studies suggested that peroxiredoxin 6 could act in an antioxidant role in rd12 mice. Our findings support the feasibility of gene therapy in LCA2 patients and support a role for alpha A crystallin, heat shock protein 70 and peroxiredoxin 6 in the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in LCA2 disease process."
https://openalex.org/W2021966623,"Glutathionyl-hydroquinone reductases (GS- HQRs) are a newly identified group of glutathione transferases, and they are widely distributed in bacteria, halobacteria, fungi, and plants. GS-HQRs catalyze glutathione (GSH)-dependent reduction of glutathionyl-hydroquinones (GS-hydroquinones) to hydroquinones. GS-hydroquinones can be spontaneously formed from benzoquinones reacting with reduced GSH via Michael addition, and GS-HQRs convert the conjugates to hydroquinones. In this report we have determined the structures of two bacterial GS-HQRs, PcpF of Sphingobium chlorophenolicum and YqjG of Escherichia coli. The two structures and the previously reported structure of a fungal GS-HQR shared many features and displayed complete conservation for all the critical residues. Furthermore, we obtained the binary complex structures with GS-menadione, which in its reduced form, GS-menadiol, is a substrate. The structure revealed a large H-site that could accommodate various substituted hydroquinones and a hydrogen network of three Tyr residues that could provide the proton for reductive deglutathionylation. Mutation of the Tyr residues and the position of two GSH molecules confirmed the proposed mechanism of GS-HQRs. The conservation of GS-HQRs across bacteria, halobacteria, fungi, and plants potentiates the physiological role of these enzymes in quinone metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W1994576437,"Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the major source for alteration of extracellular matrix in fibrosis and cirrhosis. Conditioned medium (CM) collected from immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) have earlier been shown to be responsible for apoptosis of HSCs. In this study, we have shown that antibodies raised against a peptide derived from a linear B-cell epitope in the N-terminal region of gelsolin identified a gelsolin fragment in IHH CM. Analysis of activated stellate cell death by CM collected from Huh7 cells transfected with plasmids encoding gelsolin deletion mutants suggested that the N-terminal half of gelsolin contained sequences which were responsible for stellate cell death. Further analysis determined that this activity was restricted to a region encompassing amino acids 1–70 in the gelsolin sequence; antibody directed to an epitope within this region was able to neutralize stellate cell death. Gelsolin modulation of cell death using this fragment involved upregulation of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2, and involved caspase 3 activation by extrinsic pathway. The apoptotic activity of N-terminal gelsolin fragments was restricted to activated but not quiescent stellate cells indicating its potential application in therapeutic use as an anti-fibrotic agent. Gelsolin fragments encompassing N-terminal regions in polypeptides of different molecular sizes were detected by N-terminal peptide specific antiserum in IHH CM immunoprecipitated with chronically HCV infected patient sera, suggesting the presence of autoantibodies generated against N-terminal gelsolin fragments in patients with chronic liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020210286,"NIPA is an F-box-like protein that contributes to the timing of mitotic entry. It targets nuclear cyclin B1 for ubiquitination in interphase, whereas in G(2)/M phase, NIPA is inactivated by phosphorylation to allow for cyclin B1 accumulation, a critical event for proper G(2)/M transition. We recently specified three serine residues of NIPA and demonstrated a sequential phosphorylation at G(2)/M, where initial Ser-354 and Ser-359 phosphorylation is most crucial for SCF(NIPA) inactivation. In this study, we identified ERK2 as the kinase responsible for this critical initial phosphorylation step. Using in vitro kinase assays, we found that both ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylated NIPA with high efficiency. Mutation of either Ser-354 or Ser-359 abolished ERK-dependent NIPA phosphorylation. Pharmacologic inhibition of ERK1/2 in cell lines resulted in decreased NIPA phosphorylation at G(2)/M. By combining cell cycle synchronization with stable expression of shRNA targeting either ERK1 or ERK2, we showed that ERK2 but not ERK1 mediated NIPA inactivation at G(2)/M. ERK2 knockdown led to a delay at the G(2)/M transition, a phenotype also observed in cells expressing a phospho-deficient mutant of NIPA. Thus, our data add to the recently described divergent functions of ERK1 and ERK2 in cell cycle regulation, which may be due in part to the differential ability of these kinases to phosphorylate and inactivate NIPA at G(2)/M."
https://openalex.org/W2066576345,"Tissue-specific transcription factors are thought to cooperate with signaling pathways to promote patterned tissue specification, in part by co-regulating transcription. The Drosophila melanogaster Pax6 homolog Eyeless forms a complex, incompletely understood regulatory network with the Hedgehog, Decapentaplegic and Notch signaling pathways to control eye-specific gene expression. We report a combinatorial approach, including mRNAseq and microarray analyses, to identify targets co-regulated by Eyeless and Hedgehog, Decapentaplegic or Notch. Multiple analyses suggest that the transcriptomes resulting from co-misexpression of Eyeless+signaling factors provide a more complete picture of eye development compared to previous efforts involving Eyeless alone: (1) Principal components analysis and two-way hierarchical clustering revealed that the Eyeless+signaling factor transcriptomes are closer to the eye control transcriptome than when Eyeless is misexpressed alone; (2) more genes are upregulated at least three-fold in response to Eyeless+signaling factors compared to Eyeless alone; (3) based on gene ontology analysis, the genes upregulated in response to Eyeless+signaling factors had a greater diversity of functions compared to Eyeless alone. Through a secondary screen that utilized RNA interference, we show that the predicted gene CG4721 has a role in eye development. CG4721 encodes a neprilysin family metalloprotease that is highly up-regulated in response to Eyeless+Notch, confirming the validity of our approach. Given the similarity between D. melanogaster and vertebrate eye development, the large number of novel genes identified as potential targets of Ey+signaling factors will provide novel insights to our understanding of eye development in D. melanogaster and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2089854179,"While the effect of habitat connectivity on local and regional diversity has been analysed in a number of studies, time-dependent dynamics in metacommunities have received comparatively little consideration. When local patches of a metacommunity are identical in environmental conditions but differ in initial community composition, dispersal among patches may result in homogenization of local communities. In a microcosm experiment with benthic ciliates, we tested the hypothesis that the effect of connectivity on diversity is time-dependent and only transitory, with the degree of connectivity affecting the time to homogenization but not the final outcome. Six microcosms were connected to a metacommunity with one of three levels of connectivity. The six patches differed in initial community composition but were identical in environmental conditions. We found a time-dependent and transitory effect of connectivity on local and regional richness and on local Shannon diversity, while Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and regional Shannon diversity were persistently affected by connectivity. Local richness increased and regional richness decreased with connectivity during the initial phase of the experiment but soon converged to similar values in all three connectivity treatments. Local Shannon diversity was unimodally related to time, with maximum diversity reached sooner with high than with medium or low connectivity. Eventually, however, local diversity converged to similar values irrespective of connectivity. At the regional scale, Shannon diversity was persistently lower with high than with low connectivity. While initial differences in community composition vanished with medium and high connectivity, they were maintained with low connectivity resulting in persistently high beta and regional diversity. The effect of connectivity on ciliate community composition translated down to the algal resource, as stronger dominance of the superior competitor with high and medium connectivity resulted in stronger depletion of the resource."
https://openalex.org/W2037016649,BMS309403 is a biphenyl azole inhibitor against fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) and regarded as a lead compound for effective treatment of obesity related cardio-metabolic diseases. Here we discovered an off-target activity of BMS309403 in that it stimulates glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes in a temporal and dose dependent manner via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway but independent of FABPs. Further analysis indicated that BMS309403 activates AMPK through increasing the ratio of intracellular AMP:ATP while decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings provide mechanistic insights on the action of BMS309403.
https://openalex.org/W2080946637,"Background Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are major downstream mediators of neuronal calcium signaling that regulate multiple neuronal functions. CaMKII, one of the key CaMKs, plays a significant role in mediating cellular responses to external signaling molecules. Although calcium signaling plays an essential role in the enteric nervous system (ENS), the role of CaMKII in neurogenic intestinal function has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the function and expression pattern of CaMKII in the ENS across several mammalian species. Methodology/Principal Findings CaMKII expression was characterized by immunofluorescence analyses and Western Blot. CaMKII function was examined by intracellular recordings and by assays of colonic contractile activity. Immunoreactivity for CaMKII was detected in the ENS of guinea pig, mouse, rat and human preparations. In guinea pig ENS, CaMKII immunoreactivity was enriched in both nitric oxide synthase (NOS)- and calretinin-containing myenteric plexus neurons and non-cholinergic secretomotor/vasodilator neurons in the submucosal plexus. CaMKII immunoreactivity was also expressed in both cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons in the ENS of mouse, rat and human. The selective CaMKII inhibitor, KN-62, suppressed stimulus-evoked purinergic slow EPSPs and ATP-induced slow EPSP-like response in guinea pig submucosal plexus, suggesting that CaMKII activity is required for some metabotropic synaptic transmissions in the ENS. More importantly, KN-62 significantly suppressed tetrodotoxin-induced contractile response in mouse colon, which suggests that CaMKII activity is a major determinant of the tonic neurogenic inhibition of this tissue. Conclusion ENS neurons across multiple mammalian species express CaMKII. CaMKII signaling constitutes an important molecular mechanism for controlling intestinal motility and secretion by regulating the excitability of musculomotor and secretomotor neurons. These findings revealed a fundamental role of CaMKII in the ENS and provide clues for the treatment of intestinal dysfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W2008369467,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the establishment and maintenance of silent chromatin at the telomere requires a delicate balance between opposing activities of histone modifying enzymes. Previously, we demonstrated that the protein arginine methyltransferase Hmt1 plays a role in the formation of yeast silent chromatin. To better understand the nature of the Hmt1 interactions that contribute to this phenomenon, we carried out a systematic reverse genetic screen using a null allele of HMT1 and the synthetic genetic array (SGA) methodology. This screen revealed interactions between HMT1 and genes encoding components of the histone deacetylase complex Rpd3L (large). A double mutant carrying both RPD3 and HMT1 deletions display increased telomeric silencing and Sir2 occupancy at the telomeric boundary regions, when comparing to a single mutant carrying Hmt1-deletion only. However, the dual rpd3/hmt1-null mutant behaves like the rpd3-null single mutant with respect to silencing behavior, indicating that RPD3 is epistatic to HMT1. Mutants lacking either Hmt1 or its catalytic activity display an increase in the recruitment of histone deacetylase Rpd3 to the telomeric boundary regions. Moreover, in such loss-of-function mutants the levels of acetylated H4K5, which is a substrate of Rpd3, are altered at the telomeric boundary regions. In contrast, the level of acetylated H4K16, a target of the histone deacetylase Sir2, was increased in these regions. Interestingly, mutants lacking either Rpd3 or Sir2 display various levels of reduction in dimethylated H4R3 at these telomeric boundary regions. Together, these data provide insight into the mechanism whereby Hmt1 promotes the proper establishment and maintenance of silent chromatin at the telomeres."
