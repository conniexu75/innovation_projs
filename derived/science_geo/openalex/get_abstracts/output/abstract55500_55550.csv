https://openalex.org/W2061269883,"Murine leukemia virus activity is present in tissues from NIH Swiss and other mouse strains after cocultivation with nonvirus-yielding rat cells transformed by Harvey sarcoma virus. The resulting pseudotype sarcoma virus has the same type-specific coat as the virus previously isolated from New Zealand black (NZB) mice, and, like the NZB virus, it is unable to infect mouse cells. The results show that this NZB type virus is endogenous in other strains of mice and is xenotropic; that is, it grows only in cells foreign to the host. This is the first clear demonstration that NIH Swiss mice also carry indigenous infectious murine leukemia virus."
https://openalex.org/W185850242,"Abstract Ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli consists of two nonidentical subunits (Protein B1 and Protein B2), both required for activity. Protein B2 contains 2 iron atoms and a lesser, variable amount of a paramagnetic species, characterized by g = 2.0047 EPR and 410 nm electronic absorptions. Except for the 410 nm band, Protein B2 much resembles oxy- and methemerythrins in electronic spectra. The paramagnetic species is probably organic free radical rather than metal, is dependent upon the presence of iron in Protein B2, is directly correlated with enzymatic activity, and is destroyed by NH2OH and hydroxyurea (Ehrenberg, A., and Reichard, P. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 3485–3488). We here describe complete removal of iron from Protein B2, reconstitution to active metalloenzyme, and Mossbauer spectroscopy of [57Fe]Protein B2. Addition of excess Fe2+ to metal-free protein yielded reconstituted/reactivated protein with 2:1 iron:subunit stoichiometry and a hemerythrinlike electronic spectrum, but with 120 to 390% of the original specific enzymatic activity and correspondingly increased 410 nm and EPR absorptions. NH2OH- or hydroxyurea-inactivated protein was also converted to highly active enzyme subunit by the same iron substitution procedures. Mossbauer and electronic spectra suggested that Protein B2 contains 2 nonidentical high spin Fe(III) ions in an antiferromagnetically coupled binuclear complex that resembles both methydroxohemerythrin and oxyhemerythrin. Below 195°K the iron in Protein B2 was completely diamagnetic, in confirmation of the previous assignment of the 410 nm- and EPR-absorbing species as stable organic free radical of unknown structure. We propose that the function of iron in Protein B2 is the initial generation of radical from a protein-bound group, and that stability of the radical depends upon some continuing interaction with the iron center. The radical is apparently less stable than is metalloprotein structure: this would account for the variability of radical content in native protein and for the g 100% yield of radical obtainable by substitution of the iron. We further propose that the free radical participates in the reduction of ribonucleotides by the enzymatically active Protein B1-Protein B2 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1538260817,"Abstract The phosphorylation of specific membrane proteins by endogenous protein kinase in synaptic membrane fractions from rat cerebrum has been studied using the technique of acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The endogenous phosphorylation of two specific membrane proteins was found to be regulated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). The minimal molecular weights of these proteins were determined, by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, to be 86,000 (Protein I) and 48,000 (Protein II). The endogenous phosphorylation of Protein I and Protein II was stimulated by cyclic AMP in the presence of magnesium ions. Approximately 80% and 75% of the 32P incorporated into Protein I and Protein II, respectively, was found in phosphoserine. The concentration of cyclic AMP required for maximal stimulation of the phosphorylation of both Protein I and Protein II was approximately 5 x 10-6 m. Guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate had no significant effect, at concentrations up to 10-4 m, on the phosphorylation of either of these proteins. The endogenous phosphorylation occurred rapidly, the phosphorylation of both Protein I and Protein II reaching maximal levels within 5 sec. After reaching a maximal level of phosphorylation, Protein II underwent rapid dephosphorylation. The cyclic AMP-stimulated endogenous phosphorylation of a protein corresponding in position on acrylamide gel electrophoresis to Protein I was also observed in membrane fractions prepared from other neural tissues known to contain synapses, but membrane fractions prepared from several neural and non-neural tissues devoid of synapses, including lingual nerve, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney, all failed to reveal cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of a protein band corresponding in position to Protein I. In contrast, cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of a protein band corresponding in position to Protein II was observed in several neural and non-neural tissues. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the mediation of certain types of synaptic transmission may involve regulation by cyclic AMP of the level of phosphorylation of specific protein constituents of the synaptic membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1490801702,"Normal mouse livers have been perfused in situ and the release of triglycerides in the perfusate has been measured as an index of very low density lipoprotein secretion. Vincristine or colchicine, drugs known to interfere with the microtubular system, were found to inhibit markedly triglyceride release by perfused livers. When used at appropriate concentrations these drugs did not change glucose production, ureogenesis, ATP levels, or oxygen consumption. The uptake and oxidation of fatty acids by livers perfused with either drugs remained unaffected. Labeled oleate incorporation into total triglycerides (i.e. liver plus perfusate) as well as that of labeled amino acids into total proteins were not changed by vincristine or colchicine. The ultrastructure of livers perfused with these drugs appeared normal except that the microtubules could no longer be observed. Concomitantly numerous clusters of vesicles were observed in vincristine- or colchicine-treated livers. In the presence of vincristine (not in that of colchicine) these vesicles were very often seen in close relationship with amorphous masses interpreted as being precipitated microtubular proteins. It is concluded that the functional integrity of microtubules is important for the intracellular movement and eventual release of very low density lipoprotein particles. The additional observation that total protein secretion by the liver was also markedly inhibited by vincristine or colchicine further suggests that microtubules may also play a role in the release of albumin or globulins."

https://openalex.org/W1537885139,"Abstract Effects of insulin on the level of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and the rate of lipolysis in isolated rat epididymal fat cells were determined under various conditions. When cells were incubated with 0.01 to 100 nm insulin, it gave: (a) a biphasic inhibitory effect that was maximal between 0.1 and 1 nm and submaximal at either lower or higher insulin concentrations on lipolysis stimulated by 0.5 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP, 10 nm adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or 1 to 10 µm norepinephrine; (b) a monophasic inhibitory effect that was maximal at 1 to 100 nm on lipolysis induced by 5 or 20 mm cyclic AMP or 1 to 4 mm caffeine; and (c) a monophasic stimulatory effect that was maximal at 10 to 100 nm on lipolysis induced by 1 mm dibutyryl cyclic AMP or 0.1 to 1 mm norepinephrine. Under the above conditions, lipolysis was either inhibited or stimulated by either 10 times recrystallized Novo insulin or a highly purified single component insulin, but not by modified insulin preparations that were inactive in stimulating glucose utilization in fat cells. On the other hand, neither the inhibitory nor stimulatory effect of insulin was observed when the cellular insulin receptor or receptors were modified by exposure of cells to trypsin (1 mg per ml) for 15 min. Insulin at either 0.2 or 10 nm significantly decreased the cellular level of cyclic AMP in the presence or absence of various lipolytic agents tested, except in the presence of high concentrations (0.1 to 1 mm) of catecholamines (see below). The effect of insulin to lower the cellular level of cyclic AMP was seemingly large enough to account for the antilipolytic effect of this hormone when the cyclic AMP level was low (or when the determinations were made in the presence of 2 to 5 mm caffeine, 10 to 100 nm glucagon, or less than 10 nm ACTH) but not when the nucleotide level was high (or when the determinations were made in the presence of 1 µm norepinephrine or 10 to 100 nm ACTH). Insulin at 10 nm further increased the levels of cyclic AMP and lipolysis that were highly elevated by 0.1 to 1 mm norepinephrine, whereas insulin at 0.2 nm had no significant effects on the two parameters under these conditions. On the other hand, either in the absence of any lipolytic agent or in the presence of 2 mm caffeine or 10 nm ACTH, insulin at 10 nm lowered the level of cyclic AMP to a larger degree than it did at 0.2 nm. Consequently, the effect of insulin on the cyclic AMP level was monophasic while its effect on lipolysis was biphasic (see above) in the presence of 10 nm ACTH. The effects of the insulin-like action of trypsin on the levels of cyclic AMP and lipolysis were similar to those of insulin at 0.2 nm. Incidentally, all the effects of norepinephrine noted above were observed with epinephrine. The above mentioned insulin effects do not necessarily indicate the physiological effects of this hormone since they were observed in the presence of wide concentration ranges of insulin and certain lipolytic agents. Thus, the above data suggest that, under the given in vitro conditions, insulin (rather than its possible contaminants) induces multiple effects on the levels of cyclic AMP and lipolysis depending on its concentration and on the nature and concentrations of the lipolytic agent used. Part of the difference in the effects of lipolytic agents might be explained by the difference in the cyclic AMP levels elevated by these agents. Since all the insulin effects tested seem to be mediated by the cellular insulin receptor or receptors, it is suggested that the insulin receptor system of fat cells can respond to a wide concentration range (approximately from 0.01 to 100 nm) of this hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1574319011,"Abstract Of four protein fractions previously reported which bind corticosteroids in liver cytosol, one fraction, corticosteroid Binder II, has been found to be a major hormone receptor. It has a molecular weight of 67,000 determined by gel filtration. Binder II has an appropriate glucocorticoid binding specificity: dexamethasone g corticosterone g cortisol >> cortisone >> deoxycorticosterone and it also binds progesterone and to a lesser extent the sex hormones. The Kd for dexamethasone is about 6 x 10-10 m determined in vitro and that for cortisol is in the range of 10-8 m. Binder II bound with corticosteroid is deduced to undergo nuclear transfer in vitro and in vivo as determined by its reisolation from the soluble nuclear fraction. The reisolated nucleoplasmic macromolecule has characteristics similar to corticosteroid Binder II isolated from liver cytosol (molecular weight, chromatographic elution position and pI (6.7) determined by isoelectric focusing). An antibody has been prepared to corticosteroid Binder II fraction isolated from cytosol which does not cross-react with other corticosteroid binding proteins (ligandin, Binder III and transcortin) and an antigen, determined by gel immunodiffusion, is present in the soluble nuclear fraction after nuclear transfer of macromolecular bound steroid in vitro or in vivo."

Molecular weights of the holoenzyme and its cyclic AMP-binding and phosphotransferase (catalytic) components were 174,000, 98,000, and 38,000, respectively. Frictional and axial ratios were 1.6 and 12 for both the holoenzyme and the cyclic AMP-binding protein and 1.1 and 3 for the catalytic component. We conclude that the native enzyme is composed of two catalytic units and one cyclic AMP-binding protein containing two polypeptide chains of equal size."
https://openalex.org/W1505544379,"Abstract Modification of erythrocyte membrane sialoglycoprotein(s) in isolated form, or when in membrane, is described using sequential sodium periodate oxidation and tritiated sodium borohydride reduction, essentially as suggested by Van Lenten and Ashwell ((1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1889). Conditions of modification were investigated; under the optimal but nondestructive conditions selected, the modification appears specific for sialyl residues and leads to incorporation of tritium into the modified product, 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-l-arabino-2-heptulosonic acid, identified by its susceptibility to neuraminidase and mild acid hydrolysis, and by its identity with the authentic compound in chromatographic behavior, several colorimetric assays, and extent of tritium incorporation. The selectivity of the modification for the sialoglycoprotein(s) is further demonstrated by carrying out the modification on solubilized membrane proteins; only the sialoglycoprotein(s) incorporates the label. In the modification of the intact membranes some lipid components also become radioactive. The modification of intact erythrocytes, the membranes, or the isolated sialoglycoprotein(s) results in loss of the M blood group activity, but the A and B blood group activities and the phytohemagglutinin binding sites are not affected. The modification offers a handle for isolation of membrane sialoglycoprotein(s) and study of their disposition, and possibly, for evaluation of the physiological role of the terminal polyhydroxy side chains of their sialyl residues."
https://openalex.org/W1972402575,"The effects of pentobarbital (Nembutal) on synaptic transmission and postsynaptic potentials were studied by the use of several invertebrate preparations. Pentobarbital selectively and reversibly depressed both excitatory postsynaptic potentials and sodium-dependent postsynaptic responses to putative excitatory transmitters without affecting either inhibitory postsynaptic potentials or chloride- and potassium-dependent postsynaptic responses to putative transmitters. A selective depression of postsynaptic excitatory events was also observed with other central nervous system depressants (ethanol, chloroform, chloralose, diphenylhydantoin, and urethane). The results suggest that central and peripheral depression observed during general anesthesia is due to a selective depression of excitatory synaptic events."

https://openalex.org/W1489969450,"Abstract Marked alterations in the functions of hepatic mitochondria have been observed in male Sprague-Dawley rats fed a nutritionally adequate diet having 36% of its caloric content supplied by ethanol. A direct causal relationship exists between changes in mitochondrial function and abnormal accumulation of lipid in the liver. When ethanol forms a significant part of the diet, the reducing equivalents required for the respiratory chain arise mainly from the oxidation of ethanol rather than β oxidation of fatty acids. This simple shift in metabolism appears to be the basis for the biochemical change producing the observed alterations in mitochondrial function. A significant decrease in the translocation of ADP across the mitochondrial membrane was observed which was associated with an increase in the hepatic level of long chain acyl coenzyme A derivatives of fatty acids, which have been shown to impede this metabolic step. This explains the lowering of the respiratory activity and lack of respiratory control which has been observed in the mitochondria isolated from an ethanol-induced fatty liver. This transition from State 3 to 4 in the mitochondria explains the observed decrease in the flux of substrate through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the shift in the oxidation-reduction state of the mitochondria to a more reduced level, and the decreased synthesis of ATP in the liver of these animals exhibiting a fatty liver."
https://openalex.org/W1499846546,"Highly purified lipoprotein lipase from bovine milk has been incubated with emulsified 1,3-dioleoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl-[3H]glycerol, and the reaction products have been separated by thin layer chromatography on silicic acid impregnated with boric acid. There was an appreciable accumulation of monoacylglycerol, preponderantly of the 2 configuration. The 1(3)-monoacylglycerol found must have been formed by isomerization from the 2 isomer. A small but constant amount of 1,2(2,3)-diacylglycerol was found among the reaction products, but no 1,3-diacylglycerol. In incubations of albumin-bound 1(3)-monooleoylglycerol and 2-monooleoylglycerol with the enzyme, glycerol was produced by hydrolysis of the 1(3) isomer exclusively. In the incubations with trioleoylglycerol substrate, glycerol thus must have been obtained by hydrolysis of 1(3)-monoacylglycerol formed by isomerization from the 2 isomer. The main reaction sequence was triacylglycerol → 1,2(2,3)-diacylglycerol → 2-monoacylglycerol ⇌ 1(3)-monoacylglycerol → glycerol. The enzyme thus has a specificity for position 1(3) of the acylglycerols."

Peak concentrations of cyclic AMP precede peak development of systolic tension.

Significant enhancement of ""renin-dependent"" as well as renin-independent drinking was observed in the presence of peripheral SQ. Intraventricular SQ obviated this enhancement of drinking but did not affect the water intake caused by the original stimulus itself, whereas it sharply reduced drinking evoked by peripheral renin in nephrectomized rats. Prior renin depletion likewise had no influence on so-called renin-dependent thirst."

https://openalex.org/W1504112263,"Abstract The DNA-joining reaction catalyzed by the Escherichia coli DNA ligase is markedly enhanced by low concentrations of monovalent cations, NH4+ being most effective. The Km for NH4+ is about 1 mm, and at saturating concentrations it increases the true Vmax by 20-fold. Under these conditions the Km for diphosphopyridine nucleotide is 7 µm, the Km for single strand breaks is 0.03 to 0.06 µm, and the turnover number is 25 sealing events per min. The DNA-joining reaction obeys ping-pong kinetics, thus providing kinetic evidence for the participation of a covalent intermediate, presumably ligase-adenylate. The rate of the ligase-catalyzed diphosphopyridine nucleotide-nicotinamide mononucleotide exchange reaction is unaffected by NH4+, indicating that the activation occurs at a step subsequent to the formation of ligase-adenylate; furthermore, the exchange reaction is faster than the rate of DNA-joining, demonstrating that ligase-adenylate can be formed at a rate sufficient to be an intermediate in the over-all reaction. The rate of release of adenosine 5'-monophosphate from synthetic DNA-adenylate in the absence of NH4+ is greater than the rate of DNA-joining, as expected for a kinetically significant intermediate. However, in the presence of NH4+, the rate of adenosine 5'-monophosphate release is less than that of the over-all reaction. Since NH4+ markedly increases the apparent rate of dissociation of ligase-adenylate from DNA, the result may reflect reversal of the reaction to form ligaseadenylate from ligase and DNA-adenylate and dissociation of this form of the enzyme from the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2399889170,"Abstract A receptor with specificity and high affinity for glucocorticoid hormones has been identified and partially characterized in the cytoplasmic fraction of AtT-20 mouse pituitary tumor cells grown in tissue culture. The binding of triamcinolone acetonide, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, was analyzed using the high speed supernatant or cytosol fraction from homogenates of these cells. The interaction with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide had an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of about 1.0 x 10-9 m and a second order association rate constant of 2.2 x 105 m-1s-1 at 0°. The triamcinolone-receptor complex was stable at 0°, but the binding activity of the receptor was labile in the absence of bound steroid. The receptor activity was destroyed by heating to 60° and by treatment with Pronase and N-ethylmaleimide, but not by deoxyribonuclease or ribonuclease. The size of the cytoplasmic binding component was estimated by sucrose gradient centrifugation studies. The complex had a sedimentation coefficient of about 5.4 S in 0.01 m KCl and 4 S in 0.4 m KCl. The binding of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide to the cytosol receptor was largely inhibited by unlabeled corticosterone and dexamethasone and partially reduced by cortisol, progesterone, deoxycorticosterone, and aldosterone, but unaffected by estradiol, testosterone, or dihydrotestosterone at the concentrations tested. A functional role for these receptors in the regulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production is supported by the correlation between effectiveness of the glucocorticoids in competing with triamcinolone binding and their ability to reduce ACTH levels in cell incubation studies."
https://openalex.org/W1486973074,"Abstract The effect of strong electrolyte upon the activity of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (VC neuraminidase) toward the surface of intact cells and toward their isolated, purified sialolipid components, was studied in detail. A linear dependence of the logarithm of initial velocity on the square root of ionic strength was observed for purified GM3 over a concentration range of 0 to 0.05 m NaCl in 0.01 m Tris-acetate, pH 6.5. The rate of decrease of the logarithm of the optimum initial velocity, obtained in 0.01 m Tris-acetate alone, with increasing square root of ionic strength was 3 times more rapid with GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1 as substrate mixture than with the smaller sialolipid, GM3, as substrate. These data are consistent with previous results which indicate that ionic interactions upon the enzyme conformationally govern steric availability of the catalytic site. The effect of strong electrolyte upon the activity of neuraminidase toward the surface of intact cells was small in comparison with that observed with purified sialolipid substrates. Analysis of lipid extracts from untreated control and VC neuraminidase-treated samples by thin layer chromatography revealed no detectable difference between the sialolipid content of untreated control samples and samples treated with VC neuraminidase. These findings suggest that the sialolipid components in the intact cell surface are relatively unavailable to the extracellular action of VC-neuraminidase. This is supported by evidence obtained by detailed analysis of the sialyl components in four cell types (Green monkey kidney cells, Morris hepatoma, B-16 melanoma, and human neuroblastoma) before and after VC neuraminidase treatment. The total cellular sialic acid content of these cell types, untreated, varied from 2.3 to 7.1 µg of sialic acid per mg of protein; lipid-bound sialic acid content varied from 0.7 to 1.6 µg of sialic acid per mg of protein. Progress curves for sialic acid release from the surface of intact cells were hyperbolic and had reached a plateau within approximately 30 min. In the plateau region approximately 20% of the total cellular sialic acid had been released consistently, in each case. Analysis of the lipid-bound sialic acid content of the VC neuraminidase-treated intact cells revealed no major changes, all values being greater than 90% of the untreated, control values. The sialolipid composition of each cell type was examined by thin layer chromatography and found nevertheless to consist predominately of VC neuraminidase-labile components. Therefore, the sialolipids of the intact cell surface appear to be more deeply localized so as to be sterically inaccessible to VC neuraminidase, and release of sialic acid from intact cells by VC neuraminidase appears to be from surface sialoglycoproteins."

Km and Vmax values relative to d-fructose at pH 7.5, 25°, 4 mm MgATP are 2,5-anhydro-d-mannitol (1.7 mm, 1.97); 2,5-anhydro-d-glucitol (5.9 mm, 1.33, phosphorylated in position 6); 2,5-anhydro-d-lyxitol (67 mm, 0.19); 2,5-anhydro-d-mannose (1.5 mm, 0.50). 2,5-Anhydro-d-xylitol inhibits (Ki, 40 mm), while 2,5-anhydro-l-iditol and cis 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran are neither inhibitors nor substrates.

https://openalex.org/W1481012370,"Abstract A procedure for the isolation and purification of bacteriophage T3-induced RNA polymerase from T3-infected Escherichia coli cells is presented. The procedure described leads to the isolation of polymerase preparation that displays a single protein band by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and is free of detectable ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease activities. Other enzyme activities absent from such preparations include inorganic pyrophosphatase, nucleoside diphosphokinase, DNA polymerase, E. coli RNA polymerase, nucleoside triphosphatase, polynucleotide phosphorylase, polyriboadenylate polymerase, and polyphosphate kinase. T3-induced RNA polymerase has been characterized with regard to various biochemical parameters. The enzyme is a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 105,000 ± 5,000. The enzyme activity is completely dependent on the presence of Mg2+, all four nucleoside triphosphates, and T3 DNA. T7 DNA shows only 2 to 5% of activity as that obtained with T3 DNA, while other native DNA preparations examined are inactive. The T3 RNA polymerase is highly sensitive to salt concentrations above 0.03 m or to reagents which react with sulfhydryl groups such as p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide. The enzyme catalyzes a T3 DNA-dependent 32PPi exchange into nucleoside triphosphates. However, no pyrophosphorolysis of free RNA can be demonstrated. The 32PPi exchange reaction can occur with GTP alone. The exchange reaction with the other three nucleoside triphosphates, present either alone or in combination, does not occur except when GTP is included in the reaction. The effect of E. coli RNA chain termination factor, p, on the T3 RNA polymerase reaction has been studied. It has been found that p factor has no effect on the rate, yield, or size of RNA formed in the T3 RNA polymerase-catalyzed reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1586039665,"Abstract A comparison of the effects of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on the cholesterol side chain cleavage system of zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata-reticularis tissue of the rat adrenal is presented. Following hypophysectomy, the rate of pregnenolone formation from endogenous cholesterol in mitochondria from zona fasciculata-reticularis was lower than in mitochondria from zona glomerulosa. Also, the proportion of high spin, cholesterol-bound side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 was smaller, as measured by spectrophotometry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Treatment with ACTH brought about an increase in the rate of cholesterol side chain cleavage and in the proportion of high spin, cholesterol-bound side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 in mitochondria isolated from both zones. However, the percentage increase found in the zona fasciculata reticularis was much greater than in the zona glomerulosa. It is concluded that although both zones are affected by ACTH, the cholesterol side chain cleavage system of the zona fasciculata-reticularis is much more sensitive than that of the zona glomerulosa to this hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1550636323,"Abstract Glutamate dehydrogenase is inactivated by incubation with 4-iodoacetamidosalicylic acid at 37° and pH 6.0. The reaction obeys pseudo-first order kinetics, with a rate constant which is linearly proportional to the 4-iodoacetamidosalicylic acid concentration. A 4- to 5-fold decrease in the rate of inactivation is provided by the substrates α-ketoglutarate and glutamate when added to the incubation mixture with ADP and DPN, but no appreciable decrease in the inactivation rate is produced by the coenzymes themselves, either alone or when combined with ADP or GTP. These results suggest that 4-iodoacetamidosalicylic acid reacts in the region of the active site. 4-Iodoacetamidosalicylic acid produces a change in the response of the enzyme to the allosteric inhibitor GTP, as exemplified by an increase in the kinetic dissociation constant of the enzyme-coenzyme-GTP complex. Although the reagent causes inactivation of the enzyme in the absence of GTP, it does not influence the small residual activity (4 to 8%) seen when a saturating concentration of GTP is present. Only methionyl and cysteinyl residues of glutamate dehydrogenase are altered by 4-iodoacetamidosalicylic acid at periods up to 10 times the half-life for inactivation; lysyl and histidyl residues are not alkylated during this time. As determined by the release of iodide ion from 4-iodoacetamidosalicylic acid, approximately 4 amino acids per peptide chain are modified when the enzyme loses 90% of its activity: about 2 cysteinyl and 2 methionyl residues are alkylated. Several lines of evidence suggest that covalent modification of cysteine is not the primary cause of inactivation. The rate of alkylation of sulfhydryl groups (K-sh = 0.0015 min-1) is only one-sixth that of inactivation (Ki = 0.0102 min-1) for the enzyme in the absence of ligands. These two rate constants can be varied independently by the addition of substrates and allosteric modifiers. In contrast, a good correlation is observed between the degree of inactivation of the enzyme and the extent of modification of approximately 1 methionyl residue per peptide chain. Furthermore, treatment of 75% inactivated enzyme with dithiothreitol produces a 3-fold increase in the enzymatic activity, accompanied by the regeneration of methionine but no appreciable alteration of the number of modified cysteine residues. It is concluded that the integrity of a methionine residue is critical for the function of glutamate dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1603947936,"Abstract The receptor for thyrotropin-releasing hormone has been located in the plasma membranes of bovine anterior pituitary gland. Treatment of membranes with phospholipase A, phospholipase C, or digitonin or addition of lysophosphatidylcholine diminishes or completely destroys the ability of membranes to bind 3H-labeled thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Phospholipase D was without effect. These reductions in thyrotropin-releasing hormone binding capacity stem from a decrease in the affinity for thyrotropin-releasing hormone of the membrane-located receptor. The effects of phospholipase A were completely Ca2+-dependent. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine are the four major phospholipids of adenohypophyseal cell plasma membranes. When added in excess of 1 mg per ml to intact plasma membranes, sonicated suspensions of these four phospholipids present either singly or in combination result in an inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone binding. If plasma membranes are used with a concentration of phospholipase A or C to give a reduction in thyrotropin-releasing hormone binding of at least 50%, partial recovery of binding activity is achieved on phospholipid addition. Inhibition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone binding by phospholipid addition to intact membranes is mediated by a decrease in the Vmax of the reaction. These data show membrane phospholipids to be intimately involved in the receptor for thyrotropin-releasing hormone."

https://openalex.org/W202589309,"Abstract A pure preparation of rat liver parenchymal cells was prepared by collagenase digestion of livers from fasted (24 hours) Sprague-Dawley rats, and the general features of gluconeogenesis in these cells have been elucidated. Rates of gluconeogenesis by a 5% suspension of cells were studied over a range of concentrations (0 to 11.3 mm) of different substrates. Rates were most rapid with concentrations of d-glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone up to 1.5 mm and d-fructose up to 3.7 mm. d-Glyceraldehyde inhibited gluconeogenesis at 1.5 to 2.0 mm. At greater than 1.5 mm, dihydroxyacetone continued to be converted but at a slower rate. At 3.7 to 7.6 mm, fructose was converted at a constant maximal rate; slight inhibition occurred at 11.3 mm. The maximal rate of gluconeogenesis from glycerol was observed at 0.75 mm and was half the maximal rate observed for fructose. Alanine and serine were converted to glucose very slowly; pyruvate and lactate were converted at rates between those from glycerol and from the amino acids. When lactate or pyruvate was incubated with the liver cells at 2 to 3 mm or greater, the rate of gluconeogenesis became approximately constant. When lactate and pyruvate were incubated together in ratios varying from 2 to 6, gluconeogenesis occurred rapidly and in proportion to the substrate concentration. In contrast to perfused liver, isolated cells subjected to the extreme oxidized or reduced state caused by incubation with pyruvate alone or lactate alone, respectively, were incapable of rapid carbohydrate synthesis. The liver cells were responsive to glucagon stimulation of gluconeogenesis from d-glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone: with d-glyceraldehyde as substrate, glucagon caused a 50 % increase, but the effect was not reproducible. The effects of monobutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) on metabolism of dihydroxyacetone and a mixture of lactate and pyruvate (3:1) also were studied. The nucleotide caused a 30% increase in gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone but much less of a change in gluconeogenesis from lactate-pyruvate. Thus, the properties of our cell system permitted a discrimination between a readily demonstrable cyclic AMP effect on dihydroxyacetone metabolism and an effect (reported by others) on pyruvate metabolism which was not as demonstrable. These results are consistent with the view that the actions of glucagon on the gluconeogenic pathway are not unifocal."
https://openalex.org/W2471799179,"Two isopentenyl pyrophosphate homologs, 3-ethylbut-3-enyl pyrophosphate (I), and trans-3-methylpent-3-enyl pyrophosphate (II)have been found to act as substrates for isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase from pig live. The compound (I) is converted much faster into II than into cis-3-methylpent-2-enyl pyrophosphate (III), whereas II gives exclusively trans-3-methylpent-2-enyl pyrophosphate (IV). The isomerization between II and IV is reversible and similar in stereochemical sense to that between isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. However, the unusual isomerization of I to II is irreversible. The mechanism for these isomerizations is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1491636426,"Abstract The concentration of cytochrome c has previously been shown to increase 2-fold in leg muscles of rats subjected to a program of prolonged exercise. In the present study it was found that the radioactivity of cytochrome c labeled with δ-amino[14C]levulinate decreased significantly more slowly in quadriceps muscles of rats subjected to a program of running than in muscles of sedentary animals. The t½ of muscle cytochrome c was 32 days in the sedentary animals and 48 days in the runners. The synthesis rate of cytochrome c was calculated to be approximately 0.630 nmole per muscle per day in the sedentary and 0.771 nmole per muscle per day in the exercised animals. Thus, a decrease in the rate of degradation plays the major role in accounting for the adaptive increase in the concentration of cytochrome c that occurs in muscle in response to exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1584825090,"Abstract Preparations of porcine spleen deoxyribonuclease (DNase II) obtained by the ammonium sulfate precipitation procedure of Bernardi et al. (Bernardi, G., Bernardi, A., and Chersi, A. (1966) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 129, 1) can be purified by sequential chromatography over sulfoethyl-Sephadex and phosphocellulose at pH 4.6. The purified enzyme is homogeneous by the criteria of chromatography on carboxymethyl-Sephadex, gel electrophoresis at pH 3.8, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. The specific activity, molecular weight, and amino acid composition of the purified protein are close to the values obtained by Bernardi et al. (Bernardi, G., Apella, E., and Zito, R. (1965) Biochemistry 4, 1725) on DNase II purified by a different chromatographic procedure. Significant differences between the two protein preparations are found only in tryptophan content and extinction coefficient at 280 nm. DNase II can be inactivated completely by iodoacetate at pH 4.6. The neutral alkylating agent, iodoacetamide, is without effect. At 2 x 10-5 m iodoacetate, only 4 min are required for half-inactivation. This inactivation rate is sufficiently rapid to permit the titration of DNase II activity with molar equivalent of iodoacetate. Loss of enzyme activity with radioactively labeled iodoacetate parallels the incorporation of 1 carboxymethyl group per molecule. The inactivated protein can be separated from active enzyme by chromatography over phosphocellulose. Inactive enzyme obtained by chromatography has 1 residue of 3-carboxymethylhistidine as the sole product of iodoacetate reaction. This alkylation reaction probably occurs in the active site region, since the enzyme is protected completely from inactivation by iodoacetate when substrate DNA is present at a concentration of 0.5 mg per ml."
https://openalex.org/W2160424491,"The amino acid sequence of ovine pancreatic ribonuclease has been derived by the fragment approach. The reduced, S-aminoethylated protein was subjected to tryptic hydrolysis. Peptides derived from all segments of the 124-residue chain were isolated, and their amino acid sequences determined by conventional methods. Alignment of the peptides proceeded from close homology with the amino acid sequence of the bovine enzyme. The ovine enzyme shows the following replacements: serine for threonine at position 3; serine for alanine at position 19; glutamine for lysine at position 37; and glutamine for asparagine at position 103. The results, together with the known amino acid sequences for the enzymes from the cow, pig, and rat, provide an increasingly detailed impression of the species variability of this protein and indicate that pancreatic ribonuclease is an enzyme which is undergoing evolution relatively rapidly in comparison to cytochrome c."

https://openalex.org/W1484390435,"Abstract An assignment of the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of NAD+ is presented based on the 13C chemical shifts of the following model compounds: protonated pyridine, benzamide, and N-methylnicotinamide. The pH dependence of the 13C spectra of NAD+ and oxidized thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is presented. The 13C chemical shifts of certain carbon atoms in both the adenyl and pyridyl rings are sensitive to pH. An inflection point in the pD profile occurs at a value slightly above 4 for all of these carbons. This implies that protonation of N1 in the adenine ring of NAD+ coincides with changes in the 13C chemical shifts of the pyridyl carbons. These data are interpreted to indicate the operation of a complex pH-dependent intramolecular anisotropic ring current effect in both pyridine dinucleotides."

https://openalex.org/W1494286622,"Abstract Extraction of NAD+ and NADH from Azotobacter vinelandii under conditions which do not promote anomerization, indicates that only the β-anomers of NAD+ and NADH are present. No α-NAD+ or α-NADH (measured as α-NAD+ following chemical oxidation) could be found using a chromatographic technique that can separate the β- and α-anomers of NAD+ and detect α-NAD+ at a level of 1% that of β-NAD+. Although there is no detectable α-NAD+ or α-NADH in A. vinelandii, β-NADH does exist in chemical equilibrium with α-NADH (Keq = [α-NADH]/[β-NADH] ≈ 0.18), and this equilibrium is readily established at elevated temperatures (100°) under neutral or mildly alkaline conditions. The data presented indicate that previous reports of α-NAD+ in A. vinelandii and other biological sources are the result of extraction conditions which promote the anomerization of β-NADH to α-NADH. Formation of α-NAD+ occurs by oxidation of α-NADH by various means, among which is the spontaneous transfer of hydrogen from α-NADH to β-NAD+."
https://openalex.org/W1486858541,"Abstract Reduced (Fe2+) carboxymethylated cytochrome c (Cm-cytochrome c) reversibly binds ligands of ferrous iron, e.g. CO, cyanide, ethyl isocyanide, and oxygen, at neutral pH. Titrations of the reduced protein with CO show that over the pH range 6 to 9.5 the stoichiometry of binding is one, and that the spectrum of the Cm-cytochrome c complex with CO is practically pH-independent. The kinetics of CO binding of Cm-cytochrome c have been studied as a function of pH. At low pH values the binding process as observed by stopped flow or photolysis techniques conforms to a simple bimolecular process (l' = 1.6 x 106 m-1 s-1), whereas at high pH the process, although remaining simple, it is ∼100-fold slower. At intermediate pH values, the binding of CO occurs in a biphasic reaction, the proportions of the fast and slow phases depending on the pH, on the monitoring wave length, and, in the case of photolytic experiments, on the CO concentration. The dissociation rate constants of CO from Cm-cytochrome c were measured by replacement with oxygen or ethyl isocyanide. A model is proposed in which the acid and alkaline conformers of the ligand-free protein have different ligand-binding properties. It is suggested that there is a pH-dependent transition in the CO adduct of Cm-cytochrome c and the pK of this transition is reported. The model is consistent with simple thermodynamic considerations. Binding between ferrous Cm-cytochrome c and O2 has been examined. At pH 6, a stable O2 complex, similar to myoglobin, is formed, whereas at pH 9 O2 rapidly oxidized the heme iron."

https://openalex.org/W1584067924,"Abstract The steroidogenic capacity, determined by in vitro superfusion with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), of adrenals in hypophysectomized rats decays with a half-life of approximately 6 hours. In vivo ACTH treatment of rats within 12 hours posthypophysectomy leads to regeneration of this capacity with little or no lag period. In vivo ACTH treatment of rats 24 hours posthypophysectomy leads to regeneration of this capacity with a lag period of 3 to 6 hours, indicating some unknown changes in the adrenals between 12 and 24 hours posthypophysectomy. With 36 hours posthypophysectomized rats, no regeneration of this capacity was observed for 24 hours of in vivo ACTH treatment. The regenerative effect of ACTH is blocked by actinomycin D but not by puromycin, indicating that an RNA factor is involved. It is postulated that this RNA is, or includes, the mRNA coding for the steroidogenic protein(s) reported by Garren and co-workers ((1965) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 53, 1443)."
https://openalex.org/W1655323234,"Abstract Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were recorded from single monoclinic crystals of bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase. Spectra were taken at various angles of rotation about the c (or blue optic) axis (Richardson, D. C., Bier, C. J., and Richardson, J. S. (1972), J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6368–6369) and about the a or b (green optic) axis of the crystal. Rotation about the blue axis (H in ab plane) yields the information that the Z components of all Cu(II) g tensors lie substantially in the ab plane, and this is confirmed by rotation about one of the green axes which yielded only very small Z component resonances (H in ac or bc plane). A maximum of eight hyperfine components were observed regardless of the orientation of the crystal. There appear to be two distinct groups of eight symmetrically degenerate (at least along their Z axes) Cu(II) ions, and the common Z axes of these two groups are off parallel by only a few degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1543970361,"Abstract Cell suspensions prepared from gonadotropin primed rabbit ovaries were characterized according to their ability to incorporate labeled acetate into the various intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis. The suspensions respond typically to luteinizing hormone (LH), with a reduction in labeled acetate incorporation into both esterified and non-esterified cholesterol. In contrast, radioactivity accumulated more rapidly and more extensively in lanosterol, as well as two unidentified sterols, in the LH-treated suspensions; squalene also demonstrates an enhanced labeled acetate concentration. LH does not affect the transport of acetate into the cells nor the incorporation of acetate into free fatty acids. Furthermore, other 27-carbon sterols are labeled to the same extent in the presence or absence of LH with the exception of 7-dehydrocholesterol, which, like cholesterol, was labeled to a lesser extent. Since these cell preparations have been shown to respond to LH with increased 14C-steroid hormone production, we conclude that the increased rate and extent of [14C]acetate accumulation into the sterols and squalene reflects an increased rate of synthesis of these compounds. The decrease of incorporation into certain 27-carbon sterols may result either from increased turnover of these intermediates or from exclusion of these sterols from the direct synthetic pathway to hormonal steroids. It does seem probable from these studies that LH stimulates steroidogenesis at sites prior to cholesterol synthesis in addition to its other sites of action."
