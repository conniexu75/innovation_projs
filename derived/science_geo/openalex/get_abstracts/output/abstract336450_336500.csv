https://openalex.org/W2058728873,"The analyses of two ice cores from a southern tropical ice cap provide a record of climatic conditions over 1000 years for a region where other proxy records are nearly absent. Annual variations in visible dust layers, oxygen isotopes, microparticle concentrations, conductivity, and identification of the historical (A.D. 1600) Huaynaputina ash permit accurate dating and time-scale verification. The fact that the Little Ice Age (about A.D. 1500 to 1900) stands out as a significant climatic event in the oxygen isotope and electrical conductivity records confirms the worldwide character of this event."
https://openalex.org/W2052894760,"Techniques for analyzing the structure and composition of solid surfaces with electron and photon beams often cause radiation damage in samples. Damage-producing processes compete with information-producing events during measurements, and beam damage can be a serious perturbation in quantitative surface analysis. There are, however, substantial benefits of electron- and photonstimulated damage processes for studying molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Direct information about the geometric structure of surface molecules can be obtained from measurements of the angular distributions of ions released by electron- or photon-stimulated desorption. The directions of ion emission are determined by the orientation of the surface bonds that are ruptured by beam irradiation. Moreover, photon-stimulated desorption studies that make use of synchrotron radiation reveal the fundamental electronic excitations that lead to bondbreaking processes at surfaces. These measurements provide new insights into radiation-damage processes in areas as diverse as x-ray optics and semiconductor electronics."
https://openalex.org/W2066359159,"Electronic materials and devices corrode in the same ways as automobiles, bridges, and pipelines, but their typically small dimensions make them orders of magnitude more susceptible to corrosion failure. As elsewhere, the corrosion involves interactions with the environment. Under control, these interactions can be put to use, as in the formation of protective and functional oxide films for superconducting devices. Otherwise, they cause damage, as in the electrolytic dissolution of conductors, even gold, in the presence of humidity and ionic contamination from atmospheric particles and gases. Preventing corrosion entails identifying the damaging interactions and excluding species that allow them to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1968791722,"Microemulsions, which are optically transparent oil-water dispersions, were produced by mixing hexadecane, hexanol, potassium oleate, and water. As the amount of water is increased, the microemulsion exhibits a clear to turbid to clear transition. In contrast to the clear regions, the turbid region possesses birefringence. The development of birefringence is also accompanied by a sharp decrease in the electrical resistance. The high-resolution (220 megacycle) nuclear magnetic resonance data suggest that water exists in two distinct molecular environments in the birefringent region; the first environment is characterized by relatively less mobile water molecules than oil molecules, whereas in the second environment oil molecules are less mobile than water molecules. The electrical, birefringence, and nuclear magnetic resonance data are in agreement with the proposed mechanism of change in the structure of water from water spheres to water cylinders to water lamellae. The chemical shift of water protons suggests that the molecular environment of water in spheres is different from that of water in cylinders or that of water in lamellae."

https://openalex.org/W2014197186,"The magnetic properties of surfaces are now being explored with electron spectroscopies that use electron spin polarization techniques. The increased activity in surface magnetic measurements with polarized electron beams is spurred by new scientific and technological challenges and is made feasible by recent advances in the technology of sources and detectors of polarized electrons. The ability to grow thin films and to engineer artificial structures permits new phenomena to be investigated at magnetic surfaces and interfaces. For such investigations, spin-polarized electron techniques-such as polarized electron scattering, polarized photoemission, polarized Auger spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis-have been and will probably continue to be used to great advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2047574019,"Cratering flow calculations for a series of oblique to normal (10 degrees to 90 degrees ) impacts of silicate projectiles onto a silicate halfspace were carried out to determine whether or not the gas produced upon shock-vaporizing both projectile and target material would form a downstream jet that could entrain and propel SNC meteorites from the Martian surface. The difficult constraints that the impact origin hypothesis for SNC meteorites has to satisfy are that these meteorites are lightly to moderately shocked and yet have been accelerated to speeds in excess of the Martian escape velocity (more than 5 kilometers per second). Two-dimensional finite difference calculations were performed that show that at highly probable impact velocities (7.5 kilometers per second), vapor plume jets are produced at oblique impact angles of 25 degrees to 60 degrees and have speeds as great as 20 kilometers per second. These plumes flow nearly parallel to the planetary surface. It is shown that upon impact of projectiles having radii of 0.1 to 1 kilometer, the resulting vapor jets have densities of 0.1 to 1 gram per cubic centimeter. These jets can entrain Martian surface rocks and accelerate them to velocities greater than 5 kilometers per second. This mechanism may launch SNC meteorites to earth."

Such phonons, which play an important role in thermal energy transpor and nonradiative recombination processes, can be used as sensitive microscopic probes of electronic, defect, and interface states. Experiments on phonon transmission thrugh epitaxially grown bulk material as well as thin-film superlattice structures in the semiconductor gallium arsenide are described. Such thin-film periodic structures can be used to build frequency-selective phonon filters and reflectors, which can in turn be used to manipulate phonon diagnostic beams in technologically important materials."
https://openalex.org/W2009006108,"Laboratory experiments that subjected soil to repeated freeze-thaw cycles in an inclined container revealed every process of solifluction, especially of frost creep. Multiple slope-angle effects on the amount of particle movement on the soil surface in every cycle are interpreted by several characteristic processes of frost creep. Gelifluction was found to occur in thicker layers of soil, owing to the excess water retained in soil after thawing. For further development of the problem, a similarity law for the model experiment was derived from thermal considerations."
https://openalex.org/W2011076253,"The termination of a solid induces changes in the locations of the outermost atoms of the solid. The changes can be minor or as dramatic as the rearrangement of the atoms into a different crystallographic group. Surface crystallography studies have determined that all surfaces are altered by forces induced at the solid-vacuum interface. At the least, the outermost atomic layers are displaced away from positions that they would have had in the bulk environment. Results from experimental and theoretical investigations for the Al(110) surface are discussed to illustrate present understanding of the surface atomic displacements. Some effects that the truncation- induced forces have on the surfaces of binary metal alloys are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2027905353,"Total carbon in the Apollo 12 sample 12023 fines was 110 micrograms per gram of sample with a carbon isotopic abundance δ13C (relative to the Pee Dee belemnite standard) of +12 per mil. Hydrolysis of the fines with deuterium chloride yielded undeuterated methane along with deuterated hydrocarbons, thus confirming the presence of 7 to 21 micrograms of carbon per gram of sample as carbide and about 2 micrograms of carbon per gram of sample as indigenous methane. After vacuum pyrolysis of the fines to 1100°C the following gases were detected in the relative abundance: carbon monoxide ⪢ carbon dioxide > methane. Variations of the δ13C value with the pyrolysis temperature indicated the presence of carbon with more than one range of isotopic values. The observed δ13C value of +14 per mil for lunar carbide is much higher than that of carbide in meteorites. These results suggest that lunar carbide is either indigenous to the moon or a meteoritic contribution that has been highly fractionated isotopically."

https://openalex.org/W1994499267,"Three crystalline phases of xenon hexafluoride are based on tetrameric association of XeF(5)(+) and F(-) ions into eight-membered rings. Phase I (monoclinic, 8 XeF(6) units per cell) transforms at approximately 10 degrees C to phase II (orthorhombic, 16 XeF(6) units per cell), which in turn transforms at approximately -25 degrees C to phase 111 (monoclinic, 64 XeF(6) units per doubly primitive cell). The transformation from phase I to phase II requires gross reorientation of half of the tetramers in the structure. The transformation from phase II to phase III involves only an ordering of right-handed and left-handed configurations."

https://openalex.org/W2047994754,Collapse craters formed in terrestrial basalt flows exhibit size-frequency distributions that are similar to distributions for craters located in terraces in the inner wall of the lunar crater Copernicus. These distributions and surface morphology suggest that the interior terraces are basalt lava flows containing collapse craters as well as impact craters.

https://openalex.org/W2010767649,"Abstract Objective To evaluate the association between US state policies that establish age 18 or 21 years as the minimum purchaser age for the sale of handguns and adolescent suicide rate. Design Regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences analyses. Setting 46 US states without policy changes between 2001 and 2017; Missouri and South Carolina, which lowered the age for handgun sales in 2007 and 2008, respectively; and West Virginia and Wyoming, which increased the age for handgun sales in 2010. Participants Adolescents aged 13 to 20 years(554 461 961 from 2001 to 2017) in the regression discontinuity analysis, and adolescents aged 18 to 20 years (168 934 041 from 2002 to 2014) in the main difference-in-differences analysis. Main outcome measure Suicide rate per 100 000 adolescents. Results In the regression discontinuity analysis, state policies that limited the sale of handguns to those aged 18 or older (relative to 21 or older) were associated with an increase in suicide rate among adolescents aged 18 to 20 years equivalent to 344 additional suicides in each state where they were in place between 2001 and 2017. In the difference-in-differences analysis, state policies that limited the sale of handguns to those aged 21 or older were associated with 1.91 fewer suicides per 100 000 adolescents aged 18 to 20 years (95% confidence interval −3.13 to −0.70, permutation adjusted P=0.025). In the difference-in-differences analysis, there were 1.83 fewer firearm related suicides per 100 000 adolescents (−2.66 to −1.00, permutation adjusted P=0.002), with no association between age 21 handgun sales policies and non-firearm related suicides. Separate event study estimates indicated increases in suicide rates in states that lowered the age of handgun sales, with no association in states that increased the age of handgun sales. Conclusions A clear discontinuity was shown in the suicide rate by age at age 18 in states that limited the sale of handguns to individuals aged 18 or older. State policies to limit the sale of handguns to individuals aged 21 or older were associated with a reduction in suicide rates among adolescents. Increases in suicide rates were observed after states lowered the age of handgun sales, but no effect was found in states that increased the age of handgun sales."
https://openalex.org/W2069761302,"A troilite-rich nickel-iron particle (""mini-moon"") recovered from the moon may be a mound detached from a sphere of silicate glass. Erosion and pitting of the particle may have been caused by passage through a cloud of hot gas and particulate matter formed by meteorite impact on the lunar surface. This explanation is in contrast to the theory that the particle was meteoritically derived molten material that was furrowed during solidification after lunar impact, subsequently pitted by high-velocity particles, and then abraded and polished by drifting dust while on the lunar surface."
