https://openalex.org/W2041885277,"The net inputs of silicic acid (dissolved silica) to the world ocean have been revised to 6.1 +/- 2.0 teramoles of silicon per year (1 teramole = 10(12) moles). The major contribution (about 80 percent) comes from rivers, whose world average silicic acid concentration is 150 micromolar. These inputs are reasonably balanced by the net ouputs of biogenic silica of 7.1 +/- 1.8 teramoles of silicon per year in modern marine sediments. The gross production of biogenic silica (the transformation of dissolved silicate to particulate skeletal material) in surface waters was estimated to be 240 +/- 40 teramoles of silicon per year, and the preservation ratio (opal accumulation in sediment/gross production in surface waters) averages 3 percent. In the world ocean the residence time of silicon, relative to total biological uptake in surface waters, is about 400 years."
https://openalex.org/W2047602127,"The molecular-based magnetic materials Cs2MnII[VII(CN)6] (1) and (Et4N)0.5Mn1.25- [V(CN)5]⋅ ⋅2H2O (2) (where Et is ethyl) were prepared by the addition of manganese(II) triflate to aqueous solutions of the hexacyanovanadate(II) ion at 0°C. Whereas 1 crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice, 2 crystallizes in a noncubic space group. The cesium salt (1) has features characteristic of a three-dimensional ferrimagnet with a Néel transition at 125 kelvin. The tetraethylammonium salt (2) also behaves as a three-dimensional ferrimagnet with a Néel temperature of 230 kelvin; only two other molecular magnets have higher magnetic ordering temperatures. Saturation magnetization measurements indicate that in both compounds the VII and high-spin MnII centers are antiferromagnetically coupled. Both 1 and 2 exhibit hysteresis loops characteristic of soft magnets below their magnetic phase-transition temperatures. The high magnetic ordering temperatures of these cyano-bridged solids confirm that the incorporation of early transition elements into the lattice promotes stronger magnetic coupling by enhancing the backbonding into the cyanide π* orbitals."

The phytoalexins appear to be synthesized in subcellular inclusions within a host epidermal cell that is about to be penetrated by a fungus. This site-restricted synthesis suggests that the phytoalexin response occurs initially in the first cells that come under fungal attack and is not simply a response of cells that surround the original infection site.

No difference was seen in single-donor crosses. Male mating success can be strongly influenced by the environmental conditions of pollen-bearing plants, a factor overlooked in studies of plant reproductive biology and in standard quantitative genetic crossing designs, where effects of male parent are equated with heritable genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2078347784,"Spin ordering in the low-temperature magnetic phase is directly linked to the orientational ordering of C(60) molecules in organically doped fullerene derivatives. Electron spin resonance and alternating current susceptometry measurements on tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene-C(60) (TDAE-C(60)) (Curie temperature T(c) = 16 kelvin) show a direct coupling between spin and merohedral degrees of freedom. This coupling was experimentally demonstrated by showing that ordering the spins in the magnetic phase imprints a merohedral order on the solid or, conversely, that merohedrally ordering the C(60) molecules influences the spin order at low temperature. The merohedral disorder gives rise to a distribution of pi-lectron exchange interactions between spins on neighboring C(60) molecules, suggesting a microscopic origin for the observed spinglass behavior of the magnetic state."
https://openalex.org/W1988518537,"Seismic reflection data from the East Pacific Rise between 17 degrees 05' and 17 degrees 35'S image a magma lens that varies regularly in depth and width as ridge morphology changes, confirming the notion that axial morphology can be used to infer ridge magmatic state. However, at 17 degrees 26'S, where the ridge is locally shallow and broad, the magma lens is markedly shallower and wider than predicted from regional trends. In this area, submersible dives reveal recent volcanic eruptions. These observations indicate that it is where the width and depth of the magma chamber differ from regional trends, indicating an enhanced magmatic budget, that is diagnostic of current magmatism."
https://openalex.org/W2023216138,"Seismic models of global-scale lateral heterogeneity in the mantle show systematic differences below continents and oceans that are too large to be purely thermal in origin. An inversion of the geoid, based on a seismic model that includes viscous flow in the mantle, indicates that the differences beneath continents and oceans can be accounted for by differences in composition in the upper mantle superposed on mantle-wide thermal heterogeneities. The net continent-ocean density differences, integrated over depth, are small and cause only a low flux of mass and heat across the asthenosphere and mantle transition zone."

https://openalex.org/W2125818296,"Descriptions are given of the methods of separated and successive oscillatory fields and of the atomic hydrogen maser. Their applications to the precision spectroscopy of atoms and molecules are discussed along with specific examples of fundamental measurements best made with such devices. The applications of these methods to atomic clocks are discussed. Cesium-separated oscillatory fields atomic beam clocks are accurate to 10(-13), and hydrogen masers are stable for several hours to 10(-15). A discussion is given of fundamental experiments that require highly stable clocks, such as long-base-line radio astronomy, precise measurement of pulsar frequencies and stabilities, tests of relativity theories, and accurate navigation both on the earth and in outer space."
https://openalex.org/W2073727262,"The conformation of linear polymer chains trapped in a matrix of cross-linked polymer has been measured by neutron scattering. Three regimes were found depending on the length of the linear chain, Nl, with respect to the mesh size of the network, Nc. When Nc > Nl, the radius of gyration, Rg, of the linear chain is the same as that observed in the uncrosslinked melt. When Nc < Nl, Rg shrinks according to the scaling relation Rg–1 ∼Nc–1 that has been predicted for isolated polymer chains trapped in a field of random obstacles. When Nc << Nl the linear chains are observed to segregate."

https://openalex.org/W2067355322,"Thomas Karl and his colleagues at the National Climatic Data Center in NC have found indications that the US climate has turned toward a greenhouse regime in the past 15 years. By combining data on summer droughts, wet winters, drenching rainstorms, and other weather extreams, expected to grow more common in a warmer climate, the researchers have developed a Greenhouse Climate Response Index. This short article describes the Index and comments of other scientists about its ability to predict Greenhouse responses."

The controversy stems from reports that the NAS Radioactive Waste Management Board has ordered on the environmental and geological characteristics of proposed dump sites in Nevada, California and New York. Concerns have arisen and are being debated in Congress over the impartiality of the Board and its individual members."
