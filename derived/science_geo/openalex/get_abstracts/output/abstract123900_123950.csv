https://openalex.org/W2053704719,"Putative endothelial cell (EC) progenitors or angioblasts were isolated from human peripheral blood by magnetic bead selection on the basis of cell surface antigen expression. In vitro, these cells differentiated into ECs. In animal models of ischemia, heterologous, homologous, and autologous EC progenitors incorporated into sites of active angiogenesis. These findings suggest that EC progenitors may be useful for augmenting collateral vessel growth to ischemic tissues (therapeutic angiogenesis) and for delivering anti- or pro-angiogenic agents, respectively, to sites of pathologic or utilitarian angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2010142606,"The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) is a G protein–coupled, seven-transmembrane receptor expressed in the brain. Inactivation of this receptor by gene targeting results in mice that develop a maturity onset obesity syndrome associated with hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. This syndrome recapitulates several of the characteristic features of the agouti obesity syndrome, which results from ectopic expression of agouti protein, a pigmentation factor normally expressed in the skin. Our data identify a novel signaling pathway in the mouse for body weight regulation and support a model in which the primary mechanism by which agouti induces obesity is chronic antagonism of the MC4-R."

https://openalex.org/W2128928858,"The Arabidopsis NPR1 gene controls the onset of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a plant immunity, to a broad spectrum of pathogens that is normally established after a primary exposure to avirulent pathogens. Mutants with defects in NPR1 fail to respond to various SAR-inducing treatments, displaying little expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and exhibiting increased susceptibility to infections. NPR1 was cloned using a map-based approach and was found to encode a novel protein containing ankyrin repeats. The lesion in one npr1 mutant allele disrupted the ankyrin consensus sequence, suggesting that these repeats are important for NPR1 function. Furthermore, transformation of the cloned wild-type NPR1 gene into npr1 mutants not only complemented the mutations, restoring the responsiveness to SAR induction with respect to PR-gene expression and resistance to infections, but also rendered the transgenic plants more resistant to infection by P. syringae in the absence of SAR induction."
https://openalex.org/W2076020247,"Cancers of the microsatellite mutator phenotype (MMP) show exaggerated genomic instability at simple repeat sequences. More than 50 percent (21 out of 41) of human MMP + colon adenocarcinomas examined were found to have frameshift mutations in a tract of eight deoxyguanosines [(G) 8 ] within BAX , a gene that promotes apoptosis. These mutations were absent in MMP − tumors and were significantly less frequent in (G) 8 repeats from other genes. Frameshift mutations were present in both BAX alleles in some MMP + colon tumor cell lines and in primary tumors. These results suggest that inactivating BAX mutations are selected for during the progression of colorectal MMP + tumors and that the wild-type BAX gene plays a suppressor role in a p53-independent pathway for colorectal carcinogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2160912589,"To move forward, migrating cells must generate traction forces through surface receptors bound to extracellular matrix molecules coupled to a rigid structure. We investigated whether cells sample and respond to the rigidity of the anchoring matrix. Movement of beads coated with fibronectin or an anti-integrin antibody was restrained with an optical trap on fibroblasts to mimic extracellular attachment sites of different resistance. Cells precisely sense the restraining force on fibronectin beads and respond by a localized, proportional strengthening of the cytoskeleton linkages, allowing stronger force to be exerted on the integrins. This strengthening was absent or transient with antibody beads, but restored with soluble fibronectin. Hence, ligand binding site occupancy was required. Finally, phenylarsine oxide inhibited strengthening of cytoskeletal linkages, indicating a role for dephosphorylation. Thus, the strength of integrin–cytoskeleton linkages is dependent on matrix rigidity and on its biochemical composition. Matrix rigidity may, therefore, serve as a guidance cue in a process of mechanotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1981243923,"We have found that the mammalian Ran GTPase–activating protein RanGAP1 is highly concentrated at the cytoplasmic periphery of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), where it associates with the 358-kDa Ran–GTP-binding protein RanBP2. This interaction requires the ATP-dependent posttranslational conjugation of RanGAP1 with SUMO-1 (for small ubiquitin-related modifier), a novel protein of 101 amino acids that contains low but significant homology to ubiquitin. SUMO-1 appears to represent the prototype for a novel family of ubiquitin-related protein modifiers. Inhibition of nuclear protein import resulting from antibodies directed at NPC-associated RanGAP1 cannot be overcome by soluble cytosolic RanGAP1, indicating that GTP hydrolysis by Ran at RanBP2 is required for nuclear protein import."
https://openalex.org/W1986152436,"The precise role played by HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in HIV infection remains controversial. Despite strong CTL responses being generated during the asymptomatic phase, the virus persists and AIDS ultimately develops. It has been argued that the virus is so variable, and the virus turnover so great that escape from CTL recognition would occur continually, but so far there is limited evidence for CTL escape. The opposing argument is that evidence for CTL escape is present but hard to find because multiple anti-HIV immune responses are acting simultaneously during the asymptomatic phase of infection. We describe six donors who make a strong CTL response to an immunodominant HLA-B27-restricted epitope. In the two donors who progressed to AIDS, CTL escape to fixation by the same mutation was observed, but only after 9–12 years of epitope stability. CTL escape may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection."

Similar results were obtained for two other α-methyl amino acids, isovaline and α-methylnorvaline, although the α hydrogen analogs of these amino acids, α-amino- n -butyric acid and norvaline, were found to be racemates. With the exception of α-amino- n -butyric acid, these amino acids are either unknown or of limited occurrence in the biosphere. Because carbonaceous chondrites formed 4.5 billion years ago, the results are indicative of an asymmetric influence on organic chemical evolution before the origin of life."
https://openalex.org/W2035499819,"The telomerase ribonucleoprotein catalyzes the addition of new telomeres onto chromosome ends. A gene encoding a mammalian telomerase homolog called TP1 (telomerase-associated protein 1) was identified and cloned. TP1 exhibited extensive amino acid similarity to the Tetrahymena telomerase protein p80 and was shown to interact specifically with mammalian telomerase RNA. Antiserum to TP1 immunoprecipitated telomerase activity from cell extracts, suggesting that TP1 is associated with telomerase in vivo. The identification of TP1 suggests that telomerase-associated proteins are conserved from ciliates to humans."
https://openalex.org/W1514099677,"The mechanisms responsible for thyrocyte destruction in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) are poorly understood. Thyrocytes from HT glands, but not from nonautoimmune thyroids, expressed Fas. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), abundantly produced in HT glands, induced Fas expression in normal thyrocytes, and cross-linking of Fas resulted in massive thyrocyte apoptosis. The ligand for Fas (FasL) was shown to be constitutively expressed both in normal and HT thyrocytes and was able to kill Fas-sensitive targets. Exposure to IL-1β induced thyrocyte apoptosis, which was prevented by antibodies that block Fas, suggesting that IL-1β-induced Fas expression serves as a limiting factor for thyrocyte destruction. Thus, Fas-FasL interactions among HT thyrocytes may contribute to clinical hypothyroidism."

These NK-like T cells are thus thought to be important for the initiation of type 2 T helper cell (TH2) responses. CD1-deficient mice were found to lack this lymphocyte subset, but they could nevertheless mount a protypical TH2 response; after immunization with antibody to immunoglobulin D (IgD), CD1-deficient mice produced IgE. Thus, although dependent on CD1 for their development, IL-4-secreting NK-like T cells are not required for TH2 responses."
https://openalex.org/W2079753076,"An analysis of historical sea surface temperatures provides evidence for global warming since 1900, in line with land-based analyses of global temperature trends, and also shows that over the same period, the eastern equatorial Pacific cooled and the zonal sea surface temperature gradient strengthened. Recent theoretical studies have predicted such a pattern as a response of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system to an exogenous heating of the tropical atmosphere. This pattern, however, is not reproduced by the complex ocean-atmosphere circulation models currently used to simulate the climatic response to increased greenhouse gases. Its presence is likely to lessen the mean 20th-century global temperature change in model simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2052938585,"Organ xenografts under certain circumstances survive in the presence of anti-graft antibodies and complement, a situation referred to as “accommodation.” We find that the endothelial cells (ECs) in hamster hearts that accommodate themselves in rats express genes, such as A20 and bcl-2, that in vitro protect ECs from apoptosis and prevent upregulation in those cells of proinflammatory genes such as cytokines, procoagulant and adhesion molecules. Hearts that are rejected do not express these genes. In addition, vessels of rejected hearts show florid transplant arteriosclerosis whereas those of accommodated hearts do not. Accommodated xenografts have an ongoing T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine immune response, whereas the rejected grafts have a Th1 response. We propose a model for factors that contribute to the survival of xenografts and the avoidance of transplant arteriosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2031434137,"A proposed mechanism for sorting secretory proteins into granules for release via the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine-neuroendocrine cells involves binding the proteins to a sorting receptor at the trans-Golgi network, followed by budding and granule formation. We have identified such a sorting receptor as membrane-associated carboxypeptidase E (CPE) in pituitary Golgi-enriched and secretory granule membranes. CPE specifically bound regulated secretory pathway proteins, including prohormones, but not constitutively secreted proteins. We show that in the Cpefat mutant mouse lacking CPE, the pituitary prohormone, pro-opiomelanocortin, was missorted to the constitutive pathway and secreted in an unregulated manner. Thus, obliteration of CPE, the sorting receptor, leads to multiple endocrine disorders in these genetically defective mice, including hyperproinsulinemia and infertility."

S phase nuclei or an S phase nuclear extract are required for the initiation of semiconservative DNA replication in G1 nuclei but not for elongation in S phase nuclei. S phase nuclear extract could be replaced by recombinant human cyclins A and E complexed to Cdk2 but not by Cdk2 alone or by human cyclin B1 complexed to Cdc2. In S phase cytosol, cyclins A/Cdk2 and E/Cdk2 triggered initiation synergistically."
https://openalex.org/W2093364468,"Intracellular Ca2+ store depletion induces Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, allowing the store to recharge. In our experiments, Ca2+ stores in pancreatic acinar cells were depleted by acetylcholine (ACh) stimulation in Ca2+-free solution. Thereafter, Ca2+ entry was only allowed through a CaCl2-containing pipette attached to the basal membrane. Recharging intracellular Ca2+ stores via a patch pipette occurred without a rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and depended on the operation of a thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pump. After a period of focal Ca2+ entry, ACh could again evoke a rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, and this rise always started in the apical secretory pole. Recharging the apical Ca2+ store therefore depends on Ca2+ flow through a tunnel from the basal to the secretory pole, and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump is essential for this process."

Using electron cryomicroscopy and angular reconstitution, structures at 20 Å resolution were obtained, which, when compared with our earlier reconstruction of “empty” ribosomes, showed densities corresponding to tRNA molecules—at the P and E sites for posttranslocational ribosomes and at the A and P sites for pretranslocational ribosomes. The P-site tRNA lies directly above the bridge connecting the two ribosomal subunits, with the A-site tRNA fitted snugly against it at an angle of ∼50°, toward the L7/L12 side of the ribosome. The E-site tRNA appears to lie between the side lobe of the 30S subunit and the L1 protuberance."

https://openalex.org/W2025592993,"The RAG1 and RAG2 proteins initiate V(D)J recombination by making specific double-strand DNA breaks at recombination signal sequences. We show here that RAG1 and RAG2 bind specifically to this sequence, forming a stable protein–DNA complex. The complex requires the conserved heptamer and nonamer motifs of the recombination signal as well as both the RAG1 and RAG2 proteins. This complex is able to either nick or form hairpins at the V(D)J signal sequence, depending on the divalent cation present. A complex trapped using Ca2+ is subsequently active when transferred to Mg2+ or Mn2+. After cleavage, the complex is destabilized and the RAG proteins dissociate. We term this early precursor in the V(D)J recombination reaction a “stable cleavage complex.”"
https://openalex.org/W1968345646,"For the past decade the immune system has been exploited as a rich source of de novo catalysts. Catalytic antibodies have been shown to have chemoselectivity, enantioselectivity, large rate accelerations, and even an ability to reroute chemical reactions. In many instances catalysts have been made for reactions for which there are no known natural or man-made enzymes. Yet, the full power of this combinatorial system can only be exploited if there was a system that allows for the direct selection of a particular function. A method that allows for the direct chemical selection for catalysis from antibody libraries was so devised, whereby the positive aspects of hybridoma technology were preserved and re-formatted in the filamentous phage system to allow direct selection of catalysis. This methodology is based on a purely chemical selection process, making it more general than biologically based selection systems because it is not limited to reaction products that perturb cellular machinery."

Using defined components, the binding of ribonuclease B (RNase B) Man7-Man9 glycoforms to the luminal domain of calnexin was observed in vitro only if RNase B was monoglucosylated. Binding was independent of the conformation of the glycoprotein. Calnexin protected monoglucosylated RNase B from the action of glucosidase II and PNGase F but not from that of Endo H, which completely released the protein from calnexin. These observations directly demonstrate that calnexin can act exclusively as a lectin."

Redox titrations with molecular oxygen (O 2 ) and cobaltocene were carried out, and O 2 was found to bind irreversibly in a 1:1 ratio to the model compound. This O 2 adduct (a bridged peroxide) can be fully reduced to the deoxygenated form with four equivalents of cobaltocene.

https://openalex.org/W2062634373,"The translocation of a secretory precursor protein across the ER membrane comprises three phases: docking of the precursor at the membrane, insertion into the translocation pore, and exit from the pore into the ER lumen. We demonstrate that Sec62p, Sec71p and Sec72p form a translocon subcomplex that engages secretory precursors at the membrane site of the ER translocation machinery. Binding of a precursor to the subcomplex depends on the presence of an intact signal sequence and occurs only in the absence of ATP. In the presence of ATP, the precursor is released from the subcomplex in a reaction mediated by the lumenal hsp70, BiP. This release reaction, which is specific to BiP and requires interaction between BiP and the DnaJ homolog Sec63p, defines a role for BiP and Sec63p early in the ER translocation process."

In the present study, we examined the effect of antisense S100A4 RNA on metastatic potential of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells. High-metastatic A11 cells were transfected with the expression vector containing S100A4 cDNA in an inverted (antisense) orientation under the transcriptional control of the mouse metallothionein promoter. Treatment of a stably transfected clone (AS10 cells) with Zn2+ resulted in the suppression of the experimental metastatic ability, which was accompanied with the expression of antisense S100A4 RNA and the suppression of the S100A4 expression at both the mRNA and the protein levels. To further confirm the effect of antisense S100A4 RNA, we established several clones after retroviral transduction with an antisense S100A4 construct. Notably, reduced metastatic potential was also evident in these clones. In the antisense S100A4 RNA-expressing cells, cell motility and in vitro invasiveness were found to be suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W2058271447,"Inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) by mutations or abnormal phosphorylation is a mechanism by which tumour cells can subdue normal growth control. Among molecules involved in control of pRB phosphorylation, cyclin D1 and E have been found to be deregulated and overexpressed in various types of cancers. In order to study the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer, we have analysed the protein expression of cyclin D1 and E in 114 tumour specimens from patients with primary breast cancer using Western blotting. Twenty-five out of 34 tumours with overexpression of cyclin E showed uniform low cyclin D1 expression, and by immunohistochemical analysis of pRB we present evidence for the existence of pRB defects in approximately 40% of these tumours in contrast to no pRB defects in the other group of tumours. This result was supported by a high protein expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 in 44% of the tumours with high cyclin E and low D1 expression, and all immunohistochemical pRB defect tumours showed a high p16 protein level. Additionally, an abnormal low pRB phosphorylation in relation to a high proliferative activity and loss of heterozygosity of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene locus were found in all but one tumour with immunohistochemical defect pRB. Interestingly, tumours with high cyclin E and low D1 expression were generally oestrogen receptor negative suggesting a role for cell cycle regulators in the mechanisms leading to oestrogen independent tumour growth. Furthermore, the prognosis differed markedly for the patients in the various groups of tumours, indicating that the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer pathogenesis and the clinical course in part could be explained by different and distinctive sets of cell cycle defects."
https://openalex.org/W2088805118,"oxR is a [2Fe-2S] transcription factor triggered by oxidative stress and activated in vitro by one-electron oxidation or assembly of the iron–sulfur centers. To distinguish which mechanism operates in cells, we studied constitutively active SoxR (SoxRc) proteins. Three SoxRc proteins contained [2Fe-2S] centers required for in vitro transcription and, like wild-type SoxR, were inactivated by chemical reduction. However, in vivo spectroscopy showed that even without oxidative stress, the three SoxRc proteins failed to accumulate with reduced [2Fe-2S] (≤4% compared to ≥40% for wild type). One SoxRc protein had a redox potential 65 mV lower than wild type, consistent with its accumulation in the oxidized (activated) form in vivo. These results link in vitro and in vivo approaches showing novel redox regulation that couples an iron–sulfur oxidation state to promoter activation."
https://openalex.org/W2330248224,"2-Methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2) treatment caused significant growth inhibition of H460 and A549 human lung cancer cell lines which contain wild-type p53. However, 2-MeOE2 had a little effect on the p53 negative H358 and p53 mutated H322 cell lines. Western blot analysis indicated that 2-MeOE2 treatment resulted in an eightfold increase in the endogenous wild-type p53 protein, while the level of the mutant p53 protein remained unchanged. TdT staining indicated that following 2-MeOE2-mediated increases in wildtype p53 protein, cells bypass the G1-S checkpoint of the cell cycle with 30 to 40% undergoing apoptosis. Introduction of anti-sense wt-p53 into wt-p53 cells abrogated the 2-MeOE2 effect. A significant portion of lung cancer retains the wild-type p53 gene therefore, 2-MeOE2 may have therapeutic application."
https://openalex.org/W2079812974,"Posttetanic potentiation (PTP) is a common form of short-term synaptic plasticity that is generally thought to be entirely presynaptic. Consistent with that idea, PTP of evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials at Aplysia sensory-motor neuron synapses in cell culture was reduced by presynaptic injection of a slow calcium chelator and was accompanied by an increase in the frequency but not the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials. However, PTP was also reduced by postsynaptic injection of a rapid calcium chelator or postsynaptic hyperpolarization. Thus, PTP at these synapses is likely to involve a postsynaptic induction mechanism in addition to the known presynaptic mechanisms."

The predicted product of TEL harbours an amino acid region similar to the ETS DNA binding domain. We now report the isolation of the murine TEL cDNA and the characterization of the human TEL proteins. Human and murine TEL proteins are particularly homologous within their aminoterminal regions and their ETS domains. TEL proteins are nuclear and display specific DNA binding activity toward classical ETS binding sites. In addition, we show that TEL mRNAs initiate translation at either of the two first inframe ATGs (codon 1 and 43) to encode 50 kDa and 57 kDa TEL proteins. In vivo, each of these primary translational products is modified by multiple phosphorylation events."
https://openalex.org/W2036667886,"The 357 amino acid open reading frame 1 (ORF-1), also designated DR7, within the SalI-L fragment of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) exhibited transactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and increased HIV-1 replication (Kashanchi et al., Virology, 201, 95 – 106, 1994). In the current study, the SalI-L transforming region was localized to the SalI-L-SH subfragment. Several ORFs identified in SalI-L-SH by sequence analysis were cloned into a selectable mammalian expression vector, pBK-CMV. Only pBK/ORF1 transformed NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, cells expressing ORF-1 protein produced fibrosarcomas when injected into nude mice, whereas control cells, expressing either no ORF-1 protein or C-terminal truncated (after residue 172) ORF-1 protein, were not tumorigenic. Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from the tumors revealed ORF-1 protein. Additional studies indicated that ORF-1 was expressed in HHV-6-infected human T-cells by 18 h. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ORF-1 protein bound to tumor suppressor protein p53, and the ORF-1 binding domain on p53 was located between residues 28 and 187 of p53, overlapping with the specific DNA binding domain. Functional studies showed that p53-activated transcription was inhibited in ORF-1, but not in truncated ORF-1, expressing cells. Importantly, the truncated ORF-1 mutant also failed to cause transformation. Analysis of several human tumors by PCR revealed ORF-1 DNA sequences in some angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathies, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and glioblastomas. The detection of ORF-1 sequences in human tumors, while not proof per se, is a prerequisite for establishing its role in tumor development. Taken together, the results demonstrate that ORF-1 is an HHV-6 oncogene that binds to and affects p53. The identification of both transforming and transactivating activities within ORF-1 is a characteristic of other viral oncogenes and is the first reported for HHV-6."
https://openalex.org/W2314374552,"Growth factors and growth factor receptors are involved in tumor progression. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene encodes distinct isoforms. The isoforms which bind KGF (keratinocyte growth factor or FGF-7) are called KGF-R or FGFR2b. KGF-R is expressed in different epithelia and is involved in the control of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Expression of KGF-R mRNA was examined in normal human bladder and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCC) by semi-quantitative RT – PCR using TFIID and GAPDH as internal standards. In normal bladder, the KGF-R mRNA was detected in the urothelium but not in the underlying stroma. In TCCs, the level of KGF-R mRNA was generally either normal or low. Eighteen out of 54 TCCs had a KGF-R mRNA level below 30% of that found in normal urothelium. This decrease in KGF-R mRNA was not accompanied by an increase in BEK (FGFR2c) mRNA, the other major splice variant of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene. Expression of the KGF-R was also monitored by immunohistochemistry using a functional KGF-immunoglobulin chimera. The receptor was uniformly expressed throughout the normal urothelium except for the umbrella cells. Immunoreactivity for KGF-R was found to be negative in tumors with low levels of KGF-R mRNA, while the peritumoral normal urothelium was positive. Among patients with muscle invasive tumors, those exhibiting a low level of KGF-R mRNA had a significantly higher proportion of cancer deaths. Our results suggest that decreased expression of KGF-R can be considered as a marker of tumor progression in muscle invasive TCCs."

No site of consistent LOH was identified on chromosome 10. Five regions of LOH were contained within bands q22-24 of chromosome 11 for which nearly 50% of the tumors had LOH at at least one marker. This region is thus a major site of deletion in breast cancer and several tumor suppressor genes seem to be involved. One of them may be the ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) gene which is located in one of the affected regions. Five regions of LOH, one of which is within the BRCA1 gene area, were recognized along chromosome 17. LOH at three of these regions were found in highly proliferative tumors. When combined with a previous study of chromosome 13 with emphasis on BRCA2 and Rb1 genes, this work allowed to distinguish a total of 12 regions of LOH, variably affected in breast tumors and correlated with prognostic parameters."

Details of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this leukemia are unclear at present. In other malignancies tumorigenesis has been shown to proceed via a multistep progression model with a causal relation between the accumulation of genetic abnormalities and more aggressive clinical behavior. The loss of chromosomal segments in malignant cells has proven useful in mapping regions of DNA that contain candidate tumor suppressor genes. The detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been greatly facilitated by the analysis of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers enabling the identification of submicroscopic losses. Utilizing immunomagnetic bead sorting to separate leukemic from normal cells we identified at least one allelic losses in 8/29 (28%) of analysed CLL cases with a PCR-based assay. On chromosomal arm 3p we have identified homozygous deletions in 3/29 cases at locus D3S1284 residing in the vicinity of the newly described FHIT gene. Several cases of CLL manifested LOH at a locus telomeric to the p15 and p16 tumor suppressor genes, all being early to intermediate stage disease. Our findings suggest that losses at these loci may contribute to the development and/or progression of CLL in at least a subset of cases."
