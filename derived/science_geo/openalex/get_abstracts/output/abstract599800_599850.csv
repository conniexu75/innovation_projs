https://openalex.org/W2769517706,"A pathway for the production of aromatic amino acid metabolites in Clostridium sporogenes is described; modulation of serum levels of these metabolites in gnotobiotic mice affects intestinal permeability and systemic immunity. The human microbiome has a substantial effect on our health. Our gut microbes produce a range of small molecules, many of which can reach relevant concentrations, yet we know surprisingly little about microbial metabolic pathways and how they affect the host. Here, Justin Sonnenburg, Michael Fischbach and colleagues use genetics and metabolic profiling to identify the gene cluster of Clostridium sporogenes that metabolizes aromatic amino acids, several of the products of which are produced exclusively by the microbiota. For example, the neuroprotective agent indolepropionic acid (IPA) was also produced by several other gut bacteria. In mice with controlled bacterial colonies, the serum levels of IPA and host physiology can be modulated by genetic modification of C. sporogenes. The human gut microbiota produces dozens of metabolites that accumulate in the bloodstream1,2, where they can have systemic effects on the host. Although these small molecules commonly reach concentrations similar to those achieved by pharmaceutical agents, remarkably little is known about the microbial metabolic pathways that produce them. Here we use a combination of genetics and metabolic profiling to characterize a pathway from the gut symbiont Clostridium sporogenes that generates aromatic amino acid metabolites. Our results reveal that this pathway produces twelve compounds, nine of which are known to accumulate in host serum. All three aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine) serve as substrates for the pathway, and it involves branching and alternative reductases for specific intermediates. By genetically manipulating C. sporogenes, we modulate serum levels of these metabolites in gnotobiotic mice, and show that in turn this affects intestinal permeability and systemic immunity. This work has the potential to provide the basis of a systematic effort to engineer the molecular output of the gut bacterial community."
https://openalex.org/W2770709665,"Environmental nutrient levels impact cancer cell metabolism, resulting in context-dependent gene essentiality. Here, using loss-of-function screening based on RNA interference, we show that environmental oxygen levels are a major driver of differential essentiality between in vitro model systems and in vivo tumours. Above the 3-8% oxygen concentration typical of most tissues, we find that cancer cells depend on high levels of the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthetic enzyme NFS1. Mammary or subcutaneous tumours grow despite suppression of NFS1, whereas metastatic or primary lung tumours do not. Consistent with a role in surviving the high oxygen environment of incipient lung tumours, NFS1 lies in a region of genomic amplification present in lung adenocarcinoma and is most highly expressed in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. NFS1 activity is particularly important for maintaining the iron-sulfur co-factors present in multiple cell-essential proteins upon exposure to oxygen compared to other forms of oxidative damage. Furthermore, insufficient iron-sulfur cluster maintenance robustly activates the iron-starvation response and, in combination with inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis, triggers ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death. Suppression of NFS1 cooperates with inhibition of cysteine transport to trigger ferroptosis in vitro and slow tumour growth. Therefore, lung adenocarcinomas select for expression of a pathway that confers resistance to high oxygen tension and protects cells from undergoing ferroptosis in response to oxidative damage."

https://openalex.org/W2768426391,"Using a ligand as a promoter enhances the reactivity of the palladium catalyst in non-directed C–H functionalization of arenes, enabling the arene to be used as the limiting reagent. The functionalization of a carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bond is one of the most useful reactions in organic synthesis as it precludes the need to install reactive groups to perform a reaction. However, the reactivity and number of C–H bonds that are present in organic molecules mean that selectively targeting one is challenging. Typically this has been achieved by 'directing groups', where proximity to a specific C–H bond guides the reaction. Now, Jin-Quan Yu and colleagues report a palladium-catalysed non-directed arene C–H functionalization method using a 2-pyridone ligand. The ligand makes the catalyst more reactive, allowing the arene to be used as the limiting reagent—overcoming a key limitation in the use of such reactions in the derivatization of complex molecules. The ligand also enhances the effects of sterics on site selectivity, in some cases improving it significantly without the need for a directing group. The directed activation of carbon–hydrogen bonds (C–H) is important in the development of synthetically useful reactions, owing to the proximity-induced reactivity and selectivity that is enabled by coordinating functional groups1,2,3,4,5,6. Palladium-catalysed non-directed C–H activation could potentially enable further useful reactions, because it can reach more distant sites and be applied to substrates that do not contain appropriate directing groups; however, its development has faced substantial challenges associated with the lack of sufficiently active palladium catalysts7,8. Currently used palladium catalysts are reactive only with electron-rich arenes, unless an excess of arene is used9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, which limits synthetic applications. Here we report a 2-pyridone ligand that binds to palladium and accelerates non-directed C–H functionalization with arene as the limiting reagent. This protocol is compatible with a broad range of aromatic substrates and we demonstrate direct functionalization of advanced synthetic intermediates, drug molecules and natural products that cannot be used in excessive quantities. We also developed C–H olefination and carboxylation protocols, demonstrating the applicability of our methodology to other transformations. The site selectivity in these transformations is governed by a combination of steric and electronic effects, with the pyridone ligand enhancing the influence of sterics on the selectivity, thus providing complementary selectivity to directed C–H functionalization."
https://openalex.org/W2770404833,"Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of yeast Rad26 bound to RNA polymerase II provides insight into the initiation of the transcription-coupled DNA repair mechanism in eukaryotes. Transcription-coupled DNA repair removes DNA lesions from the template strand that present obstacles to the translocation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The process is initiated by the recruitment of the Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein in humans—or the equivalent Rad26 in the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)—to the arrested polymerase complex. Here, Andres Leschziner, Dong Wang and colleagues have used cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of a complex of S. cerevisiae Rad26 bound to Pol II. Rad26 binds to DNA upstream of Pol II and causes marked bending of the DNA, and the Swi2/Snf2-family ATPase domain of Rad26 is proposed to promote forward movement of Pol II. The authors suggest a mechanistic model whereby Rad26 ensures transcription-coupled recognition of DNA lesions while also functioning as a transcription elongation factor. Eukaryotic transcription-coupled repair (TCR) is an important and well-conserved sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair that preferentially removes DNA lesions from the template strand that block translocation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)1,2. Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB, also known as ERCC6) protein in humans (or its yeast orthologues, Rad26 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhp26 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) is among the first proteins to be recruited to the lesion-arrested Pol II during the initiation of eukaryotic TCR1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Mutations in CSB are associated with the autosomal-recessive neurological disorder Cockayne syndrome, which is characterized by progeriod features, growth failure and photosensitivity1. The molecular mechanism of eukaryotic TCR initiation remains unclear, with several long-standing unanswered questions. How cells distinguish DNA lesion-arrested Pol II from other forms of arrested Pol II, the role of CSB in TCR initiation, and how CSB interacts with the arrested Pol II complex are all unknown. The lack of structures of CSB or the Pol II–CSB complex has hindered our ability to address these questions. Here we report the structure of the S. cerevisiae Pol II–Rad26 complex solved by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals that Rad26 binds to the DNA upstream of Pol II, where it markedly alters its path. Our structural and functional data suggest that the conserved Swi2/Snf2-family core ATPase domain promotes the forward movement of Pol II, and elucidate key roles for Rad26 in both TCR and transcription elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2770295104,"Lightning and thundercloud are the most dramatic natural particle accelerators on the Earth. Relativistic electrons accelerated by electric fields therein emit bremsstrahlung gamma rays, which have been detected at ground observations, by airborne detectors, and as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) from space. The energy of the gamma rays is sufficiently high to potentially invoke atmospheric photonuclear reactions 14N(gamma, n)13N, which would produce neutrons and eventually positrons via beta-plus decay of generated unstable radioactive isotopes, especially 13N. However, no clear observational evidence for the reaction has been reported to date. Here we report the first detection of neutron and positron signals from lightning with a ground observation. During a thunderstorm on 6 February 2017 in Japan, a TGF-like intense flash (within 1 ms) was detected at our monitoring sites 0.5-1.7 km away from the lightning. The subsequent initial burst quickly subsided with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 ms, followed by a prolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolt (MeV), lasting for a minute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 MeV of the initial emission are well explained with de-excitation gamma rays from the nuclei excited by neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line emission corresponds to the electron-positron annihilation, and hence is the conclusive indication of positrons produced after the lightning. Our detection of neutrons and positrons is unequivocal evidence that natural lightning triggers photonuclear reactions. No other natural event on the Earth is known to trigger photonuclear reactions. This discovery places lightning as only the second known natural channel on the Earth after the atmospheric cosmic-ray interaction, in which isotopes, such as 13C, 14C, and 15N, are produced."
https://openalex.org/W2768571303,"Neutrinos interact only very weakly, so they are extremely penetrating. The theoretical neutrino–nucleon interaction cross-section, however, increases with increasing neutrino energy, and neutrinos with energies above 40 teraelectronvolts (TeV) are expected to be absorbed as they pass through the Earth. Experimentally, the cross-section has been determined only at the relatively low energies (below 0.4 TeV) that are available at neutrino beams from accelerators1,2. Here we report a measurement of neutrino absorption by the Earth using a sample of 10,784 energetic upward-going neutrino-induced muons. The flux of high-energy neutrinos transiting long paths through the Earth is attenuated compared to a reference sample that follows shorter trajectories. Using a fit to the two-dimensional distribution of muon energy and zenith angle, we determine the neutrino–nucleon interaction cross-section for neutrino energies 6.3–980 TeV, more than an order of magnitude higher than previous measurements. The measured cross-section is about 1.3 times the prediction of the standard model3, consistent with the expectations for charged- and neutral-current interactions. We do not observe a large increase in the cross-section with neutrino energy, in contrast with the predictions of some theoretical models, including those invoking more compact spatial dimensions4 or the production of leptoquarks5. This cross-section measurement can be used to set limits on the existence of some hypothesized beyond-standard-model particles, including leptoquarks."
https://openalex.org/W2768449780,"Ultralow-velocity zones (ULVZs) at Earth's core-mantle boundary region have important implications for the chemical composition and thermal structure of our planet, but their origin has long been debated. Hydrogen-bearing iron peroxide (FeO2Hx) in the pyrite-type crystal structure was recently found to be stable under the conditions of the lowermost mantle. Using high-pressure experiments and theoretical calculations, we find that iron peroxide with a varying amount of hydrogen has a high density and high Poisson ratio as well as extremely low sound velocities consistent with ULVZs. Here we also report a reaction between iron and water at 86 gigapascals and 2,200 kelvin that produces FeO2Hx. This would provide a mechanism for generating the observed volume occupied by ULVZs through the reaction of about one-tenth the mass of Earth's ocean water in subducted hydrous minerals with the effectively unlimited reservoir of iron in Earth's core. Unlike other candidates for the composition of ULVZs, FeO2Hx synthesized from the superoxidation of iron by water would not require an extra transportation mechanism to migrate to the core-mantle boundary. These dense FeO2Hx-rich domains would be expected to form directly in the core-mantle boundary region and their properties would provide an explanation for the many enigmatic seismic features that are observed in ULVZs."
https://openalex.org/W2770673156,"Interfacing fundamentally different quantum systems is key to build future hybrid quantum networks. Such heterogeneous networks offer superior capabilities compared to their homogeneous counterparts as they merge individual advantages of disparate quantum nodes in a single network architecture. However, only very few investigations on optical hybrid-interconnections have been carried out due to the high fundamental and technological challenges, which involve e.g. wavelength and bandwidth matching of the interfacing photons. Here we report the first optical quantum interconnection between two disparate matter quantum systems with photon storage capabilities. We show that a quantum state can be faithfully transferred between a cold atomic ensemble and a rare-earth doped crystal via a single photon at telecommunication wavelength, using cascaded quantum frequency conversion. We first demonstrate that quantum correlations between a photon and a single collective spin excitation in the cold atomic ensemble can be transferred onto the solid-state system. We also show that single-photon time-bin qubits generated in the cold atomic ensemble can be converted, stored and retrieved from the crystal with a conditional qubit fidelity of more than $85\%$. Our results open prospects to optically connect quantum nodes with different capabilities and represent an important step towards the realization of large-scale hybrid quantum networks."
https://openalex.org/W2769910569,"Small, approximately 10-kilobase microhomology-mediated tandem duplications are abundant in the genomes of BRCA1-linked but not BRCA2-linked breast cancer. Here we define the mechanism underlying this rearrangement signature. We show that, in primary mammalian cells, BRCA1, but not BRCA2, suppresses the formation of tandem duplications at a site-specific chromosomal replication fork barrier imposed by the binding of Tus proteins to an array of Ter sites. BRCA1 has no equivalent role at chromosomal double-stranded DNA breaks, indicating that tandem duplications form specifically at stalled forks. Tandem duplications in BRCA1 mutant cells arise by a replication restart-bypass mechanism terminated by end joining or by microhomology-mediated template switching, the latter forming complex tandem duplication breakpoints. Solitary DNA ends form directly at Tus-Ter, implicating misrepair of these lesions in tandem duplication formation. Furthermore, BRCA1 inactivation is strongly associated with ~10 kilobase tandem duplications in ovarian cancer. This tandem duplicator phenotype may be a general signature of BRCA1-deficient cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2769518064,"Regular mindfulness practice benefits people both mentally and physically, but many populations who could benefit do not practice mindfulness. Virtual Reality (VR) is a new technology that helps capture participants’ attention and gives users the illusion of “being there” in the 3D computer generated environment, facilitating sense of presence. By limiting distractions from the real world, increasing sense of presence and giving people an interesting place to go to practice mindfulness, Virtual Reality may facilitate mindfulness practice. Traditional Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT®) mindfulness skills training was specifically designed for clinical treatment of people who have trouble focusing attention, however severe patients often show difficulties or lack of motivation to practice mindfulness during the training. The present pilot study explored whether a sample of mindfulness experts would find useful and recommend a new VR Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT®) mindfulness skills training technique and whether they would show any benefit. Forty four participants attending a mindfulness conference put on an Oculus Rift DK2 Virtual Reality helmet and floated down a calm 3D computer generated virtual river while listening to digitized DBT® mindfulness skills training instructions. On subjective questionnaires completed by the participants before and after the VR DBT® mindfulness skills training session, participants reported increases/improvements in state of mindfulness, and reductions in negative emotional states. After VR, participants reported significantly less sadness, anger, and anxiety, and reported being significantly more relaxed. Participants reported a moderate to strong illusion of going inside the 3D computer generated world (i.e., moderate to high “presence” in VR) and showed high acceptance of VR as a technique to practice mindfulness. These results show encouraging preliminary evidence of the feasibility and acceptability of using VR to practice mindfulness based on clinical expert feedback. VR is a technology with potential to increase computerized dissemination of DBT® skills training modules. Future research is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2768128882,"The ability to regenerate missing body parts exists throughout the animal kingdom. Positional information is crucial for regeneration, but how it is harboured and used by differentiated tissues is poorly understood. In planarians, positional information has been identified from study of phenotypes caused by RNA interference in which the wrong tissues are regenerated. For example, inhibition of the Wnt signalling pathway leads to regeneration of heads in place of tails. Characterization of these phenotypes has led to the identification of position control genes (PCGs)-genes that are expressed in a constitutive and regional manner and are associated with patterning. Most PCGs are expressed within planarian muscle; however, how muscle is specified and how different muscle subsets affect regeneration is unknown. Here we show that different muscle fibres have distinct regulatory roles during regeneration in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. myoD is required for formation of a specific muscle cell subset: the longitudinal fibres, oriented along the anterior-posterior axis. Loss of longitudinal fibres led to complete regeneration failure because of defects in regeneration initiation. A different transcription factor-encoding gene, nkx1-1, is required for the formation of circular fibres, oriented along the medial-lateral axis. Loss of circular fibres led to a bifurcated anterior-posterior axis with fused heads forming in single anterior blastemas. Whereas muscle is often viewed as a strictly contractile tissue, these findings reveal that different muscle types have distinct and specific regulatory roles in wound signalling and patterning to enable regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2769366783,"This retrospective cohort study aimed to examine the relationship between herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) and the subsequent risk of dementia using a population-based database. We retrieved the study sample from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. The study group included 846 patients with HZO, and the comparison group included 2538 patients without HZO. Each patient was individually followed for a 5-year period to identify those patients who subsequently received a diagnosis of dementia. We performed a Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia during the follow-up period between patients with HZO and comparison patients. The respective incidence rates of dementia per 1000 person-years were 10.15 (95% CI: 7.22~13.87) and 3.61 (95% CI: 2.61~4.89) for patients with HZO and comparison patients. The Cox proportional analysis showed that the crude HR of dementia during the 5-year follow-up period was 2.83 (95% CI: 1.83–4.37) for patients with HZO than comparison patients. After adjusting for patients’ characteristics and comorbidities, HZO patients were still at a 2.97-fold greater risk than comparison patients for developing dementia. Furthermore, we found that of sampled male patients, the crude HR of dementia for patients with HZO was as high as 3.35 (95% CI = 1.79–6.28) compared to comparison patients. This study demonstrated an association between HZO and dementia. Clinicians must be alert to suspect dementia in patients with cognitive impairment who had prior HZO."
https://openalex.org/W2952062677,"Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), a latent reservoir of replication-competent HIV-1 persists in resting memory CD4+ T-cells and precludes cure. Lorenzo-Redondo et al. [Nature 530:51-56, 2016] analyzed HIV-1 sequences collected from three individuals during the first six months of ART, discovered specific patterns of sequence evolution, and concluded that viral replication persists during therapy. We believe these evolutionary patterns are artifacts of rapidly decaying viral subpopulations present during the first months of therapy and are not characteristic of the long-lived reservoir. The study therefore provides no evidence that ongoing replication is an additional barrier to cure for treated individuals who consistently maintain low viral loads."
https://openalex.org/W2768648218,"We describe a novel mechanical characterization method that has directly measured the stiffness of cancer spheroids for the first time to our knowledge. Stiffness is known to be a key parameter that characterizes cancerous and normal cells. Atomic force microscopy or optical tweezers have been typically used for characterization of single cells with the measurable forces ranging from sub pN to a few hundred nN, which are not suitable for measurement of larger 3D cellular structures such as spheroids, whose mechanical characteristics have not been fully studied. Here, we developed microtweezers that measure forces from sub hundred nN to mN. The wide force range was achieved by the use of replaceable cantilevers fabricated from SU8, and brass. The chopstick-like motion of the two cantilevers facilitates easy handling of samples and microscopic observation for mechanical characterization. The cantilever bending was optically tracked to find the applied force and sample stiffness. The efficacy of the method was demonstrated through stiffness measurement of agarose pillars with known concentrations. Following the initial system evaluation with agarose, two cancerous (T47D and BT474) and one normal epithelial (MCF 10A) breast cell lines were used to conduct multi-cellular spheroid measurements to find Young’s moduli of 230, 420 and 1250 Pa for BT474, T47D, and MCF 10A, respectively. The results showed that BT474 and T47D spheroids are six and three times softer than epithelial MCF10A spheroids, respectively. Our method successfully characterized samples with wide range of Young’s modulus including agarose (25–100 kPa), spheroids of cancerous and non-malignant cells (190–200 μm, 230–1250 Pa) and collagenase-treated spheroids (215 μm, 130 Pa)."
https://openalex.org/W2769207021,"Weevils (Curculionoidea) comprise one of the most diverse groups of organisms on earth. There is hardly a vascular plant or plant part without its own species of weevil feeding on it and weevil species diversity is greater than the number of fishes, birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals combined. Here, we employ ultraconserved elements (UCEs) designed for beetles and a novel partitioning strategy of loci to help resolve phylogenetic relationships within the radiation of Australasian smurf-weevils (Eupholini). Despite being emblematic of the New Guinea fauna, no previous phylogenetic studies have been conducted on the Eupholini. In addition to a comprehensive collection of fresh specimens, we supplement our taxon sampling with museum specimens, and this study is the first target enrichment phylogenomic dataset incorporating beetle specimens from museum collections. We use both concatenated and species tree analyses to examine the relationships and taxonomy of this group. For species tree analyses we present a novel partitioning strategy to better model the molecular evolutionary process in UCEs. We found that the current taxonomy is problematic, largely grouping species on the basis of similar color patterns. Finally, our results show that most loci required multiple partitions for nucleotide rate substitution, suggesting that single partitions may not be the optimal partitioning strategy to accommodate rate heterogeneity for UCE loci."
https://openalex.org/W2769153246,"Episodic Future Thinking has proven efficient in reducing impulsive behavior in several adult populations. Whether it also has a beneficial impact on decision making in adolescents is not known. Here the impact of episodic future thinking on discounting behavior was investigated in a sample of healthy adolescents (n = 44, age range 13–16 years). Discounting behavior in trials including episodic future thinking was significantly less impulsive than in control trials (t = 2.74, p = .009, dz = .44). In a subsample we controlled for executive function, alcohol use and developmental measures. Neither executive function nor alcohol use but developmental measures explained variability in the effect of episodic future thinking. These findings reveal that episodic future thinking can improve adolescent decision making while the effect is to some degree modulated by developmental measures."
https://openalex.org/W2769292441,"In this era of next generation sequencing technologies it is now possible to characterise the chicken respiratory microbiota without the biases inherent to traditional culturing techniques. However, little research has been performed in this area. In this study we characterise and compare buccal, nasal and lung microbiota samples from chickens in three different age groups using 16S rRNA gene analysis. Buccal and nasal swabs were taken from birds aged 2 days (n = 5), 3 weeks (n = 5) and 30 months (n = 6). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were also collected alongside reagent only controls. DNA was extracted from these samples and the V2-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Quality control and OTU clustering were performed in mothur. Bacterial DNA was quantified using qPCR, amplifying the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We found significant differences between the quantity and types of bacteria sampled at the three different respiratory sites. We also found significant differences in the composition, richness and diversity of the bacterial communities in buccal, nasal and BAL fluid samples between age groups. We identified several bacteria which had previously been isolated from the chicken respiratory tract in culture based studies, including lactobacilli and staphylococci. However, we also identified bacteria which have not previously been cultured from the respiratory tract of the healthy chicken. We conclude that our study can be used as a baseline that future chicken respiratory microbiota studies can build upon."
https://openalex.org/W2770427647,"Background There are currently no licensed vaccines available for prevention of botulism in humans. The vaccination is not desirable due to expanding therapeutic indications of botulinum toxins. The only available specific treatment for botulism is antitoxin to remove circulating toxin, thus, preventing further neuronal damage. BAT® (Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)—(Equine)) has been developed and its therapeutic efficacy evaluated against botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) in Rhesus macaques. Methods and findings In a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) study, animals were exposed to 4x LD50/kg of BoNT/A and administered intravenously with either BAT (1x or 0.1x scaled human dose), or placebo at 4 hours post-exposure. The animals were monitored for 14 days. For the therapeutic intervention studies, animals were exposed to a 1.7x LD50/kg of BoNT/A and treated intravenously with either placebo or BAT at a 1x scaled human dose at the onset of clinical signs. Animals were monitored on an hourly basis for 14 or 21 days. In the PEP study, all animals tolerated equine based antitoxin without any adverse clinical signs. A 100% survival was observed in groups treated with the BAT compared to 0% survival in those treated with the placebo (p<0.001, Fisher’s exact test). BAT antitoxin prevented the development of signs of neurotoxicity of botulinum toxin. In a therapeutic study, treatment with the BAT at scaled 1x human dose after the onset of clinical signs significantly enhanced survival compared to the placebo (46.6% vs. 0%, p<0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). Additionally, treatment with the BAT delayed the progression of signs (muscular weakness, respiratory distress, oral/nasal discharge) of toxin intoxication and reduced the severity of the disease. Conclusions A single dose of BAT, when administered to symptomatic monkeys, resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit compared to the placebo. Additionally, BAT completely protected monkeys from the clinical signs of intoxication and subsequent death when administered as PEP treatment. These data in part supported the licensure of BAT under the Animal Rule in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration."
https://openalex.org/W2770521992,"Aedes aegypti is a model species in which the endogenous regulation of odor-mediated host seeking behavior has received some attention. Sugar feeding and host seeking in female A. aegypti are transiently inhibited following a blood meal. This inhibition is partially mediated by short neuropeptide F (sNPF). The paired antennal lobes (ALs), as the first processing centers for olfactory information, has been shown to play a significant role in the neuropeptidergic regulation of odor-mediated behaviors in insects. The expression of sNPF, along with other peptides in the ALs of A. aegypti, indicate parallel neuromodulatory systems that may affect olfactory processing. To identify neuropeptides involved in regulating the odor-mediated host seeking behavior in A. aegypti, we use a semi-quantitative neuropeptidomic analysis of single ALs to analyze changes in the levels of five individual neuropeptides in response to different feeding regimes. Our results show that the level of sNPF-2, allatostatin-A-5 (AstA-5) and neuropeptide-like precursor-1-5 (NPLP-1-5), but not of tachykinin-related-peptides and SIFamide (SIFa), in the AL of female mosquitoes, changes 24 h and 48 h post-blood meal, and are dependent on prior access to sugar. To assess the role of these neuropeptides in modulating host seeking behavior, when systemically injected individually, sNPF-2 and AstA-5 significantly reduced host seeking behavior. However, only the injection of the binary mixture of the two neuropeptides lead to a host seeking inhibition similar to that observed in blood fed females. We conclude that modulation of the odor mediated host seeking behavior of A. aegypti is likely regulated by a dual neuropeptidergic pathway acting in concert in the ALs."
https://openalex.org/W2768790361,"Here we determine the sex-specific influence of mtDNA type (mitotype) and diet on mitochondrial functions and physiology in two Drosophila melanogaster lines. In many species, males and females differ in aspects of their energy production. These sex-specific influences may be caused by differences in evolutionary history and physiological functions. We predicted the influence of mtDNA mutations should be stronger in males than females as a result of the organelle's maternal mode of inheritance in the majority of metazoans. In contrast, we predicted the influence of diet would be greater in females due to higher metabolic flexibility. We included four diets that differed in their protein: carbohydrate (P:C) ratios as they are the two-major energy-yielding macronutrients in the fly diet. We assayed four mitochondrial function traits (Complex I oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species production, superoxide dismutase activity, and mtDNA copy number) and four physiological traits (fecundity, longevity, lipid content, and starvation resistance). Traits were assayed at 11 d and 25 d of age. Consistent with predictions we observe that the mitotype influenced males more than females supporting the hypothesis of a sex-specific selective sieve in the mitochondrial genome caused by the maternal inheritance of mitochondria. Also, consistent with predictions, we found that the diet influenced females more than males."
https://openalex.org/W2769601075,"Alterations in the social and cognitive domain are considered important indicators for increased disability in many stress-related disorders. Similar impairments have been observed in rodents chronically exposed to stress, mimicking potential endophenotypes of stress-related psychopathologies such as major depression disorder (MDD), anxiety, conduct disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Data from numerous studies suggest that deficient plasticity mechanisms in hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) might underlie these social and cognitive deficits. Specifically, stress-induced deficiencies in neural plasticity have been associated with a hypodopaminergic state and reduced neural plasticity persistence. Here we assessed the effects of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) on exploratory, social and cognitive behavior of females of two inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J and DBA/2J) that differ in their dopaminergic profile. Exposure to chronic stress resulted in impaired circadian rhythmicity, sociability and social cognition in both inbred strains, but differentially affected activity patterns and contextual discrimination performance. These stress-induced behavioral impairments were accompanied by reduced expression levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the prefrontal cortex. The strain-specific cognitive impairment was coexistent with enhanced plasma corticosterone levels and reduced expression of genes related to dopamine signaling in hippocampus. These results underline the importance of assessing different strains with multiple test batteries to elucidate the neural and genetic basis of social and cognitive impairments related to chronic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2770447776,"UBIAD1 (UbiA prenyltransferase domain–containing protein-1) utilizes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to synthesize vitamin K2. We previously reported that sterols stimulate binding of UBIAD1 to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–localized 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase. UBIAD1 binding inhibits sterol-accelerated, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of reductase, one of several mechanisms for feedback control of this rate-limiting enzyme in the branched pathway that produces cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids such as GGpp. Accumulation of GGpp in ER membranes triggers release of UBIAD1 from reductase, permitting its maximal ERAD and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. Mutant UBIAD1 variants associated with Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD), a human disorder characterized by corneal accumulation of cholesterol, resist GGpp-induced release from reductase and remain sequestered in the ER to block reductase ERAD. Using lines of genetically manipulated cells, we now examine consequences of UBIAD1 deficiency and SCD-associated UBIAD1 on reductase ERAD and cholesterol synthesis. Our results indicated that reductase becomes destabilized in the absence of UBIAD1, resulting in reduced cholesterol synthesis and intracellular accumulation. In contrast, an SCD-associated UBIAD1 variant inhibited reductase ERAD, thereby stabilizing the enzyme and contributing to enhanced synthesis and intracellular accumulation of cholesterol. Finally, we present evidence that GGpp-regulated, ER-to-Golgi transport enables UBIAD1 to modulate reductase ERAD such that synthesis of nonsterol isoprenoids is maintained in sterol-replete cells. These findings further establish UBIAD1 as a central player in the reductase ERAD pathway and regulation of isoprenoid synthesis. They also indicate that UBIAD1-mediated inhibition of reductase ERAD underlies cholesterol accumulation associated with SCD. UBIAD1 (UbiA prenyltransferase domain–containing protein-1) utilizes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) to synthesize vitamin K2. We previously reported that sterols stimulate binding of UBIAD1 to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–localized 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase. UBIAD1 binding inhibits sterol-accelerated, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of reductase, one of several mechanisms for feedback control of this rate-limiting enzyme in the branched pathway that produces cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids such as GGpp. Accumulation of GGpp in ER membranes triggers release of UBIAD1 from reductase, permitting its maximal ERAD and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. Mutant UBIAD1 variants associated with Schnyder corneal dystrophy (SCD), a human disorder characterized by corneal accumulation of cholesterol, resist GGpp-induced release from reductase and remain sequestered in the ER to block reductase ERAD. Using lines of genetically manipulated cells, we now examine consequences of UBIAD1 deficiency and SCD-associated UBIAD1 on reductase ERAD and cholesterol synthesis. Our results indicated that reductase becomes destabilized in the absence of UBIAD1, resulting in reduced cholesterol synthesis and intracellular accumulation. In contrast, an SCD-associated UBIAD1 variant inhibited reductase ERAD, thereby stabilizing the enzyme and contributing to enhanced synthesis and intracellular accumulation of cholesterol.

These two isoprenoids are transferred to many cellular proteins and utilized in the synthesis of other nonsterol isoprenoids such as ubiquinone, vitamin K2, heme, and dolichol. Nonsterol isoprenoids are essential for numerous cellular processes ranging from electron transport (ubiquinone and heme), asparagine-linked protein glycosylation (dolichol), and coagulation (vitamin K2) to signal transduction, cell growth, and migration (Fpp and GGpp) (2Edwards P.A.

One mechanism for the multivalent feedback regulation of reductase involves its sterol-accelerated, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) from membranes.

GGpp triggers release of UBIAD1 from reductase, allowing for the maximal ERAD of reductase and ER-to-Golgi transport of UBIAD1. Eliminating expression of UBIAD1 relieves the GGpp requirement for reductase ERAD, indicating that the reaction is inhibited by the prenyltransferase.

Utilizing cells genetically manipulated using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, we determine in the current studies the consequences of UBIAD1 deficiency and SCD-associated UBIAD1 on regulation of the mevalonate pathway. The results of these studies not only further establish a key role for UBIAD1 in regulation of reductase ERAD and mevalonate metabolism, but they also indicate that inhibition of reductase ERAD significantly contributes to accumulation of cholesterol associated with SCD. In the experiment of Fig. 1A, we compared the level of reductase protein in wild-type and genetically manipulated SV-589 cells. The results show that when wild-type SV-589 cells were cultured in sterol-replete medium containing FCS, a low but detectable level of reductase protein was observed by immunoblot analysis of isolated membrane fractions (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The level of reductase protein was reduced in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells (lane 2), which harbor a CRISPR-Cas9-induced deletion in the endogenous UBIAD1 gene. SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 cells are SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells stably transfected with UBIAD1 containing an N-terminal Myc tag. Immunoblot analysis of membrane fractions from SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 cells revealed that expression of Myc-UBIAD1 restored expression of reductase protein to approximately wild-type levels (compare lanes 1 and 3). A marked accumulation of reductase was observed in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells (lane 4), which express the SCD-associated variant of UBIAD1 that harbors substitution of serine for asparagine-102 (N102S). No significant changes were observed in the level of reductase mRNA in SV-589, SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1), SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT), and SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells (Fig. 1B). Considering these results together with the previous finding that overexpression of UBIAD1 (N102S) and other SCD-associated UBIAD1 variants blocks ERAD of endogenous reductase (16Schumacher M.M. Jun D.J. Jo Y. Seemann J. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Geranylgeranyl-regulated transport of the prenyltransferase UBIAD1 between membranes of the ER and Golgi.J.

When SV-589 and SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells were cultured in sterol-depleted lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS)-containing medium, a condition that enhances transcription of the reductase gene and slows reductase ERAD (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Regulation of the mevalonate pathway.Nature. 1990; 343 (1967820): 425-43010.1038/343425a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar), similar levels of reductase protein were observed (lanes 5 and 6). However, it should be noted that reductase continued to accumulate in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells compared with that in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 cells when grown in LPDS (compare lanes 7 and 8). The immunofluorescence experiment of Fig. 1C shows that despite their overexpression, Myc-UBIAD1 (WT) and (N102S) were localized to the Golgi and ER, respectively, of isoprenoid-replete cells as previously observed (12Schumacher M.M. Elsabrouty R. Seemann J. Jo Y. DeBose-Boyd R.A. The prenyltransferase UBIAD1 is the target of geranylgeraniol in degradation of HMG CoA reductase.eLife. 2015; 4 (25742604)10.7554/eLife.05560Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Schumacher M.M.

Although UBIAD1 (N102S) inhibits sterol-accelerated ERAD of reductase, the experiment of Fig. 1D shows that sterols continue to trigger ubiquitination of reductase in the presence of the mutant vitamin K2. SV-589, SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1), SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT), and SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells were first depleted of isoprenoids through incubation for 16 h in medium containing LPDS and the statin compactin to trigger accumulation of reductase. The cells were then treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (to block degradation of ubiquitinated reductase) in the presence of various concentrations of the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). After 1 h, the cells were harvested for preparation of detergent lysates that were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-reductase. In a dose-dependent manner, 25-HC caused reductase to become ubiquitinated in SV-589 cells, as indicated by smears of reactivity in anti-ubiquitin immunoblots of the reductase immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1D, lanes a–d). Similar results were observed in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) (lanes e–h), SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT) (lanes i–l), and SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells (lanes m–p). It is notable that reductase became ubiquitinated in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells, even though its ERAD was inhibited (Fig. 1A, lane 4). We next sought to determine the consequence of UBIAD1 deficiency and reduced expression of reductase on synthesis of cholesterol from the two-carbon precursor acetate. As shown in the experiment of Fig. 2A, SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells incorporated significantly less [14C]acetate into cholesterol than parental SV-589 cells when cultured in FCS-containing medium. To determine whether exogenous cholesterol from FCS-derived lipoproteins contributed to reduced synthesis of cholesterol in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells, we measured incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into cholesterol in wild-type and UBIAD1-deficient cells. The results show that incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into cholesterol was reduced 3–4-fold in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells cultured in FCS compared with that in SV-589 cells (Fig. 2B). However, this difference was ablated when the cells were cultured in LPDS. This result indicates that reduced expression of reductase renders SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells reliant on exogenous lipoproteins to satisfy cellular demands for cholesterol. The uptake of exogenous lipoproteins likely reduced incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into cholesterol because of modulation of the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2, a membrane-bound transcription factor that controls expression of genes encoding reductase and other enzymes of the mevalonate pathway (17Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Combined analysis of oligonucleotide microarray data from transgenic and knockout mice identifies direct SREBP target genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100 (14512514): 12027-1203210.1073/pnas.1534923100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A compares synthesis of cholesterol from acetate in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT) and (N102S) cells cultured in FCS. The incorporation of [14C]acetate was markedly enhanced (>5-fold) in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells expressing UBIAD1 (N102S) compared with that in cells expressing wild-type UBIAD1. In contrast, the synthesis of cholesterol from [3H]mevalonate in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT) and (N102S) cells was similar, regardless of culture in FCS or LPDS (Fig. 3B). Thus, enhanced synthesis of cholesterol from acetate in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells likely resulted from accumulation of reductase caused by UBIAD1 (N102S)-mediated inhibition of its ERAD. It should be noted that cholesterol synthesis from mevalonate was not enhanced when SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT) cells were cultured in LPDS (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we noticed that cholesterol synthesis is reduced in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT) cells compared that observed in parental SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells. We reason that when UBIAD1 is overexpressed, mevalonate metabolites are diverted away from cholesterol and become incorporated into nonsterol isoprenoids. The synthesis of cholesteryl esters, the major storage form of cellular cholesterol, was next measured in wild-type and UBIAD1-deficient SV-589 cells (Fig. 4A). Similar to results obtained for cholesterol synthesis (Fig. 3A), incorporation of [3H]oleate into cholesteryl esters was reduced in the absence of UBIAD1 (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of UBIAD1 (N102S) in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells led to enhanced synthesis of cholesteryl esters compared with that in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells expressing the wild-type prenyltransferase (Fig. 4B). Notably, we did not observe significant differences in the amounts of triglycerides produced by SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1), SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT), and SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells (data not shown). In Fig. 4C, SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1), SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (WT), and SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1)/pMyc-UBIAD1 (N102S) cells were cultured in FCS and subsequently stained with oil red O, a dye that stains neutral lipids such as triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. The results show that oil red O staining was reduced by almost 50% in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells compared with parental SV-589 cells (Fig. 4C, compare panels 1 and 2, and D). The level of oil red O staining was rescued by overexpression of wild-type UBIAD1 in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells (Fig. 4C, panel 3, and D) and neutral lipids overaccumulated ∼2-fold upon the overexpression of UBIAD1 (N102S) (Fig. 4C, panel 4, and D). Considering our previous results that implicated UBIAD1 as a novel sensor of GGpp embedded in membranes (16Schumacher M.M. Jun D.J. Jo Y. Seemann J. DeBose-Boyd R.A.

When SV-589 cells were depleted of exogenous sterols through incubation in LPDS-containing medium, UBIAD1 localized to the Golgi as expected (Fig. 5A, panel 1). Treatment of the cells with compactin to deplete nonsterol isoprenoids disrupted Golgi localization of UBIAD1, causing it to accumulate in the ER (panel 2). A high concentration of mevalonate (10 mm) was required to stimulate transport of UBIAD1 from the ER to Golgi in the sterol and nonsterol isoprenoid-depleted cells (panels 3-6). The Golgi localization of UBIAD1 was also disrupted by compactin when SV-589 cells were grown in lipoprotein-rich FCS-containing medium (Fig. 5A, compare panels 7 and 8). However, Golgi transport of UBIAD1 was triggered by lower concentrations of mevalonate (1–3 mm) when SV-589 cells were cultured under sterol-replete conditions (panels 10-12). Similar results were obtained when isoprenoid-depleted SV-589 cells were treated with 25-HC rather than FCS for repletion of sterols. As shown in Fig. 5B, Golgi localization of UBIAD1 was restored by lower concentrations of mevalonate when cells were incubated with 25-HC (panels 10-12) compared with those required in the absence of the oxysterol (panels 4-6). We next measured the synthesis of MK-4 in cells using a recently established assay in our group. SV-589 cells were deprived of isoprenoids through incubation in medium containing LPDS and compactin. In addition, the cells received [3H]menadione in the presence or absence of various concentrations of mevalonate (to provide substrates for synthesis of nonsterol isoprenoids). Following incubation for 16 h, the cells were lysed, and incorporation of [3H]menadione into MK-4 was determined by TLC and scintillation counting. The results show that the addition to cells of mevalonate led to a dose-dependent increase in the amount of [3H]menadione incorporated into MK-4 (Fig. 6A, white circles). Incorporation of [3H]menadione into MK-4 was enhanced at lower concentrations of mevalonate (>0.3 mm) when cells were treated with 25-HC (red circles). In sterol-deprived cells, transcriptionally active fragments of SREBP-2 become proteolytically released from Golgi membranes (17Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W.

Sterol accumulation inhibits proteolytic release of SREBP-2 from membranes, which results in the decline in transcription of SREBP-2 target genes and the rate of cholesterol synthesis. Quantitative RT-PCR reveals that expression of mRNAs encoding reductase and other cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes including HMG CoA synthase (HMGCS), Fpp synthase, and squalene synthase (SQS) were markedly reduced by 25-HC (Fig. 6B). In contrast, levels of mRNAs for geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS) and UBIAD1 remained constant regardless of the absence or presence of compactin, mevalonate, or 25-HC. Immunoblot analysis revealed a reduction in the protein levels for HMGCS, transcriptionally active nuclear SREBP-2, reductase, and SQS in 25-HC treated cells, whereas GGPPS and UBIAD1 protein levels were unchanged (Fig. 6C). The current results provide further evidence for a pivotal role of UBIAD1 in the regulation of reductase ERAD and metabolism of mevalonate. This evidence includes results showing that in the absence of UBIAD1, ERAD of reductase was accelerated (Fig. 1A), causing a fall in the synthesis of cholesterol (Fig. 2A) and cholesteryl esters (Fig. 4A). As a result, UBIAD1-deficient cells exhibited reduced storage of cholesteryl esters and other neutral lipids compared with wild-type cells as indicated by oil red O staining (Fig. 4, C and D).

However, we did not observe changes in the level of ACAT-1 in UBIAD1-deficient cells (Fig. 1A). Thus, reduced synthesis of cholesteryl esters in SV-589 (ΔUBIAD1) cells can be attributed to enhanced synthesis of cholesterol. In contrast, expression of SCD-associated UBIAD1 (N102S) led to the overaccumulation of neutral lipids (Fig. 4, C and D), because of the inhibition of reductase ERAD (Fig. 1A) that led to enhanced synthesis of cholesterol (Fig. 3A) and cholesteryl esters (Fig. 4B). These findings indicate that UBIAD1 (N102S)-mediated inhibition of reductase ERAD significantly contributes to enhanced synthesis and accumulation of cholesterol in cultured cells.

https://openalex.org/W2768560514,"We present paleo-water depth reconstructions for the Pefka E section deposited on the island of Rhodes (Greece) during the early Pleistocene. For these reconstructions, a transfer function (TF) using modern benthic foraminifera surface samples from the Adriatic and Western Mediterranean Seas has been developed. The TF model gives an overall predictive accuracy of ~50 m over a water depth range of ~1200 m. Two separate TF models for shallower and deeper water depth ranges indicate a good predictive accuracy of 9 m for shallower water depths (0–200 m) but far less accuracy of 130 m for deeper water depths (200–1200 m) due to uneven sampling along the water depth gradient. To test the robustness of the TF, we randomly selected modern samples to develop random TFs, showing that the model is robust for water depths between 20 and 850 m while greater water depths are underestimated. We applied the TF to the Pefka E fossil data set. The goodness-of-fit statistics showed that most fossil samples have a poor to extremely poor fit to water depth. We interpret this as a consequence of a lack of modern analogues for the fossil samples and removed all samples with extremely poor fit. To test the robustness and significance of the reconstructions, we compared them to reconstructions from an alternative TF model based on the modern analogue technique and applied the randomization TF test. We found our estimates to be robust and significant at the 95% confidence level, but we also observed that our estimates are strongly overprinted by orbital, precession-driven changes in paleo-productivity and corrected our estimates by filtering out the precession-related component. We compared our corrected record to reconstructions based on a modified plankton/benthos (P/B) ratio, excluding infaunal species, and to stable oxygen isotope data from the same section, as well as to paleo-water depth estimates for the Lindos Bay Formation of other sediment sections of Rhodes. These comparisons indicate that our orbital-corrected reconstructions are reasonable and reflect major tectonic movements of Rhodes during the early Pleistocene."

This engages acute nociceptive signaling events that contribute to pain and stress post-operatively that from a welfare perspective demands peri-operative analgesic treatment. However, a large number of researchers avoid providing such care based largely on anecdotal opinions that it might interfere with model pathophysiology in the longer term.To investigate effects of various peri-operative analgesic regimens encapsulating different mechanisms and duration of action, on the development of post-operative stress/welfare and pain-like behaviors in the Spared Nerve Injury (SNI)-model of neuropathic pain.Starting on the day of surgery, male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either vehicle (s.c.), carprofen (5.0mg/kg, s.c.), buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg s.c. or 1.0mg/kg p.o. in Nutella®), lidocaine/bupivacaine mixture (local irrigation) or a combination of all analgesics, with coverage from a single administration, and up to 72 hours. Post-operative stress and recovery were assessed using welfare parameters, bodyweight, food-consumption, and fecal corticosterone, and hindpaw mechanical allodynia was tested for assessing development of neuropathic pain for 28 days.None of the analgesic regimes compromised the development of mechanical allodynia. Unexpectedly, the combined treatment with 0.1mg/kg s.c. buprenorphine and carprofen for 72 hours and local irrigation with lidocaine/bupivacaine, caused severe adverse effects with peritonitis. This was not observed when the combination included a lower dose of buprenorphine (0.05mg/kg, s.c.), or when buprenorphine was administered alone (0.1mg/kg s.c. or 1.0mg/kg p.o.) for 72 hours. An elevated rate of wound dehiscence was observed especially in the combined treatment groups, underlining the need for balanced analgesia. Repeated buprenorphine injections had positive effects on body weight the first day after surgery, but depressive effects on food intake and body weight later during the first week.Post-operative analgesia does not appear to affect established neuropathic hypersensitivity outcome in the SNI model."

Accordingly, negative regulation of the DDR is as critical as its activation. In this study, we have identified ring finger protein 126 (RNF126) as a negative regulator of the DDR from a screen of iRIF containing 53BP1.

However, which patients with CSFC will have a better response to acupuncture remains unclear. Objective To explore factors related to acupuncture response in patients with CSFC. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of a previous multicenter randomized controlled trial consisting of a 2-week run-in period, 8-week treatment, and 12-week follow-up without treatment in which patients with CSFC were randomly allocated to an electroacupuncture group or a sham electroacupuncture group. Responders were defined as participants with an increase of at least one complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) in week 20 compared with the baseline period. The CSBM responder rate in both groups was described, and the baseline characteristics of participants potentially related to acupuncture response were mainly analyzed using logistic regression analysis with bootstrapping techniques. Results A total of 1021 participants were analyzed in this study, of whom 516 (50.5%) were classified as responders. The CSBM responder rate in week 20 was significantly greater in the electroacupuncture group than in the sham electroacupuncture group (62.9% vs. 37.9%, respectively; P<0.001). Both age and comorbidity were negatively associated with clinical response: with every one-year increase in age, the likelihood of clinical response was reduced by 1.2% (OR 0.988, 95%CI 0.980 to 0.996; P = 0.005), and patients with comorbidities were approximately 42% less likely to respond to treatment (OR 0.581, 95%CI 0.248 to 0.914; P = 0.001). Conclusion CSFC patients with increasing age and comorbidity may be less likely to respond to acupuncture. These findings contribute to guiding clinical practice in terms of pretreatment patient selection. Further research is needed to confirm the association."
https://openalex.org/W2770268026,"Multiple studies suggest that hypoxia, together with inflammation, could be one of the phenomena involved in the onset and progression of obesity-related insulin resistance. In addition, dysfunction of adipose tissue in obese subjects with metabolic syndrome is associated with decreased angiogenesis. However, some subjects with a high body mass index do not develop metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity. The aim of the current study was to examine the neovascular properties of visceral adipose tissue-derived multipotent mesenchymal cells subjected to hypoxia (hypox-visASCs) from normal-weight subjects (Nw) and obese patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) and without metabolic syndrome (NonMS).This was a 2-year study to enroll subjects who underwent bariatric surgery or cholecystectomy. Eight patients who underwent either bariatric surgery or cholecystectomy (27 patients) participated in the study. Visceral adipose tissue samples from Nw, MS and NonMS subjects were processed by enzymatic digestion. VisASCs cultured under hypoxic conditions were characterized by tubule formation assay, ELISA, flow cytometry, migration rate, and qRT-PCR, and the effects of visASCs-conditioned medium on survival and endothelial cell tubule formation were evaluated.Hypox-visASCs from NonMS subjects showed a greater capacity for tubule formation than hypox-visASCs from Nw and MS subjects. The lower percentage of CD140b+/CD44+ and CD140b+/CD184+ cells observed in hypox-visASCs from NonMS subjects compared to MS subjects was accompanied not only by a lower migration rate from the chemotactic effects of stromal cell derived factor 1α, but also by lower levels of NOX5 mRNA expression. While the levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 mRNA expressed by hypox-visASCs correlated positively with the body mass index and waist circumference of the subjects, the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor present in hypox-visASC-conditioned culture medium decreased significantly with increasing plasma glucose. The survival rate and tubules formed by endothelial cells cultured in hypox-visASC-conditioned medium decreased significantly with increasing homeostasis model assessment to quantify insulin resistance.Our results suggest that hypox-visASCs from NonMS subjects could promote healthy adipose tissue expansion, while hypox-visASCs from MS subjects appear to contribute to the decreased angiogenic potential and increased inflammation underlying adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity. Our results emphasize the importance of taking into account not only the BMI but also the metabolic profile of the subjects during the implementation of ASCs-based therapy to promote neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2769266621,"Cortisol, a physiologic glucocorticoid (GC), is essential for growth and differentiation of the airway epithelium. Epithelial function influences inflammation in chronic respiratory diseases. Synthetic GCs, including inhaled corticosteroids, exert anti-inflammatory effects in airway epithelium by transactivation of genes and by inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine release. We examined the effect of cortisol on the actions of synthetic GCs in the airway epithelium, demonstrating that cortisol acts like a partial agonist at the GC receptor (GR), limiting GC- induced GR-dependent transcription in the BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cell line. Cortisol also limited the inhibition of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor release by synthetic GCs in TNF-α-activated BEAS-2B cells. The relevance of these findings is supported by observations on tracheal epithelium obtained from mice treated for 5 d with systemic GC, showing limitations in selected GC effects, including inhibition of IL-6. Moreover, gene transactivation by synthetic GCs was compromised by standard air-liquid interface (ALI) growth medium cortisol concentration (1.4 μM) in the ALI-differentiated organotypic culture of primary human airway epithelial cells. These findings suggest that endogenous corticosteroids may limit certain actions of synthetic pharmacological GCs and contribute to GC insensitivity, particularly when corticosteroid levels are elevated by stress.—Prodanovic, D., Keenan, C.

The existence of HBsAg mutants is well documented in many countries. In Pakistan, HBV screening in the majority of the blood banks is performed by Rapid Detection Devices or ELISA tests. These tests are designed to detect HBsAg, but may not detect the mutant HBsAg. Failure to detect the HBsAg mutant may result in the transmission of HBV infection from donor to recipient. Hence, there is a need to identify a HBsAg assay which can detect mutants in a country where simple and conventional HBsAg assays with varying sensitivity and specificity are used to detect HBV infections.Three routinely used diagnostic tests (Rapid Detection Devices, ELISA and CLIA) for HBsAg were compared with the LIAISON® XL Murex HBsAg Quant Assay to determine the prevalence of HBV mutants in the Pakistani blood donor population. The samples of blood donors from different cities of Pakistan were collected. The testing was performed using SD Bioline rapid assay (n = 1500), ELISA (n = 1500), and Abbott ARCHITECT®CLIA system (n = 1500) at the centers where the donations were collected. All samples (n = 4500) were re-tested for comparative analysis on the LIAISON® XL Murex HBsAg Quant assay (DiaSorin S.p.A.). PCR testing was performed as a gold standard on all discordant samples.119/4500 (2.64%) of the samples were positive for antibodies against HBsAg.

https://openalex.org/W2769253342,"Social animals frequently rely on information from other individuals. This can be costly in case the other individual is mistaken or even deceptive. Human infants below 4 years of age show proficiency in their reliance on differently reliable informants. They can infer the reliability of an informant from few interactions and use that assessment in later interactions with the same informant in a different context. To explore whether great apes share that ability, in our study we confronted great apes with a reliable or unreliable informant in an object choice task, to see whether that would in a subsequent task affect their gaze following behaviour in response to the same informant. In our study, prior reliability of the informant and habituation during the gaze following task affected both great apes' automatic gaze following response and their more deliberate response of gaze following behind barriers. As habituation is very context specific, it is unlikely that habituation in the reliability task affected the gaze following task. Rather it seems that apes employ a reliability tracking strategy that results in a general avoidance of additional information from an unreliable informant."
https://openalex.org/W2770974777,"Orthostatic intolerance, one of the principle causes of syncope, can occur secondary to concomitant venous pooling and enhanced capillary filtration. We aimed to evaluate a prototype portable calf active compression brace (ACB) designed to improve orthostatic haemodynamic control. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over, double-blind study. Testing consisted of head-upright tilting and walking on a treadmill conducted on two consecutive days with a pair of ACBs wrapped around both calves. The ACB was actuated on one test day, but not on the other (placebo). Wearability, comfort, and ambulatory use of the ACB were assessed using questionnaires. The average calf pressure exerted by the ACB was 46.3±2.2 mmHg and the actuation pressure was 20.7±1.7 mmHg. When considering the differences between ACB actuation and placebo during tilt after supine rest there were trends for a larger stroke volume (+5.20±2.34%, p = 0.05) and lower heart rate (-5.12±2.41%, p = 0.06) with ACB actuation, with no effect on systolic arterial pressure (+4.86±3.41%, p = 0.18). The decrease in stroke volume after ten minutes of tilting was positively correlated with the height:calf circumference (r = 0.464; p = 0.029; n = 22; both conditions combined). The increase in heart rate after ten minutes of tilting was negatively correlated with the height:calf circumference (r = -0.485; p = 0.022; n = 22; both conditions combined) and was positively correlated with the average calf circumference (r = 0.539; p = 0.009; n = 22; both conditions combined).

https://openalex.org/W2768163394,"Empirical data has shown that bivalent inhibitors can bind a given target protein significantly better than their monomeric counterparts. However, predicting the corresponding theoretical fold improvements has been challenging. The current work builds off the reacted-site probability approach to provide a straightforward baseline reference model for predicting fold-improvements in effective affinity of dimerized ligands over their monomeric counterparts. For the more familiar irreversibly linked bivalents, the model predicts a weak dependence on tether length and a scaling of the effective affinity with the 3/2 power of the monomer’s affinity. For the previously untreated case of the emerging technology of reversibly linking dimers, the effective affinity is also significantly improved over the affinity of the non-dimerizing monomers. The model is related back to experimental quantities, such as EC50s, and the approaches to fully characterize the system given the assumptions of the model. Because of the predicted significant potency gains, both irreversibly and reversibly linked bivalent ligands offer the potential to be a disruptive technology in pharmaceutical research."
https://openalex.org/W2769270083,"Background A large and growing number of inherited genetic disease mutations are now known in the dog. Frequencies of these mutations are typically examined within the breed of discovery, possibly in related breeds, but nearly always in purebred dogs. No report to date has examined the frequencies of specific genetic disease mutations in a large population of mixed-breed dogs. Further, veterinarians and dog owners typically dismiss inherited/genetic diseases as possibilities for health problems in mixed-breed dogs, assuming hybrid vigor will guarantee that single-gene disease mutations are not a cause for concern. Therefore, the objective of this study was to screen a large mixed-breed canine population for the presence of mutant alleles associated with five autosomal recessive disorders: hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia (HUU), cystinuria (CYST), factor VII deficiency (FVIID), myotonia congenita (MYC) and phosphofructokinase deficiency (PKFD). Genetic testing was performed in conjunction with breed determination via the commercially-available Wisdom PanelTM test. Results From a population of nearly 35,000 dogs, homozygous mutant dogs were identified for HUU (n = 57) and FVIID (n = 65). Homozygotes for HUU and FVIID were identified even among dogs with highly mixed breed ancestry. Carriers were identified for all disorders except MYC. HUU and FVIID were of high enough frequency to merit consideration in any mixed-breed dog, while CYST, MYC, and PKFD are vanishingly rare. Conclusions The assumption that mixed-breed dogs do not suffer from single-gene genetic disorders is shown here to be false. Within the diseases examined, HUU and FVIID should remain on any practitioner’s rule-out list, when clinically appropriate, for all mixed-breed dogs, and judicious genetic testing should be performed for diagnosis or screening. Future testing of large mixed-breed dog populations that include additional known canine genetic mutations will refine our knowledge of which genetic diseases can strike mixed-breed dogs."

We explored the effects of extended photoperiods of low-irradiance light (7 μmol·m-2·s-1, no effective photosynthesis) on the growth, the biomass dry weight, the biomass allocation, and, especially, the stem digestibility and cell wall characteristics of switchgrass. Two extended photoperiods (i.e., 18 and 24 h) were applied over Alamo. Extended light exposure (18 and 24 h) resulted in delayed heading and higher dry weights of vegetative organs (by 32.87 and 35.94%, respectively) at the expense of reducing the amount of sexual organs (by 40.05 and 50.87%, respectively). Compared to the control group (i.e., natural photoperiod), the yield of hexoses (% dry matter) in the stems after a direct enzymatic hydrolysis (DEH) treatment significantly increased (by 44.02 and 46.10%) for those groups irradiated during 18 and 24 h, respectively. Moreover, the yield of hexoses obtained via enzymatic hydrolysis increased after both basic (1% NaOH) and acid (1% H2SO4) pretreatments for the groups irradiated during 18 and 24 h. Additionally, low-irradiance light extension (LILE) significantly increased the content of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) while notably reducing the lignin content and the syringyl to guaiacyl (S/G) ratio. These structural changes were in part responsible for the observed improved stem digestibility. Remarkably, LILE significantly decreased the cellulose crystallinity index (CrI) of switchgrass by significantly increasing both the arabinose substitution degree in xylan and the content of ammonium oxalate-extractable uronic acids, both favoring cellulose digestibility. Despite this LILE technology is not applied to the cultivation of switchgrass on a large scale yet, we believe that the present work is important in that it reveals important relationships between extended day length irradiations and biomass production and quality. Additionally, this study paves the way for improving biomass production and digestibility via genetic modification of day length sensitive transcription factors or key structural genes in switchgrass leaves."

Myosin VIIa is responsible for tension bearing and the transduction mechanism in the stereocilia and for melanosome transport in the retina, in line with the phenotypic outcomes observed in mice. However, the effect of the shaker-1 mutation, a R502P amino acid substitution, on the motor function is unclear. To explore this question, we determined the kinetic properties and the effect on the filopodial tip localization of the recombinant mouse myosin VIIa-5IQ-SAH R502P (myoVIIa-sh1) construct. Interestingly, although residue 502 is localized to a region thought to be involved in interacting with actin, the kinetic parameters for actin binding changed only slightly for the mutant construct. However, the rate constant for ATP hydrolysis (k+H + k−H) was reduced by ∼200-fold from 12 s−1 to 0.05 s−1, making the hydrolysis step the rate-limiting step of the ATPase cycle in the presence and absence of actin. Given that wild-type mouse myosin VIIa is a slow, high-duty ratio, monomeric motor, this altered hydrolysis rate would reduce activity to extremely low levels. Indeed, the translocation to the filopodial tips was hampered by the diminished motor function of a dimeric construct of the shaker-1 mutant. We conclude that the diminished motor activity of this mutant is most likely responsible for impaired hearing in the shaker-1 mice."

Forty-eight cecectomized roosters (2.39 ± 0.23 kg) were randomly allocated to eight dietary treatments containing protein levels of 0, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, 15%, 18% and 21%. Each bird was precisely fed an experimental diet of 25 g/kg of body weight. After feeding, all roosters were subcutaneously injected with a 15N-leucine solution at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight. Blood was sampled 23 h after the injection, and excreta samples were continuously collected during the course of the 48-h experiment. The ratio of 15N-enrichment of leucine in crude mucin to free leucine in plasma ranged from 0.664 to 0.763 and remained relatively consistent (P > 0.05) across all treatments. The amino acid (AA) profiles of total endogenous AAs, except isoleucine, alanine, aspartic acid, cysteine, proline and serine, were not influenced (P > 0.05) by dietary protein contents. The predominant endogenous AAs in the excreta were glutamic acid, aspartic acid, threonine, serine and proline. The order of the relative proportions of these predominant AAs also remained relatively constant (P > 0.05). The endogenous losses of total AAs determined with the 15N-leucine single-injection method increased curvilinearly with the dietary protein contents. The true digestibility of most AAs and total AAs was independent of their respective dietary protein levels. Collectively, the 15N-leucine single-injection method is appropriate for determining EAALs and the true digestibility of AAs in poultry fed varying levels of protein-containing ingredients."
