https://openalex.org/W2036806907,"A common assumption is that breeding in polygnous systems is not limited by the number of males because one male can inseminate many females1,2. But here we show that reproductive collapse in the critically endangered saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica tatarica) is likely to have been caused by a catastrophic drop in the number of adult males in this harem-breeding ungulate, probably due to selective poaching for their horns. Fecundity and calf survival are known to be affected by markedly skewed sex ratios3, but in the saiga antelope the sex ratio has become so distorted as to lead to a drastic decline in the number of pregnancies — a finding that has implications both for the conservation of the species and for understanding the reproductive ecology of polygynous ungulates."

https://openalex.org/W1990238217,"Nitrogen oxides are trace gases that critically affect atmospheric chemistry and aerosol formation1. Vegetation is usually regarded as a sink for these gases, although nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide have been detected as natural emissions from plants2,3. Here we use in situ measurements to show that solar ultraviolet radiation induces the emission of nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx) from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) shoots when ambient concentrations drop below one part per billion. Although this contribution is insignificant on a local scale, our findings suggest that global NOx emissions from boreal coniferous forests may be comparable to those produced by worldwide industrial and traffic sources."

Its 1950 position is: α = 20 h 30 m 37.6 s ± 0.1 s, δ = + 40° 47′ 12.7″ ± 1.5″."

https://openalex.org/W1988687802,"METHANE is abundantly liberated by bacteria from the sediments of rivers and lakes1. If methane formation exceeds its solubility in water it is released into the atmosphere2. Several species of bacteria oxidize methane as an energy source, converting it into cellular materials or carbon dioxide gas3. Accumulation of carbon derived from methane is involved in the ageing of lakes because it causes some carbon to be recycled in the aquatic ecosystem rather than lost as gas. How much methane carbon is retained in the ecosystem and how much escapes into the atmosphere depends on conditions in the water. This report describes enhancement of bacterial methane utilization by clay mineral particles in a simulated aquatic ecosystem."

My observations4 and those of Kristian et al.1 show that in March, the time of eclipse of the secondary of LR Cen nearly coincided with that of Cen X–3. Also LR Cen and Cen X–3 both have orbits of low eccentricity; thus, LR Cen and Cen X–3 have similar positions, periods, phases and eccentricities."
