https://openalex.org/W2071598557,"Genetic studies have identified dozens of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) susceptibility genes, raising two critical questions: (1) do these genetic loci converge on specific biological processes, and (2) where does the phenotypic specificity of ASD arise, given its genetic overlap with intellectual disability (ID)? To address this, we mapped ASD and ID risk genes onto coexpression networks representing developmental trajectories and transcriptional profiles representing fetal and adult cortical laminae. ASD genes tightly coalesce in modules that implicate distinct biological functions during human cortical development, including early transcriptional regulation and synaptic development. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that translational regulation by FMRP and transcriptional coregulation by common transcription factors connect these processes. At a circuit level, ASD genes are enriched in superficial cortical layers and glutamatergic projection neurons. Furthermore, we show that the patterns of ASD and ID risk genes are distinct, providing a biological framework for further investigating the pathophysiology of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2009742334,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental syndrome of unknown etiology. Recent studies employing exome- and genome-wide sequencing have identified nine high-confidence ASD (hcASD) genes. Working from the hypothesis that ASD-associated mutations in these biologically pleiotropic genes will disrupt intersecting developmental processes to contribute to a common phenotype, we have attempted to identify time periods, brain regions, and cell types in which these genes converge. We have constructed coexpression networks based on the hcASD ""seed"" genes, leveraging a rich expression data set encompassing multiple human brain regions across human development and into adulthood. By assessing enrichment of an independent set of probable ASD (pASD) genes, derived from the same sequencing studies, we demonstrate a key point of convergence in midfetal layer 5/6 cortical projection neurons. This approach informs when, where, and in what cell types mutations in these specific genes may be productively studied to clarify ASD pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W1984373702,"ATR, activated by replication stress, protects replication forks locally and suppresses origin firing globally. Here, we show that these functions of ATR are mechanistically coupled. Although initially stable, stalled forks in ATR-deficient cells undergo nucleus-wide breakage after unscheduled origin firing generates an excess of single-stranded DNA that exhausts the nuclear pool of RPA. Partial reduction of RPA accelerated fork breakage, and forced elevation of RPA was sufficient to delay such “replication catastrophe” even in the absence of ATR activity. Conversely, unscheduled origin firing induced breakage of stalled forks even in cells with active ATR. Thus, ATR-mediated suppression of dormant origins shields active forks against irreversible breakage via preventing exhaustion of nuclear RPA. This study elucidates how replicating genomes avoid destabilizing DNA damage. Because cancer cells commonly feature intrinsically high replication stress, this study also provides a molecular rationale for their hypersensitivity to ATR inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2062821957,"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most ubiquitous mRNA base modification, but little is known about its precise location, temporal dynamics, and regulation. Here, we generated genomic maps of m(6)A sites in meiotic yeast transcripts at nearly single-nucleotide resolution, identifying 1,308 putatively methylated sites within 1,183 transcripts. We validated eight out of eight methylation sites in different genes with direct genetic analysis, demonstrated that methylated sites are significantly conserved in a related species, and built a model that predicts methylated sites directly from sequence. Sites vary in their methylation profiles along a dense meiotic time course and are regulated both locally, via predictable methylatability of each site, and globally, through the core meiotic circuitry. The methyltransferase complex components localize to the yeast nucleolus, and this localization is essential for mRNA methylation. Our data illuminate a conserved, dynamically regulated methylation program in yeast meiosis and provide an important resource for studying the function of this epitranscriptomic modification."
https://openalex.org/W2093140735,"The low-complexity (LC) domains of the products of the fused in sarcoma (FUS), Ewings sarcoma (EWS), and TAF15 genes are translocated onto a variety of different DNA-binding domains and thereby assist in driving the formation of cancerous cells. In the context of the translocated fusion proteins, these LC sequences function as transcriptional activation domains. Here, we show that polymeric fibers formed from these LC domains directly bind the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II in a manner reversible by phosphorylation of the iterated, heptad repeats of the CTD. Mutational analysis indicates that the degree of binding between the CTD and the LC domain polymers correlates with the strength of transcriptional activation. These studies offer a simple means of conceptualizing how RNA polymerase II is recruited to active genes in its unphosphorylated state and released for elongation following phosphorylation of the CTD."
https://openalex.org/W2012991226,"There are few substantive methods to measure the health of the immune system, and the connection between immune strength and the viral component of the microbiome is poorly understood. Organ transplant recipients are treated with posttransplant therapies that combine immunosuppressive and antiviral drugs, offering a window into the effects of immune modulation on the virome. We used sequencing of cell-free DNA in plasma to investigate drug-virome interactions in a cohort of organ transplant recipients (656 samples, 96 patients) and find that antivirals and immunosuppressants strongly affect the structure of the virome in plasma. We observe marked virome compositional dynamics at the onset of the therapy and find that the total viral load increases with immunosuppression, whereas the bacterial component of the microbiome remains largely unaffected. The data provide insight into the relationship between the human virome, the state of the immune system, and the effects of pharmacological treatment and offer a potential application of the virome state to predict immunocompetence."
https://openalex.org/W2153790436,"Engineered dissipation is used to deterministically produce and stabilize entanglement between two trapped-ion quantum bits, independently of their initial states; the entanglement is stabilized even in the presence of experimental noise and decoherence. Entangled states are a key resource in fundamental quantum physics, quantum cryptography and quantum computation. It has been generally assumed that the creation of such states requires the avoidance of contact with a dissipative environment, and minimization of decoherence. Some studies have shown, however, that dissipative interactions can be used to preserve coherence, and in this issue of Nature two groups demonstrate this principle for continuously driven physical systems. Lin et al. use engineered dissipation to deterministically produce and stabilize entanglement between two trapped-ion qubits, independent of their initial state. Shankar et al. use an autonomous feedback scheme to counteract decoherence and demonstrate the stabilization of an entangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an arbitrary time. This approach may be applied to a broad range of experimental systems to achieve desired quantum dynamics or steady states. Entangled states are a key resource in fundamental quantum physics, quantum cryptography and quantum computation1. Introduction of controlled unitary processes—quantum gates—to a quantum system has so far been the most widely used method to create entanglement deterministically2. These processes require high-fidelity state preparation and minimization of the decoherence that inevitably arises from coupling between the system and the environment, and imperfect control of the system parameters. Here we combine unitary processes with engineered dissipation to deterministically produce and stabilize an approximate Bell state of two trapped-ion quantum bits (qubits), independent of their initial states. Compared with previous studies that involved dissipative entanglement of atomic ensembles3 or the application of sequences of multiple time-dependent gates to trapped ions4, we implement our combined process using trapped-ion qubits in a continuous time-independent fashion (analogous to optical pumping of atomic states). By continuously driving the system towards the steady state, entanglement is stabilized even in the presence of experimental noise and decoherence. Our demonstration of an entangled steady state of two qubits represents a step towards dissipative state engineering, dissipative quantum computation and dissipative phase transitions5,6,7. Following this approach, engineered coupling to the environment may be applied to a broad range of experimental systems to achieve desired quantum dynamics or steady states. Indeed, concurrently with this work, an entangled steady state of two superconducting qubits was demonstrated using dissipation8."
https://openalex.org/W2091264505,"An increasing body of evidence points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Recent studies of the Parkinson's disease associated genes PINK1 (ref. 2) and parkin (PARK2, ref. 3) indicate that they may act in a quality control pathway preventing the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Here we elucidate regulators that have an impact on parkin translocation to damaged mitochondria with genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens coupled to high-content microscopy. Screening yielded gene candidates involved in diverse cellular processes that were subsequently validated in low-throughput assays. This led to characterization of TOMM7 as essential for stabilizing PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane following mitochondrial damage. We also discovered that HSPA1L (HSP70 family member) and BAG4 have mutually opposing roles in the regulation of parkin translocation. The screens revealed that SIAH3, found to localize to mitochondria, inhibits PINK1 accumulation after mitochondrial insult, reducing parkin translocation. Overall, our screens provide a rich resource to understand mitochondrial quality control."
https://openalex.org/W2091680313,"Lateral habenula (LHb) neurons convey aversive and negative reward conditions through potent indirect inhibition of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons. Although VTA dopaminergic neurons reciprocally project to the LHb, the electrophysiological properties and the behavioral consequences associated with selective manipulations of this circuit are unknown. Here, we identify an inhibitory input to the LHb arising from a unique population of VTA neurons expressing dopaminergic markers. Optogenetic activation of this circuit resulted in no detectable dopamine release in LHb brain slices. Instead, stimulation produced GABA-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission, which suppressed the firing of postsynaptic LHb neurons in brain slices and increased the spontaneous firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo activation of this pathway produced reward-related phenotypes that were dependent on intra-LHb GABAA receptor signaling. These results suggest that noncanonical inhibitory signaling by these hybrid dopaminergic-GABAergic neurons act to suppress LHb output under rewarding conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1516209748,"Quantum error-correction codes would protect an arbitrary state of a multi-qubit register against decoherence-induced errors, but their implementation is an outstanding challenge for the development of large-scale quantum computers. A first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a simple quantum system such as a qubit or a cavity mode in the presence of decoherence. Several groups have recently accomplished this goal using measurement-based feedback schemes. A next step is to prepare and stabilize a state of a composite system. Here we demonstrate the stabilization of an entangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an arbitrary time. Our result is achieved by an autonomous feedback scheme which combines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling between the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous feedback techniques have recently been used for qubit reset and the stabilization of a single qubit state, as well as for creating and stabilizing states of multipartite quantum systems. Unlike conventional, measurement-based schemes, an autonomous approach counter-intuitively uses engineered dissipation to fight decoherence, obviating the need for a complicated external feedback loop to correct errors, simplifying implementation. Instead the feedback loop is built into the Hamiltonian such that the steady state of the system in the presence of drives and dissipation is a Bell state, an essential building-block state for quantum information processing. Such autonomous schemes, broadly applicable to a variety of physical systems as demonstrated by a concurrent publication with trapped ion qubits, will be an essential tool for the implementation of quantum-error correction."
https://openalex.org/W2106282816,"Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels catalyse rapid, highly selective influx of Ca2+ into cells despite a 70-fold higher extracellular concentration of Na+. How CaV channels solve this fundamental biophysical problem remains unclear. Here we report physiological and crystallographic analyses of a calcium selectivity filter constructed in the homotetrameric bacterial NaV channel NaVAb. Our results reveal interactions of hydrated Ca2+ with two high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites followed by a third lower-affinity site that would coordinate Ca2+ as it moves inward. At the selectivity filter entry, Site 1 is formed by four carboxyl side chains, which have a critical role in determining Ca2+ selectivity. Four carboxyls plus four backbone carbonyls form Site 2, which is targeted by the blocking cations Cd2+ and Mn2+, with single occupancy. The lower-affinity Site 3 is formed by four backbone carbonyls alone, which mediate exit into the central cavity. This pore architecture suggests a conduction pathway involving transitions between two main states with one or two hydrated Ca2+ ions bound in the selectivity filter and supports a ‘knock-off’ mechanism of ion permeation through a stepwise-binding process. The multi-ion selectivity filter of our CaVAb model establishes a structural framework for understanding the mechanisms of ion selectivity and conductance by vertebrate CaV channels. X-ray crystal structures of a voltage-gated Na+channel mutated to be highly Ca2+selective provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of ion selectivity and conductance in vertebrate voltage-gated Ca2+channels. Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels show remarkable selectivity, facilitating the import of Ca2+ from an extracellular medium where the Na+ concentration is 70-fold higher than that of Ca2+. How CaV channels solve this fundamental biophysical problem remains unclear. This study presents several X-ray crystal structures of the full-length tetrameric bacterial NaV channel engineered through mutations to act as a highly selective voltage-gated calcium channel. The structures reveal that there are three Ca2+-binding sites in the pore: two high-affinity Ca2+-binding sites, and a lower-affinity site that Ca2+ occupies as it moves through the pore. The Ca2+ ions remain nearly fully hydrated as they pass through the channel, which is completely contrary to the textbook picture of fully dehydrated metal ions binding to amino acid side chains or backbone carbonyl groups lining the selectivity filter."
https://openalex.org/W2015493376,"Gains and losses in DNA methylation are prominent features of mammalian cell types. To gain insight into the mechanisms that promote shifts in DNA methylation and contribute to changes in cell fate, including malignant transformation, we performed genome-wide mapping of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in purified mouse hematopoietic stem cells. We discovered extended regions of low methylation (canyons) that span conserved domains frequently containing transcription factors and are distinct from CpG islands and shores. About half of the genes in these methylation canyons are coated with repressive histone marks, whereas the remainder are covered by activating histone marks and are highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Canyon borders are demarked by 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and become eroded in the absence of DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a). Genes dysregulated in human leukemias are enriched for canyon-associated genes. The new epigenetic landscape we describe may provide a mechanism for the regulation of hematopoiesis and may contribute to leukemia development."
https://openalex.org/W2074434145,"Salamanders regenerate appendages via a progenitor pool called the blastema. The cellular mechanisms underlying regeneration of muscle have been much debated but have remained unclear. Here we applied Cre-loxP genetic fate mapping to skeletal muscle during limb regeneration in two salamander species, Notophthalmus viridescens (newt) and Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl). Remarkably, we found that myofiber dedifferentiation is an integral part of limb regeneration in the newt, but not in axolotl. In the newt, myofiber fragmentation results in proliferating, PAX7(-) mononuclear cells in the blastema that give rise to the skeletal muscle in the new limb. In contrast, myofibers in axolotl do not generate proliferating cells, and do not contribute to newly regenerated muscle; instead, resident PAX7(+) cells provide the regeneration activity. Our results therefore show significant diversity in limb muscle regeneration mechanisms among salamanders and suggest that multiple strategies may be feasible for inducing regeneration in other species, including mammals."

https://openalex.org/W2037858585,"The carboxysome is a protein-based organelle for carbon fixation in cyanobacteria, keystone organisms in the global carbon cycle. It is composed of thousands of subunits including hexameric and pentameric proteins that form a shell to encapsulate the enzymes ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase. Here, we describe the stages of carboxysome assembly and the requisite gene products necessary for progression through each. Our results demonstrate that, unlike membrane-bound organelles of eukaryotes, in carboxysomes the interior of the compartment forms first, at a distinct site within the cell. Subsequently, shell proteins encapsulate this procarboxysome, inducing budding and distribution of functional organelles within the cell. We propose that the principles of carboxysome assembly that we have uncovered extend to diverse bacterial microcompartments."
https://openalex.org/W1981726470,"In forebrain neurons, knockout of synaptotagmin-1 blocks fast Ca(2+)-triggered synchronous neurotransmitter release but enables manifestation of slow Ca(2+)-triggered asynchronous release. Here, we show using single-cell PCR that individual hippocampal neurons abundantly coexpress two Ca(2+)-binding synaptotagmin isoforms, synaptotagmin-1 and synaptotagmin-7. In synaptotagmin-1-deficient synapses of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, loss of function of synaptotagmin-7 suppressed asynchronous release. This phenotype was rescued by wild-type but not mutant synaptotagmin-7 lacking functional Ca(2+)-binding sites. Even in synaptotagmin-1-containing neurons, synaptotagmin-7 ablation partly impaired asynchronous release induced by extended high-frequency stimulus trains. Synaptotagmins bind Ca(2+) via two C2 domains, the C2A and C2B domains. Surprisingly, synaptotagmin-7 function selectively required its C2A domain Ca(2+)-binding sites, whereas synaptotagmin-1 function required its C2B domain Ca(2+)-binding sites. Our data show that nearly all Ca(2+)-triggered release at a synapse is due to synaptotagmins, with synaptotagmin-7 mediating a slower form of Ca(2+)-triggered release that is normally occluded by faster synaptotagmin-1-induced release but becomes manifest upon synaptotagmin-1 deletion."

Their comparative analysis across cetaceans provides insights into adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle. The shift from terrestrial to aquatic life by whales was a substantial evolutionary event. Here we report the whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembly of the minke whale genome, as well as the whole-genome sequences of three minke whales, a fin whale, a bottlenose dolphin and a finless porpoise. Our comparative genomic analysis identified an expansion in the whale lineage of gene families associated with stress-responsive proteins and anaerobic metabolism, whereas gene families related to body hair and sensory receptors were contracted. Our analysis also identified whale-specific mutations in genes encoding antioxidants and enzymes controlling blood pressure and salt concentration. Overall the whale-genome sequences exhibited distinct features that are associated with the physiological and morphological changes needed for life in an aquatic environment, marked by resistance to physiological stresses caused by a lack of oxygen, increased amounts of reactive oxygen species and high salt levels."
https://openalex.org/W2046457054,"In this Resource, the authors generate a genome-wide methylation profile of DNA from the normal-appearing white matter of control and multiple sclerosis–affected brains and find subtle, but widely distributed, differences. In particular, they report that hypermethylated genes that regulate oligodendrocyte survival are also transcriptionally downregulated. Using the Illumina 450K array and a stringent statistical analysis with age and gender correction, we report genome-wide differences in DNA methylation between pathology-free regions derived from human multiple sclerosis–affected and control brains. Differences were subtle, but widespread and reproducible in an independent validation cohort. The transcriptional consequences of differential DNA methylation were further defined by genome-wide RNA-sequencing analysis and validated in two independent cohorts. Genes regulating oligodendrocyte survival, such as BCL2L2 and NDRG1, were hypermethylated and expressed at lower levels in multiple sclerosis–affected brains than in controls, while genes related to proteolytic processing (for example, LGMN, CTSZ) were hypomethylated and expressed at higher levels. These results were not due to differences in cellular composition between multiple sclerosis and controls. Thus, epigenomic changes in genes affecting oligodendrocyte susceptibility to damage are detected in pathology-free areas of multiple sclerosis–affected brains."

We studied the role of these neurotransmitters in probabilistic reversal learning in nearly 700 individuals as a function of two polymorphisms in the genes encoding the serotonin and dopamine transporters (SERT: 5HTTLPR plus rs25531; DAT1 3′UTR VNTR). A double dissociation was observed. The SERT polymorphism altered behavioral adaptation after losses, with increased lose-shift associated with L′ homozygosity, while leaving unaffected perseveration after reversal. In contrast, the DAT1 genotype affected the influence of prior choices on perseveration, while leaving lose-shifting unaltered. A model of reinforcement learning captured the dose-dependent effect of DAT1 genotype, such that an increasing number of 9R-alleles resulted in a stronger reliance on previous experience and therefore reluctance to update learned associations.

These data provide direct evidence for doubly dissociable effects of serotonin and dopamine systems. Dopamine and serotonin have both long been implicated in behavioral control and decision-making. One central idea is that these neurotransmitters are involved in learning from reinforcement. This theory is most strongly supported by experimental findings on dopamine, where notable progress has been made in the last two decades. Groundbreaking electrophysiological studies showed that dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain increase firing to outcomes that exceed expectations (Fiorillo et al., 2003Fiorillo C.D. Tobler P.N.

Advances in theoretical modeling then envisioned phasic dopamine responses as a reinforcement signal, “stamping in” successful operant responses (Frank et al., 2004Frank M.J. Seeberger L.C.

Pharmacological and fMRI studies in humans support this idea, showing that dopaminergic drugs enhance relative learning from reward compared to punishments in both healthy individuals (Cools et al., 2009Cools R.

Although there is no similarly well-developed theoretical or formal framework for guiding and interpreting empirical research on serotonin, serotonin has been most closely associated with learning from negative events. For example, after administration of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram, healthy subjects shift away more frequently from a stimulus that resulted in a loss (Chamberlain et al., 2006Chamberlain S.R. Müller U. Blackwell A.D. Clark L. Robbins T.W. Sahakian B.J. Neurochemical modulation of response inhibition and probabilistic learning in humans.Science. 2006; 311: 861-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and lowering levels of serotonin using dietary tryptophan depletion selectively improves the prediction of punishments (Cools et al., 2008bCools R.

Acute tryptophan depletion in healthy volunteers enhances punishment prediction but does not affect reward prediction.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2008; 33: 2291-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). More specifically, serotonin has been associated with the inhibition of punished behaviors (Crockett et al., 2009Crockett M.J. Clark L. Robbins T.W.

It was recently suggested that their actions are characterized by mutual opponency (Boureau and Dayan, 2011Boureau Y.L. Dayan P.

Kakade S. Dayan P. Opponent interactions between serotonin and dopamine.Neural Netw. 2002; 15: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). However, both neuromodulators have also been implicated in another key set of behaviors, namely the ability to flexibly change behavior. In order to successfully interact with our environment, it is important to be able to ignore rare events in a stable environment, yet to flexibly update our beliefs when our environment changes. Such an optimal balance of cognitive stability and flexibility depends on successful integration the consequences of our actions over a longer timescale. Perseverative behavior is the tendency to stick to a particular choice independent of, or even in spite of, contrary evidence and reflects the failure to flexibly adapt. Dopamine manipulations in both rodents and humans selectively altered behavior and neural processes associated with the ability to reverse previously rewarded choices (Boulougouris et al., 2009Boulougouris V.

These two functions of learning from reinforcement versus behavioral flexibility can perhaps be reconciled if we view perseveration as another manifestation of reinforcement-like effects that are accumulated during the prereversal phase. In other words, they might provide a different window on the same underlying functionality. In the present study, we take a behavioral genetics approach to study the role of serotonin and dopamine in human decision making. The advantage of this approach over pharmacological studies is that it allowed us to test effects of both transmitter systems within single individuals, in a single session and in a large cohort. In this study, we pit against each other polymorphisms that affect dopamine and serotonin function to assess their dissociable and opponent roles in decision making. We investigate effects of polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the serotonin and dopamine transporter genes: the SLC6A4/SERT/5HTT-length polymorphism (5HTTLPR) combination with a single nucleotide polymorphism within the repeat (rs25531) and a variable repeat in the 3′ regulatory region of SLC6A3/DAT1. Although the exact functional consequences of these polymorphisms on serotonin and dopamine transmission are as yet unclear, evidence from multiple sources confirms that these polymorphisms can be used to investigate effects of the dopamine and serotonin systems. In vitro, the DAT1 and SERT polymorphisms cause natural variation in the expression levels of these transporters (Hu et al., 2006Hu X.Z. Lipsky R.H. Zhu G. Akhtar L.A. Taubman J. Greenberg B.D. Xu K.

In addition, PET/SPECT studies in humans have shown reduced SERT binding in S′-carriers (Willeit and Praschak-Rieder, 2010Willeit M. Praschak-Rieder N.

To independently assess the effects of serotonin and dopamine on both immediate effects of reinforcement on subsequent choices and on longer-term behavioral flexibility, we use a probabilistic reversal learning paradigm. First, to examine direct outcome reactivity, we assess the tendency to locally shift responding immediately after negative feedback and to stick to a response after positive feedback. We hypothesize that the SERT polymorphism will alter lose-shifting, whereas DAT1 variation will affect win-staying. Such behavior would be a direct manifestation of reinforcement properties hypothetically associated with either neurotransmitter, as embodied in Thorndike’s law of effect (Thorndike, 1911Thorndike E. Animal Intelligence: Experimental Studies. Macmillan, New York1911Crossref Google Scholar) or in computational models such as temporal difference learning. Second, we analyze the effects of the SERT and DAT1 polymorphisms on choices after reversal to assess perseveration. As mentioned above, perseveration might be an additional consequence of reinforcement, separate from any more local effects on win-stay/lose-shift behavior. In a reversal task, perseveration on a previously favored alternative following reversal might reflect the repeated reinforcement of that response accumulated during the prereversal phase. If a strongly stamped-in response tendency takes repeated trials before it is unlearned, then a reinforcement mechanism such as that associated with dopamine would give rise to perseveration at time of reversal. Another possibility is that perseveration occurs due to a failure to learn from the negative feedback that now follows a previously rewarded stimulus. We compare such potential perseveration mechanisms by fitting computational learning model to our data and subsequently test whether their estimated parameters are affected by genotype. Subjects (n = 810) completed a probabilistic reversal learning task (see Table S1, available online, for demographic information). On each trial, they selected one of two stimuli, which led probabilistically to either reward or punishment (Lawrence et al., 1999Lawrence A.D. Sahakian B.J. Rogers R.D. Hodge J.R. Robbins T.W. Discrimination, reversal, and shift learning in Huntington’s disease: mechanisms of impaired response selection.Neuropsychologia. 1999; 37: 1359-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). During the first 40 trials, stimulus A was usually rewarded (70%), but sometimes punished (30%), and vice versa for stimulus B. For the second 40 trials, these contingencies were reversed. Subjects were instructed to select the usually rewarded stimulus (for details see Experimental Procedures). All subjects were genotyped for SERT and DAT1 polymorphisms. Full behavioral, genetic, and demographic data were available for 685 participants, from which three subjects were excluded for failure to perform the task (for details on genotyping and exclusions see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). There was no significant difference between genotypes in gender distribution (both polymorphisms: χ2(2) < 4, p > 0.1). Our primary analysis focused on three main measures of interest: win-staying, lose-shifting (both as a function of the previous trial), and perseveration. Perseverative errors were defined as any sequence of two or more errors during the reversal phase. These three measures were included as within-subject measures in a repeated-measures ANOVA, together with the between-subject factors gender and learning criterion attainment, and covariates age and level of education (for control analyses of basic learning measures and covariates, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Figure S1, and Table S2). Both SERT and DAT1 selectively affected these three measures (SERT: F(3.7, 1189) = 3.38, p = 0.011, η2 = 0.010; DAT1: F(3.7,1189) = 3.07, p = 0.019, η2 = 0.09). Below, we explore the nature of these main effects of measures of interest. Consistent with our hypothesis, SERT affected the likelihood of shifting responses after punishment (F(20,661) = 5.80, p = 0.003, η2 = 0.017; Figure 2A). Pairwise post hoc comparisons revealed that L′ homozygotes exhibited increased lose-shift rate relative to the S′ carriers, whereas there was no difference between the S′ homozygotes and the heterozygotes (L′/L′ > S′/S′, p = 0.001; L′/L′ > S′/L′, p = 0.033; S′/S′ versus S′/L′, p = 0.15). Indeed, grouping S′-carriers versus L′-homozygotes does not alter significance (F(15,666) = 9.28, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.014). Conversely, there was no effect of SERT on win-stay rates (Figure 2B). In contrast to our hypothesis, DAT1 did not affect win-stay (or lose-shift) rates (Figures 2A and 2B). There were also no gene-gene interactions between the two polymorphisms for either win-stay or lose-shift (all F(20,661) < 1.5, p > 0.3, η2 < 0.001). There was no effect of gender, age, or education on win-stay or lose-shift (all tests: F(20,661) < 3, p > 0.1). As mentioned in the introduction, probabilistic discrimination and reversal tasks require subjects to ignore rare events in a stable environment, yet adjust their responses when the environment has changed. Therefore, we next assessed whether the SERT genotype affected response adaptation after any negative feedback, or whether this was specific to either the feedback validity or task epoch (acquisition or reversal). There was no interaction of SERT genotype with feedback validity (F(2,668) = 0.5, p = 0.6, η2 = 0.001), and SERT genotype significantly affected lose-shift whether feedback was invalid (F(2,668) = 4.8, p = 0.009, η2 = 0.014) or valid (F(2,668) = 5.3, p = 0.005, η2 = 0.016). This is not surprising, given that subjects are not aware of feedback validity. There was also no interaction of SERT genotype and task phase (F(2,668) = 1.9, p = 0.15, η2 = 0.006), and the effect of SERT genotype on lose-shift was significant during both the acquisition phase (F(2,668) = 6.3, p = 0.002, η2 = 0.018) and the reversal phase (F(2,668) = 3.1), p = 0.047, η2 = 0.009). A hierarchical regression analysis showed that DAT1 genotype significantly predicted the proportion of perseverative errors during the reversal phase, such that a higher ratio of 9R:10R alleles led to an increased number of perseverative errors (β = 0.084, t(671) = 2.22, p = 0.029) (Figure 2C). This effect was specific to perseveration, as evidenced by the finding that there was no effect of DAT1 on chance errors (t(671) = 0.07, p = 0.95) (Figure 2D), which were defined as single errors that occurred between two correct responses. Furthermore, there was an effect of DAT1 genotype on the interaction between perseveration and the choice history (rate of correct responses during acquisition; β = 0.10, t(671) = 2.72, p = 0.007) (Figure 2E), in the absence of a main effect of choice history on perseverative error rate (t(671) = 0.44, p = 0.66). Again, there was no such interaction for chance errors (t(671) = 1.5, p = 0.14). The DAT1 effects of choice history on perseveration were characterized by a dose-dependent reversal of their relationship: in 9R homozygotes perseveration increased with increasing number of correct choices during acquisition (β = −0.34, t(40) = 2.6, p = 0.013), whereas in heterozygotes there was no association (β = 0.061, t(221) = 0.89, p = 0.38), and in 10R homozygotes perseveration marginally decreased (β = −0.092, t(400) = −1.8, p = 0.069). We verified this effect against sensitivity to outliers using a robust regression, which confirmed the dose-response effects (9R9R, β = 0.062, t(40) = 2.31, p = 0.026; 9R10R, β = −0.008, t(221) = −0.61, p = 0.54; 10R10R: β = −0.024, t(400) = −2.7, p = 0.007). The SERT genotype did not affect any type of reversal errors (p > 0.5) (Figures 2C and 2D). In addition, sex, age, or education covariates did not explain a significant proportion of variance in any of the reversal error scores (R2 < 0.01, F(3,678) < 1.8; p > 0.1). In summary, the present data set reveals a double dissociation between effects of the SERT and DAT1 genotypes on reversal learning, with SERT altering global lose-shifting and DAT1 altering postreversal perseveration. In a final ANOVA, we ascertained that the relative difference in lose-shift and perseveration Z scores was predicted by the difference in SERT and DAT1 genotype (R2 = 0.16, F(5,676) < 25.5; p = 0.009). This significant interaction confirms the double dissociation between the two effects, with SERT affecting lose-shifting but not perseveration, and DAT1 affecting perseveration but not lose-shifting. We next used computational models to investigate the mechanisms that might underlie the DAT1 genotype results. Although DAT1 shows robust effects in our data set, the measure of perseveration to which it is related is relatively opaque, in contrast to the more direct measure of trial-by-trial switching with which SERT was associated. This opaqueness results from the fact that (perseveration) error scores require some form of “topdown” definition or knowledge by the experimenter, e.g., when the reversal, unbeknownst to the subject, has occurred. This has hampered comparison of previous studies of reversal learning studies, which have reported a veritable zoo of reversal error measures, such as errors to criterion, total reversal errors, maintenance errors, perseverative errors, learning errors, and chance errors. Models of reinforcement learning can provide a more principled approach to assessing behavior, because they are independent of such external definitions that the subject is unaware of (learning criterion, point of reversal). Instead, like for win-stay/lose-shift measures, they take into account only past choices and observed outcomes. We aimed to understand the process or mechanism underlying the effect of DAT1 on perseveration using a reinforcement learning model to examine how perseveration can arise from a learning process integrating reward over a longer timescale. For simplicity, we do not consider the more transparent SERT effects on lose-shift behavior here, although we have verified in simulations not reported here that our model captures them when it is augmented with an additional parameter that directly controls switching after losses, without affecting long-term value integration. In the context of reinforcement learning models, two features of the DAT1 effects are puzzling. First, the effect is selective to the reversal phase, and second, the relationship between performance in the acquisition and reversal phases reverses sign depending on genotype. A standard account such as a temporal-difference learning model predicts neither of these features because learning during both phases is driven by a common mechanism. Unaugmented, such a model predicts that errors on either phase should track one another. In particular, the learning rate parameter affects the acquisition and reversal equally, by speeding up or slowing down acquisition and updating of associations. The inverse temperature parameter also affects errors in both phases equally, where a decrease will lead to lead to more random (i.e., less value-driven) choices globally. Accordingly, we considered a model that generalizes temporal-difference learning to include an"

Defined populations of spinal interneurons have been linked to patterning circuits; however, neurons comprising the rhythm-generating kernel have remained elusive. Here, we identify an ipsilaterally projecting excitatory interneuron population, marked by the expression of Shox2 that overlaps partially with V2a interneurons. Optogenetic silencing or blocking synaptic output of Shox2 interneurons (INs) in transgenic mice perturbed rhythm without an effect on pattern generation, whereas ablation of the Shox2 IN subset coinciding with the V2a population was without effect. Most Shox2 INs are rhythmically active during locomotion and analysis of synaptic connectivity showed that Shox2 INs contact other Shox2 INs, commissural neurons, and motor neurons, with preference for flexor motor neurons. Our findings focus attention on a subset of Shox2 INs that appear to participate in the rhythm-generating kernel for spinal locomotion."

These streamlined elements require host factors to complete their life cycles, whereas hosts have developed mechanisms to combat retrotransposition's mutagenic effects. As such, endogenous L1 expression levels are extremely low, creating a roadblock for detailed interactomic analyses. Here, we describe a system to express and purify highly active L1 RNP complexes from human suspension cell culture and characterize the copurified proteome, identifying 37 high-confidence candidate interactors. These data sets include known interactors PABPC1 and MOV10 and, with in-cell imaging studies, suggest existence of at least three types of compositionally and functionally distinct L1 RNPs. Among the findings, UPF1, a key nonsense-mediated decay factor, and PCNA, the polymerase-delta-associated sliding DNA clamp, were identified and validated. PCNA interacts with ORF2p via a PIP box motif; mechanistic studies suggest that this occurs during or immediately after target-primed reverse transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2034575591,"Sequence polymorphisms linked to human diseases and phenotypes in genome-wide association studies often affect noncoding regions. A SNP within an intron of the gene encoding Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4), a transcription factor with no known role in melanocyte biology, is strongly associated with sensitivity of skin to sun exposure, freckles, blue eyes, and brown hair color. Here, we demonstrate that this SNP lies within an enhancer of IRF4 transcription in melanocytes. The allele associated with this pigmentation phenotype impairs binding of the TFAP2A transcription factor that, together with the melanocyte master regulator MITF, regulates activity of the enhancer. Assays in zebrafish and mice reveal that IRF4 cooperates with MITF to activate expression of Tyrosinase (TYR), an essential enzyme in melanin synthesis. Our findings provide a clear example of a noncoding polymorphism that affects a phenotype by modulating a developmental gene regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W1979032340,"Interactions among suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neurons are required for robust circadian rhythms entrained to local time. To investigate these signaling mechanisms, we developed a functional coupling assay that uniquely captures the dynamic process by which SCN neurons interact. As a population, SCN neurons typically display synchronized rhythms with similar peak times, but will peak 6-12 hr apart after in vivo exposure to long days. Once they are removed from these conditions, SCN neurons resynchronize through a phase-dependent coupling process mediated by both vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and GABAA signaling. Notably, GABAA signaling contributes to coupling when the SCN network is in an antiphase configuration, but opposes synchrony under steady-state conditions. Further, VIP acts together with GABAA signaling to couple the network in an antiphase configuration, but promotes synchrony under steady-state conditions by counteracting the actions of GABAA signaling. Thus, SCN neurons interact through nonredundant coupling mechanisms influenced by the state of the network."

We report that phasic optogenetic activation of this pathway increases BDNF amounts in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of socially stressed mice but not of stress-naive mice. This stress gating of BDNF signaling is mediated by corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) acting in the NAc. These results unravel a stress context-detecting function of the brain's mesolimbic circuit.

These mechanistic insights have been captured in two models: the interneuron network gamma (ING) and the pyramidal cell interneuron network gamma (PING) models of gamma-band synchronization. While in both, the inhibitory interneurons play a dominant role in generating the gamma rhythm, ING models (Whittington et al., 1995Whittington M.A. Traub R.D. Jefferys J.G.

PING models suggest that within the gamma cycle, pyramidal cells fire first and trigger the firing of inhibitory interneurons, leading to a characteristic average phase relation. This phase relationship is thought to be critical for the maintenance of gamma-band synchronization and has been confirmed in recordings from rat hippocampus (Csicsvari et al., 2003Csicsvari J.

Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials carry synchronized frequency information in active cortical networks.Neuron. 2005; 47: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), but not yet in monkey visual cortex, a prime model to study the putative role(s) of gamma-band synchronization. In awake monkey visual cortex, we can separate the effects of visual stimulation and attentional top-down control on the synchronization of putative pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons. Pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons can be tentatively separated in recordings from awake behaving monkeys by sorting spikes according to their waveform (e.g., Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Differential attention-dependent response modulation across cell classes in macaque visual area V4.Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Distributions of spike waveform across populations of neurons often have a characteristic bimodal shape, with broad spiking (BS) and narrow spiking (NS) cells typically labeled as putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons, respectively. We have applied this approach to data from simultaneous recordings of single unit activity (SUA), multiunit activity (MUA), and LFP from four nearby electrodes in area V4 of two monkeys performing a selective visual attention task. We recorded spiking activity of 64 isolated single units from area V4 in two awake macaque monkeys (M1 and M2). For each neuron, we normalized the average action potential (AP) waveform by dividing by its peak-to-trough amplitude. We then aligned the average AP waveforms’ peaks (Figure 1A). The distribution of AP peak-to-trough durations was bimodal (Figure 1B; p < 0.05, Hartigan’s dip test), as in a previous V4 study (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Differential attention-dependent response modulation across cell classes in macaque visual area V4.Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Neurons were classified as either NS or BS if their average AP’s peak-to-trough duration was smaller than 230 ms (n = 22) or larger than 260 ms (n = 40), respectively. NS cells had higher mean firing rates than BS cells in both the prestimulus and stimulus period (Figure 1C; randomization test, p < 0.05). In the autocorrelogram, BS cells had earlier median peak times than NS cells at respectively 4 ± 0.63 (±SEM) versus 22 ± 4.88 ms (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 62). In the interspike interval (ISI) distribution, BS and NS cells showed median peak times of 5 ± 1.38 and 12 ± 3.5 ms, respectively (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 62). BS cells showed relatively bursty firing patterns, with local variation (LV) (Shinomoto et al., 2009Shinomoto S. Kim H. Shimokawa T. Matsuno N. Funahashi S. Shima K. Fujita I. Tamura H. Doi T. Kawano K. et al.Relating neuronal firing patterns to functional differentiation of cerebral cortex.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000433Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) values significantly higher than one (median 1.58 ± 0.07, p < 0.001, rank Wilcoxon test) and higher than those of NS cells (median 1.02 ± 0.19, p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test, n = 62). The observed differences in ISI, autocorrelation peak times and burstiness during sustained visual stimulation are in good agreement with findings from the rodent hippocampus (Csicsvari et al., 1999Csicsvari J. Hirase H. Czurkó A. Mamiya A. Buzsáki G. Oscillatory coupling of hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons in the behaving Rat.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 274-287PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, these differences in waveform and spike train statistics suggest that our sample of NS cells mostly contained inhibitory interneurons, while our sample of BS cells mostly contained pyramidal cells (Barthó et al., 2004Barthó P.

We related spikes from isolated single units to the average LFP recorded simultaneously from up to four separate electrodes spaced at a fixed horizontal distance of 650–900 μm and a median vertical distance of 298 μm (with lower and upper quartiles of 144 and 585 μm). We quantified the precision of spike-LFP phase locking by using the spike-LFP pairwise phase consistency (PPC), a metric unbiased by spike rate or count (Vinck et al., 2012Vinck M. Battaglia F.P.

Pennartz C.M.A. The pairwise phase consistency: a bias-free measure of rhythmic neuronal synchronization.Neuroimage. 2010; 51: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). During the sustained visual stimulation period (>0.3 s after the onset of the stimulus grating, lasting until the first target or distracter change), spikes were strongly locked to LFP gamma-band oscillations (∼50 Hz; Figure 1D), consistent with Fries et al., 2001bFries P.

Modulation of oscillatory neuronal synchronization by selective visual attention.Science. 2001; 291: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar, Fries et al., 2008Fries P. Womelsdorf T.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4823-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Henceforth, we will investigate this gamma locking in more detail and report locking statistics for the 50 Hz bin, which approximately encompasses the 30–70 Hz interval due to spectral smoothing (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We found that gamma PPCs were almost twice as high for NS than BS cells (Figure 1D; p < 0.01, randomization test, NNS = 22, NBS = 39 for Figures 1D–1F; for monkeys M1 and M2 see Figures S1A, S1B, S2A, and S2B available online). The use of the PPC ensures that this difference is neither confounded by spike rate nor count. Irrespective of this, there might still be a physiological difference in locking strength between strongly and weakly firing units. To test whether the difference in gamma locking between NS and BS cells is due to such a physiological difference, we eliminated weakly firing BS cells until the mean firing rate was matched between BS and NS cells. After this rate stratification, NS cells still showed a stronger gamma locking than BS cells (BS: [mean PPC for high rate] = 3.1 × 10−3 ± 1.1 × 10−3, p < 0.05, randomization test, NBS = 17). Also, gamma PPC values were not correlated with AP waveform peak-to-trough duration (NS: Spearman ρ = −0.086, p = 0.7; BS: ρ = −0.16, p = 0.31), consistent with the notion that the separation based on waveform provided a separation into actual classes. Several factors influence the gamma locking of spikes. One important known factor is the precise cortical layer (Buffalo et al., 2011Buffalo E.A. Fries P. Landman R. Buschman T.J. Desimone R. Laminar differences in gamma and alpha coherence in the ventral stream.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), yet many other factors like the state of the animal might play a role. These factors might, in principle, be confounded with the probability of recording a BS versus an NS cell. And, even if they are not confounded, our limited sample size might lead to insufficient averaging-out of those factors. In order to assess the overall locking strength for a given recording site (and time, state, etc.), independent of the BS or NS characteristics of the recorded single unit, we analyzed the unsorted MUAs that were recorded from the same electrodes as the isolated units under consideration, while excluding the isolated single unit from the corresponding MUA. Based on the firing rates of MUA versus single units, we estimate that a typical MUA contained 10 to 20 single units, thereby providing a reasonable local average. Henceforth, we refer to these unsorted MUAs with the SUA excluded as the same-site MUAs. Same-site MUA PPCs did not differ between sites delivering isolated NS versus BS units (Figure 1E) (not significant [n.s.], bootstrap test). This suggests that the overall gamma locking did not differ between the recording locations of BS and NS cells. Please note that if the MUA from a BS or NS recording site had been biased to contain more BS or NS cells, this would have created similar differences for the same-site MUA as for the respective SUA analysis, which we did not find. Although the same-site MUA PPC did not differ between NS and BS cells, it is conceivable that same-site MUA PPC varied across sites. In order to eliminate the variability in PPCs across units that is caused by differences in recording location, we computed, for each unit separately, the SUA-MUA PPC difference. This measure is defined as the difference between a SUA’s PPC and its corresponding same-site MUA’s PPC [PPCSUA – PPCMUA], such that a value >0 indicates stronger spike-LFP locking for the SUA than its corresponding same-site MUA. SUA-MUA gamma PPC difference was higher for NS than BS cells (p < 0.05, randomization test) and significantly different from zero only for NS cells (p < 0.05, bootstrap test) (Figure 1F). Hence, it is unlikely that the observed difference in gamma PPC between NS and BS cells (Figure 1D) was caused by differences in recording locations. In neocortex, there are more BS than NS cells (Figure 1B, Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Differential attention-dependent response modulation across cell classes in macaque visual area V4.Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). However, NS cells have higher firing rates, such that the MUA may contain approximately equal proportions of NS and BS spikes. Based on these estimates, the MUA-LFP PPC is expected to attain PPC values in between the BS and NS cells’ PPC. In addition, we will demonstrate below that BS and NS cells lock on average to different gamma phases and that individual single units often lock to widely varying gamma phases. Assuming that our MUAs typically contained both BS and NS cells and individual cells that cover at least a small part of the overall intercell phase variance, this predicts that the MUA-LFP PPC is substantially smaller than the average PPC of its constituent SUAs, consistent with our observations. We found that NS cells were more gamma locked than BS cells during the sustained visual stimulation period. NS cells might also be more gamma locked than BS cells during network states in which cells receive only weak excitatory drive. Previous studies have shown that MUA-LFP gamma locking and LFP gamma power are weak in the absence of visual stimulation or in the presence of low-contrast visual stimuli in the RF (receptive field) (Fries et al., 2008Fries P.

Dynamic predictions: oscillations and synchrony in top-down processing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 704-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar have shown that MUA-LFP gamma locking can be reliably detected in the prestimulus period of the current task. We analyzed the prestimulus period separately for the fixation (Figures 2A and 2B ) and the cue period (Figures 2C and 2D; Figures 2E and 2F show both periods together for the lower frequencies). The fixation period started when the monkey had grasped the response bar and continued for >750 ms, ending with the appearance of the attentional cue. A cue period followed, lasting until the onset of a stimulus grating in the recorded neurons’ RFs (and the simultaneous onset of a grating outside the RF). BS cells exhibited much lower gamma PPCs in the fixation (mean ± SEM of [PPCstim – PPCfix] = 4.3 × 10−3 ± 1.0 × 10−3; p < 0.001, bootstrap test, n = 33) and the cue period (2.8 × 10−3 ± 0.7 × 10−3, p < 0.001, n = 33) than in the sustained stimulation period (Figures 2A and 2C). A potential concern is that prestimulus PPC may have been particularly variable because of low spike counts. To increase the relative contribution of cells with high spike counts, we computed weighted PPC group averages, with the relative contribution of a unit proportional to its spike count (Figures 2B and 2D; see also Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This analysis demonstrated that the relatively low BS cells’ gamma PPC values did not arise because of low spike counts, yet it did reveal a shallow bump in the PPC spectrum at gamma frequencies. The weak gamma locking of BS cells during the fixation and cue period contrasted sharply with the degree of gamma locking in NS cells. During the cue period, NS cells exhibited much stronger gamma locking than BS cells (p < 0.01, randomization test; Figure 2C), with NS gamma PPCs reaching levels similar to the sustained stimulation period (Figure 2C, mean of [PPCstim – PPCcue] = 0.61 × 10−3 ± 2.3 × 10−3, n = 17, n.s., bootstrap test). This observation held true when PPC averaging was weighted by firing rates (Figure 2D). This state of strong NS gamma locking in the cue period occurred despite much lower firing rates than in the stimulus period (Figure 1C). NS cells’ gamma PPCs were much higher in the cue (Figure 2C) than in the fixation period (Figure 2A; [PPCcue – PPCfix] = 4.0 × 10−3 ± 2.1 × 10−3, p < 0.01, bootstrap test, n = 15), and this difference in NS cells’ gamma PPCs occurred again in the absence of significant differences in firing rate between the fixation and cue period (Figure 1C; NS: p = 0.27 and p = 0.37 for rank Wilcoxon test on [FRcue − FRfix] and [(FRcue − FRfix)/(FRcue + FRfix)]; BS: p = 0.53 and p = 0.38 for same tests). Moreover, we did not find a correlation between a given NS cell’s gamma PPC value in the cue period, and its firing rate in the cue period relative to the fixation period [FRcue/FRfix] (p = 0.53, Spearman regression, n = 15). For some units (n = 9), attention was cued using a block design, i.e., without an “uncued” fixation period available. After inclusion of these units, we still found higher gamma PPC values for NS ([PPCstim – PPCcue] = 2.0 × 10−3 ± 2.3 × 10−3, n = 21, n.s., bootstrap test) than BS cells ([PPCstim – PPCcue] = 2.7 × 10−3 ± 0.97 × 10−3, p < 0.01, n = 37) in the cue period (Figures 3A and 3B ; p < 0.05, randomization test; for monkeys M1 and M2 see Figures S1A, S1B, and S3A–S3D). Hence, we included these units for further cue period analyses. To exclude the possibility that NS cells were recorded from sites where overall prestimulus spiking activity was more gamma locked, we computed the same-site MUA’s PPC and the SUA-MUA PPC difference. For recording sites delivering NS cells, cue period same-site MUA gamma PPCs (0.99 × 10−3 ± 0.32 × 10−3) were much smaller than NS gamma PPCs (Figures 3C–3E; p < 0.05, bootstrap test, n = 21). Same-site MUA gamma PPCs did not differ between sites corresponding to NS and BS units (Figure 3C; n.s., randomization test). Analysis of the LFP revealed a clear peak in LFP-LFP phase-coupling in the gamma-band both in the fixation and cue period (Figure S4A), despite no visible gamma peak in the LFP power spectrum (Figure S4C). LFP-LFP coupling values (Figure S4B) and gamma LFP power (Figure S4D) were increased in the cue relative to the fixation period. In sum, during the cue period, in the absence of a stimulus in the recorded neurons’ RFs, while BS cells showed only weak gamma locking, NS cells showed much stronger gamma locking, similar to the level observed with visual stimulation inside their RFs. This finding suggests that strong NS gamma locking in the cue period was not a mere consequence of an increase in the strength and rhythmicity of bottom-up synaptic inputs, but that it resulted most likely from top-down control. Moreover, this finding suggests that V4 NS cells can maintain strong gamma locking in network states where excitatory drive is weak and the recurrent excitatory inputs are only weakly gamma-band modulated. We next asked whether it is the same group of cells that exhibits ga"

These untoward effects are also the primary consequences of cannabis abuse. However, there are no currently FDA-approved effective medications for prevention and treatment of these cannabis-related disorders. As it is clear now, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) is the major psychoactive ingredient of marijuana (Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1964Gaoni Y. Mechoulam R.

Previous studies demonstrate that deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by Δ9-THC exposure are primarily mediated through CB1R expressed in the brain (Lichtman and Martin, 1996Lichtman A.H.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the synaptic and cognitive deficits elicited by repeated Δ9-THC exposure are largely unknown. In the present study, we unexpectedly observed that Δ9-THC increases expression and activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostanoids both in vitro and in vivo via a CB1R-dependent mechanism. This action is opposite to the observations where the endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) induces a CB1R-dependent suppression of COX-2 activity and expression in response to proinflammatory and excitotoxic insults (Zhang and Chen, 2008Zhang J. Chen C. Endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol protects neurons by limiting COX-2 elevation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22601-22611Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The differential modulation of COX-2 by the exogenous cannabinoid Δ9-THC and endogenous cannabinoid 2-AG appears to result from intrinsic properties of the CB1R-coupled G protein. The COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC is mediated via Gβγ subunits, whereas COX-2 suppression by 2-AG is mediated through the Gαi subunit. Interestingly, the impairments in hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity, spatial, and fear memories induced by repeated Δ9-THC exposure can be occluded or attenuated by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of COX-2. Finally, the beneficial effects of reducing Aβ and neurodegeneration by Δ9-THC are retained in the presence of COX-2 inhibition. Our results reveal a signaling pathway that is linked to synaptic and cognitive deficits induced by Δ9-THC exposure, suggesting that Δ9-THC would display its beneficial properties with fewer undesirable side effects when its COX-2 induction effect is inhibited, which may form a therapeutic intervention for medical treatments. Identification of CBRs led to discovery of several endogenous cannabinoids, including anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), which are the most-studied endocannabinoids involved in a variety of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological processes (Kano et al., 2009Kano M.

Rev. 2010; 62: 588-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). 2-AG, the most abundant endocannabinoid, plays significant roles in synaptic modification, resolution of neuroinflammation, and neuronal survival (Alger, 2009Alger B.E.

In particular, its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in response to proinflammatory and neurotoxic insults appear to be through limiting COX-2 signaling (Chen et al., 2011Chen X. Zhang J.

Because acute inhibition of COX-2 by selective COX-2 inhibitors has been shown to decrease hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and impairs memory consolidation (Chen et al., 2002Chen C.

Neurosci. 2008; 27: 2999-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we thus wondered whether impairments of synaptic plasticity and memory by marijuana result from a COX-2 suppressive effect. To assess this, we first analyzed hippocampal expression and activity of COX-2 in mice that received Δ9-THC. Unexpectedly, in vivo exposure to Δ9-THC produced a dose- and time-dependent induction of COX-2 in the brain, rather than suppression (Figures 1A and 1B ), whereas expression of COX-1 was unaffected by Δ9-THC (Figure S1A available online). The increase in COX-2 expression induced by Δ9-THC was accompanied by elevated production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which could be inhibited by the selective COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex or genetic inhibition of COX-2 (Figures 1C and S1B). To confirm the ability of exogenous cannabinoids to induce COX-2, we assessed COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in animals injected with the synthetic cannabinoid CP55,940 (CP). As expected, CP produced more pronounced effects on COX-2 expression and PGE2 synthesis (Figures S1C–S1E). The increase in PGE2 could be blocked by NS398, another selective COX-2 inhibitor. In addition, we observed that COX-2 expression was steadily elevated in animals injected with Δ9-THC once daily for 7 consecutive days, although the magnitude of increase in COX-2 was not as intensified as that of a single injection (Figure 1D). This indicates that expression of COX-2 is persistently elevated upon repeated exposure to Δ9-THC (Figure S7).Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Δ9-THC does not increase in COX-1 expression in the hippocampus.

Because undesirable side effects elicited by cannabinoids are primarily mediated by CB1R (Lichtman and Martin, 1996Lichtman A.H. Martin B.R.

As shown in Figures 1E and1F, Δ9-THC-induced increase in COX-2 in the hippocampus was blocked either by Rimonabant (RIM), a selective CB1R antagonist, or by genetic deletion of CB1R. To determine whether the increase in COX-2 by Δ9-THC occurs in neurons or astroglial cells, we made different conditions in cultures as described previously (Zhang and Chen, 2008Zhang J. Chen C. Endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol protects neurons by limiting COX-2 elevation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22601-22611Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found that, although Δ9-THC induced a CB1R-dependent increase in COX-2 expression both in neuronal and astroglial cell-enriched cultures, the increase was more pronounced in astroglial cell-enriched cultures than in neuronal culture (Figure 1G). Our data provide convincing evidence that COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC both in vivo and in vitro is mediated via CB1R. Because the suppression of COX-2 by 2-AG in response to proinflammatory stimuli occurs via a CB1R-dependent mechanism (Zhang and Chen, 2008Zhang J. Chen C. Endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol protects neurons by limiting COX-2 elevation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22601-22611Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we questioned why the exogenous cannabinoid Δ9-THC increases COX-2 and why the endogenous cannabinoid 2-AG suppresses COX-2 acting through the same CB1R-dependent mechanism, and we speculated that CB1R may not be the key molecule responsible for differential regulation of COX-2 expression upon exposure to cannabinoids. CB1R is coupled to a PTX-sensitive Gi/o protein, and activation of CB1R releases Gβγ subunits from the GTP-bound Gαi subunit (Howlett, 1998Howlett A.C. The CB1 cannabinoid receptor in the brain.Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 5: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Pertwee et al., 2010Pertwee R.G. Howlett A.C. Abood M.E. Alexander S.P.

Cannabinoid receptors and their ligands: beyond CB1 and CB2.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 588-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Earlier studies show that activation of CB1R is capable of inducing Gβγ-mediated response (Guo and Ikeda, 2004Guo J. Ikeda S.R.

USA. 2003; 100: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Gβγ and Gαi may differentially mediate COX-2 induction or suppression by exogenous Δ9-THC or endogenous 2-AG. To test this prediction, we first overexpressed Gβγ subunits by transfection with plasmids carrying β1 and γ2 subunits in NG108-15 cells, which express native CB1R (Figures S2A and S2B). Whereas Δ9-THC still increased expression of COX-2 mRNA in culture transfected with the control vector, it did not increase COX-2 in culture overexpressing β1 and γ2 subunits (Figure 2A). In subsequent experiments, β1 and γ2 subunits were silenced by small hairpin RNA (shRNA). Knockdown of β1γ2 by shRNA suppressing endogenous β1γ2 also blocked COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC in NG108-15 cells, and the blockade was rescued by concurrently expressing shRNA-resistant β1γ2 (Figures 2A and S2E). This indicates that COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC is likely mediated through Gβγ. To further confirm that Gβγ mediates COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC, we treated mixed culture of hippocampal neurons and astroglial cells (∼5%–10%) with a membrane-permeable Gβγ-binding peptide mSIRK to disrupt the function of Gβγ (Delaney et al., 2007Delaney A.J.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19634-19641Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a negative control, we used a variant mSIRK with a point mutation of Leu9 to Ala (L9A-mSIRK). As shown in Figure 2B, disruption of Gβγ activity by mSIRK also blocked COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC, whereas it failed to block the suppression of COX-2 by 2-AG in response to LPS, a commonly used COX-2 inducer (Zhang and Chen, 2008Zhang J. Chen C. Endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol protects neurons by limiting COX-2 elevation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22601-22611Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PTX treatment also blocked Δ9-THC-induced increase in COX-2. Interestingly, application of 2-AG failed to suppress Δ9-THC-induced increase in COX-2 (Figures 2B and S2I). To test the prediction that Gαi mediates COX-2 suppressive effect by 2-AG, we silenced Gαi using a lentiviral vector in mixed culture of neurons and astroglial cells (Figure S2C). As illustrated in Figures 2C and S2D, silencing Gαi1, but not Gαi2 or Gαi3, blocked the suppression of COX-2 by 2-AG in response to the LPS stimulus, and this blocking effect was rescued by concurrently expressing shRNA-resistant Gαi1 (Figures 2C and S2E). Knockdown of Gαi1, Gαi2, or Gαi3 did not block COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC (Figures 2C and S2D). These results indicate that COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC is likely mediated via Gβγ, whereas COX-2 suppression by 2-AG is likely mediated through Gαi1 (Figure S7).Figure 2Gβγ Subunits Mediate Δ9-THC-Elevated COX-2 ExpressionShow full caption(A) Overexpression or knockdown of β1 and γ2 subunits eliminates Δ9-THC-increased COX-2 mRNA detected by qPCR in NG108-15 cells.

Right: Δ9-THC-induced NF-кB phosphorylation and COX-2 expression are blocked by IKKβ inhibition in mixed culture of neurons and astroglial cells. See also Figures S2 and S7. To determine downstream signaling pathways of Gβγ, we detected phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and p38MAPK by overexpression or knockdown of Gβγ in the presence and absence of Δ9-THC. As shown in Figures 2D and S2F, Δ9-THC induced phosphorylation of these signaling molecules, and the phosphorylation was inhibited by knockdown or overexpression of Gβ1γ2. Inhibition of phosphorylation of these mediators by shRNA was rescued by concurrently expressing shRNA-resistant Gβ1γ2 (Figure 2D). These data indicate that COX-2 induction by Δ9-THC is likely through signaling of these downstream molecules of Gβγ. To further characterize this signaling pathway that regulates COX-2 expression by Δ9-THC, we targeted NF-кB, which is a transcription factor regulating expression of genes, including the COX-2 gene (ptgs2). We observed that Δ9-THC induced NF-кB phosphorylation in NG-108-15 cells, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by overexpression or knockdown of Gβγ and was rescued by concurrently expressing shRNA-resistant G β1γ2 (Figures 2E and S2G). To determine regulation of COX-2 transcription by NF-кB, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in mixed culture of neurons and astroglial cells. As shown in Figure 2E, a binding activity of NF-кB p65 was detected in the promoter positions (−419 to −428 bp) of ptgs2, and this interaction was enhanced by Δ9-THC and inhibited by SC-514, a specific IKKβ inhibitor that inhibits p65-associated transcriptional activation of the NF-кB pathway. To further confirm the involvement of NF-кB in Δ9-THC-induced increase in COX-2, COX-2 expression and NF-кB phosphorylation by Δ9-THC were determined in the absence and presence of SC-514. Inhibition of IKKβ blocked Δ9-THC-induced COX-2 and NF-кB phosphorylation (Figure 2E). Phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, p38MAPK, and NF-кB was confirmed in the hippocampus of animals that received Δ9-THC (Figure S2H). If sustained elevation of COX-2 expression and activity following repeated Δ9-THC exposure contribute to impairments in long-term synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, then inhibition of COX-2 should be able to eliminate or attenuate the impairments. To test this hypothesis, we recorded hippocampal LTP in mice receiving daily injections of Δ9-THC (10 mg/kg, the dosage used by other studies such as Fan et al., 2010Fan N. Yang H. Zhang J. Chen C.

Long noncoding RNAs: functional surprises from the RNA world.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1494-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar), it’s unclear whether most intergenic transcription is regulated or has cellular function. Recent evidence has shown that most intergenic transcription occurs near or is associated with gene transcription, such as transcription from promoter and enhancer regions (Sigova et al., 2013Sigova A.A. Mullen A.C. Molinie B. Gupta S. Orlando D.A. Guenther M.G. Almada A.E. Lin C. Sharp P.A. Giallourakis C.C. Young R.A.

The majority of mammalian promoters direct transcription initiation on both sides with opposite orientations, a phenomenon known as divergent transcription (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J.

Divergent transcription generates upstream antisense RNAs (uaRNAs, or PROMPTs, promoter upstream transcripts) near the 5′ end of genes that are typically short (50–2,000 nucleotides) and relatively unstable (Flynn et al., 2011Flynn R.A.

Similar divergent transcription also occurs at distal enhancer regions, giving rise to RNAs termed enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) (Kim et al., 2010Kim T.-K. Hemberg M. Gray J.M. Costa A.M. Bear D.M. Wu J. Harmin D.A. Laptewicz M. Barbara-Haley K.

A large fraction of extragenic RNA pol II transcription sites overlap enhancers.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000384Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells, most long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs, longer than 100 nucleotides) are associated with protein-coding genes, including ∼50% as uaRNAs and ∼20% as eRNAs (Sigova et al., 2013Sigova A.A. Mullen A.C. Molinie B. Gupta S. Orlando D.A. Guenther M.G. Almada A.E. Lin C. Sharp P.A. Giallourakis C.C. Young R.A. Divergent transcription of long noncoding RNA/mRNA gene pairs in embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 2876-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that divergent transcription from promoters and enhancers of protein-coding genes is the major source of intergenic transcription in ES cells. In the textbook model of a eukaryotic promoter, the directionality is set by the arrangement of an upstream cis-element region followed by a core promoter (Figure 1A). The cis-elements are bound by sequence-specific transcription factors, whereas the core promoter is bound by TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other factors that recruit the core transcription machinery. Most mammalian promoters lack a TATA element (TATA-less) and are CpG rich (Sandelin et al., 2007Sandelin A. Carninci P. Lenhard B. Ponjavic J. Hayashizaki Y. Hume D.A. Mammalian RNA polymerase II core promoters: insights from genome-wide studies.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 424-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). For these promoters, TBP is recruited through sequence-specific transcription factors such as Sp1 that bind CpG-rich sequences and components of the TFIID complex that have little sequence specificity. Thus, in the absence of strong TATA elements such as for CpG island promoters, TBP-complexes are recruited on both sides of the transcription factors to form preinitiation complexes in both orientations (Figure 1B). This model is supported by the observation that divergent transcription occurs at most promoters that are associated with CpG islands in mammals, whereas promoters with TATA elements in mammals and worm are associated with unidirectional transcription (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T. Nascent RNA sequencing reveals widespread pausing and divergent initiation at human promoters.Science. 2008; 322: 1845-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, Kruesi et al., 2013Kruesi W.S.

Condensin controls recruitment of RNA polymerase II to achieve nematode X-chromosome dosage compensation.Elife. 2013; 2 (e00808–e00808)Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, divergent transcription is less common in Drosophila where CpG islands are rare (Core et al., 2012Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Gilchrist D.A. Fargo D.C. Kwak H. Adelman K. Lis J.T. Defining the status of RNA polymerase at promoters.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 1025-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Since transcription factors with chromatin remodeling potential and transcription activation domains also bind at enhancer sites, it is not surprising that these are also sites of divergent transcription. In fact, promoters and enhancers have many properties in common, and it has been shown recently that many intragenic enhancers can act as alternative promoters producing tissue-specific lncRNAs (Kowalczyk et al., 2012Kowalczyk M.S. Hughes J.R. Garrick D. Lynch M.D. Sharpe J.A. Sloane-Stanley J.A. McGowan S.J. De Gobbi M. Hosseini M. Vernimmen D. et al.Intragenic enhancers act as alternative promoters.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Promoter-proximal noncoding transcription in both yeast and mammals has been shown to be suppressed at the chromatin level, including nucleosome remodeling (Whitehouse et al., 2007Whitehouse I. Rando O.J. Delrow J. Tsukiyama T. Chromatin remodelling at promoters suppresses antisense transcription.Nature. 2007; 450: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), histone deacetylation (Churchman and Weissman, 2011Churchman L.S. Weissman J.S. Nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription at nucleotide resolution.Nature. 2011; 469: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and gene loop formation (Tan-Wong et al., 2012Tan-Wong S.M. Zaugg J.B. Camblong J. Xu Z. Zhang D.W. Mischo H.E. Ansari A.Z. Luscombe N.M. Steinmetz L.M. Proudfoot N.J. Gene loops enhance transcriptional directionality.Science. 2012; 338: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We and others recently found that in mammals promoter upstream antisense transcription is frequently terminated due to cleavage of the nascent RNA by the same process responsible for the generation of the poly A tract at the 3′ ends of genes (Almada et al., 2013Almada A.E. Wu X. Kriz A.J. Burge C.B. Sharp P.A. Promoter directionality is controlled by U1 snRNP and polyadenylation signals.Nature. 2013; 499: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, Ntini et al., 2013Ntini E. Järvelin A.I. Bornholdt J. Chen Y. Boyd M. Jørgensen M. Andersson R. Hoof I. Schein A. Andersen P.R. et al.Polyadenylation site-induced decay of upstream transcripts enforces promoter directionality.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In both cases, the primary signal directing this process is the poly (A) signal (PAS) motif, AAUAAA or similar (Proudfoot, 2011Proudfoot N.J. Ending the message: poly(A) signals then and now.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 1770-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Pol II terminates transcription within several kb after such cleavage (Anamika et al., 2012Anamika K. Gyenis À. Poidevin L. Poch O. Tora L. RNA polymerase II pausing downstream of core histone genes is different from genes producing polyadenylated transcripts.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e38769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Richard and Manley, 2009Richard P. Manley J.L. Transcription termination by nuclear RNA polymerases.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1247-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Computational analysis showed that relative to the 5′ end of the sense regions, PAS motifs are enriched, whereas potential U1 snRNP-binding sites, or 5′ splice site-like sequences, are depleted in the upstream antisense regions. The binding of U1 snRNP is known to suppress PAS-directed cleavage over regions of thousand nucleotides downstream (Berg et al., 2012Berg M.G. Singh L.N. Younis I. Liu Q. Pinto A.M. Kaida D. Zhang Z. Cho S. Sherrill-Mix S. Wan L. Dreyfuss G. U1 snRNP determines mRNA length and regulates isoform expression.Cell. 2012; 150: 53-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, Kaida et al., 2010Kaida D. Berg M.G. Younis I. Kasim M. Singh L.N. Wan L. Dreyfuss G. U1 snRNP protects pre-mRNAs from premature cleavage and polyadenylation.Nature. 2010; 468: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, the bias in the distribution of U1 snRNP-binding sites and PAS promotes expression of full-length mRNAs by suppressing premature cleavage and polyadenylation but favors early termination of uaRNAs. This conclusion is strongly supported by the finding that inhibition of U1 snRNP dramatically increased termination and polyadenylation of sense-oriented transcripts in the gene region (Almada et al., 2013Almada A.E. Wu X. Kriz A.J. Burge C.B. Sharp P.A. Promoter directionality is controlled by U1 snRNP and polyadenylation signals.Nature. 2013; 499: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). If the U1-PAS axis defines the length of a transcribed region, then it might be expected that for a typical protein-coding gene (∼20 kb) to evolve from intergenic noncoding DNA would involve strengthening of the U1-PAS axis by gaining U1 sites and losing PAS in the sense orientation. Examining the distributions of U1 and PAS sites in bidirectional promoters involving UCSC-annotated mRNA-mRNA, mRNA-lncRNA, and mRNA-uaRNA pairs, we found that lncRNAs showed properties resembling intermediates between mRNA genes and uaRNA regions in terms of the density of U1 sites and PAS sites (Almada et al., 2013Almada A.E. Wu X. Kriz A.J. Burge C.B. Sharp P.A. Promoter directionality is controlled by U1 snRNP and polyadenylation signals.Nature. 2013; 499: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). That is, the density of PAS decreases from regions producing uaRNA to lncRNA to mRNA, whereas U1 sites show the opposite trend, consistent with the differences in the length and abundance of these transcripts. We also studied the evolution of the U1-PAS axis in vertebrates, and found that older genes exhibit progressive gain of U1 sites and loss of PAS sites at their 5′ ends. Together these observations suggest that strengthening of the U1-PAS axis may be associated with the origination and maturation of genes. Below we propose a model (Figure 2) arguing that the act of transcription in germ cells strengthens the U1-PAS axis in the upstream antisense region of an active gene, or the associated enhancer regions, creating a feedback loop amplifying transcription activity, which eventually may drive origination of a new antisense-oriented gene (Figure 3).Figure 3Divergent Transcription Drives New Gene OriginationShow full caption(A–F) De novo protein-coding gene origination (A–E), and gene duplication or translocation (F).

Thin and thick blocks represent transcribed noncoding and coding regions, respectively. One consequence of transcription is that it can cause mutations, especially on the coding (nontranscribed) strand. During transcription, transient R loops can be formed behind the transcribing RNA polymerase II, exposing the coding strand as single-stranded DNA, whereas the noncoding strand is base paired with and thus protected by the nascent RNA (Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012Aguilera A. García-Muse T. R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The lack of splicing signals in the divergent transcript also makes it more vulnerable to R loop formation, as splicing factors have been implicated in suppressing R loop formation (Li and Manley, 2006Li X. Manley J.L. Cotranscriptional processes and their influence on genome stability.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1838-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Li and Manley, 2005Li X.L. Manley J.L.

Cell. 2009; 35: 228-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In addition, divergent transcription generates negative supercoiling at promoters, which facilitates DNA unwinding and promotes R loop formation (Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012Aguilera A. García-Muse T. R loops: from transcription byproducts to threats to genome stability.Mol. Cell. 2012; 46: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, Seila et al., 2009Seila A.C. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Sharp P.A. Divergent transcription: a new feature of active promoters.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2557-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As a consequence of R loop formation, the single-stranded coding strand is vulnerable to mutagenic processes, such as cleavage, deamination, and depurination. Genomics studies have shown that during mammalian evolution, transcribed regions accumulate G and T bases on the coding strand, relative to the noncoding strand or nontranscribed regions (Green et al., 2003Green P.

Querfurth R. Arndt P.F. The evolution of transcription-associated biases of mutations across vertebrates.BMC Evol. Biol. 2010; 10: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that such strand bias may result from passive effects of deamination, transcription-coupled repair, and somatic hypermutation pathways in germ cell-transcribed genes, in the absence of selection (Green et al., 2003Green P.

Transcription induces strand-specific mutations at the 5′ end of human genes.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1216-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Accumulation of G and T content on the coding strand will strengthen the U1-PAS axis (Figure 2). A-rich sequences such as PAS (AATAAA) are likely to be lost when the genomic DNA accumulates G and T. In contrast, G+T-rich sequences, such as U1 snRNP-binding sites (e.g., resembling 5′ splice sites, G|GTAAGT and G|GTGAGT), are likely to emerge in these regions. Since promoter-proximal PAS reduces transcriptional activity (Andersen et al., 2012Andersen P.K. Lykke-Andersen S. Jensen T.H. Promoter-proximal polyadenylation sites reduce transcription activity.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the loss of PAS and gain of U1 sites should contribute to lengthening of the transcribed region as well as its more robust transcription. The gain of U1 sites could also enhance transcription by recruiting basal transcription initiation factors (Damgaard et al., 2008Damgaard C.K. Kahns S. Lykke-Andersen S. Nielsen A.L. Jensen T.H. Kjems J. A 5′ splice site enhances the recruitment of basal transcription initiation factors in vivo.Mol.

Stimulatory effect of splicing factors on transcriptional elongation.Nature. 2001; 414: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore a positive feedback loop is formed: active transcription causes the coding strand to accumulate sequence changes favoring higher transcription activity. As noted above, strengthening of the U1-PAS axis also favors extension of the transcribed region. Being longer gives the transcript several advantages: by chance longer RNAs are more likely to contain additional splicing signals such as a 3′ splice site to become spliced, or binding sites for splicing-independent nuclear export factors, thus escaping nuclear exosome degradation by packaging and exporting to cytoplasm (Nott et al., 2003Nott A.

The cellular EJC interactome reveals higher-order mRNP structure and an EJC-SR protein nexus.Cell. 2012; 151: 750-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Longer RNAs are also more likely to carry an open reading frame, either generated de novo or by incorporation of gene remnants. Once in the cytoplasm, the RNA should at some frequency be translated into short polypeptides due to widespread translational activity (Carvunis et al., 2012Carvunis A.R. Rolland T. Wapinski I. Calderwood M.A. Yildirim M.A. Simonis N. Charloteaux B. Hidalgo C.A. Barbette J. Santhanam B. et al.Proto-genes and de novo gene birth.Nature. 2012; 487: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Some of the polypeptides may provide advantage to the organism and become fixed in the population, thereby forming a new gene. In addition to de novo gene origination, the model described above also facilitates new gene origination via other mechanisms in regions of divergent transcription. Tandem duplication, retroposition, and recombination of existing genes or gene fragments are the major mechanisms for new gene origination (Chen et al., 2013Chen S. Krinsky B.H. Long M. New genes as drivers of phenotypic evolution.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, Long et al., 2013Long M. Vankuren N.W. Chen S. Vibranovski M.D. New Gene Evolution: Little Did We Know.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2013; PubMed Google Scholar). Most duplicated genes or gene fragments are silenced due to the lack of required elements such as a promoter. In contrast, genes or gene fragments inserted into regions of divergent transcription, such as upstream of a promoter or flanking an enhancer, will be transcribed, likely under different regulation than prior to their insertion, and thus could evolve to carry out functions different than the original gene. In support of this, a recent survey of human and mouse genes evolved from “domesticated” transposons (Kalitsis and Saffery, 2009Kalitsis P. Saffery R. Inherent promoter bidirectionality facilitates maintenance of sequence integrity and transcription of parasitic DNA in mammalian genomes.BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 498Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that a significant proportion of them are located in bidirectional promoters. Promoter upstream regions also preferentially accumulate transposable elements, which can carry 5′ splice site sequences that may accelerate the process of new gene origination (Gotea et al., 2013Gotea V. Petrykowska H.M. Elnitski L. Bidirectional promoters as important drivers for the emergence of species-specific transcripts.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e57323Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similar to promoters, enhancers are also divergently transcribed, and, as a result, new genes might originate at enhancer regions through the same mechanism described above. The possibility of enhancer-derived new genes has not been previously discussed. Manual inspection of a list of 24 hominoid-specific de novo protein-coding genes (Xie et al., 2012Xie C. Zhang Y.E.

https://openalex.org/W1965035346,"Podocytes are critical in the maintenance of a healthy glomerular filter; however, they have been difficult to study in the intact kidney because of technical limitations. Here we report the development of serial multiphoton microscopy (MPM) of the same glomeruli over several days to visualize the motility of podocytes and parietal epithelial cells (PECs) in vivo. In podocin-GFP mice, podocytes formed sporadic multicellular clusters after unilateral ureteral ligation and migrated into the parietal Bowman's capsule. The tracking of single cells in podocin-confetti mice featuring cell-specific expression of CFP, GFP, YFP or RFP revealed the simultaneous migration of multiple podocytes. In phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)-GFP mice, serial MPM found PEC-to-podocyte migration and nanotubule connections. Our data support a highly dynamic rather than a static nature of the glomerular environment and cellular composition. Future application of this new approach should advance our understanding of the mechanisms of glomerular injury and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2150585994,"Accumulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors at nucleus accumbens synapses underlies the intensified cue-induced cocaine craving observed after prolonged withdrawal, a phenomenon that may contribute to relapse. Here, Loweth and colleagues find that administration of mGluR1 positive allosteric modulators can normalize accumbens AMPAR transmission and curb cocaine craving in rats. Cue-induced cocaine craving is a major cause of relapse in abstinent addicts. In rats, cue-induced craving progressively intensifies (incubates) during withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration. After ∼1 month of withdrawal, incubated craving is mediated by Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) that accumulate in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We found that decreased mGluR1 surface expression in the NAc preceded and enabled CP-AMPAR accumulation. Thus, restoring mGluR1 transmission by administering repeated injections of an mGluR1 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) prevented CP-AMPAR accumulation and incubation, whereas blocking mGluR1 transmission at even earlier withdrawal times accelerated CP-AMPAR accumulation. In studies conducted after prolonged withdrawal, when CP-AMPAR levels and cue-induced craving are high, we found that systemic administration of an mGluR1 PAM attenuated the expression of incubated craving by reducing CP-AMPAR transmission in the NAc to control levels. These results suggest a strategy in which recovering addicts could use a systemically active compound to protect against cue-induced relapse."

Megakaryocytes also become more polyploid, producing 4-fold more platelets. MII is thus a multifunctional node in polarized division and niche sensing. Stem cells must be able to self-renew and also give rise to diverse cell types by asymmetric division in appropriate microenvironments (Knoblich, 2010Knoblich J.A. Asymmetric cell division: recent developments and their implications for tumour biology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This differential segregation of cell fate determinants produces progenitors that expand symmetrically to generate tissue. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs, as a subset of CD34+ cells) exemplify these key properties of stem cells in that they are often quiescent in niches of the bone marrow (BM), but they and/or their daughter cells polarize and divide asymmetrically in suitable niches to generate progenitors that further divide and specialize to terminally differentiated erythroid, megakaryocyte, and white cell lineages. A number of models for marrow and soluble signal regulation of HSC maintenance and differentiation have been described (Trumpp et al., 2010Trumpp A. Essers M. Wilson A. Awakening dormant haematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), but many physical aspects of hematopoiesis remain unclear. Many cell types apply forces to the matrix that they adhere to, and the flexibility of extracellular matrix is already known to modulate differentiation of marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (Engler et al., 2006Engler A.J. Sen S. Sweeney H.L. Discher D.E. Matrix elasticity directs stem cell lineage specification.Cell. 2006; 126: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10279) Google Scholar) as well as the expansion of adult HSCs and progenitors (HSC/Ps) (Holst et al., 2010Holst J. Watson S. Lord M.S. Eamegdool S.S. Bax D.V. Nivison-Smith L.B. Kondyurin A. Ma L. Oberhauser A.F. Weiss A.S. Rasko J.E. Substrate elasticity provides mechanical signals for the expansion of hemopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In both of these latter studies, myosin-II (MII) inhibition revealed a key role for actomyosin forces in adhesion and sensing of matrix. However, cell contractile forces contribute to many processes in stem cell and progenitor maintenance and division with likely relationships to differentiation. Cytokinesis is driven by nonmuscle MII in a cell’s cortex, and the asymmetry of stem cell division in C. elegans is also established by MII (Ou et al., 2010Ou G. Stuurman N. D’Ambrosio M. Vale R.D. Polarized myosin produces unequal-size daughters during asymmetric cell division.Science. 2010; 330: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Differentiation in embryogenesis indeed requires active MII (Conti et al., 2004Conti M.A. Even-Ram S. Liu C. Yamada K.M. Adelstein R.S. Defects in cell adhesion and the visceral endoderm following ablation of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-A in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41263-41266Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and while inhibition of MII in adherent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) increases survival in culture by preserving intercellular contacts (Chen et al., 2010Chen G. Hou Z. Gulbranson D.R. Thomson J.A. Actin-myosin contractility is responsible for the reduced viability of dissociated human embryonic stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 240-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), inhibition can also lead to multinucleated cells (Canman et al., 2003Canman J.C. Cameron L.A. Maddox P.S. Straight A. Tirnauer J.S. Mitchison T.J. Fang G. Kapoor T.M. Salmon E.D. Determining the position of the cell division plane.Nature. 2003; 424: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Actomyosin forces generally stabilize the plasma membrane with an active cortical tension or rigidity (Merkel et al., 2000Merkel R. Simson R. Simson D.A. Hohenadl M. Boulbitch A. Wallraff E. Sackmann E. A micromechanic study of cell polarity and plasma membrane cell body coupling in Dictyostelium.Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but these forces also drive cell rounding in cytokinesis (Sedzinski et al., 2011Sedzinski J. Biro M. Oswald A. Tinevez J.Y. Salbreux G. Paluch E. Polar actomyosin contractility destabilizes the position of the cytokinetic furrow.Nature. 2011; 476: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and can change dramatically in differentiation (of MSCs) (Engler et al., 2006Engler A.J. Sen S. Sweeney H.L. Discher D.E. Matrix elasticity directs stem cell lineage specification.Cell. 2006; 126: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10279) Google Scholar). Indeed, while it has been known for many years that as granulocytes differentiate they become soft to better traffic from marrow through the endothelial barrier and into the circulation (Lichtman, 1970Lichtman M.A. Cellular deformability during maturation of the myeloblast. Possible role in marrow egress.N. Engl. J. Med. 1970; 283: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), any MII changes in such cells leaving the marrow or in other hematopoietic cells is currently unknown. Mammals express three isoforms of MII: A (MYH9), B (MYH10), and C (MYH14), and each is regulated transcriptionally as well as posttranslationally. MIIA is found in most tissues (Ma et al., 2010Ma X. Jana S.S. Conti M.A. Kawamoto S. Claycomb W.C. Adelstein R.S. Ablation of nonmuscle myosin II-B and II-C reveals a role for nonmuscle myosin II in cardiac myocyte karyokinesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3952-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) including blood (Maupin et al., 1994Maupin P. Phillips C.L. Adelstein R.S. Pollard T.D. Differential localization of myosin-II isozymes in human cultured cells and blood cells.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3077-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential to embryonic differentiation (Conti et al., 2004Conti M.A. Even-Ram S. Liu C. Yamada K.M. Adelstein R.S. Defects in cell adhesion and the visceral endoderm following ablation of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-A in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41263-41266Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). MIIB is particularly enriched in brain and cardiac tissues, and it is often polarized to the rear of migrating cells (Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2008Vicente-Manzanares M. Koach M.A. Whitmore L. Lamers M.L. Horwitz A.F. Segregation and activation of myosin IIB creates a rear in migrating cells.J.

Crawling from soft to stiff matrix polarizes the cytoskeleton and phosphoregulates myosin-II heavy chain.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed roles for MIIB in hematopoiesis, specifically in megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation (Lordier et al., 2012Lordier L. Bluteau D. Jalil A. Legrand C. Pan J. Rameau P. Jouni D. Bluteau O. Mercher T. Leon C. et al.RUNX1-induced silencing of non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB contributes to megakaryocyte polyploidization.Nat Commun. 2012; 3: 717Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in the asymmetric process of erythroid enucleation (Ubukawa et al., 2012Ubukawa K. Guo Y.M. Takahashi M. Hirokawa M. Michishita Y. Nara M. Tagawa H. Takahashi N. Komatsuda A. Nunomura W. et al.Enucleation of human erythroblasts involves non-muscle myosin IIB.Blood. 2012; 119: 1036-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MIIB myofilaments are known to attach more strongly to and detach more slowly from F-actin than MIIA, resulting in higher force generation per MIIB (Wang et al., 2003Wang F. Kovacs M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. Kinetic mechanism of non-muscle myosin IIB: functional adaptations for tension generation and maintenance.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, MIIB in human ESCs or stem cells in general has unknown functions. MIIC appears restricted to epithelial cells (Ma et al., 2010Ma X. Jana S.S. Conti M.A. Kawamoto S. Claycomb W.C. Adelstein R.S. Ablation of nonmuscle myosin II-B and II-C reveals a role for nonmuscle myosin II in cardiac myocyte karyokinesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3952-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and serves here as a useful negative control in expression analyses. Here, we reveal critical roles of MIIA and MIIB in adult hematopoiesis and use that understanding to enrich highly heterogeneous HSC/Ps for long-term hematopoietic stem cells. Immunofluorescence of human CD34+ cells reveals cortical MIIB as well as MIIA (Figure 1Ai), but flow cytometry and immunoblots show that myosin levels vary with surface markers and also across differentiated lineages (Figure 1Aii, Figures S1A and S1B, available online). Mass spectrometry-calibrated intracellular flow (MS-IF) cytometry (Figure S1C, Supplemental Experimental Procedures) was developed to quantify absolute isoform stoichiometry, which is not possible by antibody methods alone due to differential sensitivities of antibodies to isoforms. MS-IF cytometry of diverse hematopoietic cell types reveals that MIIB is no more than ∼30% of total MII across cell types and has a large dynamic range of ∼5,000-fold compared to ∼80-fold for MIIA (Table S1). However, MS also revealed MIIA phosphorylation at S1943 (pS1943), which deactivates MIIA through myofilament disassembly (Dulyaninova et al., 2007Dulyaninova N.G. House R.P. Betapudi V. Bresnick A.R. Myosin-IIA heavy-chain phosphorylation regulates the motility of MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3144-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and so a phosphospecific antibody was used to estimate the pS1943 stoichiometry of MIIA through a calibration scheme using mutant GFP-MIIA (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Based on this, ∼50%–60% of MIIA is phosphorylated as pS1943 in the three key HSC/P subpopulations of CD34+ cells (Figure S1D) per standard surface markers (Majeti et al., 2007Majeti R. Park C.Y.

Shay T. et al.Densely interconnected transcriptional circuits control cell states in human hematopoiesis.Cell. 2011; 144: 296-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar):{“HSC enriched” cells: CD34+, CD38−, CD90+, CD45-RA−, CD133+}{Multipotent progenitor (“MPP”): CD34+, CD38−, CD90−, CD45-RA−, CD133+},{“Common potent progenitor (“CPP”): CD34+, CD38+, CD90−, CD45-RA+, CD133−}. In differentiation, pS1943 generally decreases as MIIA is activated (Figure S1D), except for MKs in which pS1943 is similarly high as in HSC/Ps. Phosphorylation at S1943 is equivalent to inhibiting ∼50% of MIIA activity (Raab et al., 2012Raab M. Swift J. Dingal P.C. Shah P. Shin J.W. Discher D.E. Crawling from soft to stiff matrix polarizes the cytoskeleton and phosphoregulates myosin-II heavy chain.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), so that for any cell type, active-MIIA = (50% of total MIIA) × (1 + MIIA fraction of non-pS1943). The result for active-MIIA proves to be nearly constant throughout hematopoietic differentiation and makes a useful common denominator. As such, a myosin map of hematopoiesis shows the highest stoichiometric ratio of (MIIB: active-MIIA) ≈ 1:2 (50%) in “HSC-enriched” (Figure 1Aiii) and a ratio of (MIIB: active-MIIA) ≥ 1:10 for the other marrow-restricted cells that include nucleated erythroid progenitors, MKs, and nonhematopoietic MSCs. For cell types that predominantly exit the marrow, the ratio (MIIB: active-MIIA) generally decreases as MIIB is specifically repressed—except for red blood cells (RBCs), which repress both myosins in similar proportion. Hematopoietic differentiation thus involves a major switch from MIIB + MIIA to active MIIA alone. The programmatic nature of MII changes in hematopoiesis is evident in the fact that all nine of the marrow-resident cell types measured here cluster together in the MII map (Figure 1Aiii). Based on the “marrow” space in such a map being roughly half as large as that spanned by all measured cell types, we estimate a clustering probability p ≈ (1/2)11(1/2)5 = 0.000015. This high significance p provides a metric of the systematic consistency of our MII measurements in addition to revealing a broad MII program. Since MIIB was highest at the protein level in CD34+ subpopulations, microarray profiling of the different stem/progenitor/differentiated cells allowed us to identify genes that correlate with expression of MYH10 (Figure 1Bi). CD34 correlated strongly with MYH10 in showing a power law exponent of 1.8 (Figure 1Bii), whereas the differentiation gene ELANE is strongly anticorrelated with a power law of −1.8 exponent (Figure 1Biii). MYH9 shows no correlation with MYH10. Transcripts that fit well were further assessed with a second, novel algorithm for a robust list (Table S2). A key subset is ranked on the correlation with MYH10 and color-coded for the power law. Consistent with protein-level analyses, both MYH9 and MYH10 transcripts are of similar (midrange) intensity. About 1% of MYH10-correlated genes are known HSC/P markers, while >10% of the most anticorrelated genes are specific lineage markers. The profiling indeed shows maintenance of HSC/P markers (e.g., CD34 and ALDH1A1) and suppression of differentiation genes (e.g., ELANE) (Figures 1Bii and 1Biii). Transcriptome dynamics thus align well with protein dynamics along with the differentiation trajectory. Some of the MYH10-correlated genes (CEP70, DOCK1, MACF1, MAP7, and TUBB4) not only polarize but also have roles in motility via the microtubule system. MIIB might be more cortical than MIIA in round, uncultured CD34+ cells (Figure 2A), and in the ∼50% of CD34+ cells that are polarized in culture, MIIB is clearly enriched in the uropod by 75%, while MIIA is diffuse and uniform. The microtubule organizing center (MTOC) was also in the uropod as expected (Giebel et al., 2004Giebel B. Corbeil D. Beckmann J. Höhn J. Freund D. Giesen K. Fischer J. Kögler G. Wernet P. Segregation of lipid raft markers including CD133 in polarized human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Blood. 2004; 104: 2332-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, because cytoskeletal polarization in MSCs is suppressed by soft microenvironments (Raab et al., 2012Raab M. Swift J. Dingal P.C. Shah P. Shin J.W. Discher D.E. Crawling from soft to stiff matrix polarizes the cytoskeleton and phosphoregulates myosin-II heavy chain.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), it became important to measure the elasticity of intact BM. Therefore we sectioned fresh bone lengthwise to expose the marrow for probing by atomic force microscopy. We determined a microscale elasticity of ∼0.3 kilopascal (kPa) (Figure 2B), which is >106-fold softer than rigid bone and plastic. HSC/Ps have also been seen to localize at or near the osteoblastic endosteum of bone, which we had previously measured to have an elasticity >30 kPa (Engler et al., 2006Engler A.J. Sen S. Sweeney H.L. Discher D.E. Matrix elasticity directs stem cell lineage specification.Cell. 2006; 126: 677-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10279) Google Scholar). The softness of marrow is likely a product of both high cellularity and low extracellular matrix density: fibronectin (FN) is ubiquitous in marrow but is denser near the endosteum where collagen-I is also high (Nilsson et al., 1998Nilsson S.K. Debatis M.E. Dooner M.S. Madri J.A. Quesenberry P.J. Becker P.S. Immunofluorescence characterization of key extracellular matrix proteins in murine bone marrow in situ.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). CD34+ cells clearly anchor specifically to FN versus collagen-I (Figures S2A–S2C), and so we FN-functionalized gels of polyacrylamide to test matrix elasticity effects on MIIB polarization. Similar to our findings for marrow-derived MSCs (Raab et al., 2012Raab M. Swift J. Dingal P.C. Shah P. Shin J.W. Discher D.E. Crawling from soft to stiff matrix polarizes the cytoskeleton and phosphoregulates myosin-II heavy chain.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), MIIB polarization in CD34+ cells is suppressed in cultures on marrow-mimetic soft matrix but promoted in cultures on endosteum-mimetic stiff matrix (Figure 2C). Blebb rapidly abolishes MIIB polarization on stiff matrix without affecting membrane intensity of MIIB. MII activity and stiff matrix (including rigid plastic if cells adhere) thus drive polarization in CD34+ cells. Local stresses independent of adhesion can polarize MII in Dictyostelium cells that are pulled into micropipettes by aspiration (Ren et al., 2009Ren Y. Effler J.C. Norstrom M. Luo T. Firtel R.A. Iglesias P.A. Rock R.S. Robinson D.N. Mechanosensing through cooperative interactions between myosin II and the actin crosslinker cortexillin I.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 1421-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic cells were likewise aspirated at low stress (<1 kPa) after transfection of GFP-MIIA or MIIB, and within just 20 min, MIIB polarized by more than 10-fold into the stressed projection (Figure 2D), while MIIA polarized much less. Importantly, receptors such as integrins do not engage the micropipette wall, and so polarization can indeed be independent of adhesion. Partial knockdown of MIIB in CD34+ cells followed by aspiration also showed greater distension of the membrane as well as membrane fragmentation (Figure 2E), and knockdown cells also showed an ∼20% decrease in migration through a 3 μm pore filter (Figure S2D). Functionally, MIIB polarization in CD34+ cells is thus protective of membrane shape changes produced by cell forces. Large cortical tensions are generated in cells as they round up and divide during asymmetric division (Sedzinski et al., 2011Sedzinski J. Biro M. Oswald A. Tinevez J.Y. Salbreux G. Paluch E. Polar actomyosin contractility destabilizes the position of the cytokinetic furrow.Nature. 2011; 476: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Because MYH10 correlates with a half-dozen genes involved in asymmetric division of hematopoietic cells (Ting et al., 2012Ting S.B. Deneault E. Hope K. Cellot S. Chagraoui J. Mayotte N. Dorn J.F. Laverdure J.P. Harvey M. Hawkins E.D. et al.Asymmetric segregation and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with endocytic Ap2a2.Blood. 2012; 119: 2510-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Table S3), confocal imaging and partial knockdown (Figure 3Ai) were used to assess MIIB in asymmetric division of CD34+ cells (Figure 3Aii), which occurs in ∼30% of cells (consistent with Lordier et al., 2012Lordier L. Bluteau D. Jalil A. Legrand C. Pan J. Rameau P. Jouni D. Bluteau O. Mercher T. Leon C. et al.RUNX1-induced silencing of non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIB contributes to megakaryocyte polyploidization.Nat Commun. 2012; 3: 717Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). MIIB enriches toward the CD34hi daughter cell, concentrating near the cleavage furrow by ∼3-fold (Figure 3B), whereas CD34 appears segregated between cells but otherwise locally homogenous, consistent with lateral mobility of this membrane protein. The results suggest that high cortical tensions in the cleavage furrow have a similar effect on receptor-independent localization of MIIB as that of local stressing by a micropipette. Partial knockdown of MIIB abolishes the asymmetry and also the segregation of CD34 (Figure 3B, bottom). Whereas asymmetric division of CD34+ cells results in 6-fold higher MIIB in the CD34+ daughter than in the CD34− daughter, knockdown decreases the MIIB level in CD34+ to that in CD34− and suppresses asymmetric division (Figure 3C). Prolonged cultures of MIIB knockdown cells increase the relative number of CD34+ progenitors with more colony forming unit-granulocyte and macrophage (CFU-GM) (Figure 3D), consistent with MIIB regulating asymmetric division when late CD34+ progenitor cells transition to CD34− cells and when CD34 molecularly segregates between daughter cells. Tracking of division using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Hawkins et al., 2007Hawkins E.D. Hommel M. Turner M.L. Battye F.L. Markham J.F. Hodgkin P.D. Measuring lymphocyte proliferation, survival and differentiation using CFSE time-series data.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2057-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) shows that partial knockdown of MIIB increases the number of CD34+CD38− cells by 2-fold (Figure 3Ei) or for CD34+CD38+ cells by 1.5-fold (Figure 3Eii), whereas CD34− numbers remain unaltered (Figure 3Eiii). On the other hand, partial MIIA knockdown (∼30%) did not alter numbers of any subpopulations (Figure S2E). The data reveal MIIB as a major factor in asymmetric division and differentiation of CD34+ cells to CD34− cells. MIIA is often the dominant MII isoform and can influence MIIB (Raab et al., 2012Raab M. Swift J. Dingal P.C. Shah P. Shin J.W. Discher D.E. Crawling from soft to stiff matrix polarizes the cytoskeleton and phosphoregulates myosin-II heavy chain.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 669-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which implies that phosphoregulation of MIIA can in principle influence hematopoiesis (Figure 4A). We therefore examined regulation by niche factors of pS1943 in CD34+ cells and found the highest levels of pS1943 in uncultured CD34+ cells (Figure 4Bi; Figure S1D), with levels systematically decreased upon differentiation with Thrombopoietin (Tpo) and Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), but not Stem Cell Factor (SCF) alone (Figure 4Bii). Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) promotes HSC hibernation (Yamazaki et al., 2011Yamazaki S. Ema H. Karlsson G. Yamaguchi T. Miyoshi H. Shioda S. Taketo M.M. Karlsson S. Iwama A. Nakauchi H.

Remarkably, Blebb mimics TGF-β (Figure 4B). In contrast, very low pS1943 in myeloid CD33+ cells (Figure S1D) and in the human monocytic cell line (THP-1) are consistent with rapid proliferation of THP-1 in suspension (which can be blocked by Blebb). Both CD34+ and CD34− cell numbers anticorrelate with the level of pS1943, and the half-maximal effect was observed at ∼35% pS1943-MIIA (Figure 4B). MIIA is thus modulated by cytokines critical to precirculation differentiation. Fresh CD34+CD38− are softer than CD34+CD38+ (Figure 4Ci), and consistent with the high pS1943-MIIA in CD34+ cells, cells transfected with a site-specific MIIA phosphomimetic mutant (S1943D) fragment more often (from a weak cortex) and also divide more slowly compared to wild-type controls (Figures 4Cii and 4Ciii). These functional results all indicate that high pS1943-MIIA impacts cell mechanics and limits cell division, and hence, differentiation. Transcriptional profiles reveal perturbation of pathways that regulate MIIA phosphorylation in CD34+ cells by Blebb (Table S4). Matrix mechanics therefore have an understandable effect on pS1943-MIIA as well (Figure 4Di): soft FN-coated gels (20 μg/ml) maximize pS1943 in CD34+ cells treated with cytokines compared to stiff matrix, while CD34− cells appear unaffected (Figure 4Dii). This response to stiff matrix is blocked with the phosphomimetic, deactivating S1943D-MIIA (Figure 4Diii). Increased cell spreading as part of matrix engagement on stiff substrate thus requires MIIB in CD34+ cells (Figure 2C), whereas differentiated cells use nonphosphorylated MIIA. At the same FN density as above, the number of CD34+CD38− is 4-fold higher on soft matrix relative to stiff matrix (but Blebb eliminates the difference), whereas the number of CD34+CD38+ remains constant (Figure 4E). CD34+CD38− cells are thus sensitive to matrix elasticity, with sensitivity modulated by MII. Based on our in vitro results, a major knockdown of MIIB in human cells grafted into BM should repress asymmetric division and lead to (1) an accumulation of human cells in marrow and (2) a suppression of circulating human blood cells. To test this hypothesis, fresh human CD34+ BM cells were transduced with shRNA-carrying lentivirus to knock down MIIB, which was followed by puromycin selection of transduced cells. Cells were injected directly into bone of NOD/SCID/IL-2Rγ−/− (NSG) mice to study BM retention both at 16 hr and at 20 weeks (Figure 5Ai); this same duration has been described by others (Notta et al., 2011Notta F. Doulatov S. Laurenti E. Poeppl A. Jurisica I. Dick J.E.

We injected directly into marrow rather than into blood to avoid any potential effect of knockdown on trafficking from blood to marrow. Human cells in mice were identified by dual immunostaining for hCD45 and hCD47 (Figure S3A), since human RBC and platelets do not express hCD45 while hCD47 confers immunocompatability to all human cells within NSG mice (Rodriguez et al., 2013Rodriguez P.L.

Partial permanent MIIB knockdown (by ∼40%) (Figure 5Aii) leads to 3-fold greater retention of cells in marrow when they are assayed just 16 hr after marrow injection (Figure 5Bi); this could reflect the fact that knockdown impairs migration through constraining micropores by 20% (p < 0.05; Figure S2D).

Individual genes can profoundly affect complex behaviors, including those learned through extensive practice. For example, humans with mutations of FOXP2, a Forkhead box family gene that encodes a transcription factor, exhibit orofacial dyspraxia and fail to develop normal speech and language (Lai et al., 2001Lai C.S.

While FOXP2 is expressed in many brain regions, several findings implicate aberrant striatal function in the speech and language deficits that accompany FOXP2 mutations (Lai et al., 2001Lai C.S. Fisher S.E. Hurst J.A. Vargha-Khadem F. Monaco A.P.

FOXP2 expression during brain development coincides with adult sites of pathology in a severe speech and language disorder.Brain. 2003; 126: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). One finding is that imaging studies in humans with FOXP2 mutations reveal a significant reduction in the volume of the head of the caudate nucleus, a region of the striatum involved in controlling head and face movements (Watkins et al., 2002bWatkins K.E. Vargha-Khadem F. Ashburner J. Passingham R.E. Connelly A. Friston K.J. Frackowiak R.S. Mishkin M. Gadian D.G.

Brain Mapp. 2003; 18: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Another clue is that while FOXP2 is expressed in both the striatum and the cerebellum, “knockin” of the humanized Foxp2 in mouse affects synaptic long-term depression in the striatum but not in the cerebellum (Reimers-Kipping et al., 2011Reimers-Kipping S. Hevers W. Pääbo S. Enard W. Humanized Foxp2 specifically affects cortico-basal ganglia circuits.Neuroscience. 2011; 175: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, lentiviral shRNA-mediated reduction (i.e., knockdown) of FoxP2 levels in a striatopallidal structure (Area X) of juvenile male zebra finches, which resemble humans in their capacity for imitative vocal learning, prevents them from accurately copying a tutor song (Haesler et al., 2007Haesler S. Rochefort C. Georgi B. Licznerski P. Osten P. Scharff C. Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e321Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). While these findings suggest that striatal abnormalities caused by impaired FOXP2 function underlie speech and language deficits, two major issues remain unresolved. First, because FOXP2 is highly expressed in the striatum from embryonic development onward (Teramitsu et al., 2004Teramitsu I. Kudo L.C. London S.E. Geschwind D.H. White S.A. Parallel FoxP1 and FoxP2 expression in songbird and human brain predicts functional interaction.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3152-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), a persistent role of FOXP2 in vocal control cannot be dissociated from a developmentally restricted role in vocal learning. Second, while studies in mice have illuminated structural and functional changes in striatal neurons that result from Foxp2 mutations (Enard et al., 2009Enard W. Gehre S. Hammerschmidt K. Hölter S.M. Blass T. Somel M. Brückner M.K. Schreiweis C. Winter C.

Biol. 2008; 18: 354-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), whether similar changes affect neural circuits important to learned vocal control remains unknown. Songbirds afford a powerful system in which to understand how reduced FoxP2 levels affect corticostriatal circuits important to learned vocalizations and to determine whether FoxP2 plays a persistent role in adult song control in addition to a role in juvenile song learning. Songbirds use auditory information to learn and maintain their songs (Konishi, 1965Konishi M. The role of auditory feedback in the control of vocalization in the white-crowned sparrow.Z. Tierpsychol. 1965; 22: 770-783PubMed Google Scholar, Marler, 1970Marler P. A comparative approach to vocal learning: song development in white-crowned sparrows.J. Comp. Physiol.

Neurosci. 1999; 22: 567-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar) and the songbird brain contains well-characterized song control circuitry (Figure 1A), including an anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) that plays a critical role in song learning (Nottebohm et al., 1976Nottebohm F.

The AFP shares many similarities with mammalian corticostriatal circuitry, including high levels of FoxP2 protein in its striatopallidal component, Area X (Doupe et al., 2005Doupe A.J. Perkel D.J.

Notably, an adult male zebra finch sings syllables with greater trial-by-trial variability when singing alone (i.e., undirected song) than when singing to a female (i.e., directed song) and this social context-dependent change in variability depends on changes in LMAN activity, the output nucleus of the AFP (Sossinka and Böhner, 1980Sossinka R.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 5730-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition to a demonstrated role for FoxP2 in juvenile song learning, FoxP2 mRNA and protein levels decrease in Area X of both juvenile and adult birds the more they sing (Teramitsu and White, 2006Teramitsu I. White S.A. FoxP2 regulation during undirected singing in adult songbirds.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7390-7394Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, Miller et al., 2008Miller J.E. Spiteri E.

Striatal FoxP2 is actively regulated during songbird sensorimotor learning.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8548Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Further, FoxP2 mRNA levels in adults decrease even more with undirected singing than with directed singing (Teramitsu and White, 2006Teramitsu I. White S.A. FoxP2 regulation during undirected singing in adult songbirds.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7390-7394Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), although context-dependent differences in FoxP2 protein levels are not evident (Miller et al., 2008Miller J.E. Spiteri E. Condro M.C. Dosumu-Johnson R.T. Geschwind D.H. White S.A. Birdsong decreases protein levels of FoxP2, a molecule required for human speech.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 2015-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Ultimately, whether changes in FoxP2 mRNA or protein levels are causally linked to song control in adult birds remains unknown. Here we explicitly addressed the issue of causality by reducing FoxP2 protein levels in Area X of adult birds and testing whether this reduction affected their ability to modulate song variability as a function of social context. Another advantage of using songbirds to study the role of FoxP2 in learned vocal communication is the potential to link synaptic and circuit properties to behavior. During singing, the song premotor nucleus HVC transmits a precise timing signal to the song motor nucleus RA and to Area X (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H. Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S.

Watanabe D. Neural coding of syntactic structure in learned vocalizations in the songbird.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 10023-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This timing signal then undergoes context-dependent modulation in the AFP, with the consequence that LMAN neurons display increased trial-by-trial variability, augmented bursting activity, and elevated firing rates during undirected singing relative to directed singing (Kao et al., 2005Kao M.H.

Activity in a cortical-basal ganglia circuit for song is required for social context-dependent vocal variability.J. Neurophysiol. 2010; 104: 2474-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These changes in LMAN activity drive more variable action potential activity in RA that correlates with greater spectral variability in the bird’s song (Ölveczky et al., 2011Ölveczky B.P. Otchy T.M.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 10370-10379Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). How the AFP modulates signals from HVC is unknown, but in zebra finches dopamine levels in Area X change with social context, and in embryonic mice several genes implicated in dopamine signaling are potential targets of Foxp2 regulation (Sasaki et al., 2006Sasaki A. Sotnikova T.D. Gainetdinov R.R. Jarvis E.D. Social context-dependent singing-regulated dopamine.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9010-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, Vernes et al., 2011Vernes S.C. Oliver P.L. Spiteri E. Lockstone H.E. Puliyadi R. Taylor J.M. Ho J. Mombereau C. Brewer A. Lowy E. et al.Foxp2 regulates gene networks implicated in neurite outgrowth in the developing brain.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002145Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that FoxP2 could regulate dopaminergic modulation of signals propagating from HVC through the AFP. Using in vivo intracellular recordings from LMAN neurons and pharmacological manipulations in Area X of anesthetized adult male zebra finches, we find that FoxP2 knockdown in Area X accelerates signal propagation from HVC to LMAN and renders this propagation insensitive to modulation by dopamine receptor 1 (D1R). Furthermore, FoxP2 knockdown decreases levels of D1R and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal phosphoprotein (DARPP-32), a key component in the D1R signal cascade. Finally, we show that FoxP2 knockdown abolishes context-dependent modulation of LMAN activity and context-dependent changes in song variability. These findings advance a model in which FOXP2 mutations disrupt the control of vocal variability by interfering with the dopamine-dependent modulation of premotor signals conveyed by corticostriatal circuits. Lentiviral-mediated expression of short hairpin RNAs (LV-shRNAs) can be used to reduce FoxP2 levels in Area X of juvenile zebra finches, and this treatment renders the juvenile’s copy of a tutor song both inaccurate and imprecise (Haesler et al., 2007Haesler S. Rochefort C. Georgi B. Licznerski P. Osten P. Scharff C. Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e321Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Here we used two LV-shRNA constructs (shFoxP2-h-gfp or shFoxP2-f-gfp) to explore whether song is affected by reducing FoxP2 levels in Area X of adult male zebra finches (>120 days posthatching [dph]), after song copying is complete in this species (Immelmann, 1969Immelmann K. Song development in the zebra finch and other estrildid finches.in: Hinde R.A. Bird Vocalizations. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1969: 61-74Google Scholar). To determine whether these constructs could infect cells and reduce FoxP2 levels in Area X of adult finches, we made multiple injections of LV-ShFoxP2 or LV-ShControl (LV-ShC) bilaterally in Area X using stereotaxic coordinates (Figure 1A). Two weeks to four months after the injection, visualization of the GFP marker confirmed extensive expression of the LV-ShFoxP2 constructs (Figure 1B, see Experimental Procedures). To quantify the degree to which these constructs reduced FoxP2 levels, we performed western blots of tissue homogenates obtained from Area X of adult birds previously injected with either LV-ShFoxP2 or LV-ShC (Figure 1C). Optical density measurements indicated that FoxP2 protein levels were reduced by more than two-thirds (∼70%) in the LV-ShFoxP2 animals compared to the LV-ShC animals (Figure 1D; n = 12 birds in each group, >90 days postinjection; see Experimental Procedures; p < 0.05; Student’s t test). This reduction in FoxP2 levels was comparable to that achieved in juvenile birds (Haesler et al., 2007Haesler S. Rochefort C. Georgi B. Licznerski P. Osten P. Scharff C. Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e321Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), indicating that the shRNA method is effective at decreasing FoxP2 levels in Area X of adult male zebra finches. We measured social context-dependent change in syllable variability to probe whether FoxP2 knockdown in Area X of adult finches affected song control independent of learning. Prior to injecting LV-shRNA into Area X of adult male zebra finches, we confirmed that the pitch of syllables in undirected songs varied more from one trial to the next than the pitch of the corresponding syllables in directed songs (Figures 2A–2C; blue; Pre-ShFoxP2-undirected versus Pre-ShFoxP2-directed: paired t test, p = 0.03). We then made bilateral injections of either LV-ShFoxP2 or LV-ShC into Area X of these birds and re-evaluated syllable variability in different social contexts ∼4 weeks later (ShFoxP2: n = 7 birds, mean age at injection, 127 ± 2 [SEM] dph; 26 ± 2 days postinjection; ShC: n = 4 birds; mean age at injection, 126 ± 4 dph, 27 ± 2 days postinjection). Notably, LV-ShFoxP2 injections in Area X abolished social context-dependent changes in pitch variability (Figures 2B and 2C; red; Post-ShFoxP2-undirected versus Post-ShFoxP2-directed: paired t test, p = 0.5; mean pitch in these two states was unaffected, paired t test, p = 0.7), an effect that was specifically attributable to elevated levels of variability in the directed context (Table S1). In contrast, birds that received LV-ShC injections continued to modulate song variability as a function of social context (Figure 2C; gray; Post-ShC-undirected versus Post-ShC-directed: paired t test, p = 0.03). Finally, FoxP2 knockdown did not affect context-dependent modulation of song tempo (Figure S1A), the number of introductory elements per motif (Figure S1B; the motif is a stereotyped syllable sequence produced by zebra finches), or the number of motifs per bout (Figure S1C; ShFoxP2: n = 7 birds, ShC: n = 4 birds, p = 0.3, ANOVA followed by a post hoc t test, unless otherwise noted), all of which are song features that usually change with social context but that are unaffected by LMAN lesions and are not regulated by D1R-mediated signaling in Area X (Kao and Brainard, 2006Kao M.H.

Striatal dopamine modulates song spectral but not temporal features through D1 receptors.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 1771-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, manipulating FoxP2 levels in Area X of adult birds can affect context-dependent modulation of song variability, indicating that the role of FoxP2 is not developmentally restricted. Reinforcement models of song learning posit that trial-by-trial variability enables vocal exploration necessary for the accurate copying of a tutor song (Doya and Sejnowski, 1995Doya K. Sejnowski T. A novel reinforcement model of birdsong vocalization learning.Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst. 1995; 7: 101-108Google Scholar). A prior study showed that reducing FoxP2 levels in Area X of the juvenile zebra finch impairs its ability to accurately copy a tutor song (Haesler et al., 2007Haesler S. Rochefort C. Georgi B. Licznerski P. Osten P. Scharff C. Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e321Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and we found here that a similar reduction of FoxP2 levels in the adult finch disrupts its ability to modulate song variability in a context-dependent manner. These observations led us to wonder whether reducing FoxP2 expression in Area X of the juvenile alters levels of song variability during song learning, which in turn could potentially interfere with reinforcement learning mechanisms important to accurate song imitation. To test this idea, we made bilateral injections of LV-ShFoxP2 or LV-ShC in Area X of juvenile male zebra finches ∼3 weeks after hatching (ShFoxP2: n = 6; ShC: n = 4; mean age at the time of injection: 21 ± 1 dph). Juveniles were then housed with an adult tutor for a 5–10 day period and their songs were recorded beginning at 45 dph and at regular intervals into adulthood (>90 dph). The adult bird’s song was used to retrospectively identify the motif at various times in development (see Experimental Procedures). As reported previously (Haesler et al., 2007Haesler S. Rochefort C. Georgi B. Licznerski P. Osten P. Scharff C. Incomplete and inaccurate vocal imitation after knockdown of FoxP2 in songbird basal ganglia nucleus Area X.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e321Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), we observed that birds that received injections of LV-ShFoxP2 in Area X early in juvenile development subsequently sang poorer copies of the tutor song during late juvenile development (65 and 80 dph) and in adulthood than birds that had received LV-ShC (Figures 3A and S2A). We also noted that the LV-ShFoxP2 birds sang poorer copies of the tutor song at the earliest stage that recognizable song motifs are first produced (i.e., 45–55 dph) (Figure 3B). We then measured the pitch variability and entropy of copied syllables at regular intervals throughout development (ShFoxP2: n = 6 birds, 8 syllables; ShC: n = 4 birds, 6 syllables). Notably, juveniles that received injections of LV-ShFoxP2 sang syllables with more variable pitch and higher entropy compared to their LV-ShC-injected siblings (Figures 3C, 3D, and S2B). Moreover, when we analyzed FoxP2 levels in Area X in a subset of adult birds that had received injections of either LV-ShC or LV-ShFoxP2 early in development (∼20 dph), we found that FoxP2 levels correlated with tutor song similarity (Figure 3E; R2 = 0.65, n = 5 birds in each group). Therefore, reducing FoxP2 levels in Area X of the juvenile affects acute syllable production while also interfering with song learning over a longer time course. To dissociate the effects of LV-ShFoxP2 injections on performance and song development independent of the quality of copying, we compared each bird’s song at various stages of development to its adult song. Despite marked differences in their abilities to accurately copy a tutor song, LV-ShFoxP2- and LV-ShC-injected animals displayed comparable developmental trajectories to their final adult songs (Figures 3F and 3G; ShFoxP2: n = 6 birds, ShC: n = 4 birds, p > 0.05). These findings are consistent with the idea that reducing FoxP2 levels in Area X of the juvenile causes it to produce syllables that are more variable in pitch and also noisier, raising the possibility that these acute performance deficits impair the pupil’s ability to accurately and precisely copy a tutor song. How altered FoxP2 expression impacts transmission through corticostriatal circuits to affect learned vocalizations remains unknown. However, the relationship between the modulation of singing-related activity in the AFP and song variability suggests that reduced FoxP2 levels in Area X could affect signal propagation from HVC to LMAN. To test this idea, we made intracellular current-clamp recordings from LMAN neurons in anesthetized adult (>90 dph) male zebra finches previously injected in Area X with LV-ShFoxP2 or LV-ShC and applied a brief current pulse through a bipolar stimulating electrode positioned in the ipsilateral HVC (Figure 4A; 40 μA, 400 μs, see Experimental Procedures; LV injections were made ∼20 dph). Electrical stimulation in HVC elicited excitatory synaptic responses in all (72/72) LMAN neurons, regardless of whether they were recorded from LV-ShFoxP2 or LV-ShC animals, indicating that reduced FoxP2 levels in Area X do not prevent signal propagation through the AFP. However, the latency to the onset of the evoked synaptic response was significantly shorter in the LV-ShFoxP2 animals, indicating that signals propagate more quickly from HVC through the AFP (Figures 4B and 4C; synaptic latency: ShFoxP2 = 12.5 ± 0.3 ms; ShC = 15.5 ± 0.3 ms; ShFoxP2: n = 35 cells, 5 birds; ShC: n = 37 cells, 4 birds; p < 10 × 10−5). In contrast, the mean amplitude and coefficient of variation of latency of the evoked synaptic responses did not differ between LMAN neurons from LV-ShFoxP2 and LV-ShC birds (Figures S3A and S3B). Furthermore, the interspike interval (ISI) distributions and spontaneous firing rates of LMAN neurons did not differ between the two groups (Figures S3C and S3D).Therefore, reducing FoxP2 levels in Area X specifically affects how rapidly signals propagate from HVC through the AFP of anesthetized birds. A prior study reported that infusing a D1R antagonist into Area X of adult male zebra finches abolishes the reduced syllable variability characteristic of directed singing (Leblois and Perkel, 2012Leblois A. Perkel D.J. Striatal dopamine modulates song spectral but not temporal features through D1 receptors.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 1771-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), similar to the effects of injecting LV-ShFoxP2 into Area X of adult birds observed here. These similar behavioral effects, along with the theorized role for dopamine receptor-dependent signaling in modulating singing-related neural activity in the AFP (Doya and Sejnowski, 1995Doya K. Sejnowski T. A novel reinforcement model of birdsong vocalization learning.Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst. 1995; 7: 101-108Google Scholar, Fee and Goldberg, 2011Fee M.S. Goldberg J.H. A hypothesis for basal ganglia-dependent reinforcement learning in the songbird.Neuroscience. 2011; 198: 152-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), led us to wonder whether altered AFP signal propagation times in LV-ShFoxP2 birds reflect impaired striatopallidal sensitivity to dopamine signaling. To test this idea, we measured synaptic responses in LMAN neurons evoked by periodic (0.17 Hz) electrical stimulation in HVC before and after we injected a D1R antagonist (SCH) into Area X through a puffer pipette (Figures 4D and S3E, see Experimental Procedures). Applying SCH to Area X of adult male zebra finches significantly and reversibly decreased the mean latency of synaptic responses evoked in LMAN by HVC stimulation, indicating that dopaminergic signaling in Area X influences how rapidly signals p"

In hair cells responsive to low frequencies, two distinct adaptation mechanisms exist, a fast component of debatable origin and a slow myosin-based component. It is generally believed that Ca(2+) entry through mechano-electric transducer channels is required for both forms of adaptation. This study investigates the calcium dependence of adaptation in the mammalian auditory system. Recordings from rat cochlear hair cells demonstrate that altering Ca(2+) entry or internal Ca(2+) buffering has little effect on either adaptation kinetics or steady-state adaptation responses. Two additional findings include a voltage-dependent process and an extracellular Ca(2+) binding site, both modulating the resting open probability independent of adaptation. These data suggest that slow motor adaptation is negligible in mammalian auditory cells and that the remaining adaptation process is independent of calcium entry."

In vivo, genetic analysis of Drosophila allows mechanistic investigation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in their native microenvironment. Hemocytes, Drosophila blood cells that are akin to vertebrate myeloid cells, develop within a specialized hematopoietic organ called the lymph gland during embryonic and larval stages and contribute to the blood cells that circulate in pupae and adults (Jung et al., 2005Jung S.H. Evans C.J. Uemura C. Banerjee U. The Drosophila lymph gland as a developmental model of hematopoiesis.Development. 2005; 132: 2521-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The differentiated hemocytes, residing in the outermost layer of the lymph gland called the cortical zone (CZ; Figures 1A and 1B ), arise from undifferentiated progenitors located within the inner core region, termed the medullary zone (MZ). MZ progenitor properties include lack of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation as well as differentiation markers and multipotency, as they give rise to all Drosophila blood cell lineages (Jung et al., 2005Jung S.H.

Hematopoietic stem cells in Drosophila.Development. 2010; 137: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A small group of cells in the lymph gland, termed the posterior signaling center (PSC), expresses Hedgehog (Hh) and functions as the hematopoietic niche (Mandal et al., 2007Mandal L. Martinez-Agosto J.A. Evans C.J. Hartenstein V. Banerjee U. A Hedgehog- and Antennapedia-dependent niche maintains Drosophila haematopoietic precursors.Nature. 2007; 446: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Hh derived from the PSC synergizes with a CZ-derived signal initiated by Adenosine deaminase growth factor-A (Adgf-A) (Mondal et al., 2011Mondal B.C. Mukherjee T. Mandal L. Evans C.J. Sinenko S.A.

The MZ progenitors also respond to systemic signals that are triggered by amino acid and insulin levels in the animal (Benmimoun et al., 2012Benmimoun B. Polesello C. Waltzer L. Haenlin M.

Gene regulatory networks controlling hematopoietic progenitor niche cell production and differentiation in the Drosophila lymph gland.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e41604Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Circulating larval blood cells also arise from the head mesoderm of the embryo independently of the lymph gland. They reside in segmentally repeated epidermal-muscular pockets in which they rely on the peripheral nervous system (PNS) for their localization and survival (Makhijani et al., 2011Makhijani K. Alexander B. Tanaka T. Rulifson E. Brückner K. The peripheral nervous system supports blood cell homing and survival in the Drosophila larva.Development. 2011; 138: 5379-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe a link between the activity of olfactory neurons, GABA signaling, and the maintenance of blood progenitors. The larval olfactory system consists of a pair of dorsal organs expressing 25 specific odorant receptors (OR) in 21 olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) (Kreher et al., 2005Kreher S.A. Kwon J.Y. Carlson J.R. The molecular basis of odor coding in the Drosophila larva.Neuron. 2005; 46: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, Vosshall and Stocker, 2007Vosshall L.B. Stocker R.F. Molecular architecture of smell and taste in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 505-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). An example of such a receptor is Or83b (Orco), an atypical odorant receptor protein that is broadly expressed in every ORN and is essential for response to all odors (Larsson et al., 2004Larsson M.C. Domingos A.I. Jones W.D. Chiappe M.E. Amrein H. Vosshall L.B. Or83b encodes a broadly expressed odorant receptor essential for Drosophila olfaction.Neuron. 2004; 43: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Within the glomeruli of the larval antennal lobe, the ORNs form excitatory synapses with projection neurons (PN) whose axons innervate deeper into regions that represent higher brain centers for information processing (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007Vosshall L.B. Stocker R.F. Molecular architecture of smell and taste in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 505-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Glomeruli are interconnected either by inhibitory GABAergic (iLN) or excitatory cholinergic (eLN) local interneurons that fine-tune the ORN-PN network (Masse et al., 2009Masse N.Y. Turner G.C. Jefferis G.S. Olfactory information processing in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R700-R713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Here, we show that activation of olfactory neurons leads to a secretion of GABA from neurosecretory cells into the circulating blood. Circulating GABA activates metabotropic GABAB receptors (GABABR) on the progenitor cells and mediates changes in the intracellular Ca+2 concentration by activating PLC that regulates Ca2+ stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Nilsson et al., 1993Nilsson M.

The resulting high cytosolic Ca2+ is necessary and sufficient for maintenance of the progenitor cells, showing that, in Drosophila, smell perception is associated with the maintenance of the hematopoetic and immune system. We first investigated whether Ca2+ signaling regulates progenitor cell maintenance. To detect Ca2+ levels within cells of the lymph gland, we expressed the Ca2+ sensor GCaMP (Nakai et al., 2001Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. A high signal-to-noise Ca(2+) probe composed of a single green fluorescent protein.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) under the control of a ubiquitous driver (Ubi-Gal4). GCaMP emits green fluorescence only under conditions of high Ca2+ concentration. In addition to sensing transient Ca2+ pulses in neurons, this sensor has been previously used to monitor developmentally regulated, slow changes in Ca2+ levels (Chen et al., 2012Chen Q. Cichon J. Wang W. Qiu L. Lee S.J. Campbell N.R. Destefino N. Goard M.J. Fu Z.

During early stages of lymph gland development, before the onset of any differentiation markers, high sensor activity is detected in all cells of the lymph gland (Figure 1C). At later stages, although the sensor continues to be expressed ubiquitously in cells of the MZ and CZ (Figures S1A–S1C available online), high sensor activity is restricted to the MZ progenitors (Figures 1D and 1E). Fluorescence intensity measurements show a 6.6-fold (660%) reduction in sensor activity in the CZ cells compared with the MZ progenitors (n = 10). These results were confirmed with multiple Ca2+ sensing constructs and dyes (Figures S1D and S1F) and collectively show that, during development, hematopoietic progenitors retain stable and high Ca2+ concentration that is depleted as cells initiate differentiation. To determine whether the high Ca2+ level is causally related to the maintenance of progenitor fate, Ca2+ concentration was manipulated during hematopoietic development using multiple zone-specific drivers (Table S1) and genetic backgrounds (Figures 1 and S1). In Figures 1F–1O, domeMZ-Gal4 was used to express various genetic constructs specifically in the MZ (Figures S1G and S1H and Table S1). Inhibition of ER-mediated Ca2+ release into the cytosol by knockdown of IP3R (Figures 1F and 1G) or ryanodine receptor (RyR) (Figure 1H), reduction of store-operated Ca2+ entry by knockdown of the Orai channel (Figure 1I), or knockdown of the downstream components of the pathway—Calmodulin (CaM) (Figure 1J) or Calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) (Figure 1K)—all lead to loss of blood progenitors with a concomitant expansion of differentiated hemocytes (Figures 1F–1K, quantitation showed in Figure 1O). Conversely, experiments in which free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration is raised within the progenitors such as by overexpression of IP3R (Figure 1L), expression of a dominant-negative form of the SERCA pump (Figure 1M), or overexpression of CaMKII (Figure 1N) promote increased progenitor maintenance inhibiting differentiation (Figures 1L–1O). The above results have been recapitulated using additional drivers (Figures S1J–S1W). Altering Ca2+ levels in differentiated cells using CZ-specific drivers does not result in any blood phenotype (Figures S1X–S1AA). Furthermore, an antibody specific to phospho-CaMKII detects the activated kinase specifically in the MZ cells (Figure S1BB). We conclude that high Ca2+ is needed in the MZ cells, but not in the CZ cells, for progenitor maintenance. We used a genetic background (Tep4MZ-Gal4, UAS-mCherry; UAS-GCaMP, UAS-XRNAi/DN) that allows us to restrict expression of the sensor, measure Ca2+ activity, alter Ca2+ activity (controlled by gene X), and also mark MZ and CZ cell fate. At two different stages of development, before and during the onset of normal differentiation, we directly demonstrate that, compared to wild-type (Figures 2A and 2B ), IP3RRNAi (Figures 2C and 2D) causes lowering of Ca2+ levels (sensor activity), and SercaDN (Figures 2E and 2F) causes increase in Ca2+ level (sensor activity) within the cells of the MZ. This experiment also provides a temporal pattern whereby, in mutants that block calcium signaling, cells first lose high Ca2+, then lose MZ markers, and finally initiate differentiation. Metabotropic receptors, usually associated with neuronal function, are important for controlling intracellular Ca2+ (Bettler and Tiao, 2006Bettler B. Tiao J.Y. Molecular diversity, trafficking and subcellular localization of GABAB receptors.Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 110: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We knocked down several kinds of these receptors in the midsecond before differentiation program normally sets in and identified the metabotropic GABAB receptor (GABABR) as the signaling entity required for the maintenance of GCaMP sensor activity in the MZ progenitors. RNAi knockdown of either subunit GABABR1 or GABABR2 is sufficient to cause attenuation of GCaMP activity in the progenitors (Figures 2G–2J and S2A–S2G ). This is accompanied by loss of progenitor markers and enhanced differentiation (Figures 2K, 2L, 2O, and S2H–S2J). Unlike the MZ and CZ, the PSC size and expression of Antenapedia or Hh proteins by PSC cells are not affected (Figures S2K–S2M). GABABR mutant phenotypes can be overridden by overexpression of either the Orai channel (Figures S2N–S2P, S2T, and S2U) or wild-type CaMKII (Figures 2M–2O and S2Q–S2U). These results place activation of GABABR signaling upstream of the intracellular Ca2+ sensing mechanism in the progenitors. The above genetic data are further supported by expression analysis that localizes GABABR protein to MZ progenitors. The level of GABABR declines as the cells differentiate and form part of the CZ (Figure 2P). Additionally, GABABR is also detected in the PSC (Figure 2P), and knocking down the gene in the PSC using the driver Antp-Gal4 (Mandal et al., 2007Mandal L. Martinez-Agosto J.A. Evans C.J. Hartenstein V. Banerjee U. A Hedgehog- and Antennapedia-dependent niche maintains Drosophila haematopoietic precursors.Nature. 2007; 446: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) leads to a small lymph gland size without causing any increase in progenitor differentiation (Figures 2Q–2T). This small lymph gland phenotype, superposed on the progenitor maintenance phenotype, is seen in several contexts of Ca2+ loss-of-function genetic backgrounds (indicated in relevant figures by differences in scale bars). When PSC knockdown is caused later in development (using gal80ts; see Experimental Procedures), no change in lymph gland size (or any other mutant phenotype) is apparent (Figures S2V and S2W). This suggests that GABABR function in the PSC controls the size of the lymph gland (see, for example, Pennetier et al., 2012Pennetier D. Oyallon J. Morin-Poulard I. Dejean S. Vincent A. Crozatier M. Size control of the Drosophila hematopoietic niche by bone morphogenetic protein signaling reveals parallels with mammals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 3389-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This function is earlier than, and separable from, the progenitor maintenance phenotype of the MZ. The neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), is the endogenous ligand that activates GABAR and is synthesized by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase1 (Gad1). GABA immunoreactivity is detected on the cell surface of MZ progenitors (Figures 3A and S3A) and is extremely detergent sensitive (see Extended Experimental Procedures and Figures S3B and S3C). Lymph-gland-specific expression of Gad1 RNAi does not cause any differentiation or progenitor loss phenotypes (Figures S3D and S3E), nor does this eliminate GABA immunoreactivity in the MZ of the lymph gland (Figures S3F and S3G). Moreover, Gad1 is not expressed in the lymph gland (Figure S3H) as shown by staining with a specific antibody (Jackson et al., 1990Jackson F.R. Newby L.M. Kulkarni S.J. Drosophila GABAergic systems: sequence and expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase.J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1068-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We conclude that the GABA detected on the lymph gland is synthesized elsewhere and binds to the GABAR on the surface of the MZ progenitors. Consistent with this notion, lymph-gland-independent GABA is also detected in the lumen of the heart/aorta (dorsal vessel, DV; Figures S3I and S3J) in direct contact with the hemolymph.

These cells belong to the same neurosecretory cluster as the cells marked by arrows but they do not secrete GABA. (L′) shows the same image in the red channel (GABA staining) only. In contrast to the above results, when GABA production is specifically blocked in all neurons (elav-Gal4; UAS-Gad1RNAi), GABA immunoreactivity on the lymph gland is lost (Figure 3B), MZ progenitor maintenance is severely affected (Figures 3B and 3C), and hemolymph GABA is reduced (Figure 3D). Thus, neuronally derived GABA is secreted and detected in circulation and on the lymph gland. GABA released as a neurotransmitter at synapses within the brain is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier. In Drosophila, several populations of neurosecretory cells have been described that secrete small molecules and hormones into circulation, and drivers that identify these rare cells within the brain have been developed (Nässel and Winther, 2010Nässel D.R. Winther A.M. Drosophila neuropeptides in regulation of physiology and behavior.Prog. Neurobiol. 2010; 92: 42-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, Siegmund and Korge, 2001Siegmund T. Korge G. Innervation of the ring gland of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 431: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Of interest to this study are the Kurs6+ neurons. Unlike in the ventral nerve cord, which has many Kurs6+ neurons, only six cluster pairs of three to four neurosecretory cells each express Kurs6 within the central brain (Figure S3K). These were of interest as a single pair of a four cell Kurs6+ cluster near the subesophageal ganglion region contains two cells per cluster that exhibit high GABA immunoreactivity (Figures 3E and S3L). Blocking GABA synthesis with Gad1RNAi or its vesicular packaging using VGATRNAi in the Kurs6+ group of neurons results in downregulation of GABA levels specifically in these Kurs6+GABA+ cells (Figures 3F and 3G), whereas the overall brain GABA expression remains unaffected (Figure 3F). More importantly, lymph glands from Kurs6-GAL4; UAS-Gad1RNAi and Kurs6-GAL4; UAS-VGATRNAi backgrounds have reduced circulating GABA in the hemolymph when compared to sibling controls (Figure 3H), and they show severely reduced GABA immunoreactivity and reduced maintenance of blood progenitors in the lymph gland (Figures 3I–3K). The critical issue of physiological relevance of the above findings requires investigation of upstream mechanisms by which GABA levels are maintained in the neurosecretory cells contained within the central brain. Our past work (Shim et al., 2012Shim J. Mukherjee T. Banerjee U. Direct sensing of systemic and nutritional signals by haematopoietic progenitors in Drosophila.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) suggests that system-level changes can influence blood progenitor behavior, and we investigated whether sensory input, such as that provided by olfaction, may play a role in this process. The common odorant coreceptor 83b (Orco) is broadly expressed in every ORN essential for all olfaction (Larsson et al., 2004Larsson M.C. Domingos A.I. Jones W.D. Chiappe M.E. Amrein H. Vosshall L.B. Or83b encodes a broadly expressed odorant receptor essential for Drosophila olfaction.Neuron. 2004; 43: 703-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), and the mutant combination orco2/Df[orco] is viable. By investigating the lymph glands of these mutants, we find clear evidence for lymph gland lobes with loss of blood progenitor cells and a concomitant increase in differentiated blood cells (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4F ). A connection between odorant receptor function and blood development is an important finding and was therefore confirmed in several different ways. The blood differentiation phenotype of the orco mutant is also seen upon (1) ablating all ORNs using Orco-Gal4-driven expression of proapoptotic genes hid-rpr (Figure 4C), (2) expression of OrcoRNAi (Figure 4D), and (3) blocking ORN function by expression of Shits1 (Figure 4E). In addition to the blood differentiation phenotypes, blocking olfactory function in these backgrounds results in a dramatic reduction of GABA immunoreactivity in the lymph gland (Figures 4G and 4H). The systemic level of hemolymph GABA extracted from orco mutants (orco2/Df[orco]) is also significantly reduced (Figure 4I). Upstream of the lymph gland, GABA expression in the Kurs6+GABA+ cells of the brain in orco mutant (orco2/Df[orco]) is significantly reduced, demonstrating t"

Neural circuits are assembled through interactions between neurites, both axons and dendrites, of vast numbers of neurons. This assembly relies upon many different receptors and ligands mediating repulsive and adhesive interactions between neurites. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of repulsive interactions between neurites of the same cell for patterning neural circuits.

Genetic studies indicate that thousands of isoforms are necessary for self-avoidance (Hattori et al., 2009Hattori D. Chen Y. Matthews B.J. Salwinski L. Sabatti C. Grueber W.B. Zipursky S.L. Robust discrimination between self and non-self neurites requires thousands of Dscam1 isoforms.Nature. 2009; 461: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and neurons must express different Dscam1 isoforms from their neighbors for normal patterning (Hughes et al., 2007Hughes M.E.

Drosophila sensory neurons require Dscam for dendritic self-avoidance and proper dendritic field organization.Neuron. 2007; 54: 403-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As neurons often encounter the neurites of many different cells, particularly in dense neuropile in the developing central nervous system (CNS), robust mechanisms must exist to ensure that neurons that encounter each other during development express different isoforms. Dscam1 isoforms are generated through alternative splicing (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Drosophila Dscam is an axon guidance receptor exhibiting extraordinary molecular diversity.Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Each extracellular domain shares the same overall domain structure, but differs in amino acid sequence in one or more of three variable Ig domains, designated Ig2, Ig3, and Ig7. These are encoded by clusters of alternative exons with 12 variants of exon 4 (encoding half of Ig2), 48 variants of exon 6 (encoding half of Ig3), and 33 variants of exon 9 (encoding Ig7 in its entirety) (Figure 1A). Each combination of three variable domains determines the unique binding specificity of each isoform. Indeed, some 18,000 of the 19,008 potential extracellular domains exhibit strong isoform-specific homophilic binding (Wojtowicz et al., 2004Wojtowicz W.M. Flanagan J.J. Millard S.S. Zipursky S.L.

A vast repertoire of Dscam binding specificities arises from modular interactions of variable Ig domains.Cell. 2007; 130: 1134-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The ability of neurites to discriminate between self and nonself depends critically on the pattern of alternative splicing of Dscam1 in each neuron. Although genetic studies indicate that neurons with overlapping dendrites and axons must express different isoforms, the expression of Dscam1 isoforms in vivo has not been described. Microarray studies on cDNAs prepared by RT-PCR from a small number of single R7 and R3/R4 photoreceptor neurons, isolated by FACS, indicated that a single neuron expresses multiple variants of exon 9 (Neves et al., 2004Neves G. Zucker J. Daly M. Chess A. Stochastic yet biased expression of multiple Dscam splice variants by individual cells.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear whether photoreceptor neurons require Dscam1 for circuit assembly, using the same molecular approach we later reported a similar mode of expression in a small number of mushroom body (MB) neurons, which require Dscam1 for self-avoidance (Zhan et al., 2004Zhan X.L. Clemens J.C. Neves G. Hattori D. Flanagan J.J. Hummel T. Vasconcelos M.L. Chess A. Zipursky S.L. Analysis of Dscam diversity in regulating axon guidance in Drosophila mushroom bodies.Neuron. 2004; 43: 673-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that photoreceptor and MB neurons express different combinations of Dscam1 isoforms conferring unique cell identities to them. It has not been demonstrated how the expression of a unique combination of Dscam1 isoforms in each neuron is determined. Neurons may express Dscam1 isoforms in a highly regulated or deterministic fashion reflecting their cell type, their unique location (e.g., their dorsoventral or anteroposterior location), developmental history (e.g., their birth date or lineage) or some combination of such developmental determinants. Alternatively, the pattern of isoform expression may not be regulated in a deterministic fashion, but rather may result from lack of regulation. A probabilistic choice of isoforms, in theory, provides a robust and efficient means by which neurons acquire unique identities (Forbes et al., 2011Forbes E.M. Hunt J.J. Goodhill G.J. The combinatorics of neurite self-avoidance.Neural Comput. 2011; 23: 2746-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, Hattori et al., 2009Hattori D. Chen Y. Matthews B.J. Salwinski L. Sabatti C. Grueber W.B. Zipursky S.L. Robust discrimination between self and non-self neurites requires thousands of Dscam1 isoforms.Nature. 2009; 461: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, different strategies may be employed in different systems. Distinguishing between these possibilities has been hampered by the difficulties in assessing the expression of alternative isoforms at the level of identified neurons within the developing nervous system. Here, we report that Dscam1 splicing is probabilistic through the analysis of alternative exon 4 expression using splicing reporters. Live imaging revealed that the alternative variants spliced in a given cell also change over time. A similar mode of splicing was observed in cells requiring Dscam1 for self-avoidance in axons, dendrites, and postsynaptic elements, and more generally throughout the nervous system. These findings support the notion that the ability of neurites to discriminate between self and nonself relies on a probabilistic mechanism to endow developing neurons with unique cell surface identities. As specific cell types were not found to reproducibly splice the same alternative exon 4, and thus they do not express isoforms with the same binding specificity, it is unlikely that neurons use Dscam1 to specify interactions between different neuronal cell types. Conversely, widespread probabilistic splicing supports a role for Dscam1 diversity in self-recognition throughout the developing nervous system. We devised a splicing reporter system to visualize the expression of single alternative variants of exon 4 from the endogenous Dscam1 locus in individual cells in vivo. Reporter constructs were knocked into the endogenous locus by homologous recombination of exons 3–5 with a replaceable cassette, followed by phiC31 recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) (see Figure S1, available online; Extended Experimental Procedures). The detection system was designed to monitor expression in fixed preparations and in live animals at different time points and to identify cells expressing different alternative exons by their morphology, coexpression of specific markers, or both. We generated reporters for each of the 12 alternative variants of exon 4. Each variant is referred to as exon 4.X, where X indicates the position of the alternative variant within the cluster from 5′ to 3′ (i.e., exon 4.5 is the fifth alternative exon downstream from exon 3). In each reporter, only a single alternative variant was in-frame with a downstream indicator, the transcriptional activator GAL4. The remaining 11 alternative variants all included a frame-shift mutation that rendered the indicator out-of-frame (Figure 1B). Thus, GAL4 was expressed only in neurons that spliced the single remaining wild-type alternative variant. These neurons were visualized by expression of either membrane-bound or nuclear GFP under the control of tandemly arranged UAS elements. Positive and negative control alleles were also generated, in which all variants were in frame (Dscam1positive-Gal4) or out of frame (Dscam1negative-Gal4). As the reporter knockin mutations inactivate Dscam1, all experiments were done in a heterozygous background. No morphological or developmental defects were observed in this background in any of the systems we analyzed. As expected, positive controls were expressed widely, and only very few weakly stained scattered cells were observed in the negative control. By contrast, each of the 12 single exon reporters was expressed in a salt-and-pepper pattern within the developing nervous system. Here, we describe the expression patterns of all 12 variants of alternative exon 4 in developing MB neurons in the central brain, dendritic arborization (da) neurons in the periphery, and visual system neurons. A role for Dscam1 in self-avoidance was first described in the MB (Zhan et al., 2004Zhan X.L. Clemens J.C. Neves G. Hattori D. Flanagan J.J. Hummel T. Vasconcelos M.L. Chess A. Zipursky S.L. Analysis of Dscam diversity in regulating axon guidance in Drosophila mushroom bodies.Neuron. 2004; 43: 673-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). MB is a bi-lobed structure in the central brain, with each lobe containing one of two sister branches of intrinsic MB neurons (i.e., Kenyon cells) (Figure 2A). Each MB contains ∼2,500 Kenyon cells. These cells send axons within a common nerve called the peduncle. Axons bifurcate at the base of the peduncle, and the branches segregate and extend into separate lobes with high fidelity. In the absence of Dscam1, as assessed in single mutant cells, sister branches often fail to segregate, and instead, the two branches extend within the same lobe. Here, we argued that axons from different neurons express different Dscam1 isoforms, such that at the common branch point branches discriminate between self and nonself. This “self-recognition” would lead to homophilic repulsion and branch segregation (Hattori et al., 2007Hattori D. Demir E. Kim H.W. Viragh E. Zipursky S.L. Dickson B.J.

We assessed expression of all 12 variants of exon 4 during MB development in pupae. Dscam1positive-Gal4 was expressed strongly in both lobes of the MB (Figure 2C1). This resulted from the reporter expression in the Kenyon cells and possibly other neurons sending process into the lobes (i.e., MB extrinsic neurons). Most, if not all, Kenyon cells expressed Dscam1positive-Gal4 (Figure 2C2), consistent with previous data indicating Dscam1 expression in these cells (Zhan et al., 2004Zhan X.L. Clemens J.C. Neves G. Hattori D. Flanagan J.J. Hummel T. Vasconcelos M.L. Chess A. Zipursky S.L. Analysis of Dscam diversity in regulating axon guidance in Drosophila mushroom bodies.Neuron. 2004; 43: 673-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). By contrast, only a couple of weakly stained cells were observed in the negative control (i.e., Dscam1negative-Gal4) (Figures 2B1 and 2B2). The source of this background expression is not known. Each of the 12 exon 4 variants was expressed in a subset of cells (Figures 2D–2G; Figures S2A–S2J). For a given alternative variant, the expression level and number of cells expressing the variant were qualitatively similar between animals. By contrast, the expression frequency for different alternative variants was different (Figures 2D–2G; Figures S2A–S2J). For example, the frequency of exon 4.2 splicing was consistently lower than any other alternative variant we analyzed (Figures 2E1 and 2E2). In contrast, exon 4.12 was expressed in many more cells at much higher levels (Figures 2G1 and 2G2). Furthermore, although the frequency of expression of a given variant was similar between animals, there was no obvious similarity in the distribution of cells in different animals. The overall bias in splicing of the alternative variants is consistent with our previous expression data obtained on populations of Kenyon cells isolated by FACS (Zhan et al., 2004Zhan X.L. Clemens J.C. Neves G. Hattori D. Flanagan J.J. Hummel T. Vasconcelos M.L. Chess A. Zipursky S.L. Analysis of Dscam diversity in regulating axon guidance in Drosophila mushroom bodies.Neuron. 2004; 43: 673-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For example, microarray and cDNA sequencing results both indicated that exons 4.2 and 4.12 represent the two extremes of the frequency spectrum with exon 4.2 expressing the least and exon 4.12 the most. The convergence of these data argues that the splicing trap method accurately reflects splicing in vivo. To assess rigorously whether Dscam1 alternative splicing is probabilistic, we analyzed expression in class IV da neurons. The dendrites of these neurons require Dscam1 for self-avoidance. In wild-type, each class IV da neuron forms highly branched dendrites that do not overlap (Grueber et al., 2002Grueber W.B. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Tiling of the Drosophila epidermis by multidendritic sensory neurons.Development. 2002; 129: 2867-2878PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, in the absence of Dscam1, these dendrites frequently cross one another, form clumps, and as a consequence, disrupt coverage of the receptive field (Hughes et al., 2007Hughes M.E.

Each class IV da neuron can be identified reliably from animal to animal based on its unique position, morphology, and marker expression. There is a dorsal (ddaC), lateral (v’ada), and ventral (vdaB) class IV neuron in each abdominal hemisegment A1 through A7 (Grueber et al., 2002Grueber W.B. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

Integrins regulate repulsion-mediated dendritic patterning of Drosophila sensory neurons by restricting dendrites in a 2D space.Neuron. 2012; 73: 64-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). Thus, this system allows us to score the alternative splicing of exon 4 in 42 different uniquely identified neurons in each animal and to compare expression between these cells and between the same cell in different animals. We first set out to address whether the choice of alternative exon 4 variant is always the same for a class IV neuron in the same location in different animals. GFP-tagged histone H2A was used to detect the expression of each splicing reporter, and class IV da neurons were identified by the expression of tandem dimer Tomato under the control of a genomic element from the pickpocket locus (Han et al., 2011Han C. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Enhancer-driven membrane markers for analysis of nonautonomous mechanisms reveal neuron-glia interactions in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 9673-9678Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (Figures 3B and 3C). Each neuron in abdominal segments A1 through A7 was identified, and its nuclear GFP intensity was quantified to determine the expression (i.e., simply ON or OFF). GFP intensity in Dscam1negative-Gal4 was used to determine the threshold between ON and OFF. Briefly, the histogram was fit to a Gamma probability distribution function to determine a threshold value; 312/314 of the control cells were below this value (for details, see Extended Experimental Procedures). With this threshold, the positive control was expressed in all neurons scored except one (i.e., 1/299), confirming Dscam1 expression at this stage (Figure 3E). By contrast, in every animal, only a subset of the 42 class IV da neurons expressed each alternative exon 4 variant (Figures 3F–3I; Figures S3A–S3G). Moreover, the set of neurons that spliced a given variant was different between individual animals, and no cell expressed the same variant across all animals, with the exception of three cells that expressed exon 4.2 in all eight animals analyzed (Figures 3F–3J; Figures S3A–S3G). Given that exon 4.2 is expressed in ∼80% of class IV neurons, we would expect on average seven cells to express this alternative exon in all animals by chance. Thus, the splicing choice is not deterministic. To determine whether the probability of splicing a specific variant is the same for each class IV da neuron (i.e., whether there is a splicing bias for cells in certain locations), we performed statistical simulations. For a given alternative exon 4 variant, the spatial splicing patterns were shuffled to generate a set of randomized patterns. The pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was then calculat"
https://openalex.org/W2142355474,"The mammalian neocortex is a highly interconnected network of different types of neurons organized into both layers and columns. Overlaid on this structural organization is a pattern of functional connectivity that can be rapidly and flexibly altered during behavior. Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory neurons, which are implicated in cortical oscillations and can change neuronal selectivity, may play a pivotal role in these dynamic changes. We found that optogenetic activation of PV+ neurons in the auditory cortex enhanced feedforward functional connectivity in the putative thalamorecipient circuit and in cortical columnar circuits. In contrast, stimulation of PV+ neurons induced no change in connectivity between sites in the same layers. The activity of PV+ neurons may thus serve as a gating mechanism to enhance feedforward, but not lateral or feedback, information flow in cortical circuits. Functionally, it may preferentially enhance the contribution of bottom-up sensory inputs to perception."
https://openalex.org/W2022878394,"Retrograde communication from axonal targets to neuronal cell bodies is critical for both the development and function of the nervous system. Much progress has been made in recent years linking long-distance, retrograde signaling to a signaling endosome, yet the mechanisms governing the trafficking and signaling of these endosomes remain mostly uncharacterized. Here we report that in mouse sympathetic neurons, the target-derived nerve growth factor (NGF)–tropomyosin-related kinase type 1 (TrkA, also called Ntrk1) signaling endosome, on arrival at the cell body, induces the expression and recruitment of a new effector protein known as Coronin-1 (also called Coro1a). In the absence of Coronin-1, the NGF-TrkA signaling endosome fuses to lysosomes sixfold to tenfold faster than when Coronin-1 is intact. We also define a new Coronin-1–dependent trafficking event in which signaling endosomes recycle and re-internalize on arrival at the cell body. Beyond influencing endosomal trafficking, Coronin-1 is also required for several NGF-TrkA–dependent signaling events, including calcium release, calcineurin activation and phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). These results establish Coronin-1 as an essential component of a feedback loop that mediates NGF-TrkA endosome stability, recycling and signaling as a critical mechanism governing developmental competition for survival."

Yet all functional data thus far come from studies that have used neuroimaging or electroencephalography, leaving important questions about their precise source and neuronal underpinnings. We capitalized on the comorbidity between epilepsy and ASD (Sansa et al., 2011Sansa G. Carlson C. Doyle W. Weiner H.L. Bluvstein J. Barr W. Devinsky O. Medically refractory epilepsy in autism.Epilepsia. 2011; 52: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with the ability to record from clinically implanted depth electrodes in patients with epilepsy who are candidates for neurosurgical temporal lobectomy. This gave us the opportunity to record intracranially from the amygdala in two rare neurosurgical patients who had medically refractory epilepsy, but who also had a diagnosis of ASD, comparing their data to those obtained from eight control patients who also had medically refractory epilepsy and depth electrodes in the amygdala, but who did not have a diagnosis of ASD (see Tables S1 and S2 available online for characterization of all the patients). Perhaps the best-studied aspect of abnormal social information processing in ASD is face processing. People with ASD show abnormal fixations onto (Kliemann et al., 2010Kliemann D. Dziobek I. Hatri A.

A recurring pattern across studies is the failure to fixate and to extract information from the eye region of faces in ASD. Instead, at least when high functioning, people with ASD may compensate by making exaggerated use of information from the mouth region of the face (Neumann et al., 2006Neumann D. Spezio M.L. Piven J.

Furthermore, neurological patients with focal bilateral amygdala lesions show intriguing parallels to the pattern of facial feature processing seen in ASD, also failing to fixate and use the eye region of the face (Adolphs et al., 2005Adolphs R.

Yet despite the wealth of suggestive data linking ASD, the amygdala, and abnormal social processing, data broadly consistent with long-standing hypotheses about the amygdala’s contribution to social dysfunction in autism (Baron-Cohen et al., 2000Baron-Cohen S. Ring H.A. Bullmore E.T. Wheelwright S. Ashwin C. Williams S.C. The amygdala theory of autism.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2000; 24: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), there are as yet no such studies at the neuronal level. This gap in our investigations is important to fill for several reasons. First and foremost, one would like to confirm that the prior observations translate into abnormal electrophysiological responses from neurons within the amygdala, rather than constituting a possible epiphenomenon arising from altered inputs due to more global dysfunction, or from structural abnormalities in the absence of any clear functional consequence. Moreover, such findings should also yield a deeper understanding of precisely which functional abnormalities can be attributed to the amygdala: are there nonspecific electrophysiological deviations, or is the dysfunction more specific to processing faces? Are all neurons dysfunctional, or might there be some populations that are abnormal whereas others are not? Answers at this level of analysis would help considerably in constraining the interpretations from neuroimaging studies, would allow the formulation of more precise hypotheses about the amygdala’s putative role in social dysfunction in autism, and would better leverage animal models of autism that could be investigated at the cellular level. Here we recorded from single neurons in the amygdalae of two rare neurosurgical patients with ASD. Basic electrophysiological response parameters as well as overall responsiveness to faces were comparable to responses recorded from a control patient group without ASD. However, there were specific differences in how individual facial features drove neuronal responses: neurons in the two ASD patients responded significantly more to the mouth, but less to the eyes. Additional analyses showed that the findings could not be attributed to differential fixations onto the stimuli, or to differential task difficulty, but that they did correlate with behavioral use of facial features to make emotion judgments. We isolated a total of 144 amygdala neurons from neurosurgical patients who had chronically implanted clinical-research hybrid depth electrodes in the medial temporal lobe (see Figures 1 and S1 for localization of all recording sites within the amygdala). Recordings were mostly from the basomedial and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (see Experimental Procedures for details). We further considered only those units with firing rate ≥0.5 Hz (n = 91 in total, 37 from the patients with ASD). Approximately half the neurons (n = 42 in total, 19 from the patients with ASD) responded significantly to faces or parts thereof, whereas only 14% responded to a preceding “scramble” stimulus compared to baseline (Tables S3 and S4; cf. Figure 3A for stimulus design). Waveforms and interspike interval distributions looked indistinguishable between neurons recorded from the ASD patients and controls (Figure 2). To characterize basic electrophysiological signatures more objectively, we quantified the trough-to-peak time for each mean waveform of each neuron that was included in our subsequent analyses (Figure 2 and Experimental Procedures), a variable whose distribution was significantly bimodal with peaks around 0.4 and 1 ms (Hartigan’s dip test, p < 1 × 10−10) for neurons in both subject groups, consistent with prior human recordings (Viskontas et al., 2007Viskontas I.V. Ekstrom A.D. Wilson C.L. Fried I. Characterizing interneuron and pyramidal cells in the human medial temporal lobe in vivo using extracellular recordings.Hippocampus. 2007; 17: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The distribution of trough-to-peak times was statistically indistinguishable between the two subject groups (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.16). We quantified the variability of the spike times of each cell using a burst index and a modified coefficient-of-variation (CV2) measure and found no significant differences in either measure when comparing neurons between the two subject groups (paired t tests, p > 0.05; see Table S5). Similarly, measures of the variability of the spiking response (see Experimental Procedures) following stimulus onset did not differ between cells recorded in ASD patients and controls (mean CV in ASD 1.02 ± 0.04 versus 0.93 ± 0.04 in controls, p > 0.05). Basic electrophysiological parameters characterizing spikes thus appeared to be typical in our two patients with ASD.Figure 2Electrophysiological Properties of Neurons in ASD Patients and ControlsShow full caption(A and B) Mean spike waveforms (n = 37 units for ASD; n = 54 units for controls).

To investigate face processing, we used an unbiased approach in which randomly sampled pieces of emotional faces (“bubbles”; Gosselin and Schyns, 2001Gosselin F. Schyns P.G. Bubbles: a technique to reveal the use of information in recognition tasks.Vision Res. 2001; 41: 2261-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) were shown to participants while they pressed a button to indicate whether the stimulus looked happy or fearful, a technique we have previously used to demonstrate that the amygdala is essential to process information about the eye region in faces (Adolphs et al., 2005Adolphs R. Gosselin F. Buchanan T.W. Tranel D. Schyns P. Damasio A.R. A mechanism for impaired fear recognition after amygdala damage.Nature. 2005; 433: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Complementing this data-driven approach, we also showed participants specific cutouts of the eyes and mouth, as well as the whole faces from which all these were derived (Figure 3A). The difficulty of the bubbles task was continuously controlled by adjusting the extent to which the face was revealed to achieve a target performance of 80% correct (Figure 3B shows examples). As subjects improved in performance, less of the face was revealed (as quantified by the number of bubbles) to keep the task equally difficult for all subjects. The two patients with ASD performed well on the task (Figure 3C), with accuracy as good as or exceeding that of the controls (number of bubbles for the last trial was 13.5 ± 8.5 and 20.0 ± 2.8, respectively; see Figure S2A for individual subjects). Similarly, reaction time (RT) did not differ significantly between patients with ASD and controls (relative to stimulus onset across all bubble trials, 1,357 ± 346 ms and 1,032 ± 49 ms, respectively; p = 0.28, two-tailed t test) although one of the ASD patients did have slower RT than any of the other participants (see Figure S2B for individual subjects). Thus, overall behavioral performance of patients with ASD did not appear impaired. Neurons in the primate amygdala are known to respond to faces (Fried et al., 1997Fried I. MacDonald K.A. Wilson C.L.

Tudusciuc O. Neumann D. Mamelak A.N. Heller A.C. Ross I.B. Philpott L. Sutherling W.W. Adolphs R. Single-unit responses selective for whole faces in the human amygdala.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1654-1660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Using published metrics, we here found that one-third (12/37 and 17/54, respectively) of neurons we recorded qualified as whole-face selective (WF) in the ASD and control groups. To further establish that there was no difference in the strength of face selectivity between the two subject groups, we quantified whole-face response strength relative to the response to face parts using the whole-face index (WFI, see Experimental Procedures), which quantifies the difference in firing rate between whole faces and parts (bubbles) (Rutishauser et al., 2011Rutishauser U. Tudusciuc O. Neumann D. Mamelak A.N. Heller A.C. Ross I.B. Philpott L. Sutherling W.W. Adolphs R. Single-unit responses selective for whole faces in the human amygdala.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1654-1660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The average WFI for all units recorded in the ASD patients and controls, respectively, was 19.1% ± 2.3% (n = 37) and 23.0% ± 4.5% (n = 54), respectively, which were not significantly different (two-tailed t test, p = 0.45). The average WFI for units classified as WF cells was 49.3% ± 12.1% for ASD (n = 12) and 60.2% ± 12.4% for controls (n = 17) (not significantly different, p = 0.55, two-tailed t test). WF cells did not differ in their basic electrophysiological properties between ASD and controls: there was no significant difference of waveform shape, burst index, or CV2 (see Table S5). Thus, there was no significant difference in the whole-face selectivity of amygdala neurons between our two ASD subjects and controls. Together with the comparable basic electrophysiological properties we described above, this provides a common background against which to interpret the striking differences we describe next. The “bubbles” method allows the extraction of a classification image that describes how specific (but randomly sampled) regions of a face drive a dependent measure (Adolphs et al., 2005Adolphs R.

Disord. 2007; 37: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); of which we here considered two: behavioral and neural. The behavioral classification image (BCI) depicts the facial information that influences behavioral performance in the task. It is based on the correlation between the trial-by-trial appearance of any part of the face, and the RT and accuracy on that trial, calculated across all pixels and all trials (Gosselin and Schyns, 2001Gosselin F. Schyns P.G. Bubbles: a technique to reveal the use of information in recognition tasks.Vision Res. 2001; 41: 2261-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The BCI showed that subjects with ASD selectively failed to make use of the eye region of faces, relying almost exclusively on the mouth (Figures 4B, 4D, S2C, and S2D), a behavioral pattern typical of people with ASD (Spezio et al., 2007aSpezio M.L.

Disord. 2007; 37: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and one that clearly distinguishes our two ASD patients from the controls (two-way ANOVA of subject group [ASD/control] by region of interest [ROI; eye/mouth] showed a significant interaction; F(1,16) = 6.0, p = 0.026; Figure 4D). To understand what facial features were driving neuronal responses, we next computed a neuronal classification image (NCI) that depicts which features of faces were potent in modulating spike rates for a given neuron (the spike-rate-derived analog of the BCI). For each bubbles trial, we counted the number of spikes in a 1.5 s window beginning 100 ms poststimulus onset, and correlated this with the parts of the face revealed in the stimulus sho"
https://openalex.org/W2095452832,"Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are oligomeric stress proteins characterized by an α-crystallin domain (ACD) surrounded by a N-terminal arm and C-terminal extension. Publications on sHSPs have reported that they exist in prokaryotes and eukaryotes but, to our knowledge, not in viruses. Here we show that sHSPs are present in some cyanophages that infect the marine unicellular cyanobacteria, Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. These phage sHSPs contain a conserved ACD flanked by a relatively conserved N-terminal arm and a short C-terminal extension with or without the conserved C-terminal anchoring module (CAM) L-X-I/V, suggested to be implicated in the oligomerization. In addition, cyanophage sHSPs have the signature pattern, P-P-[YF]-N-[ILV]-[IV]-x(9)-[EQ], in the predicted β2 and β3 strands of the ACD. Phylogenetically, cyanophage sHSPs form a monophyletic clade closer to bacterial class A sHSPs than to cyanobacterial sHSPs. Furthermore, three sHSPs from their cellular host, Synechococcus, are phylogenetically close to plants sHSPs. Implications of evolutionary relationships between the sHSPs of cyanophages, bacterial class A, cyanobacteria, and plants are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2061008627,"T cells specific for hepatitis C virus (HCV) have been reported in some individuals who have been repeatedly exposed to virus, yet have never had detectable HCV or HCV-specific antibodies. These findings suggest that T cells in these individuals may protect against infection by HCV. Barbara Rehermann and colleagues now test this assumption in a nonhuman primate study exposing animals to a very low dose of HCV. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is endemic in many countries due to its high propensity for establishing persistence1. The presence of HCV-specific T cells in subjects repeatedly exposed to HCV who test negative for HCV RNA and antibodies and who do not have any history of HCV infection has been interpreted as T cell–mediated protection2,3,4,5. Here, we show in nonhuman primates that repeated exposure to human plasma with trace amounts of HCV induced HCV-specific T cells without seroconversion and systemic viremia but did not protect upon subsequent HCV challenge. Rather, HCV-specific recall and de novo T cell responses, as well as intrahepatic T cell recruitment and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production, were suppressed upon HCV challenge, concomitant with quantitative and qualitative changes in regulatory T cells (Treg cells) that occurred after subinfectious HCV exposure and increased after HCV challenge. In vitro Treg cell depletion restored HCV-specific T cell responses. Thus, T cells primed by trace amounts of HCV do not generate effective recall responses upon subsequent HCV infection. Subinfectious HCV exposure predisposes to Treg cell expansion, which suppresses effector T cells during subsequent infection. Strategies to reverse this exposure-induced immune suppression should be examined to aid in the development of T cell−based vaccines against HCV and other endemic pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2037917923,"Silk-based scaffolds have been introduced to bone tissue regeneration for years, however, their local therapeutic efficency in bone metabolic disease condition has been seldom reported. According to our previous report, mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG)/silk scaffolds exhibits superior in vitro bioactivity and in vivo osteogenic properties compared to non-mesoporous bioactive glass (BG)/silk scaffolds, but no information could be found about their efficiency in osteoporotic (OVX) environment. This study investigated a biomaterial-based approach for improving MSCs behavior in vitro, and accelerating OVX defect healing by using 3D BG/silk and MBG/silk scaffolds, and pure silk scaffolds as control. The results of SEM, CCK-8 assay and quantitative ALP activity showed that MBG/silk scaffolds can improve attachment, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of both O-MSCs and sham control. In vivo therapeutic efficiency was evaluated by μCT analysis, hematoxylin and eosin staining, safranin O staining and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, indicating accelerated bone formation with compatible scaffold degradation and reduced osteoclastic response of defect healing in OVX rats after 2 and 4 weeks treatment, with a rank order of MBG/silk > BG/silk > silk group. Immunohistochemical markers of COL I, OPN, BSP and OCN also revealed that MBG/silk scaffolds can better induce accelerated collagen and non-collagen matrix production. The findings of this study suggest that MBG/silk scaffolds provide a better environment for cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation, and act as potential substitute for treating local osteoporotic defects."
https://openalex.org/W1977635151,"Autoimmunity is triggered by trafficking of self-reactive T cells into tissues. Joonsoo Kang and colleagues show that the kinase ITK regulates T cell trafficking. ITK inhibition or genetic ablation prevents homing of autoreactive T cells into tissues and reduces islet destruction in models of type 1 diabetes without affecting T cell activation or antiviral T cell responses, suggesting that this kinase may be targeted in autoimmune disease. Activation of self-reactive T cells and their trafficking to target tissues leads to autoimmune organ destruction. Mice lacking the co-inhibitory receptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) develop fatal autoimmunity characterized by lymphocytic infiltration into nonlymphoid tissues. Here, we demonstrate that the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway regulates the trafficking of self-reactive Ctla4−/− T cells to tissues. Concurrent ablation of the CD28-activated Tec family kinase ITK does not block spontaneous T cell activation but instead causes self-reactive Ctla4−/− T cells to accumulate in secondary lymphoid organs. Despite excessive spontaneous T cell activation and proliferation in lymphoid organs, Itk−/−; Ctla4−/− mice are otherwise healthy, mount antiviral immune responses and exhibit a long lifespan. We propose that ITK specifically licenses autoreactive T cells to enter tissues to mount destructive immune responses. Notably, ITK inhibitors mimic the null mutant phenotype and also prevent pancreatic islet infiltration by diabetogenic T cells in mouse models of type 1 diabetes, highlighting their potential utility for the treatment of human autoimmune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2082955485,"Adhesion inhibitors that block the attachment of pathogens to host tissues may be used synergistically with or as an alternative to antibiotics. The wide-spread bacterial adhesin Multivalent Adhesion Molecule (MAM) 7 has recently emerged as a candidate molecule for a broad-spectrum adhesion inhibitor which may be used to prevent bacterial colonization of wounds. Here we have tested if the antibacterial properties of a MAM-based inhibitor could be used to competitively inhibit adhesion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to host cells. Additionally, we analyzed its effect on host cellular functions linked to the host receptor fibronectin, such as migration, adhesion and matrix formation in vitro, to evaluate potential side effects prior to advancing our studies to in vivo infection models. As controls, we used inhibitors based on well-characterized bacterial adhesin-derived peptides from F1 and FnBPA, which are known to affect host cellular functions. Inhibitors based on F1 or FnBPA blocked MRSA attachment but at the same time abrogated important cellular functions. A MAM7-based inhibitor did not interfere with host cell function while showing good efficacy against MRSA adhesion in a tissue culture model. These observations provide a possible candidate for a bacterial adhesion inhibitor that does not cause adverse effects on host cells while preventing bacterial infection."

We recorded pairs of neurons from secondary somatosensory (S2) and premotor (PM) cortices while monkeys reported the presence or absence of a tactile stimulus. We found that while populations of S2 and sensory-like PM neurons are only partially correlated with behavior, those PM neurons active during a delay period preceding the motor report predict unequivocally the animal’s decision report.

When decisions are based on sensory evidence, decision-related signals evolve across sensory and frontoparietal cortices (for reviews, see Gold and Shadlen, 2001Gold J.I. Shadlen M.N.

Neurosci. 2003; 4: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The involvement of single neurons in decision-making processes is usually studied in terms of the choice probability (CP) index, a measure of covariation between a neuron’s firing rate activity and the subject’s choice (Britten et al., 1996Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Shadlen M.N. Celebrini S. Movshon J.A. A relationship between behavioral choice and the visual responses of neurons in macaque MT.Vis.

USA. 2006; 103: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, Hernández et al., 2010Hernández A. Nácher V. Luna R. Zainos A. Lemus L. Alvarez M. Vázquez Y. Camarillo L. Romo R.

Conversion of sensory signals into perceptual decisions.Prog. Neurobiol. 2013; 103: 41-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hence, if one is to decode behavioral choices, the relevant measurements must come from population variables constructed from the spiking activity of multiple neuronal pools. To understand how decisions emerge, one must first define proper measures to quantify how population activity covaries with behavior. It is known that firing rates vary stochastically from trial to trial (Shadlen and Newsome, 1998Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T.

Newsome W.T. Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), often named noise correlation. Such correlations between neurons strongly impact the association between neuronal activity and behavior (Shadlen et al., 1996Shadlen M.N. Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Movshon J.A. A computational analysis of the relationship between neuronal and behavioral responses to visual motion.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1486-1510PubMed Google Scholar); in particular, it is known that the CP index depends on the correlation structure of the neuronal network (Cohen and Newsome, 2009Cohen M.R.

Decision-related activity in sensory neurons: correlations among neurons and with behavior.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 463-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently demonstrated that the temporal profile of the noise correlation coefficient changes as the task progresses, reflecting dynamic effects of stimuli and internally generated signals on frontal lobe neurons that might participate in the decision process (Carnevale et al., 2012Carnevale F. de Lafuente V. Romo R. Parga N. Internal signal correlates neural populations and biases perceptual decision reports.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 18938-18943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given that a decision evolves over time, we think it is important to detect and describe transient interpool interactions. Some knowledge about the dynamics of a large-scale cortical network during decision making has been obtained by studying macroscopic signals from magnetoencephalographic recordings (Siegel et al., 2011Siegel M. Engel A.K. Donner T.H. Cortical network dynamics of perceptual decision-making in the human brain.Front Hum Neurosci. 2011; 5: 21Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), but the dynamical profile of correlations has rarely been studied at the circuit level (Pesaran et al., 2008Pesaran B. Nelson M.J. Andersen R.A. Free choice activates a decision circuit between frontal and parietal cortex.Nature. 2008; 453: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Motivated by these observations, we developed analytical tools to study the dynamics of neuronal pools and their relation to behavior. We tested these tools with data from simultaneous recordings of neuron pairs obtained while monkeys performed a decision-making task (de Lafuente and Romo, 2005de Lafuente V. Romo R. Neuronal correlates of subjective sensory experience.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1698-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, de Lafuente and Romo, 2006de Lafuente V. Romo R. Neural correlate of subjective sensory experience gradually builds up across cortical areas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Specifically, we have first extended the concept of CP index, which traditionally refers to single neurons, to define measures of covariation between behavior and the firing rates of two or more neurons. We have then derived analytical expressions that explicitly relate these measures to statistical properties of the pools’ spiking activity, obtaining a precise description of how noise correlations affect the standard CP index and the generalized indices introduced here. We find that the CP becomes significant when the correlation coefficients depend strongly on the choice outcomes of the trials used to compute them and that the association between population activity and behavior increases notably when the choice-conditioned correlations are small. To address the issue of how neuronal pools cooperate to form the decision, we reasoned that the concerned pools combine their firing outputs and send the resulting signal downstream for further processing. Since the observed behavior is a consequence of these neural computations, we assumed that an important combination of pool activities would be one that covaries closely with behavior. To test these ideas, we analyzed simultaneous recordings of pairs of premotor cortex (PM) neurons of distinct functional types and also of neuron pairs in the secondary somatosensory area (S2) (de Lafuente and Romo, 2005de Lafuente V. Romo R. Neuronal correlates of subjective sensory experience.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1698-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, de Lafuente and Romo, 2006de Lafuente V. Romo R. Neural correlate of subjective sensory experience gradually builds up across cortical areas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the decision-making task, monkeys had to detect a stimulus that often was very weak and was absent in half of the trials. Both the PM and S2 areas contained two types of neurons that exhibited oppositely tuned responses to stimulation (de Lafuente and Romo, 2006de Lafuente V. Romo R. Neural correlate of subjective sensory experience gradually builds up across cortical areas.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Presumably, these two neuronal pools contribute to the decision-making process. For the detection task analyzed here, we found that sensory-like neurons in PM areas covary strongly with the decision report during the stimulation period, although this covariation does not reach its largest possible value. In contrast, pools of PM neurons exhibiting delay activity during the period between the application of the stimulus and a cue signal that triggers the decision’s motor report become fully correlated with the subject’s choice. Interestingly, this occurs when the population firing rates of the relevant pools are combined optimally, maximizing the generalized measures of covariance with behavior. Consider a perceptual decision-making task in which the subject has to decide between two possible choices, A or B. Covariation between the activity of single neurons and the subject’s choice is often quantified by the CP index. This quantity represents the average probability with which an external observer could predict the subject’s decision from the activity of a single neuron, using the accrued knowledge of the firing rate distributions computed over trials in which option A or option B was selected. If the neuron responds identically in trials in which the subject chooses A (A trials) and in trials in which it chooses B (B trials), the prediction performance of the external observer is at chance level (CP = 0.5). Conversely, if the firing rate distributions of the neuron in trials A and B are fully distinct, the external observer could perfectly predict the subject’s decision (CP = 1). The CP index can be computed as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the neuron’s firing rate, segregating trials according to the subject’s choice (Britten et al., 1996Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Shadlen M.N. Celebrini S. Movshon J.A. A relationship between behavioral choice and the visual responses of neurons in macaque MT.Vis.

John Wiley and Sons, New York1966Google Scholar). If the neuron’s firing rate distributions in trials A and B can be described as Gaussian, one finds the following analytical expression (see Supplemental Information available online for the derivation)CP=12erfc(−δ2),δ=μA−μB12(σA2+σB2),(Equation 1) where μc and σc2 are the mean and variance of the firing rate over trials in which the subject’s choice was c=A,B. The quantity δ is the difference between the firing rate means in trials A and B, measured in units of the arithmetic mean of the two variances. The CP index is a useful measure to study how the activity of a single neuron covaries with behavior. However, the decision-making process is determined by neuronal populations (de Lafuente and Romo, 2006de Lafuente V. Romo R.

Understanding how the decision is formed in the brain requires the use of proper measures to quantify the covariance of population activity variables with the subject’s choices. This can be done by extending the concept of CP index to the combined activity of several neurons. Here we start by considering the case in which cells can be sorted into homogeneous pools of similar responses, and in section “Finding the Optimal Decision Code,” we study the general case. For the simplest example, two neurons from the same pool, we consider the ROC index of the sum of their firing rates r1 and r2, rw=r1+r2, which can be estimated byCP2,w=12erfc(−Δw2),Δw=μwA−μwB12(σw,A2+σw,B2),(Equation 2) where μwc and σw,c2 are the mean and variance of rw over trials of choice c. This can be expressed in terms of the firing properties of the pair of neuronsΔw=2δ1,21+ρ12w.(Equation 3) Here δ1,2 is the arithmetic mean of δ1 and δ2, defined in Equation 1, and ρ12w=0.5(ρ12w,A+ρ12w,B) is the arithmetic mean of the correlation coefficients between r1 and r2, computed over trials of decision A and B, ρ12w,A and ρ12w,B (see Equation 11 in Experimental Procedures). The superscript w indicates that the two neurons belong to the same pool. For simplicity, in Equation 3 we assumed that the variance of the single neuron’s firing rate distributions is equal for both neurons, in both trial types (A and B). Equation 2 relates the subject’s choices to the activity of the pool of neurons, but it does so in terms of the properties of the two neurons in the pool and their interaction, as captured by the correlation coefficient. The general expression is given in the Supplemental Information (Equation S16). Notice that CP2,w will always be higher than CP, except when ρ12w=1. This is a reasonable result: the averaged activity of two neurons in the same pool covaries with behavior more than that of single neurons, provided that their responses are significantly different, i.e., that their correlation is not too large. For two neurons in different pools, we consider an arbitrary linear combination of their firing rates, rb=C1r1+C2r2, and quantify its covariation with the subject’s choices by another ROC index, CP2,b. This index can be estimated as (see Supplemental Information for details)CP2,b=12erfc(−12Δb),Δb=δ1+Dδ21+D2+2Dρ12b(Equation 4) where D=C2/C1. Here ρ12b=0.5(ρ12b,A+ρ12b,B) with ρ12b,c being the correlation coefficient between the firing rates of neurons 1 and 2 in different pools, computed over trials of choice c. Again, we assumed that the variance of the firing rates is equal for both neurons and both types of trials (see general expression in Equation S23). Note that if ρ12b<0 and D<0, the CP2,b index increases as |ρ12b| decreases. To test the amount of covariation with behavior of the combined activity of different neural populations, we consider a further extension of this procedure. Given a set of P pools each having N neurons and a population firing rate rα (α = 1,..., P), we can quantify the amount of covariation of an arbitrary combination of the pools’ firing rates, rN=∑Cαrα, defining the CPN index,CPN=12erfc(−ΔN2),ΔN=μNA−μNB12(σN,A2+σN,B2).(Equation 5) In applying these calculations to experimental data, we will be interested in linear combinations of rates from two pools, rN=C1r++C2r−, with the pools defined as + and −. ΔN can be expressed in terms of population-averaged firing rates, variances, and correlation coefficients,ΔN=N(δ¯++Dδ¯−)(1+D2)[1+(N−1)ρ¯w]+2DNρ¯b,(Equation 6) where again D=C2/C1. The bar indicates population average. For simplicity, we took equal population-averaged variances for the two pools and the two choices (see the general expression in Equation S31). Correlation coefficients ρ¯w and ρ¯b affect the CPN index in a manner similar to that for CP2,w and CP2,b, respectively. The factor that amplifies the population-averaged δ s increases as ρ¯w decreases. For D < 0 and ρ¯b<0, ΔN also increases when |ρ¯b| decreases. For the particular case in which (N−1)ρ¯w>>1, ΔN becomes independent of the number of neurons. If in addition, ρ¯b ∼ 0, ρ¯w still modulates the amplification of this index, ΔN∝(ρ¯w)−12. The measures defined above can be used to study the interaction of neural pools during the decision-making process. If two pools cooperate in forming the decision, then combinations of their firing rates must covary with the behavioral response. But the reverse should also be true: maximizing this covariation should lead to the combination of rates that optimally predicts the animal’s decision. This can be done by optimizing the CPN index with respect to the relative contribution of the two pools to the population variable (D), which is equivalent to maximizing the mean difference between choices divided by the choice-conditioned variances (Equation 5). To study how population activity covaries with behavior, we considered the case in which cells can be assigned to one of two discrete pools. If neurons could be sorted into discrete and homogeneous pools, one would assign equal weights to all neurons within the same pool. However, the assumption of neurons distributed in discrete pools can be relaxed. In a more general case, neurons contribute to the population variable in a graded manner, with their firing rates weighted with different coefficients. A CPN index associated with this variable can still be defined and expressed in terms of its means, variances, and covariance matrix in the two conditions (see Supplemental Information). The proposed optimality criterion is again equivalent to maximizing the mean difference between choices divided by the choice-conditioned variances. Equivalently, finding the weights amounts to obtaining the Linear Fisher’s Discriminant between the two decisions (Equations S37 and S38). In this more general situation, the CPN index depends on the covariance between every pair in the population. Thus, searching for optimal population variables in experimental data requires the simultaneous recording of multiple neurons in the population. However, in situations in which neurons can be classified into discrete pools, the CPN can be computed from (Equation 5), (Equation 6). The degrees of freedom involved in the optimization procedure are reduced to one: the coefficient D that combines the pools’ activities. Besides this parameter, in this case, the CPN index only depends on two population-averaged correlation coefficients, one for neural pairs within each pool and another for pairs between pools. Notice that the optimization procedure does not assume the existence of a decision rule based on the neurons’ firing activity. In our formalism, the population variable could be any combination of the firing rates and is not necessarily related to a decision rule. The proposed procedure can be seen as a way to search for population variables that are optimally correlated with behavior. It can be applied to neurons in any area participating in the decision-making process. The covariance between global activity and behavior is determined by the network correlation structure. We now turn to a more detailed analysis of how the correlation structure affects the covariance between firing activity and behavior. The CP index in Equation 1 is computed from properties of single neurons (means and variances of the firing rate distributions in trials A and B). Although pairwise correlations do not appear explicitly in this equation, the CP index does depend on the correlation structure of the neural population involved in the decision-making process. This is because the firing rate distributions are conditioned to the subject’s choice, which is determined by the network state during the trial. To make this dependence explicit, we must relate the usual correlation coefficient Rij for the neuron pair (i, j) (that is, the correlation coefficient computed using all trial types, regardless of the subject’s choice) with the difference in mean firing rates between trials ending in each of the two choices. The latter are essentially the quantities δ, defined for neurons i and j, as in Equation 1. Given an arbitrary partition of the set trials into two different groups (A and B), the correlation coefficient Rij can be expressed asRij=12(ρijA+ρijB)+14δiδj[1+(δi2)2][1+(δj2)2](Equation 7) where, for simplicity, we assumed that the variance of the firing rates of the two neurons is equal in both types of trials (see Equation S48 for the general expression). Equation 7 shows that, apart from a common factor, the correlation coefficient Rij is the sum of two effects: a contribution from the difference in rates between the two choice conditions (δi and δj, see Equation 1) and a contribution from the choice-conditioned correlation coefficients, ρijA and ρijB. If the network contains several neural pools, the correlation structure consists of correlation coefficients of pairs of neurons in the same pool and correlations between neurons in different pools. Given a triplet of cells (1, 2, 3), with neurons (1, 2) in the same pool and neuron 3 in a different pool, we can use the equation above for the pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). This leads to equations for R12, R13, and R23 that can be solved for δ1, δ2, and δ3, obtaining the CP indices as a function of correlations between neurons in the same or different pools. However, implementing this procedure to analyze electrophysiological data requires the simultaneous recording of triplets of neurons. Moreover, the mathematical solution in terms of correlation coefficients between the three pairs of neurons becomes rather cumbersome. It is desirable to have a way to estimate the CP index using only data from simultaneous recordings of pairs of neurons. Now we show that it is possible to obtain a simple approximate expression for the population-averaged CP index based only on correlations between pairs of neurons. It is enough to assume that, given two neurons (1, 2) in the same population, δ1∼δ2∼δ0. Using R12 we obtainCP∼12erfc(−δ02),(δ02)2∼R12w−ρ12w1−R12w,(Equation 8) where δ0=(δ1+δ2)/2 (see Equations S50–S53 in the Supplemental Information for a discussion of the accuracy of this approximation). Averaging Equation 8 over the population of independent pairs gives the estimate for the population-averaged CP index. This is our main result. It shows that the CP index is different from 0.5 when correlations evaluated using all trial types differ from the correlations conditioned on the subject’s choice. Neurons could covary significantly with behavior even if the latter correlations are very small. It has been pointed out that correlated activity is necessary for observing robust covariations between single neuron responses and behavior (Shadlen et al., 1996Shadlen M.N. Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Movshon J.A. A computational analysis of the relationship between neuronal and behavioral responses to visual motion.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1486-1510PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, pairwise correlations in recurrent networks can be quite small (Ecker et al., 2010Ecker A.S. Berens P. Keliris G.A. Bethge M. Logothetis N.K. Tolias A.S. Decorrelated neuronal firing in cortical microcircuits.Science. 2010; 327: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, Renart et al., 2010Renart A. de la Rocha J. Bartho P. Hollender L. Parga N. Reyes A. Harris K.D. The asynchronous state in cortical circuits.Science. 2010; 327: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The equations above show that there is no contradiction between these two statements: decorrelation in the recurrent network makes ρ12w small, but there is still a contribution to CP coming from R12w, which is produced by the difference in firing rates between trials A and B (Equation 7; see also Brody, 1999Brody C.D. Correlations without synchrony.Neural Comput. 1999; 11: 1537-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In fact, Equation 8 shows that the CP index is maximized when the overall correlations R12w are large but the choice-conditioned correlations are small. Notice that Equation 8 does not assume any model that mechanistically relates the activity of the neurons to the subject’s decision. We can use Equation 8 to draw several conclusions. First, notice that R12w−ρ12w≥0 : correlations for neurons in the same pool, computed with fixed-choice trials, are smaller than those obtained with the whole set of trials. Instead, if neurons (1, 3) in two different pools have opposite mean responses in the two conditions: μ1A−μ1B∼−(μ3A−μ3B) (that is, δ1δ3<0), from Equation 7, we observe that R13b−ρ13b≤0 (see Supplemental Information). In both cases, the sign is determined by the difference in the mean activities in the two trial types. Finally, neurons in a given pool show CP = 0.5 if pairwise correlations in that pool obey R12w=ρ12w. Similar considerations apply to the other generalized choice probability indices (Equations 3, 4, and 5). In particular for the CPN index ((Equation 5), (Equation 6)), apart from the population-averaged δ+ and δ−, for which the discussion above still holds, there is a factor depending only on the choice-conditioned correlation coefficients. A potential effect of this factor is to amplify ΔN, thereby pushing CPN to saturation, that is, closer to full covariance between firing activity and behavior. Equation 8 was obtained for a pair (1, 2) of neurons in the same pool. As a more complex example, we now consider a two-pool network satisfying the condition that for a pair (1, 3) of neurons in different pools, δ3∼−δ1∼−δ0. This can be seen as a constraint on the correlation structure of the network. Using this constraint, and replacing pairwise correlations by their population-averaged values (R¯w, R¯b, ρ¯w, ρ¯b), it is interesting to observe that the average CP index can be estimated asCP¯∼12erfc(−(R¯w−R¯b)−(ρ¯w−ρ¯b)2−(R¯w−R¯b)).(Equation 9) This equation shows an explicit dependence on the difference R¯w−R¯b but not on R¯w+R¯b. In a computational model constrained as in this example, where R¯w and R¯b were considered to be free parameters, it was found that the CP index depends only on R¯w−R¯b (Nienborg and Cumming, 2010Nienborg H.

The study of their transposition pathways may shed light onto their impact on the dynamics of eukaryotic genome evolution. Among these transposons, Itm elements (to which belong mariner elements) are one of the most widespread groups of transposons. They transpose via a DNA intermediate, using a cut and paste mechanism (5.Plasterk R.H. van Luenen H.G. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.L. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D.

Target capture has been extensively studied for prokaryotic model elements (Tn5, Tn7, and Tn10), the Mu phage, and two eukaryotic transposons (RAG1/2 and Himar1). All the related transposases display an RNase H-like catalytic domain that contains a DD(E/D) catalytic triad (11.Nowotny M. Retroviral integrase superfamily. The structural perspective.EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, these transposases are of different origins: Tn5 and Tn10 belong to the IS10 superfamily, and Tn7 is the prototype of a single family. Concerning the eukaryotic transposases, RAG1/2 belongs to the Transib family, whereas Himar1 belongs to the mariner family. These different origins result in differences in the transposition mechanisms. For instance, hairpins are produced during the excision at the ends of Tn5 and Tn10 but on the flanking DNA for RAG1/2. In contrast, mariner transposition does not require any hairpin (12.Claeys Bouuaert C. Chalmers R.M. Gene therapy vectors.

However, it has been shown that Mos1 may have preferred integration spots such as the one in the chloramphenicol resistance gene of Tn9 (22.Crénès G. Ivo D. Hérisson J. Dion S. Renault S. Bigot Y.

No structural features explaining the preferential integration of Mos1 have yet been identified (23.Crénès G. Moundras C. Demattei M.-V. Bigot Y. Petit A. Renault S. Target site selection by the mariner-like element, Mos1.Genetica. 2010; 138: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, contrarily to RAG1/2 that creates a 5-bp duplication upon insertion (24.Matthews A.G. Elkin S.K. Oettinger M.A. Ordered DNA release and target capture in RAG transposition.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1198-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), mariner elements generate a 2-bp duplication. All these remarks suggest that target capture complexes are organized differently depending on the transposase involved and result in different integration pathways. An example is the timing of the target capture during various transposition cycles. Tn7 binds its specific target attTn7 before excising (13.Kuduvalli P.N. Rao J.E. Craig N.L. Target DNA structure plays a critical role in Tn7 transposition.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 924-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas Mu captures its target DNA at different points of the reaction pathway (24.Matthews A.G.

In contrast, Tn5, Tn10, and RAG1/2 bind their target after excision (24.Matthews A.G. Elkin S.K.

It has been demonstrated that Tn10, Himar1, and RAG1/2 capture their target in a two-step procedure. First, a labile interaction occurs between the target and the excised element. Second, the complex is stabilized, so that the target cannot be replaced by another DNA, resulting in what is known as “target commitment” (26.Sakai J. Kleckner N.

The variety of the target capture mechanisms makes it necessary to describe them for each transposon family. In particular, within the mariner family, the fact that the first model to be studied, namely Himar1 (29.Lipkow K. Buisine N. Chalmers R. Promiscuous target interactions in the mariner transposon Himar1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48569-48575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), displayed a target capture contrasting with other transposases (Tn5, Tn10, and RAG1/2), leaves open the question of the chronology of events (excision/target capture/integration or target capture/excision/integration) for the other mariner elements. In this perspective, the Mos1 element is of particular interest, because it is the only eukaryotic transposon for which the complete transposition cycle can be reconstituted step by step in vitro and for which crystallographic data of the excised element (precleaved ITRs with two transposases) are available (9.Richardson J.M. Colloms S.D. Finnegan D.J. Walkinshaw M.D. Molecular architecture of the Mos1 paired-end complex. The structural basis of DNA transposition in a eukaryote.Cell. 2009; 138: 1096-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure, a target capture complex has been recently proposed to account for the fact that a channel exists between the two transposases that might provide a niche to the target DNA (9.Richardson J.M. Colloms S.D. Finnegan D.J. Walkinshaw M.D. Molecular architecture of the Mos1 paired-end complex. The structural basis of DNA transposition in a eukaryote.Cell. 2009; 138: 1096-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, there is no biochemical evidence to support this model. Here, we confirm that the organization of the Mos1 target capture complex is consistent with that predicted by cut and paste models of transposition. We show that target capture takes place only after Mos1 element has been fully excised. The TA dinucleotide present in the target is of particular importance not only for the strand transfer, but also for the target capture itself. DNA bending of the target significantly improves the efficiency of capture, highlighting the role of the +2 position relative to the TA dinucleotide. The various models previously published for Mos1 are discussed in the light of our findings. The MBP-MOS1 protein was produced using the pVL1392 baculovirus transfer vector and the BaculoGoldTM baculovirus expression system (BD Biosciences) and then extracted from baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells. The fusion protein was purified on a amylose resin (New England Biolabs) as previously described (30.Bouchet N. Jaillet J. Gabant G. Brillet B. Briseño-Roa L. Cadene M. Augé-Gouillou C. cAMP protein kinase phosphorylates the Mos1 transposase and regulates its activity. Evidences from mass spectrometry and biochemical analyses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; (10.1093/nar/gkt874)PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the study are shown in supplemental Table S1. The precleaved ITR (PC-ITR) is 50 bp long (also used as a short ITR), and the long PC-ITR is 70 bp long. The uncleaved ITR (UC-ITR) and the prenicked ITR (PN-ITR) are 70 bp long. The TA targets are 30 bp long (also used as a short target) and 50 bp long (used as long target). GC target and targets containing mismatch and nick are 30 bp long. Oligonucleotides were provided by Eurofins MWG Biotech (Germany) or Eurogentec (Belgium) and purified by PAGE. Double-stranded DNA of ITRs and targets were obtained by annealing equimolar amounts of different complementary oligonucleotides. The wild type TA target was obtained by annealing T1 and T2. Targets exhibiting a nick at the integration site obtained by annealing T1, T3, and T3′ (N+1 target); T1, T4, and T4′ (N+2 target); T1, T5, and T5′ (N+3 target); and T3′, T4′, and T5′ were phosphorylated at the 5′ position using standard procedures. The targets exhibiting a mismatch were obtained by annealing T1 and T6 (M+1 target), T1 and T7 (M+2 target), and T1 and T8 (M+3 target). The GC target was obtained by annealing T9 and T10. Long targets were obtained by annealing T11 and T12 or T13 and T14. All targets were filled in with [α-32P]dATP by Klenow exo-minus in presence of dTTP. PC-ITR was obtained by annealing I4 and I5, UC-ITR was obtained by annealing I1 and I2, and PN-ITR was obtained by annealing I2, I3, and I4. The transferred strand (I2 or I5) was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to annealing. PICs were formed using 250 nm transposase (MBP-MOS1) and 250 nm PC-ITR in 10 mm Tris, pH 9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 5 mm MgCl2 in 20 μl. Reactions were carried out for 3 h at 30 °C. For PIC analyses, labeled ITRs were used instead of unlabeled ITRs, and the reaction products were analyzed by EMSA onto 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) buffer. The gel was dried and scanned. When specified, the PICs were assembled using UC-ITR or PN-ITR instead of PC-ITR. PICs were formed as described above using cold ITRs. After incubation, 250 nm of labeled targets were added with 5 mm EDTA. The addition of EDTA chelates MgCl2, blocking the strand transfer. The use of labeled target and EDTA allowed the detection of complexes if and only if the complexes contained a target and avoided strand transfer. For TCC assembly, reactions were carried out for another hour (30 °C). All the targets used contained a single dinucleotide TA, except for the GC target, which did not contain any TA. Complexes were analyzed by EMSA onto 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer. The gel was dried and scanned. Cold PICs were prepared as described above but with an overnight incubation before proceeding to TCC assembly with a labeled target. The TCCs were then digested for 0–5 h by factor Xa (1 μg) in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 at 30 °C. Reaction products were analyzed by EMSA onto 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and scanned. Cold PICs were prepared as described above. Then labeled short (30 bp) and/or long (50 bp) targets were added before performing target capture. Reaction products were analyzed by EMSA onto 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and scanned. Cold PICs were prepared as described above using a mixture of equimolar unlabeled short (50 bp) and long (70 bp) PC-ITRs at a final concentration of 250 nm. Standard target capture (with a labeled target) assays were performed as described above. Reaction products were analyzed by EMSA onto 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and scanned. The TCCs were assembled as previously described using either short or long labeled targets as the first target. To find out whether the target could be exchanged, the second labeled target (short if the first was long and vice versa) was added at 250 nm. A control reaction was performed by adding long and short targets at the same time. Reactions were carried out for 1 h more at 30 °C. Complexes were analyzed by EMSA onto 6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and scanned. Each point was repeated five times. The signal obtained for each target (long or short) was quantified using ImageQuant software. The percentage of each target was calculated as the signal obtained with the long (or short) target divided by the signal obtained with long and short targets. The percentage of target commitment was calculated as the percentage of the long or short target in a target commitment assay minus the percentage of the long or short target in the control reaction. Cold PICs were formed using PC-ITR at 30 °C but for 30 min. Labeled targets were then added with or without 5 mm EDTA for 3 h at 30 or 4 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.1% SDS, incubated at 65 °C for 10 min, and incubated then at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA products were purified by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Integration products were resuspended in a standard denaturing loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then loaded onto an 8% denaturing urea-acrylamide gel. The gel was dried and scanned. The integration rate is the ratio of the integration signal divided by the free target signal plus the integration signal. The integration efficiency found using the TA target was normalized to 100%. Each point was repeated five times. A labeled G+A ladder was obtained by annealing of GA1 (labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase) to its complement GA2 (supplemental Table S1). This product was chemically cleaved at G and A using the Maxam and Gilbert standard procedure. G+A products were resuspended in denaturing loading buffer. Integration products were analyzed by PCR, using F1 and F2 primers (supplemental Table S1). Integration products (3 μl) were amplified with GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) in conditions recommended by the manufacturer. 35 PCR cycles were carried out with an annealing temperature of 44 °C. PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and purified using the Nucleospin extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel). PCR products were then cloned in the pGEM-T Easy System (Promega) and sequenced by Eurofins MWG Biotech (Germany). Quantification was done using ImageQuant software. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0c for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). We used a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks. This is a nonparametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution or not. It is used to compare more than two samples that are not related. The null hypothesis is that the populations from which the samples originate all have the same median value. Analyses are done using an α level of 5% (α = 0.05). The calculated Kruskal-Wallis value is then compared with the critical value. If the Kruskal-Wallis test leads to significant results, then at least one of the samples is different from the other samples. The test does not identify where the differences lie, nor how many differences are actually present. To identify the differences, sample contrast determinations were carried out between individual sample pairs (or post hoc tests). Multiple comparisons were done using Dunn's test (pairwise comparisons) and the Bonferroni correction to find out whether the post hoc tests are significant. According to the currently accepted models of mariner transposition, transpososome excision (i.e., the formation of the PIC) should precede the target capture (7.Jaillet J. Genty M. Cambefort J. Rouault J.-D. Augé-Gouillou C. Regulation of mariner transposition. The peculiar case of Mos1.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e43365Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To set up a target capture assay, PICs were first formed using cold precleaved ITR (PC-ITR, mimicking the ITR extremities cleaved by transposase on the two strands) and the purified transposase MOS1 under catalytic conditions (Mg2+, 30 °C). The labeled target (containing a single TA) was added with EDTA after the PIC had been fully formed. In this situation, the observed complex will only correspond to the target capture complex and not to the strand transfer complex. The scheme of the assay is outlined in Fig. 1A. Formation of ITR-transposase complexes was controlled by the detection of SEC2 (single end complex 2) and PIC as already described (7.Jaillet J. Genty M. Cambefort J. Rouault J.-D. Augé-Gouillou C. Regulation of mariner transposition. The peculiar case of Mos1.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e43365Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The use of equimolar amounts of unlabeled ITR, transposase, and labeled target gave rise to a complex detected by EMSA (Fig. 1B, lane 5). The only labeled DNA used in this assay is the target, allowing the detection of complexes if and only if a target molecule was present. The complex obtained in presence of EDTA and herein observed satisfied this condition. This complex should be considered as a TCC. As expected, this complex disappeared partially when equimolar herring sperm double-stranded DNA was added as competitor at the same time as the target, because this DNA could also be used as a target (Fig. 1B, lane 6). The band corresponding to TCC was expected to migrate above the PIC, because it contains an additional DNA fragment. However, the TCC has one surprising feature: it migrates slightly faster than the PIC (Fig. 1B). This discrepancy between the electrophoretic properties of TCC and PIC could result from the fact that the two complexes have different conformations (see “Bending DNA in the TCC”). In the absence of ITR, a MOS1-labeled target complex is also detected. It corresponds to a nonspecific complex showing that the binding of MOS1 is not restricted to ITRs (Fig. 1B, lane 3). This binding is nonspecific because it decreased by addition of herring sperm double-stranded DNA (Fig. 1B, lane 4). This MOS1 target nonspecific complex migrates faster than the putative TCC and can be distinguished from TCC. To confirm that the complex observed with the labeled target should be a TCC, TCC was assembled with a short target (30 bp) and a long target (50 bp). As expected, when the target is longer, the TCC migrated slower than the complex containing a short target (Fig. 1C). This result showed that the observed complex corresponded to a TCC. TCC is expected to contain a transposase dimer, a pair of ITRs, and a single target DNA molecule. We therefore determined the ITR-transposase target content of the putative Mos1 TCC. The number of targets was determined by a long/short target experiment. The PIC was assembled with cold ITRs, and then a mix of long or/and short targets was added. In the mix, either the short or the long target was labeled, as indicated (Fig. 1D). On the basis of what is known about TCC stoichiometry (a single target per complex), a single-band pattern was expected regardless of the conditions used. The resulting complexes were analyzed in EMSA. The same pattern was observed for reactions containing each combination of targets and corresponded to a single-band pattern. This result showed that the Mos1 TCC contained a single target DNA. Then the presence of a MOS1 dimer in the putative TCC was assayed by EMSA with a labeled target and unlabeled ITR. We took advantage of the cleavage site for the factor Xa protease between the MBP and MOS1 moieties in MBP-MOS1 fusion protein, as previously done to analyze the composition of the Mos1 PIC (7.Jaillet J. Genty M. Cambefort J. Rouault J.-D. Augé-Gouillou C. Regulation of mariner transposition. The peculiar case of Mos1.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e43365Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If the TCC contains an MBP-MOS1 dimer, three bands would have been expected following factor Xa cleavage: a first band containing uncleaved MBP-MOS1, a second band containing both cleaved and uncleaved MOS1 monomers, and a third band containing two cleaved MOS1. Our data showed the sequential detection of each expected band. (Fig. 1E). Our data demonstrate that the TCC does contain a transposase dimer because it satisfies the conditions expected after factor Xa cleavage. Finally, The number of ITRs was determined using a long/short ITR experiment similar to that used to determine the number of ITR in the Mos1 PIC (7.Jaillet J. Genty M. Cambefort J. Rouault J.-D. Augé-Gouillou C."
