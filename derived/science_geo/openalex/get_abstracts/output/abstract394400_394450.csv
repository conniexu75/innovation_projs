Behavioral and neurobiological analysis of this construct, with evidence from both animal and human studies, defines several dissociable forms depending on distinct cortico-striatal substrates. One form of impulsivity depends on the temporal discounting of reward, another on motor or response disinhibition. Impulsivity is commonly associated with addiction to drugs from different pharmacological classes, but its causal role in human addiction is unclear. We characterize in neurobehavioral and neurochemical terms a rodent model of impulsivity based on premature responding in an attentional task. Evidence is surveyed that high impulsivity on this task precedes the escalation subsequently of cocaine self-administration behavior, and also a tendency toward compulsive cocaine-seeking and to relapse. These results indicate that the vulnerability to stimulant addiction may depend on an impulsivity endophenotype. Implications of these findings for the etiology, development, and treatment of drug addiction are considered. Impulsivity is the tendency to act prematurely without foresight.

We report that different subtypes of projection neurons uniquely and differentially determine the laminar distribution of cortical interneurons. We find that in Fezf2−/− cortex, the exclusive absence of subcerebral projection neurons and their replacement by callosal projection neurons cause distinctly abnormal lamination of interneurons and altered GABAergic inhibition. In addition, experimental generation of either corticofugal neurons or callosal neurons below the cortex is sufficient to recruit cortical interneurons to these ectopic locations. Strikingly, the identity of the projection neurons generated, rather than strictly their birthdate, determines the specific types of interneurons recruited. These data demonstrate that in the neocortex individual populations of projection neurons cell-extrinsically control the laminar fate of interneurons and the assembly of local inhibitory circuitry.

Projection neurons control the laminar fate of cortical interneurons Projection neurons can recruit interneurons to ectopic locations The identity of projection neurons defines the type of interneurons affected High-level cortical function including cognition, sensory perception, and motor function relies on the coordinated assembly of local microcircuitry between glutamatergic projection neurons and GABAergic interneurons (Hensch, 2005Hensch T.K. Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar). Excitatory projection neurons represent the largest portion of all cortical neurons. They are born from neural progenitors in the dorsal telencephalon and are classified into numerous subtypes based on their location within different cortical layers and areas; their axonal projections to distinct intracortical, subcortical, and subcerebral targets; and the combinatorial expression of different neuron type-specific genes (Bayer and Altman, 1991Bayer S.A. Altman J. Neocortical Development. Raven Press, New York1991Google Scholar, Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Among them, corticofugal projection neurons include corticothalamic projection neurons, which are found in layer VI and project to the thalamus, as well as corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) and several other types of subcerebral projection neurons, which are located in different areas of layer V and project to the spinal cord, the superior culliculus, and other targets in the brainstem and below the brain (Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). In addition, the cortex includes several types of callosal projection neurons (CPN), which are primarily located in layers II/III and V and connect to targets in the contralateral hemisphere, the striatum, and the frontal cortex (Lindwall et al., 2007Lindwall C.

The firing activity of these projection neuron types is modulated locally by GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Cortical interneurons are defined at the intersection of diverse molecular, electrophysiological, and morphological properties and based on their connections to the soma, axonal initial segment, or dendritic tree of their projection neuron partners (Ascoli et al., 2008Ascoli G.A.

Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). However, the classification of cortical interneurons remains an open challenge (Ascoli et al., 2008Ascoli G.A. Alonso-Nanclares L. Anderson S.A. Barrionuevo G. Benavides-Piccione R. Burkhalter A.

Neurosci. 2008; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Contrary to projection neurons, in rodents, cortical interneurons are mostly generated from neural progenitors located in the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (MGE and CGE) and in the preoptic area (POA) (Gelman et al., 2009Gelman D.M. Martini F.J. Nóbrega-Pereira S. Pierani A. Kessaris N. Marín O. The embryonic preoptic area is a novel source of cortical GABAergic interneurons.J.

Neurosci. 2006; 7: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). MGE progenitors give rise to parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons, which distribute at higher densities in deep cortical layers (Butt et al., 2005Butt S.J. Fuccillo M. Nery S.

In contrast, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and calretinin (CR) interneurons originate in the CGE and preferentially populate the superficial layers II/III (Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G.

Cobos I. De La Cruz E. Rubenstein J.L. Anderson S.A. Origins of cortical interneuron subtypes.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2612-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Projection neurons and interneurons are born from distal germinal zones, but they ultimately coexist in the cortex, where they assemble into local microcircuitry. This requires coordinated migration and development of these two broad neuronal populations. The migration of interneurons to the cortex is particularly extensive (Corbin et al., 2001Corbin J.G.

Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 780-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Following tangential migration through the ventral forebrain, interneurons enter the cortex where they disperse along migratory routes in the marginal zone (MZ) and the intermediate zone (IZ)/subventricular zone (SVZ) (Kriegstein and Noctor, 2004Kriegstein A.R.

The cellular and molecular events that direct interneurons to position precisely within specific cortical layers are poorly understood. Correct cell-autonomous development of cortical interneurons is a critical factor for the radial positioning of GABAergic interneurons, since defective laminar distribution is often observed in mutant mice that have abnormal interneuronal differentiation (Alifragis et al., 2004Alifragis P.

In addition, interneurons are cell-intrinsically programmed to modulate expression of the KCC2 cotransporter in order to sense extracellular GABA levels and arrest radial migration (Bortone and Polleux, 2009Bortone D.

However, several lines of evidence indicate that the environment of the cortex also plays instructive roles in directing interneuron cortical distribution, pointing at a possible involvement of projection neurons. For example, synchronically generated GABAergic interneurons and projection neurons preferentially pair, suggesting linked mechanisms of layer distribution (Fairén et al., 1986Fairén A. Cobas A.

Tan S.S. Layer specification of transplanted interneurons in developing mouse neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5113-5122PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, interneurons invade the cortical plate only after their projection neuron partners, possibly reflecting a need for signals from appropriately located projection neurons (López-Bendito et al., 2008López-Bendito G. Sánchez-Alcañiz J.A. Pla R. Borrell V. Picó E. Valdeolmillos M. Marín O. Chemokine signaling controls intracortical migration and final distribution of GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, interneurons distribute abnormally in the cortex of the reeler mice, in which projection neuron lamination is nearly inverted (Hammond et al., 2006Hammond V. So E. Gunnersen J. Valcanis H. Kalloniatis M. Tan S.S. Layer positioning of late-born cortical interneurons is dependent on Reelin but not p35 signaling.J.

Abnormal laminar position and dendrite development of interneurons in the reeler forebrain.Brain Res. 2007; 1140: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that projection neurons are required for the laminar distribution of interneurons and, further, that distinct subtypes of projection neurons provide different interneuron populations with specific positional information. Fezf2 is a critical transcription factor for forebrain development in several species (Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, Shimizu and Hibi, 2009Shimizu T. Hibi M. Formation and patterning of the forebrain and olfactory system by zinc-finger genes Fezf1 and Fezf2.Dev. Growth Differ. 2009; 51: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In mice, loss of Fezf2 results in the exclusive absence from the cortex of subcerebral projection neurons, which are replaced by another population of excitatory neurons: callosal projection neurons (Chen et al., 2005aChen B. Schaevitz L.R. McConnell S.K. Fezl regulates the differentiation and axon targeting of layer 5 subcortical projection neurons in cerebral cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fezl is required for the birth and specification of corticospinal motor neurons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 817-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We find that GABAergic interneurons distribute abnormally in the Fezf2−/−cortex and that Fezf2−/− mice display aberrant cortical activity due to defective GABAergic inhibition. The defect is projection neuron type-specific, since the generation of CPN in place of the missing subcerebral projection neurons cannot compensate for the interneuron abnormalities. Different types of projection neurons can affect interneuron positioning, as demonstrated by the ectopic presence of cortical interneurons within clusters of either corticofugal projection neurons or layer II/III CPN that are experimentally generated in proximity to the cortex. Interestingly, the types of interneurons recruited are appropriate for the subtype-specific identity of the projection neurons, rather than strictly their day of birth. We conclude that in the neocortex, individual types of projection neurons play critical roles in governing the radial distribution of GABAergic interneurons, a process that is critically important for the development of balanced cortical circuitry. Loss of the transcription factor Fezf2 results in the absence from the cortex of all subcerebral projection neurons, which fail to develop while other projection neuron types across all cortical layers are generated normally (Chen et al., 2005aChen B. Schaevitz L.R. McConnell S.K. Fezl regulates the differentiation and axon targeting of layer 5 subcortical projection neurons in cerebral cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Loss of subcerebral neurons in this mutant is accompanied by the expansion of a different population of projection neurons with callosal projection neuron properties (Chen et al., 2008Chen B. Wang S.S. Hattox A.M. Rayburn H. Nelson S.B. McConnell S.K. The Fezf2-Ctip2 genetic pathway regulates the fate choice of subcortical projection neurons in the developing cerebral cortex.Proc. Natl.

USA. 2008; 105: 11382-11387Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) without overall loss of neurons, defective migration, or changes in cortical thickness (Molyneaux et al., 2005Molyneaux B.J.

Fezl is required for the birth and specification of corticospinal motor neurons.Neuron. 2005; 47: 817-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although Fezf2−/− mice are viable and motile (Molyneaux et al., 2005Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Hirata T. Hibi M. Macklis J.D.

To determine whether the abnormal development of projection neurons in this mutant affects the distribution of cortical interneurons and whether specific subtypes of projection neurons play different roles, we first defined the nature of the CPN that replace subcerebral projection neurons in the Fezf2−/− cortex. As expected, CTIP2, a marker of subcerebral projection neurons, was not expressed in mutant layer V (Molyneaux et al., 2005Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Hirata T. Hibi M. Macklis J.D.

In contrast, TBR1, a marker of layer VI and layer II/III neurons, and SATB2, a protein important for CPN development, were both expanded (Chen et al., 2008Chen B. Wang S.S. Hattox A.M. Rayburn H.

To determine whether these neurons project through the corpus callosum, we retrogradely labeled CPN of the mutant mice with FluoroGold (FG) injections in the contralateral hemisphere. Despite the fact that most CPN form Probst bundles (Pb), making their retrograde labeling inefficient, FG-labeled CPN were visible within layer V and coexpressed TBR1 and SATB2 (Figures 1A–1E ). These data extend prior electrophysiological analysis and characterization of these neurons in chimeric mice by demonstrating that they project through the corpus callosum (Chen et al., 2008Chen B. Wang S.S. Hattox A.M. Rayburn H. Nelson S.B. McConnell S.K. The Fezf2-Ctip2 genetic pathway regulates the fate choice of subcortical projection neurons in the developing cerebral cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 11382-11387Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These CPN are distinct from the CPN of layer Va, which expressed SATB2 but not TBR1 (data not shown). To precisely define the subtype-specific identity of CPN in the mutant layer V, we analyzed the expression of three CPN-specific genes among several that were shown to label subpopulations of CPN in different layers (Molyneaux et al., 2009Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Fame R.M. MacDonald J.L. MacQuarrie K.L. Macklis J.D. Novel subtype-specific genes identify distinct subpopulations of callosal projection neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12343-12354Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Lpl labels CPN in layers V and VI and in the deeper part of layer II/III; Inhba labels CPN of layer II/III; and Limch1 is expressed in subpopulations of CPN within the upper part of layer II/III. In the Fezf2−/− cortex, Lpl expression was increased in layer V (Figures 1F and 1G; arrows), whereas expression of Inhba and Limch1 remained unchanged (Figures 1H–1K; arrowheads). This molecular and hodological analysis indicates that CPN from layers Vb/VI, but not from layers Va or II/III, replace subcerebral projection neurons within layer V of the Fezf2−/− cortex. Fezf2−/− mice represent a unique mutant model in which a single projection neuron population fails to develop and is substituted by projection neurons of a different identity. This motivated us to use this mouse to determine whether projection neurons control the laminar distribution of GABAergic interneurons and, further, whether different types of projection neurons have different roles (Figures 2A and 2B ). First, we quantified the number of GAD67-positive interneurons detected by in situ hybridization in motor, somatosensory, and visual cortex at P28 in wild-type and Fezf2−/− littermates (n = 3 wt; n = 3 Fezf2−/−). The total number of GAD67-positive interneurons did not differ between wild-type and mutant cortices (Figure 2C), but the distribution of GAD67 interneurons was distinctly abnormal in the Fezf2−/− mutant (Figures 2A and 2B). To precisely determine the radial distribution of GAD67-positive interneurons, we divided the cortex"
https://openalex.org/W1966385969,"Previously the application of a weak electric anodal current oscillating with a frequency of the sleep slow oscillation (∼0.75 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NonREM) sleep boosted endogenous slow oscillation activity and enhanced sleep-associated memory consolidation. The slow oscillations occurring during NonREM sleep and theta oscillations present during REM sleep have been considered of critical relevance for memory formation. Here transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) oscillating at 5 Hz, i.e., within the theta frequency range (theta-tDCS) is applied during NonREM and REM sleep. Theta-tDCS during NonREM sleep produced a global decrease in slow oscillatory activity conjoint with a local reduction of frontal slow EEG spindle power (8-12 Hz) and a decrement in consolidation of declarative memory, underlining the relevance of these cortical oscillations for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In contrast, during REM sleep theta-tDCS appears to increase global gamma (25-45 Hz) activity, indicating a clear brain state-dependency of theta-tDCS. More generally, results demonstrate the suitability of oscillating-tDCS as a tool to analyze functions of endogenous EEG rhythms and underlying endogenous electric fields as well as the interactions between EEG rhythms of different frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2029578047,"Loss of one type of sensory input can cause improved functionality of other sensory systems. Whereas this form of plasticity, cross-modal plasticity, is well established, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying it are still unclear. Here, we show that visual deprivation (VD) increases extracellular serotonin in the juvenile rat barrel cortex. This increase in serotonin levels facilitates synaptic strengthening at layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapses within the barrel cortex. Upon VD, whisker experience leads to trafficking of the AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) into these synapses through the activation of ERK and increased phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit GluR1 at the juvenile age when natural whisker experience no longer induces synaptic GluR1 delivery. VD thereby leads to sharpening of the functional whisker-barrel map at layer 2/3. Thus, sensory deprivation of one modality leads to serotonin release in remaining modalities, facilitates GluR1-dependent synaptic strengthening, and refines cortical organization."

Pairs of cross-repressive transcription factors, whose expression is differentially sensitive to the patterning signals establish five discrete ventral spinal progenitor domains (Figure 1A ). Specifically, the motor neuron progenitor (pMN) marker Olig2 is engaged in a cross-repressive interaction with Irx3 to define the dorsal boundary of the pMN domain (Chen et al., 2007Chen J.A.

Interestingly, lineage tracing experiments in which Cre recombinase was knocked into domain specific patterning genes Olig1, Olig2, or Dbx1 (Dessaud et al., 2007Dessaud E. Yang L.L. Hill K. Cox B.

Thus, the state of cross-repressive loops has to be malleable, and the initial broad expression of domain specific determinants needs to be refined during development. Repression of Olig2 in nonmotor neuron progenitors appears to be in part achieved by a temporal adaptation of spinal cells to Shh signal. Clearance of Olig2 from the p3 domain depends on the induction of a repressor Nkx2.2 in response to a sustained Shh signaling, whereas more passive loss of Olig2 expression in p2 domain is proposed to be due to a developmental de-sensitization of progenitors to the Shh signal (Dessaud et al., 2007Dessaud E.

Here we considered whether repression of Olig2 within p2 progenitor domain might rely on additional regulatory mechanisms. Specifically, we examined whether microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNAs generated by the cytoplasmic RNaseIII enzyme Dicer, might contribute to cross-repressive interactions at progenitor boundaries via their ability to silence translation of target mRNAs. miRNAs play a critical role in the specification of postmitotic neuronal identity in Caenorhabditis elegans, where miRNAs lsy-6 and mir-273 are integral parts of a bistable loop controlling the left and right subtype identities of ASE chemosensory neurons (Chang et al., 2004Chang S. Johnston Jr., R.J. Frokjaer-Jensen C. Lockery S. Hobert O.

USA. 2005; 102: 12449-12454Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and in the specification of neural versus non-neural identity in Drosophila peripheral nervous system (Li et al., 2006Li Y. Wang F. Lee J.A. Gao F.B. MicroRNA-9a ensures the precise specification of sensory organ precursors in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2793-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To what extent miRNAs are involved in the segregation of neuronal subtypes in vertebrates remains unclear. The analysis of neural specific Dicer mutants in mammals established miRNA roles in the control of temporal transitions from early to late neural progenitors (Georgi and Reh, 2010Georgi S.A. Reh T.A. Dicer is required for the transition from early to late progenitor state in the developing mouse retina.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 4048-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or from progenitors to postmitotic neurons (Fineberg et al., 2009Fineberg S.K. Kosik K.S. Davidson B.L. MicroRNAs potentiate neural development.Neuron. 2009; 64: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A role for miRNAs in spatial patterning has been demonstrated in the developing mesoderm where knockdown of mir-196 results in an expansion of Hoxb8 expression and homeotic transformation of axial skeleton (Mansfield et al., 2004Mansfield J.H. Harfe B.D. Nissen R. Obenauer J. Srineel J. Chaudhuri A. Farzan-Kashani R. Zuker M. Pasquinelli A.E.

USA. 2009; 106: 18610-18615Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, whether miRNAs are involved in spatial patterning of neural progenitors is not well established (Fineberg et al., 2009Fineberg S.K. Kosik K.S. Davidson B.L. MicroRNAs potentiate neural development.Neuron. 2009; 64: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This might be in part due to the lack of a simple genetic system to probe miRNA function during the early stages of mammalian development when progenitor identity is specified. A complete loss of Dicer function in mice leads to embryonic lethality before neural tissue formation (Bernstein et al., 2003Bernstein E. Kim S.Y. Carmell M.A. Murchison E.P. Alcorn H. Li M.Z. Mills A.A. Elledge S.J. Anderson K.V. Hannon G.J. Dicer is essential for mouse development.Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar) and selective disruption of Dicer function in early neural progenitors is complicated by the lack of suitable drivers expressed in prospective neural tissue and by the relative stability of existing miRNAs (Davis et al., 2008Davis T.H. Cuellar T.L. Koch S.M. Barker A.J. Harfe B.D. McManus M.T. Ullian E.M. Conditional loss of Dicer disrupts cellular and tissue morphogenesis in the cortex and hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4322-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Here we examined miRNA function by employing an embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation system that faithfully recapitulates patterning of the developing spinal cord (Wichterle et al., 2002Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into motor neurons.Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). By disrupting miRNA biogenesis during simulated dorso-ventral patterning of differentiating ES cells we observed a conversion of Olig2 negative V2 interneuron progenitors (p2) to Olig2 positive motor neuron progenitors (pMN). We determined that mir-17-3p, a member of the mir-17∼92 cluster (He et al., 2005He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W.

Thus, miRNA-mediated regulation of transcriptional programs might play a more general role in the refinement and positioning of spatial boundaries in the developing neural tissue. Developing spinal progenitors undergo a progressive adjustment in the expression profile of patterning transcription factors to refine the position and size of individual progenitor domains (Figure 1A) (Dessaud et al., 2007Dessaud E. Yang L.L. Hill K. Cox B. Ulloa F. Ribeiro A. Mynett A. Novitch B.G. Briscoe J.

To identify all spinal neural cells that descend from Olig2 expressing progenitors we performed a lineage tracing experiment using Olig2Cre/+ mice in which one allele of Olig2 is replaced with a gene coding Cre recombinase (Figure 1B) (Dessaud et al., 2007Dessaud E.

Analysis of Olig2Cre/+; ROSA26-loxp-STOP-loxp-YFP embryos on day 11.5 of development (E11.5) demonstrated that Cre is transiently expressed not only by pMN progenitors, but also by p3 and a significant subset of p2 progenitors (Figures 1C–1H; see Figure S1 available online) (Dessaud et al., 2007Dessaud E. Yang L.L. Hill K. Cox B. Ulloa F. Ribeiro A. Mynett A. Novitch B.G. Briscoe J.

Dorsal to the pMN domain, YFP expression was detected in ∼40% of Irx3on, Nkx6.1on, Olig2off p2 progenitors, ∼40% postmitotic Chx10on V2a and ∼20% Gata3on V2b interneurons (Figures 1C–1J and S1). Occasionally we observed isolated YFPon clones within more dorsal progenitor domains (Figure 1H), but a majority of postmitotic V0 and V1 interneurons expressing Evx1 and En1 were YFPoff (Figures S1B and S1C). Together, these results provide genetic evidence that Olig2 is transiently expressed by a subset of p2 progenitors during spinal cord development and that its expression is subsequently repressed to achieve Olig2off, Irx3on transcriptional state compatible with p2 progenitor identity (Figure 1K). Requirement for a rapid and efficient repression of Olig2 prompted us to examine whether miRNA-mediated silencing might be involved in the process of ventral spinal cord patterning. To circumvent the early embryonic lethality of mice in which miRNA biogenesis is blocked (Bernstein et al., 2003Bernstein E. Kim S.Y. Carmell M.A. Murchison E.P. Alcorn H. Li M.Z. Mills A.A. Elledge S.J. Anderson K.V. Hannon G.J. Dicer is essential for mouse development.Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), we examined miRNA function in an in vitro embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation system recapitulating ventral spinal cord patterning in response to variable concentration of Sonic Hedgehog agonist (SAG) (Wichterle et al., 2002Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells into motor neurons.Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). ES cells lacking functional Dicer enzyme are unstable and exhibit propensity to accumulate chromosomal defects (Kanellopoulou et al., 2005Kanellopoulou C. Muljo S.A. Kung A.L. Ganesan S. Drapkin R. Jenuwein T. Livingston D.M. Rajewsky K. Dicer-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells are defective in differentiation and centromeric silencing.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Therefore we derived a CAGG-CreER+/−; Dicerloxp/loxp ES cell line (Dicerf/f) in which both Dicer alleles can be disrupted by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH-TM) treatment (Figures 2A and S2A) (Harfe et al., 2005Harfe B.D. McManus M.T. Mansfield J.H. Hornstein E. Tabin C.J. The RNaseIII enzyme Dicer is required for morphogenesis but not patterning of the vertebrate limb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 10898-10903Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, Hayashi and McMahon, 2002Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Efficient recombination in diverse tissues by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre: a tool for temporally regulated gene activation/inactivation in the mouse.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Treatment of Dicerf/f ES cells with 4OH-TM leads to efficient recombination of both Dicer alleles (producing Dicer−/− cells) (Figure S2B) accompanied by a ∼10-fold decrease in the level of a ubiquitously expressed miRNA mir-16 on day 3 of differentiation when cells are acquiring dorso-ventral progenitor identity (Figure S2C). To examine whether decreased levels of miRNAs affect dorso-ventral spinal progenitor patterning, differentiating 4OH-TM treated control and conditional Dicer−/− ES cells were exposed to low (lo[Hh], 5–10 nM) and high (hi[Hh], 500 nM) concentration of SAG on day 2 of differentiation (Figure 2A). Two days later on day 4 of differentiation, control cells exposed to lo[Hh] acquired preferentially p0/p1 interneuron progenitor identity (Irx3on, Nkx6.1off, Pax7off) whereas a smaller fraction of cells adopted p2 identity (Irx3on, Nkx6.1on, Olig2off) (Figures 2B and 2D). Identical treatment of the Dicer−/− ES cell line resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of progenitors expressing p2 markers that was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the percentage of Irx3off, Nkx6.1on, Olig2on MN progenitors (n = 3 independent experiments; Figure 2F), indicative of a partial conversion of p2 to pMN identity in the absence of miRNAs. To determine whether specification of other ventral progenitor domains is affected in the Dicer−/− cells we examined expression of progenitor markers in ES cells differentiated under hi[Hh] conditions. In contrast to lo[Hh] condition, we did not detect overt defects in neural progenitor patterning. Comparable percentages of Olig2 expressing pMN progenitors, and Nkx2.2 expressing p3 interneuron progenitors were detected in the control and Dicer−/− ES cell lines on day 4 of differentiation (Figures 2G–2K). These results indicate that under the examined differentiation conditions, Dicer activity is specifically required for the efficient specification of p2 and suppression of pMN progenitor identity of differentiating ES cells exposed to low concentration of Hh. Next we examined whether p2/pMN specification in vivo also relies on Dicer function. Because Dicer mutant mice die on embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5) (Bernstein et al., 2003Bernstein E. Kim S.Y. Carmell M.A. Murchison E.P. Alcorn H. Li M.Z. Mills A.A. Elledge S.J. Anderson K.V. Hannon G.J. Dicer is essential for mouse development.Nat.

To ensure effective loss of miRNAs after Dicer deletion, tamoxifen (TM) was injected intraperitoneally into pregnant dams on E5–E5.5 to generate Dicer−/− embryos and dorso-ventral pattering was assayed 4 days later on E9.5 (Figure 2L). Dicer−/− mice exhibited a shorter body axis and most mutant embryos died by E11.5 (Figures S2F and S2G). The ubiquitously expressed miRNA mir-16 was effectively depleted in the neural tube of E9.5 knockout mice as determined by in situ hybridization using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe (Figures S2H and S2I). Because the deletion of Dicer gene is not limited to neural tissue, we considered whether global depletion of miRNAs might affect specification of signaling centers essential for spinal cord patterning. Ventral expression domain of Shh in the floor plate and notochord, and paraxial mesodermal expression domain of the RA synthesizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2) were not affected in E9.5 Dicer−/− embryos (Figures S2J and S2K). Despite the normal appearance of the developing spinal cord and adjacent patterning centers, all examined Dicer−/− embryos exhibited a dorsal expansion of pMN domain marker Olig2 (n = 5, Figures 2M–2T) compared to their heterozygous or wild-type littermates. To investigate the precise position of the dorsal limit of Olig2 expansion in Dicer−/− embryos, we quantified p2 progenitors coexpressing Nkx6.1 and Irx3. Although the total number of Nkx6.1on cells was not changed in mutant embryos, the number of p2 progenitors (Nkx6.1on, Irx3on) was markedly diminished (Figures 2Q, 2R, and 2U), suggesting that the Olig2 expression domain expanded at the expense of p2 progenitors. In contrast, the number of Nkx2.2 expressing p3 progenitors was unchanged as was the position of Pax7 expressing dorsal spinal progenitors (Figures 2S–2U, and data not shown), suggesting that the dorsal shift of the pMN/p2 progenitor boundary is likely not a consequence of an overall increase in Shh signaling accompanied by a global dorsal shift of all ventral progenitor domain boundaries. Considering that Olig2 is transiently expressed by p2 progenitors during early stages of spinal cord development we propose that the failure to effectively repress its expression in Dicer−/− embryos results in a conversion of a subset of p2 progenitors to Olig2 expressing pMN-like cells (Figure 2V). The ectopic expression of Olig2 in p2 progenitors in Dicer−/− cells and embryos raised the possibility that miRNAs expressed in the p2 domain might be involved in the silencing of Olig2 expression. To identify miRNAs that are enriched in p0–p2 domain we profiled expression of 343 miRNAs in ES cell derived ventral spinal progenitors treated with lo[Hh]or hi[Hh] using the murine TaqMan low density arrays (TLDA) (Figure 3A ). TLDA arrays are based on qPCR technology, providing a quantitative assessment of expressed miRNAs. The pairwise comparison of small RNA enriched samples isolated from cells differentiated under the two conditions identified 53 miRNAs (15.4%) significantly enriched in lo[Hh] progenitors and only 8 miRNAs (2.3%) enriched in hi[Hh] progenitors (Figure 3B). Out of the lo[Hh] enriched miRNAs only two miRNAs, mir-17-3p and mir-302b, were predicted to target Olig2 mRNA by miRNA target prediction algorithms (Targetscan 4.2, miRanda, and MicroCosm Targets) (Figure 3C). Independent qPCR analysis (n = 3) confirmed ∼4.5-fold enrichment of mir-17-3p and ∼2-fold enrichment of mir-302b in lo[Hh] derived p0-p2 progenitors compared to hi[Hh] derived p3-pMN progenitors (Figure 3D). The highly enriched mir-17-3p is a passenger strand (also known as mir-17∗) produced from an oncomir cluster mir-17∼92 (He et al., 2005He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W.

Passenger strand (miRNA∗) refers to a strand of miRNA duplex that is less likely to be incorporated into the RISC complex during miRNA biogenesis, yet many passenger strands were recently shown to be utilized in mRNA silencing (Okamura et al., 2008Okamura K. Phillips M.D. Tyler D.M. Duan H. Chou Y.T. Lai E.C. The regulatory activity of microRNA∗ species has substantial influence on microRNA and 3′ UTR evolution.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a closer examination of mir-17-5p, the major product of mir-17, revealed a striking similarity of its seed sequence to the seed sequence of mir-302b (Figure 3E). Thus, both strands of mir-17 might contribute to Olig2 silencing through binding to mir-17-3p and mir-302b target sites within Olig2 3′UTR (Figure 3E). Based on these observations we elected to further examine the function of mir-17 during spinal cord patterning. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry on adjacent mouse E9.5 spinal cord sections revealed that mir-17-3p was enriched in the dorsal spinal region corresponding to Irx3 expression domain and was reduced in the Olig2 expressing motor neuron progenitor domain (Figures 4A and 4B). To examine whether Olig2 and Irx3 transcription factors might control mir-17-3p expression, we generated “Tet-on” inducible Irx3 and Olig2 ES cell lines (Figure 4C) (Ting et al., 2005Ting D.T. Kyba M. Daley G.Q. Inducible transgene expression in mouse stem cells.Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 105: 23-46PubMed Google Scholar). Induced expression of Olig2 in progenitors derived under lo[Hh] condition by doxycycline treatment on day 3 of differentiation resulted in an efficient suppression of Irx3 expression (Figures 4D and 4E) and in a decrease in both mir-17-3p and -5p levels on day 4 (Figure 4H). Conversely, induction of Irx3 in hi[Hh] differentiated progenitors repressed Olig2 expression within the pMN cells (Figures 4F and 4G) and increased mir-17-5p and -3p expression (Figure 4H). To determine whether Olig2 is necessary for mir-17 repression, we derived an Olig2−/− ES cell line and differentiated it under condition that normally promotes specification of pMNs. The absence of Olig2 results in a modest increase in Irx3 expression and correspondingly modest increase (∼1.5-fold) in mir-17-3p and -5p expression (n = 3 independent experiments) (Figure S3). Together, these observations indicate that Olig2 represses mir-17 indirectly, likely through the repression of Irx3 or another p2-specific positive regulator of mir-17 expression. To examine whether mir-17 is sufficient to switch the state of the Olig2/Irx3 cross-repressive loop we developed a “Tet-on” inducible ES cell line, in which mir-17 was inserted into the 3′UTR of an inducible GFP construct (Figures 4I and S4A) (Wang et al., 2007Wang J. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. Site-directed, virus-free, and inducible RNAi in embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 20850-20855Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Fortunately, ganglion cell morphology appears to remain intact long after photoreceptors and distal retinal circuitry have degenerated. We have introduced the optical neuromodulators channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) differentially into the soma and dendrites of ganglion cells to recreate antagonistic center-surround receptive field interactions. We then reestablished the physiological receptive field dimensions of primate parafoveal ganglion cells by convolving Gaussian-blurred versions of the visual scene at the appropriate wavelength for each neuromodulator with the Gaussians inherent in the soma and dendrites. These Gaussian-modified ganglion cells responded with physiologically relevant antagonistic receptive field components and encoded edges with parafoveal resolution. This approach bypasses the degenerated areas of the distal retina and could provide a first step in restoring sight to individuals suffering from retinal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2142809407,"Ca2+-evoked transmitter release shows a high dynamic range over spontaneous release. We investigated the role of the Ca2+ sensor protein, Synaptotagmin2 (Syt2), in both spontaneous and Ca2+-evoked release under direct control of presynaptic [Ca2+]i, using an in vivo rescue approach at the calyx of Held. Re-expression of Syt2 rescued the highly Ca2+ cooperative release and suppressed the elevated spontaneous release seen in Syt2 KO synapses. This latter release clamping function was partially mediated by the poly-lysine motif of the C2B domain. Using an aspartate mutation in the C2B domain (D364N) in which Ca2+ triggering was abolished but release clamping remained intact, we show that Syt2 strongly suppresses the action of another, near-linear Ca2+ sensor that mediates release over a wide range of [Ca2+]i. Thus, Syt2 increases the dynamic range of synapses by driving release with a high Ca2+ cooperativity, as well as by suppressing a remaining, near-linear Ca2+ sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2019813402,"<h2>Summary</h2> Homeostatic signaling systems stabilize neural function through the modulation of neurotransmitter receptor abundance, ion channel density, and presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Molecular mechanisms that drive these changes are being unveiled. In theory, molecular mechanisms may also exist to oppose the induction or expression of homeostatic plasticity, but these mechanisms have yet to be explored. In an ongoing electrophysiology-based genetic screen, we have tested 162 new mutations for genes involved in homeostatic signaling at the <i>Drosophila</i> NMJ. This screen identified a mutation in the <i>rab3-GAP</i> gene. We show that Rab3-GAP is necessary for the induction and expression of synaptic homeostasis. We then provide evidence that Rab3-GAP relieves an opposing influence on homeostasis that is catalyzed by Rab3 and which is independent of any change in NMJ anatomy. These data define roles for Rab3-GAP and Rab3 in synaptic homeostasis and uncover a mechanism, acting at a late stage of vesicle release, that opposes the progression of homeostatic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1979208696,"Abnormal aggregates of transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) and its hyperphosphorylated and N-terminal truncated C-terminal fragments (CTFs) are deposited as major components of ubiquitinated inclusions in most cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U). The mechanism underlying the contribution of TDP-43 to the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases remains unknown. In this study, we found that a 2-5-fold increase in TDP-43 expression over the endogenous level induced death of NSC34 motor neuronal cells and primary cortical neurons. TDP-43-induced death is associated with up-regulation of Bim expression and down-regulation of Bcl-xL expression. siRNA-mediated reduction of Bim expression attenuates TDP-43-induced death. Accumulated evidence indicates that caspases are activated in neurons of ALS and FTLD-U patients, and activated caspase-mediated cleavage of TDP-43 generates CTFs of TDP-43. Here, we further found that the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress- or staurosporine-mediated activation of caspases leads to cleavage of TDP-43 at Asp(89) and Asp(169), generating CTF35 (TDP-43-(90-414)) and CTF27 (TDP-43-(170-414)) in cultured neuronal cells. In contrast to TDP-43, CTF27 is unable to induce death while it forms aggregates. CTF35 was weaker than full-length TDP-43 in inducing death. A cleavage-resistant mutant of TDP-43 (TDP-43-D89E/D169E) showed stronger death-inducing activity than wild-type TDP-43. These results suggest that disease-related activation of caspases may attenuate TDP-43-induced toxicity by promoting TDP-43 cleavage."

While the function of the central orexinergic system in sleep regulation has been well studied, the role of orexin in motor control is largely unknown. Here, we show that orexin-A acts via OX1 and OX2 receptors to directly depolarize neurons in the rat lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN), a subcortical motor center, and enhance their sensitivity. A dual ionic mechanism involving both Na+-Ca2+ exchangers and inward rectifier K+ channels underlies these effects. Furthermore, orexin-A regulates central vestibular-mediated posture, motor balance and negative geotaxis. Orexin is critical when an animal is facing a major motor challenge as opposed to during rest and general movements. Therefore, orexin participates not only in sleep and emotion (nonsomatic) but also in motor (somatic) regulation, suggesting that the central orexinergic system plays an important role in somatic-nonsomatic integration.

But, since cataplexy is closely related to narcolepsy and often triggered by strong emotions, the effect of orexin on the motor system may be secondary to its actions on the neural circuits controlling sleep or emotions (España et al., 2007España R.A.

However, several lines of evidence indicate that the orexinergic system may directly participate in central motor control. First, numerous neuroanatomical and immunohistochemical studies reveal that essential subcortical motor structures, such as basal ganglia, cerebellum, and vestibular nuclei, receive direct innervation from the hypothalamic orexinergic neurons (Cutler et al., 1999Cutler D.J. Morris R. Sheridhar V. Wattam T.A. Holmes S. Patel S. Arch J.R. Wilson S. Buckingham R.E.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7754-7765PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, injection of orexin into the midbrain locomotor region of decerebrate cats triggers locomotion and facilitates muscle tone (Takakusaki et al., 2005Takakusaki K. Takahashi K. Saitoh K. Harada H. Okumura T. Kayama Y. Koyama Y. Orexinergic projections to the cat midbrain mediate alternation of emotional behavioural states from locomotion to cataplexy.J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 1003-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of central orexinergic system in motor control needs to be clarified. In the present study, to reveal the exact relationship between the central orexinergic system and motor control, the effects of orexin on the motor system and the underlying mechanisms were investigated at molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels. Considering that cataplexy induced by orexin deficiency is characterized by sudden loss of muscle tone and the central vestibular system plays a critical role in control of muscle tone and postural control (Angelaki and Cullen, 2008Angelaki D.E. Cullen K.E. Vestibular system: The many facets of a multimodal sense.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 125-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, Barmack, 2003Barmack N.H. Central vestibular system: Vestibular nuclei and posterior cerebellum.Brain Res. Bull. 2003; 60: 511-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we focused on the effects of orexin on the vestibular nuclear complex in the brainstem. Moreover, compared to other sensorimotor circuits, the central vestibular circuitry exhibits a linear input-output transformation which is closely linked to vestibular reflexes (Bagnall et al., 2008Bagnall M.W. McElvain L.E. Faulstich M. du Lac S. Frequency-independent synaptic transmission supports a linear vestibular behavior.Neuron. 2008; 60: 343-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This distinctive feature enables any modulation on the vestibular nuclei, including orexinergic, to be linearly transduced into the final output of the vestibular circuitry and reflected in motor behavior. Therefore, this study, we concentrated on the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN, or Deiters' nucleus) in the vestibular nuclear complex, a nucleus that directly contributes to adjustment of muscle tone for both postural maintenance and the alternative change from the extensor to the flexor phase during locomotion (Molina-Negro et al., 1980Molina-Negro P.

Peterson B.W. Peripheral and central substrates of vestibulospinal reflexes.Physiol. Rev. 1978; 58: 80-105PubMed Google Scholar). Carrying out quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence techniques, we first investigated expression and distribution of orexin receptors in the LVN in rats. Next, we examined in brain slices the electrophysiological effects of orexin on the LVN neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Finally, we determined whether orexin regulates vestibular-mediated motor behaviors. The results demonstrate that orexin activates LVN neurons and promotes vestibular-mediated motor behaviors, implicating orexin and the central orexinergic system in the direct control of somatic motor behavior. We assessed the expression of OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNAs in rat LVN by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The rat LVN tissues, localized between −10.50 and −11.30 mm from bregma (Figures 1A and 1B ), were extracted according to the rat brain atlas of Paxinos and Watson, 2007Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates.Sixth Edition. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2007Google Scholar. Amplification and melting temperature curves of ox-r1 and ox-r2 (genes of OX1 and OX2 receptors) and gapdh (the control housekeeping gene) show the cycle thresholds (Ct) for all genes (Figure 1C) and demonstrate that only one product per gene was generated (Figure 1D). As shown in Figure 1E, both OX1 and OX2 receptor mRNAs were detected in the rat LVN. To map the distribution of orexin receptors, we performed immunostaining of the rat brain slices containing the LVN with an antibody against OX1 and OX2 receptors, respectively. We found that both OX1 and OX2 receptors were localized in the LVN (Figures 1F1, 1F2, 1G1, and 1G2) and present in all the large neurons (diameter >35 μm) (Figures 1F3 and 1G3). These large neurons are giant Deiters' neurons (Shamboul, 1979Shamboul K.M. The lateral vestibular nucleus of the rat, with a note on its dorsal extension into the cerebellum.J. Anat. 1979; 129: 107-116PubMed Google Scholar, Suárez et al., 1993Suárez C. González del Rey C. Tolivia J. Llorente J.L. Díaz C. Navarro A. Gómez J.

Given the finding of the expression and localization of the orexin receptors in the LVN and considering previous reports of moderately dense orexinergic innervation of the vestibular nuclei in rats (Cutler et al., 1999Cutler D.J. Morris R. Sheridhar V. Wattam T.A. Holmes S. Patel S. Arch J.R. Wilson S. Buckingham R.E.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9996-10015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we carried out voltage-clamp recordings in the giant LVN neurons (diameter >35 μm) to examine the effect of orexin on whole-cell currents of LVN neurons and the underlying mechanisms by using brain slice preparations (see also Figure 1B). In total, we recorded 69 LVN neurons with the membrane resistance higher than 150 MΩ. As all of these cells had a diameter >35 μm and a whole-cell membrane capacitance >150 pF, we conclude that the neurons studied were giant Deiters' neurons (Uno et al., 2003Uno A. Idoux E. Beraneck M. Vidal P.P. Moore L.E. Wilson V.J. Vibert N. Static and dynamic membrane properties of lateral vestibular nucleus neurons in guinea pig brain stem slices.J.

Orexins have two splice variants, orexin-A and orexin-B, that are derived from a common pre-pro-orexin gene (Kukkonen et al., 2002Kukkonen J.P. Holmqvist T. Ammoun S. Åkerman K.E.O.

The neural circuit of orexin (hypocretin): maintaining sleep and wakefulness.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Both orexin-A and orexin-B act on two G protein-coupled receptors, OX1 and OX2 receptors (Kukkonen et al., 2002Kukkonen J.P. Holmqvist T. Ammoun S. Åkerman K.E.O.

We found that brief application (1 min) of orexin-A (10–300 nM) elicited a significant inward whole-cell current on a majority of the recorded LVN neurons (63/69, 91.3%). For the remaining six neurons, orexin-A induced an outward current (3/69, 4.3%) or had no effect (3/69, 4.3%). The orexin-A-induced excitation on LVN neurons was concentration-dependent (Figures 2A 1 and 2A2). Application of 30, 50, 100 nM orexin-A elicited an inward current of –38.4 ± 5.9 pA (n = 8), –53.4 ± 9.6 pA (n = 7), –73.8 ± 13.0 pA (n = 7), respectively. Fitting the concentration-response curve from 14 LVN neurons yielded that the mean concentration of orexin-A for half-maximal activation (EC50) was 59.0 ± 17.9 nM. Additionally, the effect of orexin-B on the LVN neurons (n = 6) was similar to that of orexin-A (Figure 2B). We used a selective receptor agonist and antagonist to assess the underlying receptor mechanisms, although the choice of orexinergic agents is limited as only [Ala11, d-Leu15]-orexin-B (selective OX2 receptor agonist) and SB334867 (selective OX1 receptor antagonist) are commercially available. As shown in Figure 2C, [Ala11, d-Leu15]-orexin-B mimicked the orexin-A-induced excitatory effect on LVN neurons. On 6 LVN neurons, 100 and 300 nM [Ala11, d-Leu15]-orexin-B elicited a concentration-dependent inward current of –26.5 ± 2.2 pA and –71.6 ± 6.6 pA, respectively, suggesting that OX2 receptors are involved in the action of orexin on the LVN neurons. In addition, on the same six LVN neurons, the orexin-A-elicited inward currents were partly blocked by SB334867. After application of 10 μM SB334867, 30 nM orexin-A-elicited currents decreased from –43.4 ± 6.2 pA to –22.2 ± 2.9 pA (p < 0.01). Together, these results provide direct electrophysiological evidence that orexin excites the LVN neurons by activation of both OX1 and OX2 receptors, consistent with our molecular and immunostaining results. To clarify the ionic basis underlying the orexin-induced excitation, first we determined whether the action of orexin-A on the LVN neurons was a direct postsynaptic effect. The fact that application of orexin-A onto LVN neurons evokes a stable inward current instead of EPSC/IPSCs suggests a direct postsynaptic excitatory effect. We also used 0.3 μM TTX for confirmation. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B1, TTX did not block the 100 nM orexin-A-elicited inward currents (i.e., –71.8 ± 10.7 pA and –69.4 ± 9.4 pA before and after applying TTX, p = 0.212; n = 5), strongly suggesting that the excitation of orexin on the LVN neurons is a direct postsynaptic action. Furthermore, GABAA receptor (100 μM picrotoxin) and ionotropic glutamate receptor (1 mM kynurenate) antagonists still did not influence the orexin-elicited inward current (i.e., –72.3 ± 22.0 pA and –73.5 ± 25.3 pA before and after application, p = 0.811; n = 4; see Figure S1 available online), confirming the direct postsynaptic mechanism. Moreover, accompanying the orexin-A-induced inward currents, the input conductance of the cells slightly decreased (76.4% ± 6.3% of the control; Figures 3A and 3B2), and the change of conductance was not blocked by TTX (77.4% ± 5.9% of the control, p = 0.234; Figures 3A and 3B2), suggesting that orexin-A caused a closure of ion channels on the postsynaptic membrane. Next, we determined the I-V curves in response to orexin-A to investigate the underlying ionic mechanism. We employed slow ramp command tests (dV/dt = –10 mV/s, ranged from –65 mV to –120 mV) to evaluate the I-V curves for a large voltage range in the absence and presence of orexin-A. We observed four types of orexin-A-induced changes on the I-V curves from 18 LVN neurons. Among 55.6% (10/18) of these neurons, the orexin-A-elicited inward current was smaller at the more hyperpolarized potential of –120 mV as compared with –65 mV (Figure 3C1), and in 22.2% (4/18) of neurons, the orexin-A-induced inward current had a larger amplitude at –120 mV as compared with –65 mV (Figure 3C2). In 16.7% (3/18) of the neurons tested, orexin-A elicited an inward current that reversed near the calculated Ek of –105 mV (Figure 3C3), suggesting the involvement of K+ channels. In the remaining 1 neuron, the orexin-A-elicited inward current was similar in amplitude at –65 and –120 mV, although its amplitude first decreased then increased along with the hyperpolarization (Figure 3C4). The diversity of the changes in the I-V curves implies that more than one ionic mechanism is involved in the orexin-induced excitation on the LVN neurons, in which K+ may be an important component. Blockage of K+ channels, activation of nonselective cation channels and/or electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchangers have been reported to mediate the orexin-A-elicited inward current (Eriksson et al., 2001Eriksson K.S.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9273-9279PubMed Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2002Liu R.J. van den Pol A.N. Aghajanian G.K.

Hypocretin/orexin innervation and excitation of identified septohippocampal cholinergic neurons.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3527-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Notably, decrease of input conductance (see Figures 3A and 3B2) and the reversal potential near the calculated Ek (see Figure 3C3) together indicate that orexin-A suppressed K+ channels to excite LVN neurons. Furthermore, we assessed other ionic mechanism(s) underlying the excitatory effects of orexin on LVN neurons. We applied a selective blocker of Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (50 μM KB-R7943) on 6 LVN neurons and observed a partial inhibition of the orexin-A-elicited inward current (49.0% ± 5.4% of the control) (Figures 4A and 4D ), suggesting an activation of electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchangers. Then, under a condition of blockage of Na+-Ca2+ exchangers by continuously perfusing the slice with KB-R7943, we used slow ramp command tests to obtain the I-V curves in the absence and presence of orexin-A (the left panel of Figure 4B1). Subtracting the control from the current recorded during orexin-A application yielded a difference current representing the orexin-A-induced current excluding the component of Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (the right panel of Figure 4B1). The difference current obtained from the 6 LVN neurons (Figure 4B2) exhibited two significant features: the difference current had a reversal potential of –100 mV that was near the calculated Ek and it was strongly outwardly rectifying. Considering orexin-A decreased input conductance, the result indicates that the K+ channels blocked by orexin-A are the inward rectifier K+ channels. To confirm these results, we applied Ba2+ (1 mM), a blocker of K+ channels, combined with 50 μM KB-R7943, on 5 LVN neurons. The orexin-A-elicited inward current was nearly totally blocked (10.5% ± 2.6% of the control) (Figures 4C and 4D), suggesting that orexin-A excites the LVN neurons via a dual ionic mechanism, including both activation of Na+-Ca2+ exchangers and closure of inward rectifier K+ channels. Other two specific blockers for Na+-Ca2+ exchangers (10 μM SN-6) and inward rectifier K+ channels (100 nM tertiapin-Q) further confirmed the dual ionic mechanism (Figure S2). Given that orexin-A induces an inward current on the LVN neurons, we carried out current clamp experiments to address whether orexin-A directly activates LVN neurons. The LVN contains two classes of neurons, one that has spontaneous discharge and the other (30%–50% of neurons) that has no spontaneous discharge (Uno et al., 2003Uno A. Idoux E. Beraneck M. Vidal P.P. Moore L.E. Wilson V.J. Vibert N. Static and dynamic membrane properties of lateral vestibular nucleus neurons in guinea pig brain stem slices.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1689-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2008Zhang J. Han X.H. Li H.Z. Zhu J.N. Wang J.J. Histamine excites rat lateral vestibular nuclear neurons through activation of post-synaptic H2 receptors.Neurosci. Lett. 2008; 448: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As expected, orexin-A (100 nM) elicited a significant increase in the discharge rates of 4 LVN spontaneous firing neurons (Figure 5A ), and a sufficiently strong depolarization to activate firing in two silent neurons (Figure 5B). Plotting the interspike intervals (ISIs) and peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of the LVN neurons with spontaneous firing (Figures 5C and 5D) shows that, accompanied by a remarkable increase in the peak firing rates (146.9% ± 15.6% of the baseline of 6.8 ± 1.8 spikes/s), the spiking intervals were also significantly shortened by orexin-A. Therefore, orexin directly increases the firing of both spontaneous discharges and silent LVN neurons. Intriguingly, orexin-A also increased the sensitivity of the LVN neurons to a depolarizing ramp-like current stimulation (Figure 5E1), consisting of a 600 ms ramp (−150 pA to 150 pA, slope of 0.5 nA/s) followed by a long plateau of current (150 pA, 4400 ms) (Ris et al., 2001Ris L. Capron B. Vibert N. Vidal P.P. Godaux E. Modification of the pacemaker activity of vestibular neurons in brainstem slices during vestibular compensation in the guinea pig.Eur. J.

Static and dynamic membrane properties of lateral vestibular nucleus neurons in guinea pig brain stem slices.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1689-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On 5 LVN neurons, orexin-A (100 nM) significantly shortened the first-spike latency from 449.3 ± 47.2 ms to 281.3 ± 35.4 ms (p < 0.05; Figure 5E2). Furthermore, orexin-A increased the rate of increase in the instantaneous firing rate (Figure 5E3) of the LVN neurons from 29.2 ± 9.1 spikes/s/nA to 34.4 ± 9.4 spikes/s/nA (p < 0.01; Figure 5E4), consistent with an increase in the sensitivity of the cell to the current stimulation. However, orexin-A did not change (control, 1.70 ± 0.40 spikes/s; orexin-A, 1.53 ± 0.45 spikes/s, p = 0.132; Figure 5E5) the difference between the firing rate reached at the end of the ramp and the stable discharge rate reached at the end of the plateau (overshoot in spikes/s; Figure 5E3), i.e., orexin did not change the accommodation, which gives an indication of the unchanged dynamic properties of neurons by orexin. The increase in both the firing rate and sensitivity of LVN neurons suggests that the orexinergic afferent system in the LVN may have a potential physiological function on the vestibular-mediated motor behaviors. We microinjected orexin-A (10 μM, 1 μl) into the LVN and used extracellular recording to observe its actions in vivo in urethane-anesthetized rats. To"

We show here that NWMN_1991 encodes a bona fide Cu(I)-inducible CsoR of a genetically unlinked copA-copZ copper resistance operon in S. aureus strain Newman. In contrast, an unannotated open reading frame found between NWMN_0027 and NWMN_0026 (denoted NWMN_0026.5) encodes a CsoR-like regulator that represses expression of adjacent genes by binding specifically to a pair of canonical operator sites positioned in the NWMN_0027-0026.5 intergenic region. Inspection of these regulated genes suggests a role in assimilation of inorganic sulfur from thiosulfate and vectorial sulfur transfer, and we designate NWMN_0026.5 as CstR (CsoR-like sulfur transferase repressor). Expression analysis demonstrates that CsoR and CstR control their respective regulons in response to distinct stimuli with no overlap in vivo. Unlike CsoR, CstR does not form a stable complex with Cu(I); operator binding is instead inhibited by oxidation of the intersubunit cysteine pair to a mixture of disulfide and trisulfide linkages by a likely metabolite of thiosulfate assimilation, sulfite. CsoR is unreactive toward sulfite under the same conditions. We conclude that CsoR and CstR are paralogs in S. aureus that function in the same cytoplasm to control distinct physiological processes."

Current models suggest a stepwise assembly in both cyanobacteria and chloroplasts involving distinct intermediates (8Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B.C. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J.

However, as with other membrane protein complexes, detailed analysis of PSII assembly complexes is hindered by their low abundance in the membrane, and until now, early assembly intermediates of PSII have not been isolated and biochemically characterized. Here, we describe the isolation of the CP47 and CP43 subunits from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803). These PSII subunits each contain six transmembrane α-helices and, in the cyanobacterial PSII holoenzyme, bind Chl a (16 molecules in CP47 and 13 in CP43) and β-carotene (4Guskov A. Kern J. Gabdulkhakov A. Broser M. Zouni A. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). They lie on either side of the heterodimeric D1/D2 reaction center complex involved in light-induced transmembrane charge separation, and one of their roles is to act as an inner light-harvesting antenna system (11Bricker T.M. Frankel L.K. Photosynth. Res. 2002; 72: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CP43 is also involved in ligating the Mn4Ca cluster (3Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2872) Google Scholar). CP47 and CP43 are tightly bound components of the larger PSII core complex, and relatively harsh treatments are required to remove CP47 and CP43 in vitro (12Ghanotakis D.F. de Paula J.C.

However, it remains unclear whether they are able to bind pigment molecules in this “unassembled” state (10Nixon P.J. Michoux F. Yu J. Boehm M. Komenda J. Ann.

To address this issue, we describe here a novel approach for the isolation and characterization of CP47 and CP43 complexes from Synechocystis 6803. Our results show that both CP47 and CP43 are likely to bind a largely complete set of pigments and are able to attach to neighboring low molecular mass (LMM) subunits before assembling into larger PSII complexes.

Ultimately, this plasmid was transformed into the ΔD1/ΔFtsH2 strain, which had been generated by transforming the ΔD1 mutant strain (15Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with the plasmid used to produce the Syn0228GENT strain described previously (17Komenda J. Barker M.

A control strain expressing His-tagged CP47 in a WT background (strain PSII-His) was generated by transforming the WT with pCP47His-tagEryR. To generate the His-tagged CP43 Synechocystis 6803 mutant strain (ΔD1/CP43-His), a His6-coding sequence was introduced at the 3′-end of the psbC gene (sll0851) by overlap extension PCR using the following primers: CP43+1000-Fw, 5′-ATATTTTCCCCTTCTTCGTAGGGGTGC-3′; CP43+1000-Rev, 5′-CTGCCATTAAAGAATTGGCTAAAGAAGCAGGTC-3′; CP43HT-Fw, 5′-CATCATCATCATCATCATTAGATTGAGACTTTTCTGATTTTGCAA-3′; and CP43HT-Rev, 5′-CTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTCGAGGTCAGGCATGAACAA-3′. The overlap extension PCR product was cloned into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega), and an erythromycin resistance cassette was introduced at an XmnI site 170 bp downstream of the stop codon of the gene. The genotypes of the mutants were verified by PCR analysis using gene-specific primers. CP47-His and CP43-His complexes were isolated from 10-liter cultures of the respective Synechocystis 6803 mutant strain that had been grown to stationary phase, concentrated using a cell harvester, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were then washed and finally resuspended in KPN buffer (40 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 100 mm NaCl) containing EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor (Roche) to a Chl a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. After two passages at 1250 p.s.i. through a prechilled French press cell (Amicon), unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation. Subsequently, crude membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in KPNG buffer (KPN buffer supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol). Solubilization of the sample was performed under gentle stirring for 30 min on ice after the addition of one-ninth of the sample volume of 10% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (β-DM) in KPN buffer. Unsolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on an end-over-end rotational wheel with nickel-iminodiacetic acid His affinity purification resin (Generon). After incubation, unbound material was removed, and the resin was washed with KPNGD buffer (KPNG buffer containing 0.04% (w/v) β-DM) until the flow-through became colorless (typically 40 column volumes). The resin was then washed with 10 column volumes each of KPNGD buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (5, 10, and 20 mm). The His-tagged proteins were eluted using 10 and 5 column volumes of 50 and 100 mm imidazole in KPNGD buffer, respectively. These elution samples were then pooled and concentrated using 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff protein concentrators (Sartorius). In a second purification step, 500-μl aliquots containing ∼200 μg of Chl a were applied to a Superdex 200 FPLC column (GE Healthcare) operated at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 with KPN buffer containing 0.04% (w/v) β-DM as the running buffer. The run was monitored at 280 nm using a Jasco MD-2015 Plus diode array detector, and 2-ml fractions were collected by a Frac-920 fraction collector (GE Healthcare). Selected fractions were pooled, supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol, and concentrated using 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff protein concentrators. Typically, the yield of CP47-His and CP43-His was ∼0.5–1.0 mg of chlorophyll/10-liter culture. As a control, His-tagged PSII was purified from strain PSII-His using the same immobilized metal affinity chromatography purification protocol as used for CP43-His and CP47-His except that a 100-kDa molecular mass cutoff concentrator was used to concentrate samples. A 500-μl aliquot containing ∼200 μg of Chl a was then applied to 5 ml of TOYOPEARL 650S DEAE anion exchange chromatography resin (Anachem) in a second purification step. The anion exchange chromatography run was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1 with KPN buffer containing 0.04% (w/v) β-DM as the running buffer. Initially, for the first 10 min, the running buffer also contained 5 mm MgSO4, and over the next 50 min, the concentration of MgSO4 was raised linearly to 200 mm. Fractions containing PSII were pooled, supplemented with glycerol to a final concentration of 10% (v/v) and concentrated using 100-kDa molecular mass cutoff protein concentrators. Samples were prepared from larger PSII core complexes using the methods described previously (18Groot M.L. Peterman E.J. van Stokkum I.H. Dekker J.P. van Grondelle R. Biophys.

The Chl a content of samples was determined by extraction into methanol and absorption measurements at 666 and 750 nm (20Komenda J. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9625-9631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Protein samples were analyzed by Blue native (BN)-PAGE and SDS-PAGE as described previously (21Boehm M. Nield J. Zhang P. Aro E.M. Komenda J. Nixon P.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6425-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, BN-8–12% (w/v) polyacrylamide and 18% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 6 m urea were used. The resulting gels were either Coomassie Blue- or silver-stained (22Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar) or electroblotted onto PVDF membrane using the iBlot system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblot analyses were performed using specific primary antibodies and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). Signals were visualized using a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-CP43 (directed against Chlamydomonas reinhardtii PsbC, serum P6, kindly provided by B. Diner), anti-CP47 (directed against barley PsbB (residues 380–394)), anti-D1 (directed against the C-terminal peptide) (23Nixon P.J. Komenda J. Barber J. Deak Z. Vass I. Diner B.A. J. Biol.

Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pigments were extracted into 80% (v/v) acetone/water at 4 °C under dim light conditions, and the sample was centrifuged at maximum speed for 1 min in a microcentrifuge to pellet precipitated proteinaceous material before injection. The injection volume was 20 μl, and the pigments were resolved using a Gemini 5-μm C6-phenyl 110-Å column (Phenomenex). The following program was run at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1: 0–4 min at 100% system B, 4–20 min linear gradient from 100% system B to 40% system B and 60% system C, 20–24 min at 40% system B and 60% system C, 24–35 min at 100% system B, with system A being 65% (v/v) acetonitrile and 35% (v/v) water, system B being 90% (v/v) acetonitrile and 10% (v/v) water, and system C being 100% ethyl acetate. The run was monitored at 440 nm using a Jasco MD-2015 Plus diode array detector. Chl a and β-carotene quantification was performed after calibration with pigment standards (purchased from Sigma) of known concentrations. CP43-His and CP47-His samples were diluted in buffer containing 20 mm BisTris-HCl (pH 6.5), 20 mm NaCl, 0.09% (w/v) β-DM, and 75% (v/v) glycerol. The samples for the absorption experiments were diluted to an absorbance of ∼0.5 cm−1 at the QY maxima, whereas for the fluorescence experiments, an absorbance if ≤0.1 cm−1 was used. The low temperature measurements were performed in an Utreks helium flow cryostat (5 K) or in an Oxford liquid nitrogen bath cryostat (77 K). Absorption spectra at 5 K were recorded in a home-built setup equipped with a 150-watt tungsten-halogen lamp, a monochromator, and a photodiode detector. The spectra were recorded using lock-in detection with 1-nm spectral resolution. Absorption spectra at 77 K were recorded in a PerkinElmer Lambda 40 UV-visible spectrophotometer with 1-nm spectral resolution. Fluorescence spectra at 77 K were recorded in a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3-11 fluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 488 nm (10-nm full-width half-maximum), and the spectral resolution was 1 nm. The fluorescence quantum yield was estimated by integrating the total fluorescence and comparing with the known value of the fluorescence quantum yield for higher plant CP43 at room temperature (19Groot M.L. Frese R.N. de Weerd F.L. Bromek K. Pettersson A. Peterman E.J. van Stokkum I.H. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Biophys.

Plöscher M. Eichacker L.A. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 383: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For offline electrospray ionization MS, 20 μl of purified CP47-His and CP43-His complexes, respectively, were precipitated overnight in 80% (v/v) acetone/water at −20 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was air-dried. The dry pellet was dissolved in solution containing 70% (v/v) acetone, 19% (v/v) water, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, and 1% (v/v) formic acid. Dissolved proteins were directly applied to a nanospray emitter. Mass spectra were obtained using a Waters Q-Tof Premier spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source. For scanning LMM proteins, mass spectra at a mass range of 800–2500 m/z were acquired. Data were recorded at a capillary voltage of 0.8 kV and a cone voltage of 37 V. After MS data collection at a rate of 1 s/scan, scans were averaged. After acquisition of fragment ion spectra at a collision energy between 26 and 40 eV, data were analyzed using MassLynx/BioLynx 4.1 software. Sequence tags obtained from the fragment spectra were used for similarity search (EMBL-EBI Data Bank). The samples were analyzed in several repetitions. The low abundance of PSII assembly intermediates in WT Synechocystis 6803 is a major barrier to their isolation. We have adopted a 3-fold approach to aid purification of unassembled CP47 and CP43 complexes. First, we incorporated His6-tags at the C terminus of each protein to allow purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Previous work has already shown that the presence of His-tags at these positions does not prevent assembly of active PSII (27Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Second, we blocked assembly of the PSII holoenzyme using a parental strain, ΔD1, which is unable to make the D1 reaction center subunit (8Komenda J. Reisinger V. Müller B.C. Dobáková M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and finally, in the case of CP47, we also inactivated the membrane-bound FtsH2 protease (Slr0228), which leads to elevated levels of unassembled PSII subunits, including the CP47 apopolypeptide, in the ΔD1 strain (17Komenda J. Barker M. Kuviková S. de Vries R. Mullineaux C.W. Tichy M. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1145-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Construction and validation of the ΔD1/CP43-His and ΔD1/CP47-His/ΔFtsH2 strains are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The CP43-His and CP47-His complexes were successfully purified from detergent-solubilized thylakoid membranes by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (supplemental Fig. 1). Small amounts of residual high molecular mass contaminants were removed by a subsequent size exclusion chromatography step (Fig. 1, A and B). Both CP47-His and CP43-His were largely monodisperse as assessed by BN-PAGE (Fig. 1C). SDS-PAGE combined with immunoblot analyses confirmed the purity of each preparation and the presence of His-tagged CP47 and CP43 (Fig. 1D). In the case of CP47-His, we were also able to detect the presence of PsbH, a neighboring low molecular mass subunit in the PSII holoenzyme (Fig. 1D). Co-purification of PsbH and CP47-His was further demonstrated by two-dimensional BN-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 2). Together, these data confirm earlier conclusions that CP47 and PsbH are capable of forming a complex at an early stage in PSII assembly (25Komenda J. Tichý M. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the absence of D1, the D2 reaction center subunit, which interacts with CP47 in the holoenzyme, was also detected in the CP47-His complex, albeit at substoichiometric levels (Fig. 1D). Analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of PsbH and also identified PsbL and PsbT (Table 1). In the case of CP43-His, low levels of a CP43 degradation product were detected by immunoblotting (designated by an asterisk in Fig. 1D) (data not shown), and the PsbK and Psb30/Ycf12 subunits were identified by mass spectrometry (Table 1).TABLE 1LMM proteins detected in CP43-His and CP47-His complexes by mass spectrometryGeneAccession numberDetected signals (charge state)De novo sequenced protein fragmentTotal sequence coverage%CP47-His complexPsbHP14835998.56 ([M + 6H]6+)PVMGVFMALFLVFL381001.57 ([M + 6H]6+)PVMGVFMALFLVFL1003.85([M + 6H]6+)MGVFMALFLVFLL1004.70 ([M + 6H]6+)TPVMGVFMALFLVF1006.99 ([M + 6H]6+)VPGWGTTPVMGVFMA1171.16 ([M + 5H]5+)TTPVMGVFMALFLVFLLII1397.41 ([M + 5H]5+)GTTPVMGVFMALFLVFLPsbLQ553541118.64 ([M + 4H]4+)LLVAVLGILFSSYF361246.45 ([M + 3H]3+)LLLVAVLGIPsbTP74787892.53 ([M + 4H]4+)LVLTMALAVLF521189.33 ([M + 3H]3+)SVAYILVLTCP43-His complexPsbKP736761050.15 ([M + 4H]4+)YQIFDPLVDVL241055.64 ([M + 4H]4+)DPLVDVLPsb30/Ycf12Q554381202.76 ([M + 3H]3+)IVLAG13 Open table in a new tab A notable feature of both the CP47-His and CP43-His complexes was the presence of bound pigment. Reverse-phase HPLC pigment analyses confirmed the presence of both Chl a and β-carotene in CP47-His and CP43-His complexes (supplemental Fig. 3), with Chl/carotenoid ratios of ∼7.7 for CP47-His and 5.0 for CP43-His. The wavelengths of maximum absorption in the red region (λmax) measured at room temperature were 674 nm for CP47-His and 671 nm for CP43-His (Fig. 2A), close to the values reported for CP47 and CP43 isolated by fragmentation of larger complexes (13Alfonso M. Montoya G. Cases R. Rodríguez R. Picorel R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10494-10500Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The relative amplitudes of the Soret and carotenoid absorption bands in the room temperature absorption spectra for CP47-His and CP43-His were also quite similar to their spinach counterparts (Fig. 3), consistent with similar Chl/carotenoid ratios in each type of complex.FIGURE 3Comparison of the room temperature absorption spectra of CP43-His and CP47-His isolated from Synechocystis 6803 and CP43 and CP47 isolated from spinach.

In the Chl Soret region, the spectral shape is almost identical for both inner antenna complexes, with two bands at 416 and 436 nm identical in value to their spinach counterparts. The carotenoid absorption bands for CP47-His are at 469 and 502 nm (467 and 502 nm for spinach CP47), and those for CP43-His are at 467 and 499 nm (462 and 497 nm for spinach CP43). Fig. 2B (inset) shows an enlargement of the Chl QY absorption region. For CP47-His, the absorption spectrum showed two bands at 668 and 676 nm and a shoulder around 683 nm. The absorption red tail extends to 700 nm, suggesting the presence of a spectral component in the red edge of the spectrum (also observed for spinach at 690 nm). Overall, when comparing CP47-His from Synechocystis 6803 with spinach CP47, the spectral shapes show some differences in positions and relative amplitude, such as stronger and weaker absorptions for the cyanobacterial inner antenna protein around 667 nm and in the red edge, respectively. For CP43-His, the absorption spectra show a broad maximum at 668.5 nm, two shoulders at 673 and 679 nm, and a narrow band at 684.5 nm. The absorption spectra of the spinach CP43 inner antenna (19Groot M.L. Frese R.N. de Weerd F.L. Bromek K. Pettersson A. Peterman E.J. van Stokkum I.H. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Biophys.

Fig. 4 shows the absorption and fluorescence spectra at 77 K normalized to a value of 1 at the absorption and fluorescence maxima for CP47 (Fig. 4A) and CP43 (Fig. 4B) from Synechocystis 6803 and spinach to facilitate the comparison of their respective spectral shapes. The second derivatives of the absorption (multiplied by −4) are displayed to identify the spectral components present in the spectra. For CP47, the second derivatives of the absorption spectra show differences at wavelengths shorter than 675 nm, with maxima at 658.5 and 667 nm for Synechocystis 6803 and 660 and 670.5 nm f"

These enzymes are organized into sequence-, mechanism-, and structure-based families. Genomic data have shown that several organisms that degrade the plant cell wall contain a large number of genes encoding family 43 (GH43) glycoside hydrolases. Here we report the biochemical properties of the GH43 enzymes of a saprophytic soil bacterium, Cellvibrio japonicus, and a human colonic symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The data show that C. japonicus uses predominantly exo-acting enzymes to degrade arabinan into arabinose, whereas B. thetaiotaomicron deploys a combination of endo- and side chain-cleaving glycoside hydrolases. Both organisms, however, utilize an arabinan-specific α-1,2-arabinofuranosidase in the degradative process, an activity that has not previously been reported. The enzyme can cleave α-1,2-arabinofuranose decorations in single or double substitutions, the latter being recalcitrant to the action of other arabinofuranosidases. The crystal structure of the C. japonicus arabinan-specific α-1,2-arabinofuranosidase, CjAbf43A, displays a five-bladed β-propeller fold. The specificity of the enzyme for arabinan is conferred by a surface cleft that is complementary to the helical backbone of the polysaccharide. The specificity of CjAbf43A for α-1,2-l-arabinofuranose side chains is conferred by a polar residue that orientates the arabinan backbone such that O2 arabinose decorations are directed into the active site pocket. A shelflike structure adjacent to the active site pocket accommodates O3 arabinose side chains, explaining how the enzyme can target O2 linkages that are components of single or double substitutions.

Plant cell walls comprise a diverse repertoire of chemically complex polysaccharides (1Burton R.A. Gidley M.J. Fincher G.B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The microbial degradation of these composite structures, which is mediated by an extensive repertoire of hydrolytic enzymes, is of considerable biological and industrial significance. Not only is the release of soluble sugars, principally monosaccharides, from the plant cell wall required to maintain microbial ecosystems, but the volatile fatty acids generated by these microbiota are essential nutrients for higher order organisms, such as mammalian herbivores (2Hooper L.V. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Within an industrial context, the microbial enzymes that catalyze this process are integral to the exploitation of lignocellulose as an environmentally sustainable substrate for the biofuel and bioprocessing industries (3Himmel M.E. Bayer E.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2009; 20: 316-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Himmel M.E. Ding S.Y. Johnson D.K. Adney W.S. Nimlos M.R. Brady J.W. Foust T.D. Science. 2007; 315: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). An important limitation in the industrial exploitation of lignocellulose is the cost of the pretreatment process, reflecting the low activity displayed by the degradative enzymes against cell wall structures. This reflects, in part, the chemical complexity of the plant cell wall, particularly within the pectin group of polysaccharides (5Caffall K.H. Mohnen D. Carbohydr. Res. 2009; 344: 1879-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). There is, therefore, an urgent need to discover glycoside hydrolases that exhibit novel activities against these complex structural polysaccharides. Such enzymes will not only have the potential to contribute to the degradative process but will also be useful reagents with which to probe the molecular architecture of cell walls. Within the plant cell wall, cellulose fibers are cross-linked with hemicellulosic and pectic polysaccharides (1Burton R.A. Gidley M.J. Fincher G.B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The backbones of these matrix polysaccharides are often decorated with arabinofuranose-containing side chains. For example, rhamnogalacturonan I is a pectic polysaccharide found in primary cell walls, which plays an important role in plant cell growth and tissue development. Rhamnogalacturonan I contains a backbone of the repeating disaccharide 4-α-d-galacturonic acid-1,2-α-l-rhamnose-1, which is extensively decorated with a variety of oligosaccharides, of which arabinan is the most abundant (5Caffall K.H. Mohnen D. Carbohydr. Res. 2009; 344: 1879-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Arabinan consists of an α-1,5-l-arabinofuranose backbone that is heavily substituted with α-1,3-l-arabinofuranose and/or α-1,2-l-arabinofuranose side chains (5Caffall K.H. Mohnen D. Carbohydr. Res. 2009; 344: 1879-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The β-1,4-xylose backbone of the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide in cereals, arabinoxylan, is also extensively decorated at O2 and/or O3 with single arabinofuranose units (6Gruppen H. Kormelink F.J. Voragen A.G. J. Cereal Sci. 1993; 18: 111-128Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Within the CAZy data base, glycoside hydrolases are grouped into families based on sequence, structural, and mechanistic similarities (7Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). Enzymes that hydrolyze arabinofuranose-linked glycosidic bonds are predominantly located in glycoside hydrolase families GH43, GH51, GH54, and GH62 (7Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). Of particular note is GH43, which, in addition to containing arabinofuranosidases and arabinanases (8Fujimoto Z. Ichinose H. Maehara T. Honda M. Kitaoka M. Kaneko S. J. Biol.

Navarro A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7705-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing feature of several organisms, which utilize the plant cell wall as an important nutrient, is that their genomes encode a large number of GH43 enzymes. For example the soil saprophyte Cellvibrio japonicus, which degrades all of the major components of the cell wall, contains 14 genes encoding GH43 enzymes (14DeBoy R.T. Mongodin E.F. Fouts D.E. Tailford L.E. Khouri H. Emerson J.B. Mohamoud Y. Watkins K. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Nelson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), whereas Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a human colonic symbiont that targets pectins and mammalian glycans, has the genetic capacity to synthesize 33 different GH43 hydrolases (15Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L.K. Chiang H.C. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Science. 2003; 299: 2074-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Superficially, GH43 appears to contain relatively few enzyme activities, and thus the biological rationale for the expansion of this family in certain organisms is unclear. It is likely, however, that GH43 arabinofuranosidases may target different hemicellulosic and pectic polysaccharides. Here we have explored the range of activities displayed by the C. japonicus and B. thetaiotaomicron GH43 enzymes against arabinose-containing polysaccharides. The data underline the different strategies used by the two microorganisms to degrade arabinan. A common feature of the two systems is an arabinan-specific α-1,2-arabinofuranosidase, an activity that has not previously been reported. It is likely that the primary role of the enzyme is to target O2-linked arabinose residues that are components of double substitutions. The crystal structure of the C. japonicus arabinan-specific α-1,2-arabinofuranosidase, CjAbf43A, reveals a curved substrate binding cleft that accommodates the helical structure of the arabinan backbone. The active site, which comprises a deep pocket in the middle of the cleft, displays considerable conservation with other GH43 exo-acting enzymes. Asn165, located in the +1 subsite, in combination with aromatic residues, appear to orientate the polysaccharide chain such that the O2 arabinose decoration is housed in the active site. Thus, the shape of the cleft, in combination with specific interactions with the arabinan backbone, confers the specificity displayed by this novel enzyme. The genes encoding the mature forms (lacking their signal peptides) of the C. japonicus and B. thetaiotaomicron GH43 enzymes were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA with the thermostable DNA polymerase Kod and the primers listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. The PCR products were cloned into the expression vectors pRSET, pET21d, pET22b, pET28b, and pET32b to generate the plasmids listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. All of the recombinant enzymes contained either a His6 tag or were fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). Escherichia coli BL21 or Tuner cells, transformed with the relevant plasmid, were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C to midexponential phase (A600 = 0.6). Recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for a further 12 h at 16 °C. Cell-free extracts were prepared as described previously (16Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and proteins with a His6 tag were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) using TalonTM resin and eluted with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 100 mm imidazole. Proteins fused to GST were purified using a glutathione resin and eluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Enzymes used in biochemical assays were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Proteins destined for crystallographic analysis were subjected to further purification on a 26/60 S75 Superdex gel filtration column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the purified protein were pooled and dialyzed against ultrapure water. To produce a selenomethionine derivative of CjAbf43A, the E. coli methionine auxotroph B834 (DE3) containing pAC12 (encodes CjAbf43A) was cultured as described previously (16Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the arabinofuranosidase was purified by IMAC and gel filtration as described above, except that the buffers were supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 10 mm dl- dithiothreitol, respectively. The purified protein was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm dl-dithiothreitol. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using pAC12 as the template and the primer pairs listed in supplemental Table S3. The substrates 4-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside (4NPA) 3The abbreviations used are: 4NPA4-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranosideHPAEChigh performance anion exchange chromatography. and sugar beet arabinan were purchased from Sigma and Megazyme, respectively. Assays in which 4NPA was the substrate were monitored by the release of 4-nitrophenolate at a wavelength of 400 nm. The product was quantified using a molar extinction coefficient of 10,500 m−1 cm−1. When using polysaccharides such as arabinan as the substrate, arabinose release was monitored using galactose dehydrogenase (Megazyme), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of galactose/arabinose with concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH (17Melrose J. Sturgeon R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 118: 247-253Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The concentration of NADH generated was quantified by measuring ΔA340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6230 m−1 cm−1. All reactions were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C for the C. japonicus enzymes and at 37 °C for the B. thetaiotaomicron enzymes. For pH optima assays, a range of different buffers were used. Assays were monitored discontinuously, and time points were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 500 mm Na2CO3. The addition of Na2CO3 raises the pH to 11, where 4-nitrophenolate has an extinction coefficient of 24,150 m−1 cm−1. Reducing sugar assays were carried out using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid according to Ref. 18Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (22220) Google Scholar. At various time points, a 500-μl aliquot of the reaction was taken and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent. After boiling for 20 min, the A575 nm values were determined and compared with a standard curve of arabinose. The enzymes used in these assays contained their respective His6 or GST tags. All enzyme assays were carried out in triplicate, and the S.E. is reported for the individual kinetic parameters. 4-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside high performance anion exchange chromatography. Oligosaccharides and monosaccharides, derived from polysaccharide hydrolysis by either enzymatic or acid treatment, were analyzed using a CARBOPACTM PA-100 anion exchange column (Dionex) equipped with a CARBOPACTM PA-100 guard column. The fully automated system (LC25 chromatography oven, GP40 gradient pump, ED40 electrochemical detector, and AS40 autosampler) had a loop size of 200 μl and flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, with sugars detected by pulsed amperometric detection. The pulsed amperometric detection settings were as follows: E1 = +0.05, E2 = +0.6, and E3 = −0.6. Typical elution conditions were as follows: 0–5 min, 66 mm NaOH; 5–30 min, 66 mm NaOH with a 0–75 mm sodium acetate linear gradient; 30–40 min, 500 mm sodium acetate in 66 mm NaOH; 40–50 min, 500 mm sodium hydroxide; and then 50–60 min, 66 mm NaOH. Appropriate oligosaccharides were used as standards at a concentration of 50 μm. Samples to be analyzed were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Data were collected and manipulated using the ChromeleonTM chromatography management system version 6.8 (Dionex) via a ChromeleonTM Server (Dionex). Final graphs were drawn with Prism 4.02 (GraphPad). TLC plates (silica gel 60, 20 × 20, Merck) spotted with samples (two 1-μl drops) were run in 1-butanol/acetic acid/water in a ratio of 2:1:1 (v/v/v). Visualization of migrated sugars was achieved by immersing the TLC plates in developer (sulfuric acid/ethanol/water (3:70:20, v/v/v), orcinol (0.1%)) for 1–2 s. Plates were again dried and heated between 80 and 100 °C. Arabinooligosaccharides were prepared for NMR analysis by the controlled acid hydrolysis of sugar beet arabinan. HCl was added to 10 ml of a 30 mg/ml solution of sugar beet arabinan to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the solution was boiled for 30 min. The reaction was then put on ice and neutralized with 500 μl of 1 m NaOH. The large polymers in the mixture were precipitated in 80% (v/v) ethanol, and the arabinooligosaccharide-containing supernatant was vacuum-dried. The arabinan oligosaccharides were dissolved in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at 5 mg/ml and incubated for 60 min in the presence and absence of 10 μm CjAbf43A at 25 °C. After the incubation, the whole reaction without separation of the reaction products or the enzyme was lyophilized. The dried material was dissolved in D2O (99.9%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), and 1H and 13C NMR two-dimensional spectra were recorded with a Varian Inova NMR spectrometer operating at 600 MHz and with a sample temperature of 298 K. Gradient versions of COSY, heteronuclear single quantum coherence, and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence experiments were recorded using standard Varian pulse programs. Heteronuclear spectra were recorded with 512 × 512 complex points. These data were processed typically with zero filling to obtain a 1024 × 1024 matrix. Chemical shifts were measured relative to internal acetone (δH 2.225, δC 30.89). Data were processed using MestRe-C software (Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Spain). A selenomethionine derivative of CjAbf43A in ultrapure water was crystallized at 30 mg/ml in 1.5 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Crystals, which grew overnight at 20 °C, were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution of the crystallization condition supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol. Native protein in water was crystallized at 10 mg/ml in 13% PEG 3350 and 150 mm sodium acetate at 20 °C, with crystals reaching maximum size in 4 weeks. The purified catalytic base mutant was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium chloride and crystallized at 20 mg/ml in the presence of 20 mm arabinotetraose in 20% PEG 3350 and 200 mm ammonium tartrate at 20 °C, with crystals growing over a 2-month period. These two crystal forms were cryoprotected with the addition of 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol to the respective crystallization conditions. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen, and diffraction data, for the native arabinofuranosidase and the enzyme-ligand complex, were collected at Diamond Light Source on beamline I02 and at the Advanced Photon Source on beamline 22-BM, respectively. Because no appropriate molecular replacement model was available for CjAbf43A in the Protein Data Bank, the structure was solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion using the selenomethionine derivative. A fluorescence energy scan was performed around the selenium K atomic absorption edge of 12.658 keV, confirming the presence of selenomethionine in the sample, and a single wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected at the optimal peak wavelength of 0.979 Å. The data were integrated using iMosflm (19Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography Number 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and scaled and merged in Scala (20Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). The single wavelength anomalous dispersion data set had an overall anomalous correlation of 0.31. The scaled data were input into the SHELX C/D/E pipeline (21Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80563) Google Scholar) for experimental phasing, where the anomalous signal, as indicated by the 〈d“/sig〉 statistics, was 3.3 in the resolution shell up to 8 Å and was 0.98 in the highest resolution shell, between 3.2 and 3.0 Å. In total, 30 selenium atom positions were identified, and phasing and density modification unambiguously determined the hand of the data to generate an interpretable initial electron density map. The initial phases were improved through the use of solvent flattening and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, with operators determined from the selenium positions, with DM (22Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). An initial model was automatically built with ARP/wARP (23Langer G. Cohen S.X. Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Nature Protocols. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) and was extended and refined using Buccaneer (24Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1993; 49: 148-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This model had an Rcryst of 0.200 and Rfree of 0.236 and was used as a molecular replacement model for the native high resolution data set. The native and the D41A ligand-enzyme complex data were integrated using iMosflm (19Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography Number 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and scaled and merged with Scala (20Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). The scaled data for the two crystal forms were input into Phaser (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14444) Google Scholar), and the structures were solved by molecular replacement using the selenomethionine structure as the search model. Refinement of all structures was performed using Refmac5 (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar) and phenix.refine (27Zwart P.H. Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. McKee E. Moriarty N.W.

Nature Protocols. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) and checked manually. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. It should be noted that the D41A mutation introduces a dual conformation of His267. One of these conformations, with a χ1 angle of −65°, points toward the bound oligosaccharide and is stabilized in this position by the presence of a solute network that coincides spatially with the other rotamer position of His267 (χ1 = −161°), which is oriented away from the oligosaccharide. In the apo structure, His267 adopts a single conformation. Interestingly, a related GH43 enzyme, PDB entry 3C7G, contains a bound sodium ion in a similar location, but our diffraction data do not permit the exact identification of the bound solutes for rigorous alternative chemical occupancy refinement, and the deposited model coordinates do not include this partially occupied solute constellation.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsSelenomethionineNativeD41A-LigandData collectionData collection wavelength (Å)0.980.971.00Space groupP41212P21P41212Unit cell parameters (Å)a = b = 192.65, c = 132.5a = 47.29, b = 139.27, c = 50.46a = b = 85.64, c = 195.65Unit cell parameters (degrees)β = 116.0Resolution (Å)72.17-2.99 (3.15-2.99)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.36.29-1.64 (1.73-1.64)44.73-1.79 (1.89-1.79)No. of observations728,565260,1481,008,728No. of unique reflections50,82971,48869,576Mean I/σI14.9 (5.2)11.5 (4.1)16 (5.4)Rmerge0.22 (0.57)0.10 (0.40)0.11 (0.50)Ranom0.07 (0.29)--Completeness (%)100 (100)99.8 (100)100 (100)Anomalous completeness (%)100 (100)--Multiplicity14.3 (14.7)3.6 (3.7)14.5 (14.5)RefinementRwork/Rfree0.200/0.2360.153/0.1840.169/0.198Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0110.0100.007Bond angles (degrees)1.351.2261.142Ramachandran plotbRamachandran statistics generated using molprobity.Favored (%)94.796.596.3Allowed (%)99.999.7100Mean B-factorWilson B (Å2)51.511.2026.50Main chain (Å2)21.039.6024.77Side chain (Å2)21.8210.1828.25Ligand/water (Å2)−/−−/22.0035.33/36.38Protein Data Bank codes3QED3QEE3QEFa Values in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.b Ramachandran statistics generated using molprobity.

To explore the relationship between the genetic potential of C. japonicus and B. thetaiotaomicron to synthesize GH43 enzymes, and the capacity of the organisms to metabolize arabinose-containing complex carbohydrates, the genes encoding the GH43 proteins were expressed in E. coli. In total, 23 of the 33 B. thetaiotaomicron and 11 of the 14 C. japonicus GH43 proteins were produced in soluble form and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity (data not shown). The ORF nomenclature used herein corresponds to that adopted in the annotation of the two genomes (14DeBoy R.T. Mongodin E.F. Fouts D.E. Tailford L.E. Khouri H. Emerson J.B. Mohamoud Y. Watkins K.

The catalytic activity of the GH43 proteins was assessed using 4NPA and a range of arabinose-containing polysaccharides (and oligosaccharides), including wheat and rye arabinoxylan, sugar beet, linear arabinan, and debranched rhamnogalacturonan I. The data, summarized in supplemental Tables S4 and S5, show that six enzymes, three from both B. thetaiotaomicron and C. japonicus, displayed significant 4NPAase activity, two B. thetaiotaomicron enzymes displayed endo-arabinanase activity, and two C. japonicus GH43 proteins were shown to function as exo-α-1,5-arabinofuranosidases (and also hydrolyzed 4NPA). A single β-xylosidase, CJA_3070 from C. japonicus, was identified. Finally, an enzyme, common to B. thetaiotaomicron and C. japonicus, Bt0369 and CJA_3018, respectively (designated hereafter as CjAbf43A), hydrolyzed 4NPA and released arabinose from sugar beet arabinan but was not significantly active against linear arabinan or any of the other polysaccharides tested (Table 2 and supplemental Tables S4 and S5).TABLE 2Kinetic properties of C. japonicus and B. thetaiotaomicron.

https://openalex.org/W2091698669,"TRPV4 (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4) channels are activated by a wide range of stimuli, including hypotonic stress, non-noxious heat and mechanical stress and some small molecule agonists (e.g. phorbol ester 4α-PDD). GSK1016790A (GSK101) is a recently discovered specific small molecule agonist of TRPV4. Its effects on physical determinants of TRPV4 activity were evaluated in HeLa cells transiently transfected with TRPV4 (HeLa-TRPV4). GSK101 (10 nM) causes a TRPV4 specific Ca2+ influx in HeLa-TRPV4 cells, but not in control transfected cells, which can be inhibited by ruthenium red and Ca2+-free medium more significantly at the early stage of the activation rather than the late stage, reflecting apparent partial desensitization. Western blot analysis showed that GSK101 activation did not induce an increase in TRPV4 expression at the plasma membrane, but caused an immediate and sustained downregulation of TRPV4 on the plasma membrane in HeLa-TRPV4 cells. Patch clamp analysis also revealed an early partial desensitization of the channel which was Ca2+-independent. FRET analysis of TRPV4 subunit assembly demonstrated that the GSK101-induced TRPV4 channel activation/desensitization was not due to alterations in homotetrameric channel formation on the plasma membrane. It is concluded that GSK101 specifically activates TRPV4 channels, leading to a rapid partial desensitization and downregulation of the channel expression on the plasma membrane. TRPV4 subunit assembly appears to occur during trafficking from the ER/Golgi to the plasma membrane and is not altered by agonist stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2088622428,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) arises from the thyroid follicular epithelium and represents the most frequent thyroid malignancy. PTC is associated with gene rearrangements generating RET/PTC and TRK oncogenes, and to the BRAFV600E activating point mutation. A role of tumor-suppressor genes in the pathogenesis of PTC has not been assessed yet. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3) gene, encoding a metalloproteinases inhibitor and capable of inhibiting growth, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of several cancers, was found to be silenced by promoter methylation in a consistent fraction of PTCs, in association with tumor aggressiveness and BRAFV600E mutation, thus suggesting an oncosuppressor role. To explore this possibility, in this study we performed gene expression and functional studies. Analysis of gene expression data produced in our laboratory as well as meta-analysis of publicly available data sets confirmed the downregulation of TIMP3 gene expression in PTC with respect to normal thyroid. The functional consequences of TIMP3 downregulation were investigated in the PTC-derived NIM1 cell line, in which the expression of TIMP3 is silenced. Restoration of TIMP3 expression by exposure to soluble TIMP3 protein or by complementary DNA transfection had no effect on the growth rate of NIM1 cells. Instead, it affected the adhesive, migratory and invasive capabilities of NIM1 cells by modulating several proteins involved in these processes. A striking effect was observed in vivo, as TIMP3 reduced the tumorigenicity of NIM1 cells by repressing angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration. Our data indicate that the loss of TIMP3 expression exerts a functional role in the pathogenesis of PTC."
https://openalex.org/W2021028892,"Tumor protein 53 induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1) is a p53 target gene that induces cell growth arrest and apoptosis by modulating p53 transcriptional activity. TP53INP1 interacts physically with p53 and is a major player in the p53-driven oxidative stress response. Previously, we demonstrated that TP53INP1 is downregulated in an early stage of pancreatic cancerogenesis and when restored is able to suppress pancreatic tumor development. TP53INP1 downregulation in pancreas is associated with an oncogenic microRNA miR-155. In the present work, we studied the effects of TP53INP1 on cell migration. We found that TP53INP1 inactivation correlates with increased cell migration both in vivo and in vitro. The impact of TP53INP1 expression on cell migration was studied in different cellular contexts: mouse embryonic fibroblast and different pancreatic cancer cell lines. Its expression decreases cell migration by the transcriptional downregulation of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). SPARC is a matrix cellular protein, which governs diverse cellular functions and has a pivotal role in regulating cell-matrix interactions, cellular proliferation and migration. SPARC was also showed to be upregulated in normal pancreas and in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions in a pancreatic adenocarcinoma mouse model only in the TP53INP1-deficient animals. This novel TP53INP1 activity on the regulation of SPARC expression could explain in part its tumor suppressor function in pancreatic adenocarcinoma by modulating cellular spreading during the metastatic process."

Current surveillance systems describe general risk of tuberculosis in a population but do not characterize the risk to an individual following exposure to an infectious case. Methods In a study of household contacts of infectious tuberculosis cases (n = 1918) and a community survey of tuberculosis infection (N = 1179) in Kampala, Uganda, we estimated the secondary attack rate for tuberculosis disease and tuberculosis infection. The ratio of these rates is the likelihood of progressive primary disease after recent household infection. Results The secondary attack rate for tuberculosis disease was 3.0% (95% confidence interval: 2.2, 3.8). The overall secondary attack rate for tuberculosis infection was 47.4 (95% confidence interval: 44.3, 50.6) and did not vary widely with age, HIV status or BCG vaccination. The risk for progressive primary disease was highest among the young or HIV infected and was reduced by BCG vaccination. Conclusions Early case detection and treatment may limit household transmission of M. tuberculosis. Household members at high risk for disease should be protected through vaccination or treatment of latent tuberculosis infection."

Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is validated in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Because angiogenesis is a pathological hallmark of portal hypertension, the goal of our study was to determine the effect of sorafenib on portal venous flow and portosystemic collateral circulation in patients receiving sorafenib therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Porto-collateral circulations were evaluated using a magnetic resonance technique prior sorafenib therapy, and at day 30. All patients under sorafenib therapy had a decrease in portal venous flow of at least 36%. In contrast, no specific change was observed in the azygos vein or the abdominal aorta. No portal venous flow modification was observed in the control group. Sorafenib is the first anti-angiogenic therapy to demonstrate a beneficial and reversible decrease of portal venous flow among cirrhotic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2143665560,"Inhibition plays an essential role in shaping and refining the brain's representation of sensory stimulus attributes. In primary auditory cortex (A1), so-called ""sideband"" inhibition helps to sharpen the tuning of local neuronal responses. Several distinct types of anatomical circuitry could underlie sideband inhibition, including direct thalamocortical (TC) afferents, as well as indirect intracortical mechanisms. The goal of the present study was to characterize sideband inhibition in A1 and to determine its mechanism by analyzing laminar profiles of neuronal ensemble activity. Our results indicate that both lemniscal and nonlemniscal TC afferents play a role in inhibitory responses via feedforward inhibition and oscillatory phase reset, respectively. We propose that the dynamic modulation of excitability in A1 due to the phase reset of ongoing oscillations may alter the tuning of local neuronal ensembles and can be regarded as a flexible overlay on the more obligatory system of lemniscal feedforward type responses."
https://openalex.org/W2088256842,"Understanding the heterogeneous genetic mechanisms of tumor initiation in lymphoid leukemias (LL) will lead to improvements in prognostic classification and treatment regimens. In previous studies of mouse leukemias, we showed that retroviral insertion at the ecotropic viral insertion site 32 locus leads to increased expression of Prdm14, a pluripotency gene implicated in the self-renewal capacity of embryonic stem cells and the early stages of breast cancer. Here, we show that PRDM14 is also overexpressed in ∼25% of human lymphoid neoplasms, with increased frequencies in T-cell acute LL and hyperdiploid precursor B-cell acute LL. To test if Prdm14 overexpression could initiate leukemia, mice were transduced with bone marrow cells transfected with a Prdm14 expression vector. LLs developed in 96% of female mice and 42% of male mice. Before the onset of leukemia, differentiation of transduced cells was biased up to 1000-fold toward cells with features of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), and lymphoid differentiation showed a relative block at the pro-B stage. Microarray gene expression analysis of expanded CLP-like cells before the onset of leukemia demonstrated upregulation of genes involved in pluripotency, tumor initiation, early B-lineage commitment, Wnt/Ras signaling and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Among the dysregulated genes were imprinted genes and non-coding RNAs including Dlk1 and Meg3, which are also key pluripotency mediators. Heightened expression of the estrogen-dependent oncogene, Myb, in tumors suggests a basis for the increased frequency of cancer in female mice. These data provide the first direct evidence for the association of Prdm14 with cancer initiation in an in vivo mouse model and in human lymphoid malignancies, while suggesting mechanisms for Prdm14's mode of action."
https://openalex.org/W1985754002,"DNA-damaging therapies represent a keystone in cancer treatment. Unfortunately, many tumors often relapse because of a group of cancer cells, which are resistant to conventional therapies. High-mobility group A (HMGA) proteins has a key role in cell transformation, and their overexpression is a common feature of human malignant neoplasias, representing a poor prognostic index often correlated to anti-cancer drug resistance. Our previous results demonstrated that HMGA1 is a substrate of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the main cellular sensor of genotoxic stress. Here we also report thatHMGA2, the other member of the HMGA family, is a novel substrate of ATM. Interestingly, we found that HMGA proteins positively regulate ATM gene expression. Moreover, induction of ATM kinase activity by DNA-damaging agents enhances HMGA-dependent transcriptional activation of ATM promoter, suggesting that ATM expression is modulated by a DNA-damage- and HMGA-dependent positive feedback loop. Finally, inhibition of HMGA expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in cancer cells strongly reduces ATM protein levels, impairing the cellular DNA-damage response and enhancing the sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. These findings indicate this novel HMGA-ATM pathway as a new potential target to improve the effectiveness of conventional anti-neoplastic treatments on the genotoxic-drug resistant cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2087465861,"Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of macrophages in the arterial intima. The activated macrophages secreted more pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which promote the development of the disease. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major component of high density lipoprotein, is involved in reverse cholesterol transport of lipid metabolism. Recently, it has been found that apoA-I suppresses inflammation via repression of inflammatory cytokine expression; the mechanisms of the apoA-I-suppressive action, however, are not yet well characterized. In this study, we have for the first time found that apoA-I suppresses the expression of some inflammatory cytokines induced by lipopolysaccharide via a specific post-transcriptional regulation process, namely mRNA destabilization, in macrophages. Our further studies have also shown that AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of TNF-α mRNA are responsive to the apoA-I-mediated mRNA destabilization. The apoA-I-induced inflammatory cytokine mRNA destabilization was associated with increased expression of mRNA-destabilizing protein tristetraprolin through a JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway-dependent manner. When blocking interaction of apoA-I with ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), a major receptor for apoA-I in macrophages, it would almost totally abolish the effect of apoA-I on tristetraprolin expression.

The prevalence of obesity has risen considerably during recent decades in the Western world and is now a serious global health burden due to the many secondary complications and comorbidity associated with this condition such as increased susceptibility to cardiovascular events and aggravation of diabetes mellitus (1Fernstrom J.D.

Native 1321N1 cells did not respond to CLAs but were sensitive to stimulation with carbachol, a ligand for endogenously expressed Gq-coupled muscarinic receptors (supplemental Fig. 2). Having once responded to each individual CLA isomer or to the selective, small molecule FFA1 agonist TUG424 (17Christiansen E. Urban C. Merten N. Liebscher K. Karlsen K.K. Hamacher A. Spinrath A.

Chem. 2008; 51: 7061-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), FFA1-1321N1 cells did not show any significant increase in [Ca2+]i in response to a second CLA stimulus irrespective of whether pre-exposure times for the first stimulus were short (100 s, Fig. 1D) or long (50 min, supplemental Fig. 3). In the presence of a small molecule FFA1 antagonist (PPTQ, Ref. 22Humphries P.S. Benbow J.W. Bonin P.D. Boyer D. Doran S.D. Frisbie R.K. Piotrowski D.W. Balan G. Bechle B.M. Conn E.L. Dirico K.J.

Lett. 2009; 19: 2400-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), CLA-dependent Ca2+ mobilization was undetectable, further confirming the specific interaction between CLAs and the cell surface FFA1 receptor (Fig. 1E). The concomitant accumulation of inositol phosphates induced by CLAs in FFA1-1321N1 but not native 1321N1 cells further underlines the ability of CLAs to stimulate Gαq/11-coupled FFA1 signaling (Fig. 1F). Activation of FFA1 by CLAs could also be recapitulated in assays detecting DMR of cellular proteins with the holistic label-free Epic® optical biosensor technology.

As opposed to the more traditional biochemical assays that are designed to detect specific alterations of intracellular second messengers such as Ca2+ or cAMP, DMR technology collates receptor activity into a single optical readout that reflects an integrated cellular response akin to tissue bioassays (18Schröder R.

FFA1-HEK293 cells engineered to inducibly express FFA1 (Fig. 2, A and B) but not untransfected control cells (supplemental Fig. 4) responded with robust and concentration-dependent DMR signals to CLA challenge. Interestingly, both CLAs were markedly more efficacious than the small molecule FFA1 agonist TUG424 in DMR assays (compare Fig. 2, A and B with Fig. 2, C and D), a feature that was not observed in the single component functional assays based on the detection of changes in intracellular Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. 5). Both CLA isomers were inactive on the two other fatty acid-binding G protein-coupled receptors, FFA2 and FFA3, respectively, which are also expressed in pancreatic β-cells (27Kebede M.A. Alquier T. Latour M.G. Poitout V.

To define whether FFA1 ligation by CLAs is of physiological relevance, both isomers were examined for insulinotropic effects in the immortalized rat cell line INS-1E (Fig. 3A), which endogenously expresses the homologue of human FFA1 (32Schnell S. Schaefer M. Schöfl C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 263: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Both CLA isomers markedly enhanced GSIS at high but not at low glucose levels in an FFA1- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 6). In primary islets, isolated from 8–10 week-old wild type mice, CLA-mediated potentiation of GSIS was only detectable at high glucose levels (Fig. 3B). Importantly, however, this effect was blunted for the 9c, 11t-isomer or markedly reduced for the 10t, 12c-isomer in islets of the corresponding FFA1−/− littermates. These data suggest that CLA-mediated insulinotropic effects in vivo are specifically mediated through FFA1 and that 10t, 12c-CLA but not 9c, 11t-CLA acutely amplifies insulin secretion via an additional mechanism not involving FFA1. Modulation of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity has long been ascribed to CLAs and proposed to involve, at least in part, activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), which is a target for the potent insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drugs (5Pariza M.W.

Increased insulin-releasing capacity of pancreatic islets from CLA-fed mice has been disclosed (34Poirier H. Rouault C. Clément L. Niot I. Monnot M.C. Guerre-Millo M. Besnard P.

In this study, we present several lines of evidence that acute insulinotropic effects of CLAs are mediated via activation of the β-cell-specific G protein-coupled receptor FFA1, an emerging therapeutic target to treat type 2 diabetes (15Itoh Y.

First, increase of [Ca2+]i and inositol phosphate production in response to CLAs was consistently observed in FFA1-expressing cells regardless of the cellular background, whereas it was not observed in cells lacking FFA1. Second, Ca2+ mobilization was completely prevented by prior desensitization with the small molecule FFA1 agonist TUG424 or by pretreatment of cells with a specific FFA1 antagonist. Third, real time non-invasive holistic DMR measurements showed specific activation of FFA1 by CLAs. Together, these findings demonstrate a direct interaction between FFA1 and CLAs in vitro. Importantly, insulin secretion by CLAs could also be detected in isolated islets from wild type but was abolished or markedly reduced in islets from FFA1−/− mice, suggesting that FFA1 is implicated in CLA potentiation of GSIS also in vivo. At present, the clinical significance of the CLA-mediated FFA1 activation is unclear. In humans, basal plasma levels of CLAs are in the μm range (∼7–70 μm) (8Kennedy A. Martinez K. Schmidt S. Mandrup S. LaPoint K. McIntosh M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2010; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39Herbel B.K. McGuire M.K. McGuire M.A. Shultz T.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 67: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Daily supplementation with CLA in healthy human volunteers resulted in 3–4-fold increases in plasma CLA levels (40Doyle L.

Lipids. 2001; 36: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the fact that local tissue concentrations can easily reach levels 10-fold higher than plasma concentrations (42Miller A. Stanton C. Devery R. Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 3879-3887PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lai K.L. Torres-Duarte A.P. Vanderhoek J.Y. Lipids. 2005; 40: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the experimental CLA concentrations used herein should be both physiologically attainable and relevant. It is therefore conceivable that therapeutic concentrations of CLAs may likely be sufficient to activate FFA1 in vivo. This in turn raises the possibility that FFA1 is responsible for both acute insulinotropic effects but also development of diabetes after long term ingestion of CLAs, two observations that have been made in various clinical studies with oral CLA supplementation (8Kennedy A. Martinez K. Schmidt S. Mandrup S. LaPoint K. McIntosh M. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2010; 21: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 13Ahrén B. Mari A. Fyfe C.L. Tsofliou F. Sneddon A.A.

Nevertheless, these aspects are of prime importance to antidiabetic drug discovery because a potential contribution of FFA1 to β-cell dysfunction would disqualify FFA1 agonists as novel type 2 diabetes drugs. Because it is completely unresolved at present whether inhibition or activation of FFA1 constitutes the desired therapeutic strategy to treat type 2 diabetes (19Zhang X. Yan G. Li Y. Zhu W. Wang H. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2010; 64: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Alquier T. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1035-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is impossible to predict whether long term ingestion of CLAs will constitute a new avenue to combat this metabolic disorder or rather be detrimental to β-cell health. The clinical consequences of FFA1 stimulation by CLAs in humans remain largely to be elucidated, but our study presents unambiguous evidence that CLAs are highly efficacious agonists for FFA1 both in vitro and in vivo. We also provide novel mechanistic insights into the complex signaling behaviors of these pleiotropic lipid mediators and add, for the first time, a specific cell surface receptor to the list of molecular CLA targets, a finding with both clinical significance and great implication for the development of FFA1 modulators as a novel treatment for type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2048542797,"The B-cell translocation gene-2 (BTG2), a p53-inducible gene, is suppressed in mammary epithelial cells during gestation and lactation. In human breast cancer, decreased BTG2 expression correlates with high tumor grade and size, p53 status, blood and lymph vessel invasion, local and metastatic recurrence and decrease in overall survival, suggesting that suppression of BTG2 has a critical role in disease progression. To analyze the role of BTG2 in breast cancer progression, BTG2 expression was knocked down in mammary epithelial cells. Suppression of BTG2 enhances the motility of cells in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The effects of BTG2 knockdown are mediated through stabilization of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) ligands neuregulin and epiregulin and activation of the HER2 and HER3 receptors, leading to elevated AKT phosphorylation. Suppression of HER activation using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib abrogates the effects of BTG2 knockdown, including the increased cell migration observed in vitro and the enhancement of tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. These results link BTG2-dependent effects on tumor progression to ErbB receptor signaling, and raise the possibility that targeted inhibition of this pathway may be relevant in the treatment of breast cancers that have reduced BTG2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2068160889,"Background Nuclear receptors (NR) are a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that control a range of cellular processes. Persistent stimulation of some NR is a non-genotoxic mechanism of rodent liver cancer with unclear relevance to humans. Here we report on a systematic analysis of new in vitro human NR activity data on 309 environmental chemicals in relationship to their liver cancer-related chronic outcomes in rodents. Results The effects of 309 environmental chemicals on human constitutive androstane receptors (CAR/NR1I3), pregnane X receptor (PXR/NR1I2), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR/NR1C), liver X receptors (LXR/NR1H), retinoic X receptors (RXR/NR2B) and steroid receptors (SR/NR3) were determined using in vitro data. Hepatic histopathology, observed in rodents after two years of chronic treatment for 171 of the 309 chemicals, was summarized by a cancer lesion progression grade. Chemicals that caused proliferative liver lesions in both rat and mouse were generally more active for the human receptors, relative to the compounds that only affected one rodent species, and these changes were significant for PPAR (p0.001), PXR (p0.01) and CAR (p0.05). Though most chemicals exhibited receptor promiscuity, multivariate analysis clustered them into relatively few NR activity combinations. The human NR activity pattern of chemicals weakly associated with the severity of rodent liver cancer lesion progression (p0.05). Conclusions The rodent carcinogens had higher in vitro potency for human NR relative to non-carcinogens. Structurally diverse chemicals with similar NR promiscuity patterns weakly associated with the severity of rodent liver cancer progression. While these results do not prove the role of NR activation in human liver cancer, they do have implications for nuclear receptor chemical biology and provide insights into putative toxicity pathways. More importantly, these findings suggest the utility of in vitro assays for stratifying environmental contaminants based on a combination of human bioactivity and rodent toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2003998993,"Bacillus sphaericus strains that produce the binary toxin (Bin) are highly toxic to Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes, and have been used since the late 1980s as a biopesticide for the control of these vectors of infectious disease agents. The Bin toxin produced by these strains targets mosquito larval midgut epithelial cells where it binds to Cpm1 (Culex pipiens maltase 1) a digestive enzyme, and causes severe intracellular damage, including a dramatic cytoplasmic vacuolation. The intoxication of mammalian epithelial MDCK cells engineered to express Cpm1 mimics the cytopathologies observed in mosquito enterocytes following Bin ingestion: pore formation and vacuolation. In this study we demonstrate that Bin-induced vacuolisation is a transient phenomenon that affects autolysosomes. In addition, we show that this vacuolisation is associated with induction of autophagy in intoxicated cells. Furthermore, we report that after internalization, Bin reaches the recycling endosomes but is not localized either within the vacuolating autolysosomes or within any other degradative compartment. Our observations reveal that Bin elicits autophagy as the cell's response to intoxication while protecting itself from degradation through trafficking towards the recycling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2059346720,"Tyrosine O-sulfation is a post-translational modification catalyzed by two tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases (TPST-1 and TPST-2) in the trans-Golgi network. Tpst2-deficient mice have male infertility, sperm motility defects, and possible abnormalities in sperm-egg membrane interactions. Studies here show that compared with wild-type sperm, fewer Tpst2-null sperm bind to the egg membrane, but more of these bound sperm progress to membrane fusion. Similar outcomes were observed with wild-type sperm treated with the anti-sulfotyrosine antibody PSG2. The increased extent of sperm-egg fusion is not due to a failure of Tpst2-null sperm to trigger establishment of the egg membrane block to polyspermy. Anti-sulfotyrosine staining of sperm showed localization similar to that of IZUMO1, a sperm protein that is essential for gamete fusion, but we detected little to no tyrosine sulfation of IZUMO1 and found that IZUMO1 expression and localization were normal in Tpst2-null sperm. Turning to a discovery-driven approach, we used mass spectrometry to characterize sperm proteins that associated with PSG2. This identified ADAM6, a member of the A disintegrin and A metalloprotease (ADAM) family; members of this protein family are associated with multiple sperm functions. Subsequent studies revealed that Tpst2-null sperm lack ADAM6 and ADAM3. Loss of ADAM3 is strongly associated with male infertility and is observed in knockouts of male germ line-specific endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperones, raising the possibility that TPST-2 may function in quality control in the secretory pathway. These data suggest that TPST-2-mediated tyrosine O-sulfation participates in regulating the sperm surface proteome or membrane order, ultimately affecting male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2046079854,"A regulator of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), α4, has been implicated in a variety of functions that regulate many cellular processes. To explore the role of α4 in human cell transformation and tumorigenesis, we show that α4 is highly expressed in human cells transformed by chemical carcinogens including benzo(a)pyrene, aflatoxin B1, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, nickel sulfate and in several hepatic and lung cancer cell lines. In addition, overexpression of α4 was detected in 87.5% (74/80) of primary hepatocellular carcinomas, 84.0% (21/25) of primary lung cancers and 81.8% (9/11) of primary breast cancers, indicating that α4 is ubiquitously highly expressed in human cancer. Functional studies revealed that elevated α4 expression results in an increase in cell proliferation, promotion of cell survival and decreased PP2A-attributable activity. Importantly, ectopic expression of α4 permits non-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEKTER) and L02R cells to form tumors in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, we show that the highly expressed α4 in transformed cells or human tumors is not regulated by DNA hypomethylation. A microRNA, miR-34b, that suppresses the expression of α4 through specific binding to the 3′-untranslated region of α4 is downregulated in transformed or human lung tumors. Taken together, these observations identify that α4 possesses an oncogenic function. Reduction of PP2A activity due to an enhanced α4–PP2A interaction contributes directly to chemical carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973861460,"CD38, a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of intracellular Ca(2+) messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), is known to be expressed on platelets. However, the role of CD38 in platelets remains unclear. Our present results show that treatment of platelets with thrombin results in a rapid and sustained Ca(2+) signal, resulting from a coordinated interplay of Ca(2+)-mobilizing messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, cADPR, and NAADP. By dissecting the signaling pathway using various agents, we delineated that cADPR and NAADP are sequentially produced through CD38 internalization by protein kinase C via myosin heavy chain IIA following phospholipase C activation in thrombin-induced platelets. An inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist blocked the thrombin-induced formation of cADPR and NAADP as well as Ca(2+) signals. An indispensable response of platelets relying on cytosolic calcium is the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), which implicates platelet procoagulant activity. Scrutinizing this parameter reveals that CD38(+/+) platelets fully express PS on the surface when stimulated with thrombin, whereas this response was decreased on CD38(-/-) platelets. Similarly, PS exposure and Ca(2+) signals were attenuated when platelets were incubated with 8-bromo-cADPR, bafilomycin A1, and a PKC inhibitor. Furthermore, in vivo, CD38-deficient mice exhibited longer bleeding times and unstable formation of thrombus than wild type mice. These results demonstrate that CD38 plays an essential role in thrombin-induced procoagulant activity of platelets and hemostasis via Ca(2+) signaling mediated by its products, cADPR and NAADP."
https://openalex.org/W1978314610,"Although the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton has been shown to facilitate nuclear import of specific cancer-regulatory proteins including p53, retinoblastoma protein, and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), the MT association sequences (MTASs) responsible and the nature of the interplay between MT-dependent and conventional importin (IMP)-dependent nuclear translocation are unknown. Here we used site-directed mutagenesis, live cell imaging, and direct IMP and MT binding assays to map the MTAS of PTHrP for the first time, finding that it is within a short modular region (residues 82–108) that overlaps with the IMPβ1-recognized nuclear localization signal (residues 66–108) of PTHrP. Importantly, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments indicated that disruption of the MT network or mutation of the MTAS of PTHrP decreases the rate of nuclear import by 2-fold. Moreover, MTAS functions depend on mutual exclusivity of binding of PTHrP to MTs and IMPβ1 such that, following MT-dependent trafficking toward the nucleus, perinuclear PTHrP can be displaced from MTs by IMPβ1 prior to import into the nucleus. This is the first molecular definition of an MTAS that facilitates protein nuclear import as well as the first delineation of the mechanism whereby cargo is transferred directly from the cytoskeleton to the cellular nuclear import apparatus. The results have broad significance with respect to fundamental processes regulating cell physiology/transformation.

Moreover, MTAS functions depend on mutual exclusivity of binding of PTHrP to MTs and IMPβ1 such that, following MT-dependent trafficking toward the nucleus, perinuclear PTHrP can be displaced from MTs by IMPβ1 prior to import into the nucleus. This is the first molecular definition of an MTAS that facilitates protein nuclear import as well as the first delineation of the mechanism whereby cargo is transferred directly from the cytoskeleton to the cellular nuclear import apparatus. The results have broad significance with respect to fundamental processes regulating cell physiology/transformation.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 390-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Specific nuclear localizing proteins, such as PTHrP, appear to possess the ability to interact with MTs for facilitated transport through the cytoplasm prior to conventional IMP-dependent import through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus (9Roth D.M.

However, neither the sequences responsible for mediating MT association and facilitation of nuclear import (microtubule association sequences (MTASs)) nor the mechanisms underlying cargo uncoupling from the MTs for IMP interaction and subsequent nuclear import have been defined. Here we used site-directed mutagenesis, live cell imaging approaches/fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, and novel in vitro binding assays to define for the first time the minimal sequence within PTHrP that is functional both in terms of MT association and MT-dependent enhancement of nuclear import. This represents the first MTAS described for any protein.Significantly, our results provide the first insight into the mechanism by which MTAS-containing proteins can interact with MTs to enhance delivery to the perinuclear region of the cell prior to displacement from the MTs for subsequent nuclear transport. The findings have clear significance to basic processes in cell biology with relevance both to cellular physiology and transformation.DISCUSSIONHere we characterize for the first time the molecular mechanism underlying MT-dependent nuclear import of PTHrP. In so doing, we also define the first modular MTAS able to confer physical and functional MT association in nuclear import. Importantly, we establish the detailed mechanism of its action, i.e. that it functions through the intriguing interplay between overlapping NLS and MTAS sequences to ensure efficient transfer of PTHrP from MTs to IMPβ1 and subsequent transport into the nucleus. MT-dependent nuclear import has been reported previously for a number of proteins (e.g. p53 and Rb) (4Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9Roth D.M. Moseley G.W. Glover D. Pouton C.W. Jans D.A.

Landes Biosciences, Austin, TX2009: 154-178Google Scholar), but the sequences responsible as well as the details of the trafficking mechanisms involved have remained unresolved. In particular, an MTAS sufficient to confer MT association and enhancement of nuclear import per se has never previously been identified. The work described here defines such an MTAS for the first time, thereby shedding new light on the mechanisms underlying MT-facilitated nuclear transport.We show here that optimal nuclear accumulation of PTHrP requires specific residues within 66–108, which includes the overlapping IMPβ1-recognized NLS (66–108) and MTAS (82–108) sequences (see Fig. 3B). The fact that the NLS and MTAS share key residues integral to their function ensures that IMPβ1 binding and MT association are mutually exclusive. This is documented here not only in our in vitro binding studies but also by the subcellular fractionation experiments using transfected cells (Fig. 7, D–G) where overexpression of IMPβ1 resulted in reduced association of PTHrP with MTs.These results identify a mechanism by which PTHrP can be released from MTs subsequent to MT-dependent delivery to the perinuclear region. Specifically, it appears that PTHrP traffic to the nuclear region is accelerated by its association with MTs until arrival at the MT-organizing center/perinuclear region where the local concentration of IMPβ1 is highest (46Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This high concentration enables IMPβ1 to compete with MTs for PTHrP binding, thereby releasing PTHrP from the MT cytoskeleton prior to ferrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. That IMPβ1 is not present in the MT fraction of intact cells (Fig. 7) is consistent with the idea that IMPβ1 acts in addition to/subsequent to MT-dependent transport of PTHrP. Importantly, the results explain for the first time how, through dynamic interactions with MTs, MTAS-dependent MT interaction can facilitate nuclear import rather than resulting in cytoplasmic sequestration and consequently inhibition of nuclear import (47Malki S. Berta P. Poulat F. Boizet-Bonhoure B. Exp. Cell. Res. 2005; 309: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 48Campbell E.M. Hope T.J. Adv. Drug Deliv.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3652-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Efficient MT-dependent nuclear import of p53, Rb, and several other cellular and viral proteins, such as rabies virus P-protein (4Giannakakou P.

Cell. 2007; 18: 3204-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), is dependent on dynein/dynactin with preliminary data (not shown) indicating that MT-facilitated transport of PTHrP toward the nucleus also involves dynein. Because optimal PTHrP nuclear import is impaired in Taxol-treated cells, the clear implication is that an intact MT network in itself is insufficient for facilitated import, but rather a dynamic MT network may be required. A possible explanation is that MT dynamics contribute to the transfer of cargo between MTs and dynein where PTHrP may first associate with MTs and then pass to dynein for trafficking. Whether the same mechanism relates to similar observations for MT-facilitated nuclear transport of p53 (4Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and Rb (9Roth D.M. Moseley G.W. Glover D. Pouton C.W. Jans D.A. Traffic. 2007; 8: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) remains to be determined.Interestingly, the MTAS responsible for MT association/facilitated nuclear import, which is within PTHrP residues 82–108 and is critically dependent on the KKKK91 and KKRR106 basic clusters, is quite distinct from consensus motifs for DLC association (e.g. KSTQT and GIQVD for DLC8 and SKCSR for Tctex-1), which mediate MT-dependent nuclear import of proteins including rabies virus P-protein (16Moseley G.W.

Although the latter appear to be able (out of context) to enhance conventional NLS-dependent nuclear import (16Moseley G.W. Roth D.M. DeJesus M.A. Leyton D.L. Filmer R.P. Pouton C.W. Jans D.A. Mol.

Clearly, the PTHrP basic motifs responsible for PTHrP MT association differ markedly from defined consensus motifs for DLC association, and mutation of PTHrP KEQE101, which can be postulated to resemble a DLC8 association motif, had no effect on PTHrP MT-dependent nuclear import. PTHrP fusion proteins also do not associate with DLC8 (not shown), further underlining the fact that MTASs and consensus motifs for DLC association are distinct.In summary, this study has enhanced our understanding of the nuclear trafficking of cellular proteins with key roles in vital processes in physiology and transformation. In addition, it has established the mechanism of MT-dependent nuclear protein cargo delivery. This has clear implications for the design of vectors for non-viral gene delivery to the cell nucleus for which cytoplasmic diffusion of large DNA molecules is a significant limiting factor (57Glover D.J.

The fact that PTHrP-(66–108) is a sequence module able to target a 580-kDa fusion protein (GFP-β-gal) rapidly and efficiently into the nucleus dependent on MT integrity (e.g. Fig. 4) implies that combining MTASs with NLSs should have great potential for future gene delivery approaches.

PTHrP is a crucial factor in the early stages of development of various tissues as well as in the biology of adult tissues (13Wysolmerski J.J. Philbrick W.M. Dunbar M.E. Lanske B. Kronenberg H.

Specific nuclear localizing proteins, such as PTHrP, appear to possess the ability to interact with MTs for facilitated transport through the cytoplasm prior to conventional IMP-dependent import through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus (9Roth D.M. Moseley G.W. Glover D. Pouton C.W. Jans D.A. Traffic. 2007; 8: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Moseley G.W. Roth D.M. DeJesus M.A. Leyton D.L. Filmer R.P. Pouton C.W. Jans D.A.

However, neither the sequences responsible for mediating MT association and facilitation of nuclear import (microtubule association sequences (MTASs)) nor the mechanisms underlying cargo uncoupling from the MTs for IMP interaction and subsequent nuclear import have been defined. Here we used site-directed mutagenesis, live cell imaging approaches/fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, and novel in vitro binding assays to define for the first time the minimal sequence within PTHrP that is functional both in terms of MT association and MT-dependent enhancement of nuclear import. This represents the first MTAS described for any protein. Significantly, our results provide the first insight into the mechanism by which MTAS-containing proteins can interact with MTs to enhance delivery to the perinuclear region of the cell prior to displacement from the MTs for subsequent nuclear transport. The findings have clear significance to basic processes in cell biology with relevance both to cellular physiology and transformation. DISCUSSIONHere we characterize for the first time the molecular mechanism underlying MT-dependent nuclear import of PTHrP. In so doing, we also define the first modular MTAS able to confer physical and functional MT association in nuclear import. Importantly, we establish the detailed mechanism of its action, i.e. that it functions through the intriguing interplay between overlapping NLS and MTAS sequences to ensure efficient transfer of PTHrP from MTs to IMPβ1 and subsequent transport into the nucleus. MT-dependent nuclear import has been reported previously for a number of proteins (e.g. p53 and Rb) (4Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9Roth D.M. Moseley G.W. Glover D. Pouton C.W. Jans D.A.

Landes Biosciences, Austin, TX2009: 154-178Google Scholar), but the sequences responsible as well as the details of the trafficking mechanisms involved have remained unresolved. In particular, an MTAS sufficient to confer MT association and enhancement of nuclear import per se has never previously been identified. The work described here defines such an MTAS for the first time, thereby shedding new light on the mechanisms underlying MT-facilitated nuclear transport.We show here that optimal nuclear accumulation of PTHrP requires specific residues within 66–108, which includes the overlapping IMPβ1-recognized NLS (66–108) and MTAS (82–108) sequences (see Fig. 3B). The fact that the NLS and MTAS share key residues integral to their function ensures that IMPβ1 binding and MT association are mutually exclusive. This is documented here not only in our in vitro binding studies but also by the subcellular fractionation experiments using transfected cells (Fig. 7, D–G) where overexpression of IMPβ1 resulted in reduced association of PTHrP with MTs.These results identify a mechanism by which PTHrP can be released from MTs subsequent to MT-dependent delivery to the perinuclear region. Specifically, it appears that PTHrP traffic to the nuclear region is accelerated by its association with MTs until arrival at the MT-organizing center/perinuclear region where the local concentration of IMPβ1 is highest (46Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This high concentration enables IMPβ1 to compete with MTs for PTHrP binding, thereby releasing PTHrP from the MT cytoskeleton prior to ferrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. That IMPβ1 is not present in the MT fraction of intact cells (Fig. 7) is consistent with the idea that IMPβ1 acts in addition to/subsequent to MT-dependent transport of PTHrP. Importantly, the results explain for the first time how, through dynamic interactions with MTs, MTAS-dependent MT interaction can facilitate nuclear import rather than resulting in cytoplasmic sequestration and consequently inhibition of nuclear import (47Malki S. Berta P. Poulat F. Boizet-Bonhoure B. Exp. Cell. Res. 2005; 309: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 48Campbell E.M. Hope T.J. Adv. Drug Deliv.

Because optimal PTHrP nuclear import is impaired in Taxol-treated cells, the clear implication is that an intact MT network in itself is insufficient for facilitated import, but rather a dynamic MT network may be required. A possible explanation is that MT dynamics contribute to the transfer of cargo between MTs and dynein where PTHrP may first associate with MTs and then pass to dynein for trafficking. Whether the same mechanism relates to similar observations for MT-facilitated nuclear transport of p53 (4Giannakakou P. Sackett D.L. Ward Y. Webster K.R. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2009170935,"Chemical communication plays a critical role in sexual selection and speciation in fishes; however, it is generally assumed that most fish pheromones are passively released since most fishes lack specialized scent glands or scent-marking behavior. Swordtails (genus Xiphophorus) are widely used in studies of female mate choice, and female response to male chemical cues is important to sexual selection, reproductive isolation, and hybridization. However, it is unclear whether females are attending to passively produced cues, or to pheromones produced in the context of communication.We used fluorescein dye injections to visualize pulsed urine release in male sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus birchmanni. Simultaneous-choice assays of mating preference showed that females attend to species- and sex-specific chemical cues emitted in male urine. Males urinated more frequently in the presence and proximity of an audience (conspecific females). In the wild, males preferentially courted upstream of females, facilitating transmission of pheromone cues.Males in a teleost fish have evolved sophisticated temporal and spatial control of pheromone release, comparable to that found in terrestrial animals. Pheromones are released specifically in a communicative context, and the timing and positioning of release favors efficient signal transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2046034086,"Filopodia are cellular protrusions important for axon guidance, embryonic development, and wound healing. The Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the best studied inducer of filopodium formation, and several of its effectors and their interacting partners have been linked to the process. These include IRSp53, N-WASP, Mena, and Eps8. The Rho GTPase, Rif, also drives filopodium formation. The signaling pathway by which Rif induces filopodia is poorly understood, with mDia2 being the only protein implicated to date. It is thus not clear how distinct the Rif-driven pathway for filopodium formation is from the one mediated by Cdc42. In this study, we characterize the dynamics of Rif-induced filopodia by time lapse imaging of live neuronal cells and show that Rif drives filopodium formation via an independent pathway that does not involve the Cdc42 effectors N-WASP and IRSp53, the IRSp53 binding partner Mena, or the Rac effectors WAVE1 and WAVE2. Rif formed filopodia in the absence of N-WASP or Mena and when IRSp53, WAVE1, or WAVE2 was knocked down by RNAi. Rif-mediated filopodial protrusion was instead reduced by silencing mDia1 expression or overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of mDia1. mDia1 on its own was able to form filopodia. Data from acceptor photobleaching FRET studies of protein-protein interaction demonstrate that Rif interacts directly with mDia1 in filopodia but not with mDia2. Taken together, these results suggest a novel pathway for filopodia formation via Rif and mDia1. Filopodia are cellular protrusions important for axon guidance, embryonic development, and wound healing. The Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the best studied inducer of filopodium formation, and several of its effectors and their interacting partners have been linked to the process. These include IRSp53, N-WASP, Mena, and Eps8. The Rho GTPase, Rif, also drives filopodium formation.

Filopodia are dynamic, actin-rich cellular protrusions that are important for processes such as cell migration, neuritogenesis, axon guidance, wound healing, angiogenesis, embryonic development, and phagocytosis (1Mattila P.K.

Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but little else is known about this interaction. mDia1 and mDia2 (mammalian Diaphanous 2) belong to the formin family of multidomain eukaryotic proteins that are involved in a wide range of cellular processes that require actin polymerization (17Faix J. Grosse R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Formins contain an actin-nucleating formin homology 2 domain, and a proline-rich, formin homology 1 domain that binds Src homology 3 and WW domain-containing proteins and profilin (18Wallar B.J. Alberts A.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 435-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Diaphanous-related formins, a subset of formins that bind to and are regulated by Rho GTPases, have additional domains flanking the formin homology 1 and formin homology 2 domains that enable signaling molecules to bind and exert control over formin protein conformation and functional state. These include an N-terminal GTPase binding domain, a Diaphanous inhibitory domain, and a C-terminal Diaphanous autoregulatory domain. Binding of Rho GTPases to the GTPase binding domain disrupts the autoinhibitory interaction between the Diaphanous autoregulatory domain and Diaphanous inhibitory domain, activating the Diaphanous-related formin (19Young K.G. Copeland J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent findings also suggest that the Diaphanous-related formins mDia1 and mDia2 both contain a phospholipid-binding N-terminal basic domain that enables them to attach to the plasma membrane (20Ramalingam N. Zhao H. Breitsprecher D. Lappalainen P. Faix J. Schleicher M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 89: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). mDia1 is a 140-kDa Diaphanous-related formin that forms stress fibers when activated by the Rho GTPase RhoA (21Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). This function of mDia1 is down-regulated by the protein phosphatase POPX2 (partner of PAK-interacting exchange factor 2), which binds to and inhibits activated mDia1 (22Xie Y. Tan E.J. Wee S. Manser E. Lim L. Koh C.G. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Other roles of mDia1 include control of neurite outgrowth (23Arakawa Y. Bito H. Furuyashiki T.

Janssen L. Verwoerd D. Hordijk P. Neefjes J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2661-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, mDia1 stabilizes microtubules (27Wen Y. Eng C.H.

Aspenström P. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rif binds to the N-terminal region of both mDia1 and mDia2 in vitro (31Pellegrin S. Mellor H. Curr.

Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Apart from these, no other interacting partners of Rif are known, and the signaling pathway(s) by which it drives the formation of actin-based cellular protrusions, such as filopodia, is poorly understood. In this study, we show by time lapse imaging of live cells that Rif drives the formation of dynamic filopodia with characteristics distinct from those of Cdc42-induced filopodia. Rif forms filopodia via a pathway that does not involve the Cdc42 effectors N-WASP and IRSp53 or the IRSp53 binding partner Mena. Furthermore, knockdown of the Rac effectors WAVE1 and WAVE2 does not disrupt Rif-mediated filopodia formation.

Taken together, these results suggest a novel pathway for filopodium formation via Rif and mDia1 that is independent of Cdc42 and Rac effectors. pcDNA3-RifQL, pEF-Myc-mDia2, and pEF-Myc-mDia2H160D were from Harry Mellor (Bristol University, UK), pEYFP.C1-mDia1 was from Art Alberts (Van Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, USA), pXJ40-GFP-actin was from Jingming Dong (GSK-Institute of Medical Biology, Singapore), p-mCherry-actin was from Maïté Coppey-Moisan (Institut Jacques Monod, Paris, France), and pIRESpuro3-mCherry-Abp140p was from Philippe Chavrier (Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Paris, France). pXJ40-mRFP-mDia1DN was constructed by cloning amino acids 771–1181 of mDia1 into the NotI and BglII sites of pXJ40-mRFP.

Decreases in target protein levels were assessed by Western blot of treated cells, and all calculations of percentage decrease were normalized for GAPDH or tubulin.

However, we are unable to determine the exact percentage of knockdown. is taken into account, the actual level of knockdown attained in the population of cells analyzed is likely to be higher than estimated. Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed once with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and then washed twice with PBS for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 min, washed twice with PBS for 10 min, and incubated with 3% BSA in PBS for 15 min. After treatment with primary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h, cells were washed twice with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 10 min. Cells were next incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies at 37 °C for 1 h and washed twice with PBST for 10 min and then once in PBS, and coverslips were mounted onto glass slides. All steps were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise specified. Cells were viewed using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200), and images were captured using a CoolSNAP CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Cells grown in 35-mm diameter glass bottom dishes (Mattek) were placed on a 37 °C heated stage within a 5% CO2 atmosphere chamber and imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope enclosed within an incubator box, with a monochromator light source and a CoolSNAP CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Images were captured in both differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence channels at 10-s intervals over a 10-min time course, and movies were compiled using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). For images of fixed cells, the following definitions of morphological characteristics were used. Peripheral projections were defined as thin, filopodia-like tubular protrusions arising from the cell periphery. Those of at least 5 μm in length were classified as long peripheral projections, and the rest were classified as short peripheral projections. Similar structures arising from the dorsal surface of the cell were defined as apical projections. Neurites were defined as linear peripheral protrusions of at least one cell body length. Neurites with structures such as short or long peripheral projections, ruffles, and/or lamellae emerging from along the neurite shaft were classified as complex neurites. Lamellae were defined as broad, flattened areas on the cell periphery that appeared to be completely adhered to the substrate. Similar structures that appeared loosely adherent were defined as ruffles. Ruffles were also observed to be able to fold back, and/or protrude from the dorsal surface of the cell. In each experiment, 10–20 cells were evaluated for the above morphological characteristics, and at least three independent experiments were carried out for any one set of conditions, giving a minimum n value of 30. For time lapse imaging of live cells, filopodia were defined as dynamic, actin-containing tubular cell surface protrusions that could extend and retract. The number of filopodia/cell was determined by first marking out all filopodia-like structures that could be seen at the middle time point (i.e. the 31st image of a series of 61 captured over a 10-min time course) and then checking consecutive images taken before and after the middle time point, in both DIC and fluorescence channels. Only actin-positive structures for which both full extension and complete retraction could be observed in the series of consecutive images were scored as bona fide filopodia. Filopodial lifetime was measured starting from the initial appearance of the nascent structure up until the complete disappearance of the entire structure. Filopodial length was measured at the point of maximum extension. In each experiment, 3–10 cells were evaluated for the filopodial protrusion, and at least two independent experiments were carried out for any one set of conditions. AP-FRET was carried out using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a C-Apochromat 63X water 1.2 numerical aperture objective, with the following filter settings: for YFP, excitation source 514-nm laser line, dichroic mirror 458/514 nm, secondary dichroic mirror 515 nm, emission BP 530–600 nm; for mRFP, excitation source 561-nm laser line, dichroic mirror 405/488/561 nm, secondary dichroic mirror 565 nm, emission LP 575 nm. Regions of interest were selected, and the acceptor fluorophore (mRFP) was photobleached using 70% laser power and 50 iterations of the 561-nm laser line. The increase in donor fluorophore (EYFP) fluorescence intensity following mRFP bleaching was measured as FRET. FRET efficiency and cross-correlation values were calculated as described by Lim et al. (8Lim K.B. Bu W. Goh W.I. Koh E. Ong S.H. Pawson T. Sudhaharan T. Ahmed S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20454-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The combination of YFP as a donor with mRFP as the acceptor fluorophore has previously been used to measure FRET (36He L. Wu X. Simone J. Hewgill D. Lipsky P.E.

Student's t test (two-tailed distribution, unpaired, equal variance) was calculated using Microsoft Excel, and the resulting p values are represented as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. The N1E115 mouse neuroblastoma cell line was used previously to measure the characteristics of filopodia induced by Cdc42 and its interacting partners IRSp53 and N-WASP (8Lim K.B. Bu W. Goh W.I.

The typical morphology of untransfected N1E115 cells is shown in (Fig. 1A, a). To establish the phenotype of Rif in this cell line, N1E115 cells were transfected with a constitutively active mutant of Rif (RifQL) and stained with anti-Rif antibodies and TRITC-phalloidin at 18 h post-transfection. Rif induced apical filopodia-like projections at the dorsal surfaces of cells and filopodia-like peripheral projections at the cell edge (Fig. 1A, b–d). Complex neurites, lamellae (Fig. 1A, c), and ruffles (Fig. 1A, d) (see “Experimental Procedures” for definitions of various morphological structures) were also seen in a smaller percentage of transfected cells (Fig. 1B). All of these structures stained positive for Rif. Filopodia are highly dynamic, actin-rich, cylindrical membrane protrusions that extend and retract rapidly. They can also exhibit lateral motion and detach and lift up from the substratum (37Wood W. Martin P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Many studies done on filopodia have been based on fixed cells, with no observation and quantification of the dynamics of the cellular structures in question (31Pellegrin S. Mellor H. Curr.

Distinguishing true filopodia from protrusions that may appear similar under fixed conditions, such as retraction fibers and thin dendritic spines, is difficult at best. Quantitative data on bona fide filopodia can only be generated using time lapse analysis. In this study, we used the following approach to examine filopodia. Cells were cotransfected with GFP-actin and expression constructs of proteins of interest, and GFP-positive cells were observed in real time by high speed multichannel time lapse wide field imaging in both fluorescence and DIC channels. GFP-actin monomers were rapidly incorporated into the F-actin cytoskeleton, and dynamic actin-based cellular protrusions were thus marked by fluorescence and could be visualized and measured. Length, lifetime, and number of peripheral filopodia formed per cell were quantified as described by Lim et al. (8Lim K.B. Bu W. Goh W.I. Koh E. Ong S.H. Pawson T. Sudhaharan T. Ahmed S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20454-20472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and under “Experimental Procedures.” Apical filopodia were not measured due to out-of-focus fluorescence making it impossible to define the full extent of the structures with two-dimensional imaging. In addition, the density of the apical filopodia formed and the fact that they could project at any angle relative to the cell surface and also bend meant that it was difficult to distinguish individual structures because many of them overlapped with one another. To examine the dynamics of Rif-induced filopodia, N1E115 cells were cotransfected with GFP-actin and either untagged (Fig. 2A) or mRFP-tagged (Fig. 2B) RifQL and observed by time lapse imaging at 18 h post-transfection. The Rif-induced filopodia were dynamic structures (Fig. 2A) with an average length of 4.37 μm and average lifetime of 162 s (Table 1 and supplemental Movies 1 and 2). In contrast, the filopodia that formed in cells transfected with GFP-actin alone were longer (average length 7.09 μm) and fewer in number (Table 1). Rif-induced filopodia contained both actin and mRFP-Rif along their entire length (Fig. 2B and supplemental Movies 3–5). Longer Rif- and actin-positive protrusions were also seen in some of the transfected cells; however, they only extended, retracted, or remained static throughout the entire 10-min period of observation and thus did not fit our definition of filopodia. Many of these longer protrusions appeared at the trailing edge and lengthened as the cells retracted, and some were branched; these are likely to be retraction fibers.TABLE 1Characteristics of filopodia induced by Rif and mDia1Protein(s) expressedFilopodia/cellLengthLifetimeμmsEndogenous1.2 ± 1.027.16 ± 0.82212 ± 64IRSp53aData for length and lifetime of IRSp53 and N-WASP filopodia in N1E115 cells from Lim et al.

https://openalex.org/W2132976944,"Background Weight regain after weight loss is common. In the Diogenes dietary intervention study, high protein and low glycemic index (GI) diet improved weight maintenance. Objective To identify blood predictors for weight change after weight loss following the dietary intervention within the Diogenes study. Design Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 8-week low caloric diet-induced weight loss from 48 women who continued to lose weight and 48 women who regained weight during subsequent 6-month dietary intervention period with 4 diets varying in protein and GI levels. Thirty-one proteins and 3 steroid hormones were measured. Results Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) was the most important predictor. Its greater reduction during the 8-week weight loss was related to continued weight loss during the subsequent 6 months, identified by both Logistic Regression and Random Forests analyses. The prediction power of ACE was influenced by immunoproteins, particularly fibrinogen. Leptin, luteinizing hormone and some immunoproteins showed interactions with dietary protein level, while interleukin 8 showed interaction with GI level on the prediction of weight maintenance. A predictor panel of 15 variables enabled an optimal classification by Random Forests with an error rate of 24±1%. A logistic regression model with independent variables from 9 blood analytes had a prediction accuracy of 92%. Conclusions A selected panel of blood proteins/steroids can predict the weight change after weight loss. ACE may play an important role in weight maintenance. The interactions of blood factors with dietary components are important for personalized dietary advice after weight loss. Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00390637"
https://openalex.org/W2015352033,"Background The failure of cytotoxic cancer regimens to cure the most drug-resistant, well-differentiated solid tumors has been attributed to the heterogeneity of cell types that differ in their capacities for growth, differentiation, and metastases. We investigated the effect of LB1, a small molecule inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), on its ability to inhibit a low growth fraction and highly drug-resistant solid neuroendocrine tumor, such as metastatic pheochromocytoma (PHEO). Subsequently, we evaluated the increased efficacy of chemotherapy combined with LB1. Methodology/Principal Findings The effect of LB1 and temozolomide (TMZ), a standard chemotherapeutic agent that alone only transiently suppressed the growth and regression of metastatic PHEO, was evaluated in vitro on a single PHEO cell line and in vivo on mouse model of metastatic PHEO. In the present study, we show that metastatic PHEO, for which there is currently no cure, can be eliminated by combining LB1, thereby inhibiting PP2A, with TMZ. This new treatment approach resulted in long term, disease-free survival of up to 40% of animals bearing multiple intrahepatic metastases, a disease state that the majority of patients die from. Inhibition of PP2A was associated with prevention of G1/S phase arrest by p53 and of mitotic arrest mediated by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk-1). Conclusions/Significance The elimination of DNA damage-induced defense mechanisms, through transient pharmacologic inhibition of PP2A, is proposed as a new approach for enhancing the efficacy of non-specific cancer chemotherapy regimens against a broad spectrum of low growth fraction tumors very commonly resistant to cytotoxic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2033866819,"Experimental observations performed in the p53-Mdm2 network, one of the key protein modules involved in the control of proliferation of abnormal cells in mammals, revealed the existence of two frequencies of oscillations of p53 and Mdm2 in irradiated cells depending on the irradiation dose. These observations raised the question of the existence of birhythmicity, i.e. the coexistence of two oscillatory regimes for the same external conditions, in the p53-Mdm2 network which would be at the origin of these two distinct frequencies. A theoretical answer has been recently suggested by Ouattara, Abou-Jaoudé and Kaufman who proposed a 3-dimensional differential model showing birhythmicity to reproduce the two frequencies experimentally observed. The aim of this work is to analyze the mechanisms at the origin of the birhythmic behavior through a theoretical analysis of this differential model. To do so, we reduced this model, in a first step, into a 3-dimensional piecewise linear differential model where the Hill functions have been approximated by step functions, and, in a second step, into a 2-dimensional piecewise linear differential model by setting one autonomous variable as a constant in each domain of the phase space. We find that two features related to the phase space structure of the system are at the origin of the birhythmic behavior: the existence of two embedded cycles in the transition graph of the reduced models; the presence of a bypass in the orbit of the large amplitude oscillatory regime of low frequency. Based on this analysis, an experimental strategy is proposed to test the existence of birhythmicity in the p53-Mdm2 network. From a methodological point of view, this approach greatly facilitates the computational analysis of complex oscillatory behavior and could represent a valuable tool to explore mathematical models of biological rhythms showing sufficiently steep nonlinearities."
https://openalex.org/W1972388618,"Cerebellar development entails rapid peri-natal proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs), proposed cells-of-origin for certain medulloblastomas. CGNPs require insulin-like growth factor (IGF) for survival and sonic hedgehog (Shh)—implicated in medulloblastoma—for proliferation. The IGF-responsive kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) drives proliferation-associated protein synthesis. We asked whether Shh signaling regulates mTOR targets to promote CGNP proliferation despite constitutive IGF signaling under proliferative and differentiation-promoting conditions. Surprisingly, Shh promoted eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) expression, but inhibited S6 kinase (S6K). In vivo, S6K activity specifically marked the CGNP population transitioning from proliferation-competent to post-mitotic. Indeed, eIF4E was required for CGNP proliferation, while S6K activation drove cell cycle exit. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibition rescued S6K activity. Moreover, Shh upregulated the PP2A B56γ subunit, which targets S6K for inactivation and was required for CGNP proliferation. These findings reveal unique developmental functions for eIF4E and S6 kinase wherein their activity is specifically uncoupled by mitogenic Shh signaling."

The chloroplast of B. hypnoides is the biggest organelle in the cell and shows strong autonomy. To better understand this organelle, we sequenced and analyzed the chloroplast genome of this green alga.A total of 111 functional genes, including 69 potential protein-coding genes, 5 ribosomal RNA genes, and 37 tRNA genes were identified. The genome size (153,429 bp), arrangement, and inverted-repeat (IR)-lacking structure of the B. hypnoides chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) closely resembles that of Chlorella vulgaris. Furthermore, our cytogenomic investigations using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and southern blotting methods showed that the B. hypnoides cpDNA had multimeric forms, including monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, and even higher multimers, which is similar to the higher order organization observed previously for higher plant cpDNA. The relative amounts of the four multimeric cpDNA forms were estimated to be about 1, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 based on molecular hybridization analysis. Phylogenetic analyses based on a concatenated alignment of chloroplast protein sequences suggested that B. hypnoides is sister to all Chlorophyceae and this placement received moderate support.All of the results suggest that the autonomy of the chloroplasts of B. hypnoides has little to do with the size and gene content of the cpDNA, and the IR-lacking structure of the chloroplasts indirectly demonstrated that the multimeric molecules might result from the random cleavage and fusion of replication intermediates instead of recombinational events."
https://openalex.org/W2005249363,"Background SoPIP2;1 constitutes one of the major integral proteins in spinach leaf plasma membranes and belongs to the aquaporin family. SoPIP2;1 is a highly permeable and selective water channel that has been successfully overexpressed and purified with high yields. In order to optimize reconstitution of the purified protein into biomimetic systems, we have here for the first time characterized the structural stability of SoPIP2;1. Methodology/Principal Finding We have characterized the protein structural stability after purification and after reconstitution into detergent micelles and proteoliposomes using circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. The structure of SoPIP2;1 was analyzed either with the protein solubilized with octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (OG) or reconstituted into lipid membranes formed by E. coli lipids, diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (DPhPC), or reconstituted into lipid membranes formed from mixtures of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine (POPS), and ergosterol. Generally, SoPIP2;1 secondary structure was found to be predominantly α-helical in accordance with crystallographic data. The protein has a high thermal structural stability in detergent solutions, with an irreversible thermal unfolding occurring at a melting temperature of 58°C. Incorporation of the protein into lipid membranes increases the structural stability as evidenced by an increased melting temperature of up to 70°C. Conclusion/Significance The results of this study provide insights into SoPIP2;1 stability in various host membranes and suggest suitable choices of detergent and lipid composition for reconstitution of SoPIP2;1 into biomimetic membranes for biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2001497625,"We investigated the epidemiology of Trypanosoma pestanai infection in European badgers (Meles meles) from Wytham Woods (Oxfordshire, UK) to determine prevalence rates and to identify the arthropod vector responsible for transmission. A total of 245 badger blood samples was collected during September and November 2009 and examined by PCR using primers derived from the 18S rRNA of T. pestanai. The parasite was detected in blood from 31% of individuals tested. T. pestanai was isolated from primary cultures of Wytham badger peripheral blood mononuclear cells and propagated continually in vitro. This population was compared with cultures of two geographically distinct isolates of the parasite by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and PCR analysis of 18S rDNA and ITS1 sequences. High levels of genotypic polymorphism were observed between the isolates. PCR analysis of badger fleas (Paraceras melis) collected from infected individuals at Wytham indicated the presence of T. pestanai and this was confirmed by examination of dissected specimens. Wet smears and Giemsa-stained preparations from dissected fleas revealed large numbers of trypanosome-like forms in the hindgut, some of which were undergoing binary fission. We conclude that P. melis is the primary vector of T. pestanai in European badgers."

A paradigm emerging from this work is that, unlike the eukaryotic actin cytoskeleton, whose architecture and function are determined by accessory factors, each bacterial actin appears adapted to a specific function, with unique properties that reduce its need for accessory factors. Given the diversity of the ALPs, we asked whether the biochemical properties we proposed to be important for the cellular function of one actin-like protein, ParM from the R1 plasmid, are conserved across the entire ParM family. R1 ParM is the best understood bacterial actin (17Needleman D.J. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: R212-R214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and it drives plasmid segregation in Gram-negative enteric pathogens by forming a polymerization-based motor (10Møller-Jensen J. Jensen R.B. Löwe J. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 18Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D.

Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We previously identified three properties that appear to be essential to the cellular function of ParM and reduce its requirement for accessory factors. These properties are as follows: 1) a stochastic switch between growth and shrinking, called dynamic instability, 2) symmetrical filament elongation, and 3) rapid spontaneous nucleation (18Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Two recently characterized bacterial ALPs assemble into structures that look very different from both ParM and conventional actin filaments. The first, an ALP from plasmid pSK41, was identified initially as a potential member of the ParM family (10Møller-Jensen J. Jensen R.B. Löwe J. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Its sequence similarity to R1 ParM (18%), however, is below the 20% cut-off proposed by Derman et al. (6Derman A.I. Becker E.C. Truong B.D. Fujioka A. Tucey T.M. Erb M.L. Patterson P.C. Pogliano J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 534-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) for defining ALP families, and its atomic structure appears more closely related to that of an archeal actin, Ta0583, from Thermoplasma acidophilum. Perhaps not surprisingly, pSK41 ALP assembles into filaments with strikingly different architecture and assembly dynamics than R1 ParM; it forms one-strand helical filaments, which are very different from the two-stranded R1 ParM filaments. Nucleation of these filaments is slower than that of R1 ParM and elongation proceeds from a dimeric rather than a trimeric nucleus. Finally, and most interestingly, the pSK41 ALP filaments are not dynamically unstable (15Popp D. Xu W. Narita A. Brzoska A.J. Skurray R.A. Firth N. Goshdastider U. Maéda Y. Robinson R.C. Schumacher M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10130-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The second ALP, AlfA, also is a plasmid-segregating actin with little sequence homology to R1 ParM (15% identity). It also forms unique filaments that bundle spontaneously and lack dynamic instability (14Polka J.K. Kollman J.M. Agard D.A. Mullins R.D. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6219-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These findings, especially the differences in polymer assembly dynamics, invite the intriguing conclusion that different ALP families partition plasmid DNA via distinct mechanisms. These results also suggest an important question; how well conserved are the biochemical and biophysical properties of more closely related ALPs, especially as individual ALP families can be more diverse than the entire family of eukaryotic actins? To address this question, we purified and characterized an actin-like protein encoded by the StbA gene from the Par1 operon of plasmid pB171 from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (21Tobe T. Hayashi T. Han C.G. Schoolnik G.K. Ohtsubo E. Sasakawa C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5455-5462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 15078-15083Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). R1 ParM and pB171 stbA share 41% identity and 52% similarity. Because this level of conservation is within the cut-off proposed by Derman et al. (6Derman A.I. Becker E.C. Truong B.D. Fujioka A. Tucey T.M. Erb M.L. Patterson P.C. Pogliano J. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 534-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) for prokaryotic ALP families, we will refer to StbA as pB171 ParM. This level of conservation is, however, weak compared with that of eukaryotic actins and is more characteristic of the conservation between conventional actin and the eukaryotic actin-related proteins, which have different activities and cellular functions (23Dion V. Shimada K. Gasser S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using time-resolved light scattering, as well as electron and TIRF microscopy of single filaments, we asked whether the structure and basic biophysical properties of R1 ParM are conserved in pB171 ParM. We PCR-amplified the pB171 ParM gene from a mini pB171 plasmid with primers that appended a C-terminal GSKCK tag for later use in maleimide labeling reactions and cloned it into a pET-11a vector (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). We transformed E. coli BL21 cells with the construct, grew them at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm, and induced with 0.75 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–5 h. We harvested bacterial pellets via centrifugation and flash froze them in liquid N2. We purified pB171 ParM-GSKCK using the same protocol as for R1 ParM (20Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) with the following modification; a 0–20% ammonium cut was used to precipitate the pB171 ParM protein out of the clarified bacterial extract as the initial purification step. R1 ParM-GSKCK was expressed and purified as described previously (20Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). pB171 and R1 ParM were polymerized with 5 mm nucleotide for 5 min and then prepared by negative staining as described (24Ohi M.

Images were recorded on a Gatan Ultrascan 4,000 × 4,000 CCD camera, at a pixel size of 1.72 Å. The defocus of each micrograph was determined using the CTFFIND program (25Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), and the entire micrograph was corrected by phase flipping. Three-dimensional reconstructions of both pB171 and R1 ParM were performed by iterative helical real space reconstruction, as described (26Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). A total of 5006 pB171 ParM filament segments 260 Å in length were used in an initial reconstruction. Heterogeneity of the helical symmetry within the dataset was sorted by comparison with a series of references with different helical symmetries, as described for R1 ParM (27Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Rivera C. Mullins R.D. Egelman E.H. Structure. 2009; 17: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The largest class from this analysis, corresponding to particles with an azimuthal angle of 166.2°, had 1111 helical segments. This class was used in an independent reconstruction, yielding the final structure at a 19 Å resolution. The R1 ParM reconstruction used 4799 helical segments and did not require classification by helical symmetry. We combined various concentrations of pB171 ParM with 10 mm nucleotide in buffer F (100 mm KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). For experiments with ATP and GTP, an additional 10 mm MgCl2 was added to the reactions. The reactions were then immediately centrifuged for 15 min at 355,000 × g at 25 °C in a Beckman Coulter TLA 120.1 rotor. The supernatants were resolved on 4–12% precast gradient NuPAGE acrylamide gels (Invitrogen) or on self-cast 13.75% SDS polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with SYPRO Red (Invitrogen), scanned with a Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare), and quantified using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). The steady state monomer concentration was estimated as the x-intercept of lines fit to a plot of the calculated amount of protein in the pellet versus the total initial protein. Reaction mixtures containing equimolar pB171 ParM and 1,N6-etheno-ATP (Invitrogen) in buffer Q (100 mm KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 200 mm acrylamide) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then combined with equal volumes of 10 mm ATP in buffer Q using an SFA-20 rapid mixer (Hi-tech, Bradford-on-Avon, UK). We monitored the fluorescence at 420 nm (excitation, 315 nm) over time with a K2 fluorimeter (ISS, Champagne, IL) and fit exponential decay functions to the data to estimate the dissociation rate constant. We mixed equal volumes of 1 μm pB171 ParM in with a range of concentrations of etheno-ATP in buffer Q using the rapid mixer and recorded the fluorescence over time. The observed rate constants were estimated by fitting exponential rise functions to the data and plotted versus the etheno-ATP concentrations. The slope of a line fit to the plot estimated the association rate constant (kon) and the y-intercept provided a second estimate of the disassociation rate constant (koff). A 1.6 μm ParM-etheno-ATP-buffer Q solution was mixed with equal volumes of a range of concentrations of ATP and GTP. Following a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the fluorescence of the individual reaction mixtures was measured. We fit a four-parameter logistic function to a plot of the percentage of relative binding versus the concentration of competitor nucleotide to estimate the IC50 and converted the IC50 values to a Ki using the online IC50-to-Ki converter tool (BotDB Database (28Cer R. Mudunuri U. Stephens R. Lebeda F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W441-W445Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar)). For the bulk polymerization assays, we rapidly mixed a range of concentrations of pB171 ParM with equal volumes of 10 mm MgCl2-ATP or MgCl2-GTP in buffer F and recorded the right angle light scattering intensity over time with an excitation wavelength of 314 nm. Each trace for a particular concentration is the average of five or more runs performed on the same day. For the assays with varied nucleotide, we rapidly mixed 10 μm pB171 ParM in buffer F with equal volumes of a dilution series of ATP or GTP and recorded the right angle light scattering over time. We measured phosphate release by 5 μm ParM polymerized with ATP or GTP in buffer F using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Invitrogen) with an Ultrospec 2100 Pro spectophotometer controlled with SWIFT II software (GE Healthcare). A360 values were converted to inorganic phosphate concentration by using a phosphate standard and parallel right angle light scattering assays were performed on the same day. For labeling reactions, monomeric pB171 ParM was combined with Alexa 488-maleimide (Invitrogen) at a 1:1.6 molar ratio in buffer F lacking DTT for 30 min at 4 °C. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 mm DTT, and the protein was separated from free dye by gel filtration. The labeling efficiency was 80–100%. To monitor single filament polymerization dynamics, we directly applied 2.7 μl of 25% Alexa 488-labeled pB171 ParM in TIRF buffer (100 mm KCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.8% methylcellulose, 0.5% BSA) and 0.3 μl of 100 mm ATP or AMP-PNP to ethanol-base washed coverslips and performed time-lapse TIRF microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E inverted microscope equipped with an Andor iXon+ EM digital camera and a 40-milliwatt 488/514 argon ion laser. Data were analyzed with ImageJ software (29Abramoff M. Magelhaes P. Biophotonics International. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Representative actin and ParM sequence were identified using BLASTP on the NCBI website. The sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE global alignment algorithm (30Edgar R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (31032) Google Scholar) and the Jalview alignment editor (31Waterhouse A.M. Procter J.B. Martin D.M. Clamp M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1189-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (5898) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis was performed with the MEGA4 software (32Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25632) Google Scholar) using the Neighbor joining (33Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) and Bootstrap (34Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) methods. Using electron microscopy, we examined negatively stained pB171 ParM filaments polymerized with AMP-PNP, ATP, and GTP. Under all conditions, we observed well separated, helically wound filaments composed of two strands (Fig. 1, A–C). Filaments formed in AMP-PNP (Fig. 1A) were longer than those formed in either ATP or GTP (Fig. 1, B and C). Initial attempts to construct a high resolution model of pB171 ParM filaments in AMP-PNP using iterative helical real space reconstruction (26Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) failed to converge to a stable solution, even after 60 refinement cycles (supplemental Fig. S1B). In contrast, R1 ParM filaments assembled in AMP-PNP yielded a stable solution after ∼20 iterations (supplemental Fig. S1A). The helical twist of R1 ParM filaments has been shown to be somewhat variable (16Orlova A. Garner E.C. Galkin V.E. Heuser J. Mullins R.D. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Rivera C. Mullins R.D. Egelman E.H. Structure. 2009; 17: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and we interpret the failure of pB171 ParM images to produce a stable reconstruction as evidence that the variation in angles between protomers in these filaments is even higher. To deal with these heterogeneities, we performed multireference classification of the data set using nine models with different helical symmetries. The largest class, which contained 20% of the entire data set, corresponded to an azimuthal rotation of 166.1° between adjacent protomers. In an independent reconstruction performed using only this class of the data, helical symmetry converged from different initial values to the same solution after ∼10 iterations. Following initial convergence, however, the azimuthal rotations oscillated between 166.0° and 166.25° in subsequent iterations, suggesting some degree of twist heterogeneity even within this class (supplemental Fig. S1C). The final structure of pB171 ParM, with an estimated resolution of 19 Å (supplemental Fig. S1D), closely resembles both the present and previously reported structures of AMP-PNP R1 ParM filaments (Fig. 2A) (27Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Rivera C. Mullins R.D. Egelman E.H. Structure. 2009; 17: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We fit the atomic structure of ADP-bound R1 ParM (12van den Ent F. Møller-Jensen J. Amos L.A. Gerdes K. Löwe J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6935-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) into our pB171 ParM AMP-PNP reconstruction without steric clashes. The inter- and intrastrand contacts between protomers are nearly identical to the model of Galkin et al. (27Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Rivera C. Mullins R.D. Egelman E.H. Structure. 2009; 17: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). We determined the distribution of pB171 ParM between monomeric and polymeric states using high speed centrifugation. Similar to other actin-like proteins, assembly of pB171 ParM into filaments required nucleotide triphosphates (either ATP or GTP) and was promoted by MgCl2. ATP-ParM polymerization was reduced in the absence of added MgCl2 and inhibited by 1 mm EDTA. Like other actin-like proteins, pB171 ParM polymerized poorly in the presence of CaCl2. A larger fraction of the pB171 protein pelleted in GTP than ATP in all conditions except buffer containing CaCl2. In this condition, pelleting was identical in ATP and GTP (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Actins and the prokaryotic ALPs studied to date bind to and polymerize in the presence of ATP and GTP with varying efficiencies (13Hara F. Yamashiro K. Nemoto N. Ohta Y. Yokobori S. Yasunaga T.

Stopped-flow experiments indicate that pB171 ParM binds the fluorescent ATP analog, 1,N6-etheno-ATP with a rate constant of 25.8 ± 1.1 × 103 s−1 m−1, and the pB171 ParM-etheno-ATP complex disassociated with a rate constant of 0.368 ± 0.142 s−1, corresponding to a Kd of 14.2 ± 5.5 μm (Fig. 3A). Competition binding experiments between etheno-ATP and either ATP or GTP indicated that pB171 ParM has a significantly higher affinity for ATP (Kd = 2.7 ± 1.2 μm) than GTP (Kd = 114.4 ± 33.4 μm) (Fig. 3B). Assuming intracellular ATP and GTP concentrations of 9.4 and 4.9 mm (38Bennett B.D. Kimball E.H. Gao M. Osterhout R. Van Dien S.J. Rabinowitz J.D. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar), respectively, and ignoring the presence of other nucleotide binding proteins, the measured affinities suggest that, in vivo, 98.8% of pB171 ParM is bound to ATP, and 1.2% is bound to GTP. For quantitative comparison of cytoskeletal polymers, we will define the following three terms: critical concentration, steady state monomer concentration, and instability ratio. We define a critical concentration only for single-state polymers. Briefly, if polymer assembly is governed by, dP/dt=k+[m][e]−k−[e](Eq. 1) where k+ and k− are rate constants for monomer association and dissociation, and [m] and [e] are concentrations of monomer and filament ends, then the critical concentration is defined as the monomer concentration at which polymer neither grows nor shrinks. [m]=k−k+(Eq. 2) Although R1 ParM is normally a two-state (dynamically unstable) polymer, we can convert it into a one-state polymer using point mutants or nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs. Under either condition, R1 ParM has a critical concentration (0.6 μm) governed by Equation 1. We will call this the ATP critical concentration (mccATP). R1 ParM is unstable in ADP and has an ADP critical concentration (mccADP) greater than 120 μm. Wild type R1 ParM filaments in the presence of ATP can switch from stable elongation to rapid depolymerization, and the measured steady state monomer concentration under these conditions is 2.3 μm. Because this monomer concentration reflects the behavior of two filament populations, each with a different critical concentration, we will refer to it simply as the steady state monomer concentration (mss) of the polymer. If we assume that the reason mss is greater than mccATP is because at steady state some fraction of filaments (r) have ATP caps at their ends and are governed by Equation 1, whereas the rest (1 − r) have ADP-bound protomers at one or both ends and are catastrophically shortening at a rapid rate (ks), then the steady state monomer concentration is given by Equation 3. [mss]=k−k++ksk+(1r−1)(Eq. 3) Using parameters measured for R1 ParM we calculate that, at steady state, 88% of filaments are stable and 12% are shrinking. Finally, for polymers whose stability changes upon nucleotide hydrolysis, the ratio of the critical concentration in nucleotide diphosphate (ADP or GDP) over that in nucleotide tri-phosphate (ATP or GTP) is a convenient measure of dynamic instability. We will call this the “instability ratio” of the polymer. For example, actin, which is not generally considered dynamically unstable, has an instability ratio of 1.6 (39Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). AlfA, which segregates DNA in Bacillus cells, has a similar instability ratio of 4.2 (14Polka J.K. Kollman J.M. Agard D.A. Mullins R.D. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6219-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, dynamically unstable R1 ParM filaments have an instability ratio >160 (20Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Mullins R.D. Science. 2004; 306: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Finally, sedimentation assays indicated that pB171 ParM has a lower steady state monomer concentration in GTP (mssGTP = 1.1 ± 0.21 μm) than in ATP (mssATP 1.5 ± 0.12 μm). We find that like R1 ParM, pB171 ParM has an instability ratio >140 (Table 1), in both adenosine and guanosine nucleotides.TABLE 1pB171 ParM steady state monomer concentrationsNucleotideSteady-state monomer concentrationμmATP1.5 ± 0.12ADP>114AMP-PNP0.5 ± 0.04GTP1.1 ± 0.21GDP>114GMP-PNP0.77 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab For linear helical polymers such as actin and R1 ParM, filament assembly is governed by several parameters that include nucleus size, nucleation rate, elongation rate, stability of the polymer in subsaturating nucleotide, and rates of nucleotide hydrolysis and phosphate release. Using right angle light scattering, pB171 ParM rapidly assembles in the presence of ATP, suggesting that nucleation is fast. The ATP-pB171 ParM assembly curves have three phases: an initial increase in polymer, followed by a brie"
https://openalex.org/W1992633207,"Cdc14 protein phosphatases are well known for regulating the eukaryotic cell cycle, particularly during mitosis. Here we reveal a distinctly new role for Cdc14 based on studies of the microbial eukaryote Phytophthora infestans, the Irish potato famine agent. While Cdc14 is transcribed constitutively in yeast and animal cells, the P. infestans ortholog is expressed exclusively in spore stages of the life cycle and not in vegetative hyphae where the bulk of mitosis takes place. PiCdc14 expression is first detected in nuclei at sporulation, and during zoospore formation the protein accumulates at the basal body, which is the site from which flagella develop. The association of PiCdc14 with basal bodies was supported by co-localization studies with the DIP13 basal body protein and flagellar β-tubulin, and by demonstrating the enrichment of PiCdc14 in purified flagella-basal body complexes. Overexpressing PiCdc14 did not cause defects in growth or mitosis in hyphae, but interfered with cytoplasmic partitioning during zoosporogenesis. This cytokinetic defect might relate to its ability to bind microtubules, which was shown using an in vitro cosedimentation assay. The use of gene silencing to reveal the precise function of PiCdc14 in flagella is not possible since we showed previously that silencing prevents the formation of the precursor stage, sporangia. Nevertheless, the association of Cdc14 with flagella and basal bodies is consistent with their phylogenetic distribution in eukaryotes, as species that lack the ability to produce flagella generally also lack Cdc14. An ancestral role of Cdc14 in the flagellar stage of eukaryotes is thereby proposed."

Five genes from this interactome were selected for genetic analysis. Twenty-one tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which captured all common variation in these genes were genotyped in 10,196 Danes, and analyzed for association with NAFLD-related quantitative traits, type 2 diabetes (T2D), central obesity, and WHO-defined metabolic syndrome (MetS).273 genes were included in the protein-protein interaction analysis and EHHADH, ECHS1, HADHA, HADHB, and ACADL were selected for further examination. A total of 10 nominal statistical significant associations (P<0.05) to quantitative metabolic traits were identified. Also, the case-control study showed associations between variation in the five genes and T2D, central obesity, and MetS, respectively. Bonferroni adjustments for multiple testing negated all associations.Using a bioinformatics approach we identified five candidate genes for NAFLD. However, we failed to provide evidence of associations with major effects between SNPs in these five genes and NAFLD-related quantitative traits, T2D, central obesity, and MetS."
https://openalex.org/W2016699607,"Actin polymerization controls a range of cellular processes, from intracellular trafficking to cell motility and invasion. Generation and elongation of free barbed ends defines the regions of actively polymerizing actin in cells and, consequently, is of importance in the understanding of the mechanisms through which actin dynamics are regulated. Herein we present a method that does not involve cell permeabilization and provides direct visualization of growing barbed ends using photoswitchable β-actin-Dendra2 constructs expressed in murine macrophage and rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines. The method exploits the ability of photoconverted (red) G-actin species to become incorporated into pre-existing (green) actin filaments, visualized in two distinct wavelengths using TIRF microscopy. In growing actin filaments, photoconverted (red) monomers are added to the barbed end while only green monomers are recycled from the pointed end. We demonstrate that incorporation of actin into intact podosomes of macrophages occurs constitutively and is amenable to inhibition by cytochalasin D indicating barbed end incorporation. Additionally, actin polymerization does not occur in quiescent invadopodial precursors of carcinoma cells suggesting that the filaments are capped and following epidermal growth factor stimulation actin incorporation occurs in a single but extended peak. Finally, we show that Dendra2 fused to either the N- or the C-terminus of β-actin profoundly affects its localization and incorporation in distinct F-actin structures in carcinoma cells, thus influencing the ability of monomers to be photoconverted. These data support the use of photoswitchable actin-Dendra2 constructs as powerful tools in the visualization of free barbed ends in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2025560507,"Many bacterial pathogens interfere with cellular functions including phagocytosis and barrier integrity. The human pathogen Neissieria gonorrhoeae generates grappling hooks for adhesion, spreading, and induction of signal cascades that lead to formation cortical plaques containing f-actin and ezrin. It is unclear whether high mechanical forces generated by type IV pili (T4P) are a direct signal that leads to cytoskeletal rearrangements and at which time scale the cytoskeletal response occurs. Here we used laser tweezers to mimic type IV pilus mediated force generation by T4P-coated beads on the order of 100 pN. We found that actin-EGFP and ezrin-EGFP accumulated below pilus-coated beads when force was applied. Within 2 min, accumulation significantly exceeded controls without force or without pili, demonstrating that T4P-generated force rapidly induces accumulation of plaque proteins. This finding adds mechanical force to the many strategies by which bacteria modulate the host cell cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2058818998,"Background Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) was described as a vascular condition characterized by anomalies of veins outside the skull was reported to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). The objective was to assess the associations between HLA DRB1*1501 status and the occurrence of CCSVI in MS patients. Methodology/Principal Findings This study included 423 of 499 subjects enrolled in the Combined Transcranial and Extracranial Venous Doppler Evaluation (CTEVD) study. The HLA DRB1*1501 status was obtained in 268 MS patients and 155 controls by genotyping rs3135005, a SNP associated with DRB1*1501 status. All subjects underwent a clinical examination and Doppler scan of the head and neck. The frequency of CCSVI was higher (OR = 4.52, p<0.001) in the MS group 56.0% vs. 21.9% in the controls group and also higher in the progressive MS group 69.8% vs. 49.5% in the non-progressive MS group. The 51.9% frequency of HLA DRB1*1501 positivity (HLA+) in MS was higher compared (OR = 2.33, p<0.001) to 31.6% to controls. The HLA+ frequency in the non-progressive (51.6%) and progressive MS groups (52.3%) was similar. The frequency of HLA+ CCSVI+ was 40.7% in progressive MS, 27.5% in non-progressive MS and 8.4% in controls. The presence of CCSVI was independent of HLA DRB1*1501 status in MS patients. Conclusions/Significance The lack of strong associations of CCSVI with HLA DRB1*1501 suggests that the role of the underlying associations of CCSVI in MS should be interpreted with caution. Further longitudinal studies should determine whether interactions between these factors can contribute to disease progression in MS."
https://openalex.org/W2002545338,"Proper control of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signaling is critical for normal development and regulated cell behaviors. Abnormal EGFR signaling is associated with tumorigenic process of various cancers. Complicated feedback networks control EGFR signaling through ligand production, and internalization-mediated destruction of ligand-receptor complexes. Previously, we found that two isoforms of D-Cbl, D-CblS and D-CblL, regulate EGFR signaling through distinct mechanisms. While D-CblL plays a crucial role in dose-dependent down-regulation of EGFR signaling, D-CblS acts in normal restriction of EGFR signaling and does not display dosage effect. Here, we determined the underlying molecular mechanism, and found that Drk facilitates the dose-dependent regulation of EGFR signaling through binding to the proline-rich motif of D-CblL, PR. Furthermore, the RING finger domain of D-CblL is essential for promoting endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex. Interestingly, a fusion protein of the two essential domains of D-CblL, RING- PR, is sufficient to down-regulate EGFR signal in a dose-dependent manner by promoting internalization of the ligand, Gurken. Besides, RING-SH2Drk, a fusion protein of the RING finger domain of D-Cbl and the SH2 domain of Drk, also effectively down-regulates EGFR signaling in Drosophila follicle cells, and suppresses the effects of constitutively activated EGFR. The RING-SH2Drk suppresses EGFR signaling by promoting the endosomal trafficking of ligand-receptor complexes, suggesting that Drk plays a negative role in EGFR signaling by enhancing receptor endocytosis through cooperating with the RING domain of D-Cbl. Interfering the recruitment of signal transducer, Drk, to the receptor by the RING-SH2Drk might further reduces EGFR signaling. The fusion proteins we developed may provide alternative strategies for therapy of cancers caused by hyper-activation of EGFR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2115533616,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated cation channels that exist throughout the mammalian central and peripheral nervous systems. ASIC1 is the most abundant of all the ASICs and is likely to modulate synaptic transmission. Identifying the proton-binding sites of ASCI1 is required to elucidate its pH-sensing mechanism. By using the crystal structure of ASIC1, the protonation states of each titratable site of ASIC1 were calculated by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation under conditions wherein the protonation states of all these sites are simultaneously in equilibrium. Four acidic-acidic residue pairs—Asp238-Asp350, Glu220-Asp408, Glu239-Asp346, and Glu80-Glu417—were found to be highly protonated. In particular, the Glu80-Glu417 pair in the inner pore was completely protonated and possessed 2 H+, implying its possible importance as a proton-binding site. The pKa of Glu239, which forms a pair with a possible pH-sensing site Asp346, differs among each homo-trimer subunit due to the different H-bond pattern of Thr237 in the different protein conformations of the subunits. His74 possessed a pKa of ≈6–7. Conservation of His74 in the proton-sensitive ASIC3 that lacks a residue corresponding to Asp346 may suggest its possible pH-sensing role in proton-sensitive ASICs."
https://openalex.org/W2016862442,"In studying the age dependence and chronology of ovarian tumors in follicle stimulating hormone receptor knockout mice, we identified a novel ovarian tumor associated gene-12 (OTAG-12), which is progressively downregulated and maps to Chr. 8B3.3. OTAG-12 protein overexpression in mouse ovarian and mammary tumor cells suggested powerful anti-proliferative effects. In human epithelial ovarian cancers (OCs) and OC cell lines, OTAG-12 mRNA expression is downregulated in comparison with normal ovaries. Cloning and identification revealed that human OTAG-12 mapping to gene-rich Chr. 19p13.12 is expressed in three spliced forms: hOTAG-12a, hOTAG-12b and hOTAG-12c, of which b is predominant in the normal ovary. Functionally active hOTAG-12b is a simple protein with no disulfide bonds and a nuclear localization signal is present in all variants. Transfection of OTAG-12 variants in OC and tumorigenic HEK293 cells confirmed nuclear localization. hOTAG-12b overexpression in OC and HEK293 cells effectively suppressed cell growth, anchorage-dependent and independent colony formation followed by apoptosis, whereas hOTAG-12a and hOTAG-12c had no such effects. Deletion mutants identified the critical importance of carboxyl terminus for hOTAG-12b function. Doxycycline-inducible growth inhibition of HEK293 cells by hOTAG-12a was associated with effects on G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. hOTAG-12b expression rendered tumorigenic cells more sensitive to four apoptotic stimuli including etoposide—a topoisomerase-II inhibitor. Doxycycline-induced hOTAG-12b expression blocked xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, whereas hOTAG-12a was ineffective. Although p53-pathway-dependent apoptotic agents could upregulate endogenous hOTAG-12b and p53 in UCI-101/107 OC cells, hOTAG-12b could also induce apoptosis in p53-null and platinum-resistant SKOV3 OC cells and Doxycycline-induced hOTAG-12b did not alter p53. Further study showed that hOTAG-12b increases mRNAs of pro-apoptotic genes such as BAD, GADD45α and CIEDB, while inhibiting anti-apoptotic NAIP and Akt1 expression, suggesting that hOTAG-12b-induced apoptosis might be p53-independent. These results indicate that hOTAG-12b is a putative ovarian tumor suppressor gene warranting further studies."
