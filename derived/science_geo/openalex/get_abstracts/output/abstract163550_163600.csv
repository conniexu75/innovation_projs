https://openalex.org/W2001675896,"Purification of rare hematopoietic stem cell(s) (HSC) to homogeneity is required to study their self-renewal, differentiation, phenotype, and homing. Long-term repopulation (LTR) of irradiated hosts and serial transplantation to secondary hosts represent the gold standard for demonstrating self-renewal and differentiation, the defining properties of HSC. We show that rare cells that home to bone marrow can LTR primary and secondary recipients. During the homing, CD34 and SCA-1 expression increases uniquely on cells that home to marrow. These adult bone marrow cells have tremendous differentiative capacity as they can also differentiate into epithelial cells of the liver, lung, GI tract, and skin. This finding may contribute to clinical treatment of genetic disease or tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W2107841008,"HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase (HMGR) catalyzes the committed step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins are HMGR inhibitors with inhibition constant values in the nanomolar range that effectively lower serum cholesterol levels and are widely prescribed in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We have determined structures of the catalytic portion of human HMGR complexed with six different statins. The statins occupy a portion of the binding site of HMG-CoA, thus blocking access of this substrate to the active site. Near the carboxyl terminus of HMGR, several catalytically relevant residues are disordered in the enzyme-statin complexes. If these residues were not flexible, they would sterically hinder statin binding."

https://openalex.org/W2012678641,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPA-Rs) mediate a majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. In hippocampus, most AMPA-Rs are hetero-oligomers composed of GluR1/GluR2 or GluR2/GluR3 subunits. Here we show that these AMPA-R forms display different synaptic delivery mechanisms. GluR1/GluR2 receptors are added to synapses during plasticity; this requires interactions between GluR1 and group I PDZ domain proteins. In contrast, GluR2/GluR3 receptors replace existing synaptic receptors continuously; this occurs only at synapses that already have AMPA-Rs and requires interactions by GluR2 with NSF and group II PDZ domain proteins. The combination of regulated addition and continuous replacement of synaptic receptors can stabilize long-term changes in synaptic efficacy and may serve as a general model for how surface receptor number is established and maintained."
https://openalex.org/W1985910710,"Telomere proteins from ciliated protozoa bind to the single-stranded G-rich DNA extensions at the ends of macronuclear chromosomes. We have now identified homologous proteins in fission yeast and in humans. These Pot1 (protection of telomeres) proteins each bind the G-rich strand of their own telomeric repeat sequence, consistent with a direct role in protecting chromosome ends. Deletion of the fission yeast pot1+ gene has an immediate effect on chromosome stability, causing rapid loss of telomeric DNA and chromosome circularization. It now appears that the protein that caps the ends of chromosomes is widely dispersed throughout the eukaryotic kingdom."

A genetic screen for suppressors of a hypermethylated clark kent mutant identified nine loss-of-function alleles of CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3), a novel cytosine methyltransferase homolog. These cmt3 mutants display a wild-type morphology but exhibit decreased CpXpG methylation of the SUP gene and of other sequences throughout the genome. They also show reactivated expression of endogenous retrotransposon sequences. These results show that a non-CpG DNA methyltransferase is responsible for maintaining epigenetic gene silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2145617194,"As a component of adherens junctions and the Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin binds cadherins, Tcf family transcription factors, and the tumor suppressor APC. We have determined the crystal structures of both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain complexed with the arm repeat region of β-catenin. The interaction spans all 12 arm repeats, and features quasi-independent binding regions that include helices which interact with both ends of the arm repeat domain and an extended stretch of 14 residues which closely resembles a portion of XTcf-3. Phosphorylation of E-cadherin results in interactions with a hydrophobic patch of β-catenin that mimics the binding of an amphipathic XTcf-3 helix. APC contains sequences homologous to the phosphorylated region of cadherin, and is likely to bind similarly."

https://openalex.org/W2029189987,"In eukaryotic cells, microtubules and their associated motor proteins can be organized into various large-scale patterns. Using a simplified experimental system combined with computer simulations, we examined how the concentrations and kinetic parameters of the motors contribute to their collective behavior. We observed self-organization of generic steady-state structures such as asters, vortices, and a network of interconnected poles. We identified parameter combinations that determine the generation of each of these structures. In general, this approach may become useful for correlating the morphogenetic phenomena taking place in a biological system with the biophysical characteristics of its constituents."
https://openalex.org/W2032685334,"The inherited human disease tuberous sclerosis, characterized by hamartomatous tumors, results from mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2. We have characterized mutations in the Drosophila Tsc1 and Tsc2/gigas genes. Inactivating mutations in either gene cause an identical phenotype characterized by enhanced growth and increased cell size with no change in ploidy. Overall, mutant cells spend less time in G1. Coexpression of both Tsc1 and Tsc2 restricts tissue growth and reduces cell size and cell proliferation. This phenotype is modulated by manipulations in cyclin levels. In postmitotic mutant cells, levels of Cyclin E and Cyclin A are elevated. This correlates with a tendency for these cells to reenter the cell cycle inappropriately as is observed in the human lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2067458366,"Tuberous sclerosis complex is a dominant disorder that leads to the development of benign tumors in multiple organs. We have isolated a mutation in the Drosophila homolog of TSC1 (Tsc1). Cells mutant for Tsc1 are dramatically increased in size yet differentiate normally. Organ size is also increased in tissues that contain a majority of mutant cells. Clones of Tsc1 mutant cells in the imaginal discs undergo additional divisions but retain normal ploidy. We also show that the Tsc1 protein binds to Drosophila Tsc2 in vitro. Overexpression of Tsc1 or Tsc2 alone in the wing and eye has no effect, but co-overexpression leads to a decrease in cell size, cell number, and organ size. Genetic epistasis data are consistent with a model that Tsc1 and Tsc2 function together in the insulin signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1667470855,"The epoxidation of olefins with H2O2 was performed with a tungsten-containing catalyst. This insoluble catalyst forms soluble active species by the action of H2O2, and when the H2O2 is used up, the catalyst precipitates for easy recycling. Thus, the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts are combined in one system through reaction-controlled phase transfer of the catalyst. When coupled with the 2-ethylanthraquinone/2-ethylanthrahydroquinone redox process for H2O2 production, O2 can be used for the epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide with 85% yield based on 2-ethylanthrahydroquinone without any co-products. This approach avoids the problematic co-products normally associated with the industrial production of propylene oxide."

https://openalex.org/W1984554514,"Stomata are microscopic pores on the surfaces of leaves, the number and density of which vary in response to changes in environmental conditions, such as carbon dioxide concentration and light. We show here that mature leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana detect and transmit this external information to new leaves of the same plant, producing an appropriate adjustment of stomatal development. As CO2 concentration controls both stomatal opening1 and number2,3, and stomatal numbers also increase with higher light intensity4, the large gradients of CO2 and light found within plant communities5 have the potential to influence stomatal development."
https://openalex.org/W2136090939,"A long record of atmospheric 14C concentration, from 45 to 11 thousand years ago (ka), was obtained from a stalagmite with thermal-ionization mass-spectrometric 230Th and accelerator mass-spectrometric 14C measurements. This record reveals highly elevated Delta14C between 45 and 33 ka, portions of which may correlate with peaks in cosmogenic 36Cl and 10Be isotopes observed in polar ice cores. Superimposed on this broad peak of Delta14C are several rapid excursions, the largest of which occurs between 44.3 and 43.3 ka. Between 26 and 11 ka, atmospheric Delta14C decreased from approximately 700 to approximately 100 per mil, modulated by numerous minor excursions. Carbon cycle models suggest that the major features of this record cannot be produced with solar or terrestrial magnetic field modulation alone but also require substantial fluctuations in the carbon cycle."

The intracellular localization and trafficking of ABCA1 was examined in stably and transiently transfected HeLa cells expressing a functional human ABCA1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein. The fluorescent chimeric ABCA1 transporter was found to reside on the cell surface and on intracellular vesicles that include a novel subset of early endosomes, as well as late endosomes and lysosomes. Studies of the localization and trafficking of ABCA1-GFP in the presence of brefeldin A or monensin, agents known to block intracellular vesicular trafficking, as well as apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux, showed that: (i) ABCA1 functions in lipid efflux at the cell surface, and (ii) delivery of ABCA1 to lysosomes for degradation may serve as a mechanism to modulate its surface expression. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy revealed that ABCA1-GFP-containing early endosomes undergo fusion, fission, and tubulation and transiently interact with one another, late endocytic vesicles, and the cell surface.

ABCA1-mediated cellular sterol efflux constitutes the initial step in the pathway of reverse cholesterol transport that ultimately leads to elimination of cholesterol from the body.

In the present study, a functional fluorescent chimeric human ABCA1-GFP protein expressed in living cells has revealed that early endosomes containing the ABCA1 transporter shuttle between the plasma membrane and other endocytic compartments. These studies suggest that the trafficking of ABCA1 in endocytic compartments may play important roles in apoA-I-mediated efflux of cellular lipids. HeLa and Chinese hamster vary (CHO) cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml of penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 100 µg/ml G418. CHO cells were transiently transfected with Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), using the expression plasmid pTRE2 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), encoding a chimeric ABCA1-GFP protein (pTRE2-ABCA1-GFP). Enhanced GFP along with a 5 amino acid glycine linker (Quantum Biologics, Vancouver, Canada) was fused in frame to the carboxyl terminus of human ABCA1, after first deleting the stop codon from the full-length ABCA1 cDNA (9Remaley A.T.

HeLa cells were also transiently and stably transfected with a chimeric ABCA1-GFP protein, as previously described (9Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G.

Briefly, HeLa (Tet-off) cells (CLONTECH, PaloAlto, CA) were co-transfected with pTRE2-ABCA1-GFP and pTK-Hyg (CLONTECH, PaloAlto, CA) at a ratio of 1:20 and selected with 500 µg/ml of hygromycin. Hygromycin-resistant cells were screened for expression of the fusion protein by fluorescence microscopy and positive clones were further purified by limiting dilution. Control cells were co-transfected with pTRE2 and pTK-Hyg (CLONTECH, PaloAlto, CA) at a ratio of 1:20 and selected with 500 µg/ml of hygromycin. ApoA-I purified from human plasma (22Brewer H.B. Ronan R. Meng M. Bishop C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was over 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE and amino-terminal sequence analysis. Cholesterol and phospholipid efflux were performed as previously described (8Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For cholesterol efflux, nearly confluent cells were labeled with 3H-cholesterol for 48 h, washed, and then incubated for the indicated times with in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 30 µg/ml apoA-I. Percentage efflux was calculated by subtracting the radioactive counts of blank media (DMEM/bovine serum albumin) from the radioactive counts in the presence of apoA-I, and then dividing the result by the sum of the radioactive counts in the medium plus the cell fraction. For phospholipid efflux, cells were labeled with methyl-3Hcholine chloride for 24 h, washed, and incubated for 24 h in DMEM/bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 30 µg/ml apoA-I. Cells in glass chamber slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were immunolabeled using an indirect procedure in which all incubations were performed either in blocker solution containing filipin (0.05%) and goat IgG (2.5 mg/ml) or 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing saponin (0.2%). Primary antibodies used were raised against human LAMP2, transferrin receptor, and p58K protein. Secondary Alexa-568-labeled antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution. Fluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss 410 or 510 laser scanning confocal microscope, using a krypton-argon-Omnichrome laser with excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm for enhanced green fluorescent protein and Alexa-568, respectively. Time-lapse images were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope equipped with a charged-coupled device camera (TEA/CCD-1317K/1, Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). For live cell imaging, cells were prepared on 40-mm coverslips, and temperature was maintained at 37 °C in Focht Chamber System 2 with an Objective Heater System (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). A total of 40 GFP images were acquired at the rate of 1/s (0.3-s exposure). Capture, animation, and export to QuickTime movie were performed using the IPLab software system (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). Structures in QuickTime movies were pseudocolored using Adobe AfterEffects 4.1 and Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software. ApoA-I-mediated efflux of cellular cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipids was enhanced 5-fold or more by ABCA1-GFP expression in stably transfected HeLa cells compared with control cells (Fig. 1). Thus, as previously shown, the fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein to the C terminus of ABCA1 does not interfere with its function (9Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B.

To further elucidate the intracellular trafficking pathways used by ABCA1, HeLa cells transiently expressing ABCA1-GFP were treated with cycloheximide, to prevent further delivery of newly synthesized protein to the cell surface, as well as with brefeldin A or monensin, agents that block both intracellular vesicular trafficking (27Klausner R.D.

The effect of these agents on the cellular distribution of ABCA1-GFP and their effects on cellular lipid efflux by ABCA1-GFP overexpression were monitored. Confocal microscopy reveals that blocking cellular protein synthesis with cycloheximide substantially reduced the total cellular levels of ABCA1-GFP including the amount residing at the cell surface (Fig.3 B). Cycloheximide treatment reduced ABCA1-GFP-mediated cellular sterol efflux to 51.9 ± 7.0% of controls (Fig. 5). These results are readily explained if in the absence of delivery of newly synthesized ABCA1-GFP to the cell surface the amount of ABCA1-GFP at the cell surface is reduced with time, as the existing cellular pool of protein is degraded, presumably in lysosomes.Figure 5Inhibition of protein synthesis or transport inhibits apoA-I-mediated efflux in HeLa cells expressing ABCA1-GFP. The effect of treatment with 5 µg/ml BFA or 10 µm monensin in the absence or presence of 100 µg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 6 h on the ability of apoA-I to mediate cholesterol efflux (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) in stably transfected HeLa cells expressing the human ABCA1-GFP fusion protein was examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) BFA causes the Golgi to fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum and blocks vesicular transport to the cell surface along the secretory pathway (27Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). Thus, BFA would be expected to cause newly synthesized ABCA1-GFP to accumulate in the fused Golgi-ER. In addition, BFA would be expected to reduce the amount of ABCA1-GFP at the cell surface and in endocytic compartments as ABCA1-GFP at the cell surface traffics along the endocytic pathway. As expected, ABCA1-GFP is considerably reduced at the surface of BFA-treated HeLa cells expressing ABCA1-GFP (Fig.3 C). Instead, ABCA1-GFP is seen to distribute in a cytosolic reticular pattern (Fig. 3 C), consistent with the trapping of newly synthesized ABCA1-GFP in the fused Golgi-ER. Treatment with BFA in the presence of cycloheximide resulted in a similar pattern of distribution of ABCA1-GFP in the Golgi-ER (Fig. 3 D). However, blocking protein synthesis greatly reduced the amount of ABCA1-GFP trapped by BFA in the hybrid organelle (Fig.3 D). BFA reduced ABCA1-GFP-induced cellular efflux of cellular sterol to 60.3 ± 6.5% of control values (Fig. 5). Thus, together with the progressive loss of ABCA1-GFP at the cell surface, there is a concomitant loss of ABCA1-stimulated cellular sterol efflux. Co-treatment with cycloheximide did not further reduce cellular sterol efflux (49.7 ± 8.4% of control values; Fig. 5). This latter finding suggests that the ABCA1-GFP trapped in the hybrid Golgi-ER organelle by the action of BFA does not promote efflux of cellular sterol. Monensin (28Mollenhauer H.H. Morre D.J. Rowe L.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), like brefeldin A (27Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar), blocks delivery of newly synthesized protein to the cell surface and thus is expected to reduce surface expression of ABCA1-GFP as well as apoA-I-mediated efflux. In addition, because monensin blocks protein degradation and trafficking out of late endosomes and lysosomes (28Mollenhauer H.H. Morre D.J. Rowe L.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), ABCA1-GFP would be expected to accumulate in LAMP2(+) late endosomes and lysosomes. Monensin treatment reduced the level of ABCA1-GFP residing at the cell surface, as revealed by confocal microscopy (Figs. 3 E and4). Monensin treatment also induced the localization of ABCA1-GFP in intracellular vesicles containing LAMP2 (Fig.4) as well as in late endocytic vesicles vitally labeled with endocytosed DiI-LDL (25Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or endocytosed tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (26Chen C.S. Bach G Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (data not shown). As seen in Fig.3 F, co-treatment with monensin and cycloheximide resulted in the accumulation of ABCA1-GFP in punctate cytoplasmic structures identified to be late endosomes/lysosomes by their co-localization with endocytosed DiI-LDL or tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (data not shown). The Golgi-specific marker p58 protein (30Bloom G.S. Brashear T.A J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not appreciably colocalize with LAMP2 (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that monensin causes ABCA1-GFP derived from the cell surface to become trapped in late endocytic compartments. As expected, based on the results of BFA treatment (Figs. 3 and5), associated with the monensin-induced loss of surface expression a considerable decrease (47.3 ± 3.8%) in apoA-I-mediated sterol efflux in HeLa cells stably transfected with ABCA1-GFP was observed (Fig. 5). Blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not further reduce the monensin-induced block in ABCA1-GFP-stimulated sterol efflux (43.3 ± 6.4%) (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results suggest that monensin blocks the movement of newly synthesized ABCA1-GFP to the cell surface and traps plasma membrane-derived ABCA1-GFP in late endocytic compartments. Time-lapse digital video fluorescence microscopy of ABCA1-GFP expressed in living cells revealed a complex intracellular trafficking pathway for the ABCA1-GFP transporter (Figs. 6 and 7; Movies 1–3 in the Supplemental Material). The fluorescent chimeric protein was seen to traffic in at least two types of intracellular vesicles: (i) small rapidly moving vesicles and (ii) large, static perinuclear vesicles (Figs. 6 and 7 and Movie 1 in Supplemental Material). Treatment of cells expressing ABCA1-GFP with U18666A (31Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11796-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) selectively enlarged the static, large ABCA1-GFP-containing perinuclear vesicles (data not shown). U18666A enlarges late endosomes/lysosomes as a result of the accumulation of cholesterol in these compartments (Refs. 32Neufeld E.B. Wastney M. Patel S. Suresh S. Cooney A.M. Dwyer N.K. Roff C.F.

Thus, the large, static ABCA1-GFP-containing perinuclear vesicles are likely to represent late endocytic compartments, whereas the small, fast-moving ABCA1-GFP-containing vesicles are likely to represent, for the most part, early endosomes.Figure 7ABCA1-GFP-containing endosomes interact with the cell surface in living cells. CHO cells were transiently transfected with ABCA1-GFP, and time-lapse image acquisition of GFP fluorescence was performed at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The large top panel shows a cell imaged in the first frame. The white arrowheads indicate the site where an ABCA1-GFP-containing endosome contacts the cell surface. Small, mobile ABCA1-GFP-containing endosomes are pseudocoloredmagenta, green, and blue. High magnification time-lapse images of a selected region of the cell (yellow box) are indicated by the image number. The dynamic interaction of a small, rapidly moving ABCA1-GFP vesicle (green) with the plasma membrane (arrowhead) can be seen. Note that the ABCA1-GFP-containing endosomes pseudocolored magenta and blue are identical to the corresponding vesicles seen in Fig. 6, whereas the ABCA1-GFP-containing endosome pseudocolored green represents a different vesicle than that in Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of these images revealed the dynamic interactions of ABCA1-GFP-containing early endosomes with one another as well as with ABCA1-GFP-containing late endocytic vesicles and the ABCA1-GFP-containing plasma membrane. As described below, ABCA1-GFP-containing early endosomes appear to shuttle between late endosomes/lysosomes and the plasma membrane in living cells. As seen in Fig. 6 (see also Movie 2 in Supplemental Material), a small ABCA1-GFP endosome (pseudocolored green) interacts with two other small ABCA1-GFP endosomes in frames 1–9 and28–31 (the endosome pseudocolored magenta) and in frames 2 and 3 (the endosome pseudocoloredblue). The small ABCA1-GFP endosome (magenta) remains relatively stationary during frames 1–37, moves rapidly in frame 38, and then appears to move out of the plane of focus in frames 39 and 40. As shown in Fig. 6, the small green ABCA1-GFP endosome appears to shuttle between the small magenta ABCA1-GFP endosome and the ABCA1-GFP-containing late endosomes (shown inwhite). The green ABCA1-GFP endosome remains associated with the magenta ABCA1-GFP endosome duringframes 1–8, then rapidly descends vertically while tubulating (frames 9–11), fuses with the ABCA1-GFP-containing late endosomes (shown in white) duringframes 11–12, and then remains fused to the ABCA1-GFP-containing late endosomes during frames 13–25. The green ABCA1-GFP endosome subsequently re-emerges from the ABCA1-GFP-containing late endosome compartment in frame 26, rapidly ascends vertically during frames 27–28, interacts with the magenta ABCA1-GFP endosome again duringframes 28–31, rapidly descends to the vicinity of the ABCA1-GFP-containing late endosomes during frames 31–34, and then appears to interact with the ABCA1-GFP-containing late endocytic vesicles (white) again during frames 34–40. An example of a small mobile ABCA1-GFP endosome that interacts with other small mobile ABCA1-GFP endosomes, as well as with the cell surface, can be seen in Fig. 7 and Movie 3 (Supplemental Material). The small ABCA1-GFP endosome (pseudocolored green) can be seen to interact intimately with the cell surface during frames 36–40. Note that prior to docking at the cell surface, the green ABCA1-GFP endosome interacts first with another small ABCA1-GFP endosome (shown inblue, during frames 16–18) and then fuses with very small ABCA1-GFP endosomes (shown in white, frames 28–31, 34, and 35). Image analysis further reveals the complex trafficking itinerary that a single ABCA1-GFP endosome can take. As seen in Fig. 6 (see also Movie 2 in Supplemental Material), the small mobile blue ABCA1-GFP endosome moves in a linear fashion across the field in frames 1–8, interacting with the small green ABCA1-GFP endosome in frames 2 and 3, then descends in a linear manner in frames 7–10, briefly interacts (frame 10) with late endosomes (shown in white, highlighted by the yellow arrow in frame 1), and then ascends vertically in a linear manner (frames 11–17) until it goes out of frame (frame 18). Note that the same small mobile blue ABCA1-GFP endosome seen in Fig. 6 can also be seen in Fig. 7 (frames 2–19) interacting subsequently with yet another small mobile ABCA1-GFP endosome (pseudocolored green in Fig. 7) during frames 16–18 (Fig. 7). The blue ABCA1-GFP endosome, which goes out of frame in Fig. 7 (frame 19), can be seen in Movie 1 (Supplemental Material) to ascend vertically and dock at the plasma membrane (during frames 19–28). Thus, the small mobileblue ABCA1-GFP endosome first interacts briefly with another small mobile ABCA1-GFP endosome (green, Fig. 6, frames 2 and 3), then interacts briefly with a large, immobile perinuclear late endosome (Fig. 6, frame 10), and finally interacts with another small, mobile ABCA1-GFP endosome for a longer period of time (pseudocolored green in Fig. 7,frames 16–18) prior to docking at the cell surface. Consistent with the perturbations observed by confocal microscopy (Fig.3), time-lapse video microscopy of living cells expressing ABCA1-GFP (Movie 4, Supplemental Material) revealed that BFA treatment resulted in a loss of ABCA1-GFP fluorescence at the cell surface and trapping of ABCA1-GFP in the cytosolic Golgi-ER compartment. Monensin treatment (Movie 4) resulted in a loss of ABCA1-GFP fluorescence at the cell surface and the trapping of ABCA1-GFP in large, static, intracellular vesicles. The human ABCA1 transporter is a polytopic membrane spanning protein that plays an essential role in apolipoprotein-mediated efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids. We have expressed a chimeric ABCA1-GFP protein to gain insight into the cellular localization and trafficking of the human ABCA1 transporter and its possible sites of function. We have identified at least three major cellular sites of ABCA1 localization in living cells, including the plasma membrane, as well as in early and late endocytic compartments (Fig.8). The ABCA1-GFP chimeric protein functions to efflux both cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipids. The present studies suggest that ABCA1 at the cell surface functions in cellular lipid efflux. This is supported by the observation that a reduction in the amount of ABCA1-GFP residing at the cell surface correlates with a reduction in apoA-I-mediated cellular lipid efflux. The present confocal microscopic immunolocalization studies have revealed that ABCA1-GFP is expressed not only on the plasma membrane but also on the surface of LAMP2(+)/DiI-LDL(+) late endocytic vesicles. ABCA1-GFP residing at the plasma membrane appears to traffic along the endocytic pathway to late endocytic compartments, because monensin causes ABCA1-GFP to accumulate in late endosomes/lysosomes while reducing the amount of ABCA1-GFP at the plasma membrane. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that ABCA1-GFP resides on the surface of both small, mobile vesicles as well as on large, relatively immobile perinuclear vesicles. The small, fast-moving ABCA1-GFP-containing vesicles are likely to represent early endosomes, whereas the ABCA1-GFP-containing large, static, perinuclear vesicles are likely to represent late endocytic compartments. The ABCA1-GFP-containing early endosomes undergo fusion and fission events. The ABCA1-GFP-containing early endosomes interact transiently with one another, with the ABCA1-GFP-containing late endocytic vesicles, and with the cell surface. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the ABCA1-GFP early endosomes appear to shuttle between the ABCA1-GFP late endocytic vesicles and the cell surface. The ABCA1-GFP-containing early endosomes tubulate while moving vectorially, consistent with directed movement along cytoskeletal elements such as microtubules or actin filaments. In addition to ABCA1, the membrane components that may be transferred from the ABCA1-GFP early endosomes to other cellular compartments remain to be determined but may include substrate lipids for ABCA1 and/or acceptor apolipoproteins. Indeed, recent studies have provided evidence that extracellular apolipoproteins are endocytosed and trafficked via a recycling compartment back to the cell surface prior to their release from the cell (21Takahashi Y. Smith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 34Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the compartment that appears to mediate the recycling of apolipoproteins is distinctive from the transferrin receptor recycling compartment (34Heeren J. Weber W. Beisiegel U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility exists that apoA-I and other apolipoproteins that are lipidated in an ABCA1-dependent manner may share an endocytic trafficking itinerary with ABCA1 in a novel endocytic recycling compartment. We have shown that delivery of the ABCA1 transporter to the cell surface is necessary for cellular lipid efflux. It remains to be determined, however, whether residence of the ABCA1 transporter at the surface is sufficient for its function or whether trafficking along the endocytic pathway plays a critical role in ABCA1 transporter function. Support for a potential functional role for ABCA1 in endocytic compartments is provided by the recent reports that the ABCA2 (35Zhou C.-J. Zhao L.-X. Inagaki N. Guan J.-L. Nakajo S. Hirabayashi T. Kikuyama S. Shioda S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 849-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ABCB9 (36Zhang F. Zhang W. Liu L. Fisher C. Hui D. Childs S. Dorovini-Zis K. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23287-23294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) transporters predominantly reside in and may function in endocytic compartments. Finally, delivery of ABCA1 to lysosomes for degradation may serve as a mechanism to modulate the surface expression of ABCA1 and hence cellular lipid efflux. Thus, the sorting of endocytosed ABCA1 into either the recycling or the lysosomal degradation pathways may serve to modulate cellular sterol efflux in a manner that may be amenable to pharmacological intervention. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIwMWI2ODk5YjRhNmU2MzRjMjI4NjQxODk3YjhkYTgyZCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjg4MDUyMjEyfQ.OSGyqMT9pBBRehTorS1euC00NjYN2obCHgpghvkDBYNBmW0styEYXdHaJWXfUFof7-_z4zLI49b10LAs3xpR_DuTAEOqacDWHfzSwVkdDTGEuBgkZHV7T3zm4i74A67PlniFmESOcuCiQNgc7_y05Wd03kmHWQBiwbU0oGxKHruLASS5avPHBqlF80toy7lHzCxn71C7cdXtUkS6s_Tpxix4IG89J6MGzTxOt__wEDEQVK9PrdKceM9JHiDa__GD8BLtUnzi32BqvYNO7EIp99iR4buIVa6VBA65Ax3Y60tIQ2jiAotzSjqdpMsWVPYAHGaV90EjOs5bKbm6slouYA Download .mp4 (0.08 MB) Help with .mp4 files eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiYzJmYWM4ZDBhNTY2ODZlMDg4YWRjM2NlYTEzNThjNSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjg4MDUyMjEyfQ.F3d5r4pJOHIw41jz6OKxYR_Y72ygH-w1oK3N2qQw4E_fEwRqp1iV0g75Pm3_9bspfDCk3pbb6aYl6FPs8zOWzpYOvZlp51G1nKwdarkG4XQGsQ3ISQlocRUwFjWaS0Kw6FX7cquk8rFI-NLf8Gxg_Meb-BVdxJjCsPb9xHe0px5vPp_5ulispJF1GwVwLCfaGcyExWgu0wrZ59-HyTETIs6HbIhsKR6nK4LWdxUBrBKG_tIpjNb4OyUu1BPgwyc94l1oitDqiEIZJ0qx7eSEU-pdHRDYnnNPIoE6CHTNWjO0eRRPilsz7UkdLgdcKPCjiVryIgZpvPLDQCtNlg0DWw Download .mp4 (0.07 MB) Help with .mp4 files eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJhYjA0Y2VmN2Q4MTA0OWM3MzczMDkwYzZmYmM1MmZmYSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjg4MDUyMjEyfQ.pntx_CY5UTHo3dc1-Kzip_hSA-pKaX8UjS-OulUPOb8rr45gvOuiqiV82MVebtNXfJDjZ0s4I9kqw-k7r9P_H_u_tL4jO5qkKhtwaDAPKNQW5wDaN03FGLA36Sicb9xQf5QFm7T_9gI0fcrToSt5uh_16BeuEWnkg9xtyT1ybQlWCrwf9L_IHBguUP0XhwIbLzXifmqvK63B8_RKII_z30JNvAAtZv838nfBgPHAfxW8JmX7OGXW5_9O_7j2bWxjrO1_cjJHVOdSRiLaXTxhOPBBmcC3EI0z4aGat3DdSkUL8QZqT69e90bagVfKdpPJ4lCXivna4vGmQ5P5VFyX5w Download .mp4 (0.07 MB) Help with .mp4 files eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI0YTQ4YzQzMzUxMmY3OTVhNzE3NzcyNmMyY2JjNDNiNyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjg4MDUyMjEyfQ.AMMDaOFrn40WOuFjhfKfQehCSdEQsXnRVoODKubf_3e-cmQPHDOX74fX5Nhg6UkAHEBbTNrZeF2hYjfkJY1dtngxhhGvUFDe6fiHJP725VCNJ3LZMa7rX-VvMn8odMDZ5-wVTijD4CUZjO_0wzlIeR7z__4wmHUgBAtKnSGarazAPe5GvfkMBc7fhsipQrjPfbau23AIpwuANj82yMVLhOtllfT1vu1SxLaoUQa-GWabgBBrVpOMfDQuVjctqf0zDOfgxfrGdwz5V-O5LCVBAMWJwdQKNnJ_tfrmeZspGqOwQ6uHjDc-up7OWxfo5jZMn6UNZAMlzwxLW1JYR7MC9g Download .mp4 (0.07 MB) Help with .mp4 files"

Basal harzburgite tectonite is overlain by cumulate ultramafic rocks, a mafic-ultramafic transition zone of interlayered gabbro and ultramafic cumulates, compositionally layered olivine-gabbro and pyroxenite, and isotropic gabbro. A sheeted dike complex is rooted in the gabbro and overlain by a mixed dike-pillow lava section, chert, and banded iron formation. The documentation of a complete Archean ophiolite implies that mechanisms of oceanic crustal accretion similar to those of today were in operation by 2.5 billion years ago at divergent plate margins and that the temperature of the early mantle was not extremely elevated, as compared to the present-day temperature. Plate tectonic processes similar to those of the present must also have emplaced the ophiolite in a convergent margin setting."

In fact, hydrated silicon dioxide (silica), the second most abundant biogenic mineral (biomineral), is produced by a wide range of organisms including animals and higher plants (1Lowenstam H.A. Science. 1981; 211: 1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). A large proportion of biogenic silica is formed by diatoms (2Tréguer P. Nelson D.M. van Bennekom A.J. DeMaster D.J. Leynaert A.

The intricate and ornate silicified cell walls of diatoms are one of the most outstanding examples of nanoscale-structured materials in nature. In the past, diatoms have been studied as model organisms to investigate the biochemical basis of biological silica formation (4Volcani B.E. Bendz G. Lindqvist I.

Nature. 2000; 403: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Recently, silica-associated components from different diatom species were identified that mediate the formation of silica nanospheres in vitro from a silicic acid solution (10Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Sumper M. Science. 1999; 286: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar, 11Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Bergsdorf C. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14133-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). These components are long-chain polyamines and polycationic polypeptides termed silaffins. The chemical structures of the polyamines have been completely elucidated. They are composed of linear chains of 8 to 20 N-methylated propylamine units that are attached to putrescine or a putrescine derivative (11Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Bergsdorf C. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14133-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is only incomplete information about the chemical structure of the silaffins. Recently, a silaffin-encoding gene, termedsil1, has been cloned from the diatom Cylindrotheca fusiformis. The encoded polypeptide sil1p serves as a precursor molecule, which becomes proteolytically processed and post-translationally modified to produce the silica-precipitating peptides silaffin-1A and silaffin-1B. It has been demonstrated that silaffin-1A represents a mixture of peptide isoforms, and that their silica-precipitating activity depends on the presence of modified lysine residues (10Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Sumper M. Science. 1999; 286: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). So far, two types of modified lysine residues (denoted Lysx and Lysy) have been characterized from the N-terminal octapeptide fragment SSKxKySGSY that is common to all silaffin-1A isoforms. Lysx represents a lysine residue that carries on its ε-amino group a linear polyamine consisting of 5 to 11 N-methylated propylamine units. Lysy has been shown to represent ε-N,N-dimethyllysine. However, no information was available for the chemical structures of the remaining parts of the silaffin-1A isoforms. In the present study we describe the silica-precipitating properties and complete the chemical structures of the peptides silaffin-1A1 and silaffin-1A2, which together account for all peptide isoforms of silaffin-1A.DISCUSSIONThe present study describes for the first time the complete chemical structures of silica-precipitating peptides found in cell walls of the diatom C. fusiformis. These are silaffin-1A1 and silaffin-1A2, which consist of 15 and 18 amino acid residues, respectively. Both peptides contain a total of four lysine residues, and all of these are targets for post-translational modifications. In silaffin-1A2, the lysine residues are clustered in two pairs with the first residue being linked to a long-chain polyamine and the second lysine being converted to ε-N,N-dimethyllysine. In silaffin-1A1, the same type of modified lysine pair is present only once within the N-terminal part of the peptide. The remaining two lysine residues in the C-terminal part are separated by two intercalated amino acids; this motif appears to alter the strategy of post-translational modification. The lysine residue at position 12 becomes modified to ε-N,N,N-trimethyl-δ-hydroxylysine, and it is now the C-terminal lysine residue that carries a long-chain polyamine modification. Remarkably, more than 30 years ago, Nakajima and Volcani (19Nakajima T. Volcani B.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 39: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) isolated and characterized for the first time ε-N,N,N-trimethyl-δ-hydroxylysine in acid hydrolysates of total cell wall preparations from a number of diatoms. However, the corresponding proteins in diatoms containing this special type of modification remained elusive. Silaffin-1A1 is (to our knowledge) the first polypeptide found in nature containing the ε-N,N,N-trimethyl-δ-hydroxylysine residue.Despite the structural differences of silaffin-1A1 and silaffin-1A2, both polycationic peptides show almost identical silica-precipitating activities and promote the formation of silica nanospheres in vitro (see Fig. 7). This result suggests that the silica-precipitating activities of silaffin-1A1 and silaffin-1A2 are dependent mainly on the polyamine modification attached to lysine residues. This is consistent with the finding that long-chain polyamines attached to putrescine that were isolated from diatom cell walls are also able to precipitate silica nanospheres (11Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Bergsdorf C. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14133-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), whereas synthetic silaffin peptides lacking the lysine modifications are unable to precipitate silica at pH < 7 in vitro (10Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Sumper M. Science. 1999; 286: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). In this respect it is interesting to note that silica formation in diatoms takes place in an acidic, intracellular compartment (20Vrieling E.G. Gieskes W.W.C. Beelen T.P.M. J. Phycol. 1999; 35: 548-559Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and thus the polyamine moieties of the silaffin-1A peptides appear to be essential to mediate silica precipitation under physiological conditions. The ε-N,N,N-trimethyl-δ-hydroxylysine present in silaffin-1A1 is a structural element that might influence the ultrastructure of the precipitating silica. Remarkably, quaternary ammonium compounds are used in the technical production of zeolites for patterning of silicate structures in the nanometer size range (21Burkett S.L. Davies M.E. Alberti G. Bein T. Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry. Pergamon, Oxford1996: 465-483Google Scholar). Possibly, the ε-N,N,N-trimethyl-δ-hydroxylysine residue exerts a similar function in biosilica formation.The role of the polypeptide backbones in silaffin-1A-mediated silica formation is much less clear. Isolation of silaffins from diatom biosilica involves treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride that converts silica to volatile silicon tetrafluoride. Although this treatment does not attack peptide bonds, it does however specifically cleave O-glycosidic bonds (22Mort A.J. Lamport D.T.A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Silaffins contain a large number of hydroxyamino acid residues, which may be targets forO-glycosylation. However, a completely different technique for the extraction of silaffins from biosilica is required to investigate this possibility.Comparison of the silaffin-1A1 and silaffin-1A2sequences with the sequences deduced from the sil1 gene revealed that during maturation of the silaffins, the C-terminal tetrapeptides RRIL and RRNL, respectively, become cleaved off. This processing step completely removes all arginine residues that are originally present in the silaffin precursor polypeptide sil1p (see Fig. 1 B). Remarkably, arginine is the biosynthetic precursor of putrescine (23Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar), and the latter has been shown to serve as the attachment site for long-chain polyamines in C. fusiformisand other diatoms (11Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Bergsdorf C. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14133-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that sil1p is also the precursor for the putrescine-linked polyamines. After conversion of the arginine residues in the silaffin precursor to ornithine residues, the latter may become modified by the same enzymatic machinery that attaches propylamine units to the appropriate lysine residues in silaffins. Subsequently, silaffin peptides and putrescine-based polyamines could be produced simultaneously by proteolytic processing and decarboxylation of the polyamine-modified ornithine residues. If so, sil1p of C. fusiformis would give rise to two different sets of silica-precipitating molecular species. Silicon oxide minerals, the main constituents of the earth's crust, are not exclusively formed by geological processes. In fact, hydrated silicon dioxide (silica), the second most abundant biogenic mineral (biomineral), is produced by a wide range of organisms including animals and higher plants (1Lowenstam H.A. Science. 1981; 211: 1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). A large proportion of biogenic silica is formed by diatoms (2Tréguer P. Nelson D.M. van Bennekom A.J. DeMaster D.J. Leynaert A. Quéginer B. Science. 1995; 268: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), which are unicellular algae that are ubiquitously present in marine and freshwater habitats (3Round F. Crawford R. Mann D. The Diatoms. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1990Google Scholar). The main attribute of a diatom cell is its silica based cell wall. The intricate and ornate silicified cell walls of diatoms are one of the most outstanding examples of nanoscale-structured materials in nature. In the past, diatoms have been studied as model organisms to investigate the biochemical basis of biological silica formation (4Volcani B.E. Bendz G. Lindqvist I.

https://openalex.org/W2158204425,"Previous studies showed that following acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment, interleukin-6 null (IL-6−/−) mice develop increased hepatocellular injury, defective regeneration, delayed wound healing, and increased hepatocyte apoptosis. Pretreatment with IL-6 prior to CCl4 reduces injury, hepatocyte apoptosis, and accelerates regeneration in both IL-6−/− and +/+ livers. To demonstrate whether IL-6 can prevent liver injury that involves direct stimulation of hepatocyte apoptosis, IL-6−/− and +/+ mice were treated with the Fas agonist, Jo-2 mAb. At low Fas agonist doses, IL-6+/+ mice developed mild hepatic injury and survived, whereas IL-6−/− mice developed severe apoptotic hepatitis within 12 h and died. Pretreatment with IL-6 improved survival in IL-6−/− mice and reduced injury in both IL-6−/− and +/+ livers. The direct anti-apoptotic effects of IL-6 were demonstrated in vitro as IL-6 decreased Fas-mediated apoptosis in both IL-6−/− and +/+ primary hepatocyte cultures, and suggested that IL-6−/− hepatocytes have a pre-existing defect in anti-apoptotic pathways. After Fas activation, IL-6−/− livers demonstrated evidence of both proximal and distal alterations in the apoptotic pathways including elevated caspase 8 and 3 activation-associated fragments, and loss of cytochrome c staining. IL-6−/− livers had reduced pre-existing protein expression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as more rapid degradation of FLIP following Fas treatment that appeared to be post-transcriptionally regulated. FLIP is a crucial proximal inhibitor of caspase 8 activation in Fas, tumor necrosis factor, and DR3/DR4-mediated apoptosis, and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL more downstream anti-apoptotic regulators. IL-6 may function as a critical anti-apoptotic factor in the liver by its ability to establish and maintain an adequate level of FLIP and downstream anti-apoptotic factors.

IL-6−/− livers had reduced pre-existing protein expression of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL as well as more rapid degradation of FLIP following Fas treatment that appeared to be post-transcriptionally regulated. FLIP is a crucial proximal inhibitor of caspase 8 activation in Fas, tumor necrosis factor, and DR3/DR4-mediated apoptosis, and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL more downstream anti-apoptotic regulators. IL-6 may function as a critical anti-apoptotic factor in the liver by its ability to establish and maintain an adequate level of FLIP and downstream anti-apoptotic factors. tumor necrosis factor interleukin-6 IL-6 null IL-6 wild type Fas-associated death-domain-like IL-1 β-converting enzyme FLICE-inhibitory protein signal transducers and activators of transcription aspartate aminotransferase monoclonal antibody Fas-associated death domain Fas receptor hematoxylin and eosin Although apoptosis may have originally evolved as a physiologic process, diverse pathologic processes are able to directly or indirectly activate the cell death mechanism. In the liver, apoptosis has been implicated in liver injury and hepatic failure from specific drugs and toxins, viral infection, autoimmune disorders, ischemia, allograft rejection, and sepsis (1Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2Tokushige K. Yamaguchi N. Ikeda I. Hashimoto E. Yamauchi K. Hayashi N. Am. J.

Med. 1999; 189: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). TNF-α,1interferon-γ, IL-1, and Fas have been shown to be important in hepatitis (1Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2Tokushige K. Yamaguchi N. Ikeda I. Hashimoto E. Yamauchi K. Hayashi N. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 95: 2040-2046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The liver is very sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. When mice are injected with anti-Fas antibody, the cause of death is secondary to liver failure (4Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar). In addition, Fas−/− mice show hepatic hyperplasia, suggesting that the Fas pathway may be important for establishing liver structure (5Adachi M. Suematsu S. Kondo T. Ogasawara J. Tanaka T. Yoshida N. Nagata S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Likewise, neutralizing antibodies against FasL or TNFR-1 receptors improve survival in hepatitis B virus surface antigen transgenic mice treated with hepatitis B virus surface antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (1Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The potential hepatic anti-apoptotic role of IL-6, a known anti-apoptotic factor, was not known. However, it has been established that IL-6 has an important role in liver regeneration and repair from injury. IL-6−/− livers have impaired liver regeneration characterized by liver necrosis and failure, a blunted DNA response in hepatocytes, and discrete G1 phase abnormalities including absence of STAT3 activation, and selective abnormalities in gene expression (6Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) that are corrected with pretreatment with IL-6. The acute liver injury noted in IL-6−/− livers following partial hepatectomy was not associated with increased hepatocyte apoptosis (6Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). IL-6 also ameliorates acute toxic liver injury (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Following a single dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), IL-6−/− livers developed increased hepatocellular injury and defective regeneration with significant blunting of STAT3 and NF-κB activation and reduced hepatocyte DNA synthetic and mitotic responses. Increased hepatocyte apoptosis was also noted in IL-6−/− livers after CCl4treatment. Pretreatment with IL-6 prior to CCl4 reduced CCl4-induced injury and apoptosis, and accelerated regeneration in both IL-6+/+ and −/− livers (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of IL-6 protection against CCl4-induced liver injury was unknown. CCl4 is a hepatotoxin that causes direct hepatocyte injury by altering permeability of cellular, lysosomal, and mitochondrial membranes (8Berger M.L. Bhatt H. Combes B. Estabrook R.W. Hepatology. 1986; 6: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). More significant is the indirect injury due to highly reactive free radicals formed from the metabolism of CCl4 (8Berger M.L. Bhatt H. Combes B. Estabrook R.W. Hepatology. 1986; 6: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Slater T.F. Nature. 1966; 209: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that CCl4 causes not only primary liver necrosis but also hepatocyte apoptosis (10Shi J. Aisaki K. Ikawa Y. Wake K. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CCl4 liver injury is associated with high levels of TNF-α, which is felt to enhance injury and promote hepatocyte apoptotic death (11Czaja M.J. Xu J. Alt E. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 1849-1854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The purpose of the current investigation was to determine if IL-6 exerts its protective effect on the liver at least in part through modulation of the apoptotic cell death program. Unlike CCl4, the binding of Fas ligand (FasL) or an agonistic antibody such as Jo-2 mAb to the Fas receptor directly causes hepatic injury by stimulating the apoptotic cell death program (4Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar). To demonstrate whether IL-6 can modulate liver injury that involved direct stimulation of hepatocyte apoptosis, IL-6−/− and +/+ mice were treated with low levels of the Fas agonist Jo-2 mAb. In contrast to IL-6+/+ mice, IL-6−/− mice developed lethal severe apoptotic hepatitis. Treatment with IL-6 prior to Jo-2 mAb improved survival in IL-6−/− mice and reduced injury in both IL-6−/− and +/+ livers. The direct anti-apoptotic effects of IL-6 were demonstrated in vitro by its ability to decrease Fas-mediated apoptosis in both IL-6−/− and +/+ primary hepatocyte cultures, and suggested that IL-6−/− hepatocytes had a pre-existing defect in apoptotic pathways. Several proximal and distal markers of apoptosis were elevated in IL-6−/− livers treated with Fas agonist. The finding of reduced levels of FLIP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic factors in IL-6−/− livers indicates that IL-6 acts at several points in the apoptotic pathway to protect the liver against cell death. Studies were performed on C57BL6/SV129 IL-6−/− and +/+ mice 12–16 weeks of age. The IL-6 knockout mice were generated as described (12Poli V. Balena R. Fattori E. Markatos A. Yamamoto M. Tanaka H. Ciliberto G. Rodan G.A. Costantini F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). IL-6+/+ and −/− colonies shared the same mixed C57BL6/SV129 background (back bred an additional generation onto C57BL6 from original C57BL6/SV129 mixture, thus 3/1 C57BL6/SV129). Heterozygotes were back bred to maintain genetic similarity of the +/+ and −/− colonies. The IL-6 genotype was confirmed in the breeders from each group by genomic DNA isolation and polymerase chain reaction as previously described (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). IL-6−/− mice are developmentally normal and display abnormalities in the hepatic acute phase response, some immune mechanisms, and bone resorption in response to estrogen (4Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar,12Poli V. Balena R. Fattori E.

Mice were used with approval of IACUC and under National Institutes of Health guidelines. In order to control for weight differences between mice, we injected 8 IL-6−/− and 8 IL-6+/+ mice, an equal ratio of males and females ranging from 12 to 16 weeks old were injected intraperitoneally with 0.4 µg/g weight of animal of the Fas agonist, Jo-2 mAb (PharMingen) following dilution to 100 µl total volume with sterile normal saline (15Fattori E. Cappelletti M. Costa P. Sellitto C. Cantoni L. Carelli M. Faggioni R. Fantuzzi G. Ghezzi P. Poli V. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 16Rouquet N. Pages J.C. Molina T. Briand P. Joulin V. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1192-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The average dose of Jo-2 mAb was 12.75 µg for 8 IL-6−/− mice and 13.24 µg for 8 IL-6+/+ mice. The mice were monitored on the half-hour for 24 h and the time of death was recorded. Necropsy was performed after loss of heart beat and the cessation of respiration for 5 min in 3 IL-6−/− and 3 IL-6+/+ animals. Liver, heart, lung, and kidney were harvested for H&E staining and TUNEL assay as described (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The dose of Fas agonist was then sequentially reduced to 0.15 µg/g weight of Jo-2 mAb, the dose where initially, a number of IL-6+/+ mice survived for 18–24 h. Eight IL-6−/− and 8 IL-6+/+ mice were given 0.15 µg/g weight of Jo-2 mAb by sterile intraperitoneal injection following dilution to 100 µl total volume with sterile normal saline. The IL-6−/− and IL-6+/+ mice received an average dose of 4.44 and 4.64 µg of Jo-2 mAb, respectively. The mice were monitored on the half-hour for 24 h and the time of death was recorded as above. Subsequently, IL-6−/− and +/+ mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.15 µg/g Jo-2 mAb and livers were harvested for histology and TUNEL staining at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 18 h post-injection. For IL-6 treatment cohorts, mice were injected subcutaneously with human recombinant IL-6 (+IL-6) at 1 µg/g wt (0.5% IL-6 solution in phosphate-buffered saline) (Gennaro Ciliberto) 20 min prior to 0.15 µg/g weight intraperitoneal injection of Jo-2 mAb and liver was harvested for histology and TUNEL staining at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 18 h post-injection. Four mice were studied at each time point in each cohort. Following IL-6 treatment, 8 IL-6+/+ mice received 0.4 µg/g Jo-2 mAb for an average dose of 12.86 mg and 8 IL-6−/− mice received 0.15 µg/g Jo-2 mAb for an average dose of 4.46 µg. The mice were monitored on the half-hour for 24 h and the time of death was recorded. There were no significant weight differences between IL-6−/− and +/+ mice in any of the treatment cohorts studied. All treatment cohorts had an equal ratio of males and females ranging from 12 to 16 weeks old. Four animals in each cohort were sacrificed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 h following treatment with 0.15 µg/g Jo-2 mAb. Cohorts of IL-6−/− and +/+ mice were also pretreated with a single subcutaneous injection of human recombinant IL-6 (+IL-6) at a dose of 1 µg/g weight 20 min prior to 0.15 µg/g Jo-2 mAb injection. Four animals in each IL-6 pretreated cohort were sacrificed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 h. Four sham IL-6+/+ controls received 100 µl weight of sterile saline intraperitoneally and were sacrificed at 0, 0.5, 2, and 4 h. Under metophane anesthesia 200 µl of blood was harvested from the right ventricle of the heart and the animal was then sacrificed by prompt total hepatectomy (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The anterior two-thirds of the liver was processed for protein and/or RNA analysis and the posterior one-third of the liver was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Formalde-Fresh; Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ) (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 17Redondo C. Flores I. Gonzalez A. Nagata S. Carrera A.C. Merida I.

Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The formalin-fixed livers were then paraffin embedded in an automated tissue processor. 5-µm liver sections were analyzed by H&E staining and immumohistochemistry (below). Serum was analyzed (Anilytics Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, creatinine, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Four livers from each cohort were examined at 0-, 6-, 12-, and 18-h time points following 0.15 µg/g weight intraperitoneally of Jo-2 mAb (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) % apoptotic hepatocytes. This was quantified by counting the average number of apoptotic hepatocytes per ×10 field of H&E stained IL-6−/− and +/+ livers. Apoptosis was monitored histologically by scoring cellular condensation, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, aggregation of basophilic chromatin at the nuclear membrane (pearl necklace appearance), condensation, and fragmentation of nuclear material into membrane bound vesicles (9Slater T.F. Nature. 1966; 209: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 11Czaja M.J. Xu J. Alt E.

Ten fields per liver specimen were counted. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and had excellent correlation with the H&E histologic data (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Primary mouse hepatoctyes were isolated using the two-step collagenase perfusion method adapted from Thorgeirsson and co-workers (21Kao C.Y. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Under metofane anesthesia, the portal vein was exposed and canulated with a 25-gauge IV catheter secured to the portal vein by 4-0 surgical silk. The inferior vena cava was ligated and cut distal to ligature. The liver was perfused with a 37 °C Hanks' balanced solution without calcium or magnesium containing 10 mm HEPES (Biofluids) and 0.2 mmEGTA (Sigma) for ∼5 min. This was followed by perfusion with filter sterilized, 0.6 mg/ml solution of collagenase type 1 (Worthington Biochemical) in Williams buffer (glutamine-free Williams medium (Biofluids) with 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4) for 5–10 min. Viable hepatocytes (∼95%) were selected by isodensity centrifugation in Percoll and were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media supplemented with 6.25 mg/ml transferrin, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml galactose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.014 m sodium bicarbonate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine (BioWhitaker), 18 mmHEPES, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Viability was assessed with trypan blue exclusion. (22Hatano E. Bradham C.A. Stark A. Iimuro Y. Lemasters J.J. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11814-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) 3 × 106 hepatocytes were plated out per 35-mm plastic Petri dish containing a coverslip that was coated with rat tail collagen type 1 (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 0.5% CO2. Media was changed after 4 h attachment. Only hepatocyte cultures of 85–90% confluence and >95% viability were retained and placed in incubator for further study. Cultures were re-examined at 18 h to ensure >95% hepatocyte viability. IL-6−/− and +/+ hepatocyte cultures were treated under differing conditions: 1) control; 2) 20 µm MG132 (Biomol Research, Plymouth Meeting, PA), which inhibits NF-κB activation by preventing IκB degradation (22Hatano E.

IL-6 was given 1 h and MG132 30 min prior to Jo-2 mAb treatment. Two culture plates were studied for each condition per liver. Paired liver perfusions and cultures of IL-6−/− and IL-6+/+ livers were performed on the same days. A total of 3 livers in each cohort were studied (6 plates/condition). After 5 h, the culture media was removed and cells were fixed with 2 ml of paraformaldehyde (3.6 gm in 100 ml of 1 × phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min then washed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was then performed. Six slides were examined for each experiment and percent apoptosis was calculated for 5 random ×10 fields/slide. Mean percent apoptosis was calculated after counting the TUNEL positive brown nuclei (apoptotic) and TUNEL negative (non-apoptotic) nuclei within hepatocytes. Nuclear extracts from the anterior two-thirds of the livers were prepared as described (6Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar) and stored at −70 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 6.7), 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with protease inhibitors, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2MoO4. All extracts were prepared in the presence of antipain, aprotinin, bestatin, and leupeptin (each at 2 mg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Protease inhibitors were added immediately at the time of harvest. Binding and supershift reactions for STAT3 and NF-κB were performed essentially as described (6Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). α-STAT3 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used in the STAT3 supershift experiment. Preparation of whole liver cell extracts, protein electrophoresis, protein transfer, and protein detection was carried out as previously described (7Kovalovich K. DeAngelis R.A. Li W. Furth E.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 22Hatano E. Bradham C.A. Stark A. Iimuro Y. Lemasters J.J. Brenner D.A. J. Biol.

Primary antibodies used were Fas receptor, FADD, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, caspase 3, Bax (Santa Cruz), β-actin (Sigma), BID (R & D Systems), FLIP, and caspase 8 (StressGen Biotechnologies, Canada) in a dilution of 1:1000. β-Actin protein expression was used to normalize protein loading for each blot. Secondary anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used in a dilution of 1:10,000. Protein expression was measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h to note any differences between IL-6−/− and +/+ livers. Significant time points were re-examined in triplicate with extracts from three livers for each treatment group. The immunoblot was scanned densitometrically to quantify protein levels (Image-Quant Software, Molecular Dynamics). A mouse anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (PharMingen), which solely recognizes the cytochrome c localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane but not cytochrome c released into the cytosol following Fas signaling was used to qualitatively demonstrate transduction of the Fas apoptotic pathway (23Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Formalin-fixed, parafin-embedded IL-6−/−, +/+, and −/−(+IL-6) liver sections were studied 0, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h following intraperitoneal injection with 0.15 µg/g weight Jo-2 mAb (see above) for immunofluorescent mitochrondrial localization of cytochromec with TSA-Direct (PerkinElmer Life Science) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Sections from three livers per cohort were examined at each time point. The cytochrome c primary antibody dilution was 1:250. The horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody was diluted to 1:1000. Slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). For RNA preparation, anterior two-thirds of IL-6−/−, +/+, and −/−(+IL-6) livers were harvested, 3 livers per cohort per time point, and total liver RNA preparation was performed as described (6Cressman D.E.

Constitutive (time 0) mRNA expression of Bcl-xL, Bax, Bcl-2, and L32 (loading control) was assessed by the multiprobe ribonuclease protection assay, mAPO-2 Multi-Probe Template (PharMingen). FLIP mRNA expression was measured at 0 h for IL-6−/− and +/+ livers by total liver RNA preparation, Northern blots, and hybridizations performed as described (6Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E.

StatWorks (Apple Software, Cupertino, CA), Chi square test, and Student's t test were used for statistical analysis. IL-6 reduced hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis following CCl4 treatment. However, CCl4 injury is multifactorial and is mediated by disruption of membrane permeability, TNF-α, and the generation of toxic-free radicals (8Berger M.L. Bhatt H. Combes B. Estabrook R.W.

To show whether IL-6 can prevent liver injury that involves direct stimulation of hepatocyte apoptosis, we injected IL-6−/− and +/+ mice with a single, 0.4 µg/g intraperitoneal dose of the Fas agonist, Jo-2 mAb. All IL-6−/− mice became lethargic and died rapidly (Fig.1 A) with an average time to death of 8 h. IL-6+/+ mice appeared lethargic at 6 h and 7 subsequently died (Fig. 1 A) with an average time to death of 10 h. There was one IL-6+/+ survivor. Although not significantly different, the data suggested that IL-6+/+ mice had a slight survival advantage over IL-6−/− mice. The dose of Fas agonist was then reduced to 0.15 µg/g where a distinction was observed in both survival and the degree of histologic liver injury between IL-6−/− and +/+ mice. All 8/8 IL-6−/− mice died within 24 h and all 8/8 IL-6+/+ mice survived (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1 B). IL-6−/− and +/+ livers were then examined at various time points following treatment with 0.15 µg/g Jo-2 mAb. Histologically, at 3 h, there was no evidence of hepatocyte apoptosis in either cohort. At 6 h, rare (<1%) apoptotic hepatocytes were noted in IL-6+/+ livers (Fig.2 A). In contrast, at 6 h there was panlobular hepatocyte apoptosis in IL-6−/− livers with 45.5 ± 4.8% apoptotic hepatocytes (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 B). These differences in apoptotic liver injury were supported by a >20-fold mean elevation in the ALT and a >10-fold mean elevation in the AST in IL-6−/− serum. The ALT and AST remained within normal limits in the IL-6+/+ serum (p = 0.02) (Fig. 3). At 12 h, there was 33.6 ± 6.2% apoptotic hepatocytes in IL-6+/+ liversverses 91.6 ± 5.1% apoptotic hepatocytes in IL-6−/− livers (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2, C a"

The proposed chiral crystal consists of square spiral posts on a tetragonal lattice. In the case of silicon posts in air (direct structure), the full PBG can be as large as 15% of the gap center frequency, whereas for air posts in a silicon background (inverted structure) the maximum PBG is 24% of the center frequency. This PBG occurs between the fourth and fifth bands of the photon dispersion relation and is very robust to variations (disorder) in the geometrical parameters of the crystal."

https://openalex.org/W1967092440,"T cell activation is dependent on both a primary signal delivered through the T cell receptor and a secondary costimulatory signal mediated by coreceptors. Although controversial, costimulation is thought to act through the specific redistribution and clustering of membrane and intracellular kinase-rich lipid raft microdomains at the contact site between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. This site has been termed the immunological synapse. Endogenous mediators of raft clustering in lymphocytes have not been identified, although they are essential for T cell activation. We now demonstrate that agrin, an aggregating protein crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction, is also expressed in lymphocytes and is important in reorganization of membrane lipid microdomains and setting the threshold for T cell signaling. Our data show that agrin induces the aggregation of signaling proteins and the creation of signaling domains in both immune and nervous systems through a common lipid raft pathway."

Photoemission spectroscopy results show that films of N = 1, 2, and 5 monolayer thicknesses are structurally stable for temperatures above 800 kelvin, whereas films of other thicknesses are unstable and bifurcate into a film with N +/- 1 monolayer thicknesses at temperatures around 400 kelvin. The results are in agreement with theoretical predictions that consider the electronic energy of the quantum well associated with a particular film thickness as a significant contribution to the film stability."

Monocytic cells express several P2Y receptors but the role of these G protein-coupled receptors in monocytes is not known. Here, we present evidence that P2Y6 regulates chemokine production and release in monocytes. We find that UDP, a selective P2Y6 agonist, stimulates interleukin (IL)-8 release in human THP-1 monocytic cells whereas other nucleotides are relatively inactive. P2 receptor antagonists or P2Y6 antisense oligonucleotides inhibit IL-8 release induced by UDP. Furthermore, UDP specifically activated IL-8 production in astrocytoma 1321N1 cells transfected with human P2Y6. Since lipopolysaccharide has been suggested to activate P2 receptors via nucleotide release, we tested whether IL-8 production stimulated by lipopolysaccharide might result from P2Y6 activation. P2 antagonists or apyrase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes nucleotides including UDP, inhibit IL-8 production induced by lipopolysaccharide but not by other stimuli. Furthermore, IL-8 gene expression activated by lipopolysaccharide is enhanced by P2Y6 overexpression and inhibited by P2Y6 antisense oligonucleotides. Thus, UDP activates IL-8 production via P2Y6 in monocytic cells. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide mediates IL-8 production at least in part by autocrine P2Y6 activation.

P2 nucleotide receptors include two distinct subtypes classified as P2X and P2Y receptors. P2X are ligand-gated ion channels permeable to Na+ and K+ whereas P2Y are G protein-coupled receptors. Cloned human P2 receptors include seven P2X (P2X1–7) and six P2Y (P2Y1,2,4,6,11,12) (1Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D.

P2 receptors exhibit a wide tissue distribution and display a very complex pharmacology. For example, ATP activates P2Y1, P2Y2, and all P2X; ADP activates P2Y12 and is a potent agonist of P2Y1 receptor; UTP is the most potent ligand at P2Y4 and UDP selectively activates P2Y6 (5Evans R.J.

Monocytic cell line and primary monocytes express several P2X (P2X1, P2X7) as well as P2Y (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6) receptors (8Berchtold S. Ogilvie A.L.J. Bogdan C. Mulh-Zurbes P. Ogilvie A.

Many studies of P2 receptors in monocytes have focused on P2X7 that is mainly expressed on monocytic cells (11Surprenant A Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). In monocytic cells or in LPS1-primed monocytes, extracellular ATP regulates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways including caspase-1 activation, IL-1β release, and nitric-oxide synthase via P2X7 (12Balboa M.A. Balsinde J.

Previous studies have suggested a role for extracellular nucleotides in regulating cellular responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). For instance, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation by LPS in macrophages can be inhibited by P2 nucleotide antagonists (15Hu Y. Fisette P.L. Denlinger L.C. Guadarrama A.G. Sommer J.A. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27170-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, LPS was shown to activate IL-1 secretion via ATP release and autocrine stimulation (16Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 17Imai M. Goepfert C. Kaczmarek E. Robson S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Monocytes exposed to LPS also synthesize large amounts of IL-8, a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils and monocytes (18Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Whether LPS-induced IL-8 release is also regulated by extracellular nucleotides is not known. Previous studies by us and others have reported the presence of P2Y6 transcripts in human spleen, placenta, thymus, small intestine, and leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) suggesting that P2Y6 plays a role in immune defenses (7Communi D. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,10Jin J. Dasari V.R. Sistare F.D. Kunapuli S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the physiological responses mediated by UDP and P2Y6 are not known. Our initial experiments showed that UDP activated IL-8 release by monocytic cells and led us to explore this new pathway of monocyte activation. Here, we show that in monocytic cells, P2Y6mediates IL-8 production and IL-8 gene expression in response to UDP or LPS. Our studies demonstrate a new role for P2Y6 in chemokine production and innate immune defenses. Human monocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were stably transfected with a pcDNA3 expression vector encoding the human P2Y6 receptor and selected as described previously (7Communi D. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Transfected 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 400 µg/ml G418. Mouse peritoneal macrophages isolated as previously described (19Ajuebor M.N. Das A.M. Virag L. Flower R.J. Szabo C. Perretti M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1685-1691PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8 concentration was determined using a double-ligand enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a goat anti-human IL-8 antibody (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described (20Warny M. Keates A.C. Keates S. Castagliuolo I. Zacks J.K. Aboudola S. Qamar A. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Kelly C.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were transiently transfected as described previously (20Warny M. Keates A.C. Keates S. Castagliuolo I. Zacks J.K. Aboudola S. Qamar A. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Kelly C.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The IL-8 reporter construct was a generous gift from Andrew C. Keates, Ph.D. Briefly, THP-1 cells were suspended in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 80 µg of DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 7 µg of DNA. In co-transfection experiments, total DNA was kept constant at 7 µg using control vector and 1 µg of reporter plasmid DNA was transfected. Following transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h before stimulation. Cell lysis and luciferase assay were performed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Enzyme activity was determined on the protein fractions as previously described (21Sévigny J. Levesque F.P. Grondin G. Beaudoin A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme activity was tested in 150 mm NaCl, 8 mmCaCl2, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Apyrase was added to the reaction buffer and was preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min. The reaction was started by addition of 0.3 mm substrate (ATP, ADP, UTP, or UDP as indicated), then terminated at 5–15 min with 0.25 ml of malachite green reagent. Pi release was measured as previously described (22Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce, Rockford, IL). THP-1 cells (500,000 cells/ml) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in serum-free cuture medium at 106 cells/ml. Aliquots of 500 µl were dispensed in prewarmed 1.5-ml Ependorf tubes and incubated for 30 min or more until extracellular ATP concentration is below 1 nm. Then, cells were stimulated for various periods of time with LPS (1–100 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) as control. Stimulation was stopped by centrifugation (200 × g, 30 s) and the supernatant was transferred into sterile and ATP-free tubes (Eppendorf Biopur, Westbury, NY). Pipetting and other procedures such as shaking were avoided since they stimulate ATP release. ATP in supernatant fluids was immediately measured by a luciferase assay (Enliten kit, Promega) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides (S-oligos) were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography by Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, Texas). 19-Mer sequences including the translation initiation site of human P2Y6 were as follows: sense: 5′-GGCATGGAATGGGACAATG, antisense: 5′-CATTGTCCCATTCCATGGC-3′. The sequence was checked for uniqueness using NCBI's Blast. THP-1 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in serum-free culture medium at 2 × 106/ml. Cells were supplemented with 2.5% LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and various concentrations of oligonucleotides and were incubated for 4 h. Then, 4 volumes of complete culture medium were added and THP-1 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for an additional 20 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated P2Y6 antisense S-oligos (Sigma Genosys) were used to quantify cellular nucleotide uptake by THP-1 cells in the same conditions. MAP kinase assays were performed as previously described (20Warny M. Keates A.C. Keates S. Castagliuolo I. Zacks J.K. Aboudola S. Qamar A. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Kelly C.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were cultured overnight in serum-free culture medium. Stimulation (5 × 106 cells per conditions) was stopped by adding ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. MAP kinases were immunoprecipitated with 2 µg of rabbit specific IgG to ERK2 (sc-154), p38 (sc-535), or JNK1 (sc-571) and protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, immunopellets were resuspended in 40 µl of kinase buffer and the kinase reaction was started by addition of 20 µm ATP, 100 µCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and 10 µg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) (as substrate for ERK and p38) or 2 µg of glutathioneS-transferase c-Jun-(1–79) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (as substrate for JNK1). Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) and analyzed by autoradiography. Endotoxin was measured using amebocyte lysate (QCL-1000 kit, Biowittaker, Walkersville, MD) following the manufacturer's protocol and standard. Results are represented as means and S.D. Statistical analyses were performed using the SIGMA-STAT software (Jandel Scientific, San Raphael, CA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with protected t test was used for intergroup comparison. To investigate the role of extracellular nucleotides in chemokine production by monocytic cells, THP-1 cells were exposed to various concentrations of ATP, ADP, UTP, or UDP for 5 h. UDP strongly activated IL-8 release (EC50: 3 µm) (Fig.1 A) and IL-8 gene expression in THP-1 cells transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid (Fig. 1 B). ADP was also active but less potent (EC50: 20 µm), whereas ATP and UTP were inactive even at high concentrations. A similar dose-response curve was observed with another commercial source of UDP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (data not shown). In human peripheral blood monocytes, UDP activated IL-8 production in a dose-dependent fashion (EC50: 17 µm). By contrast, UTP, ATP, and ADP had no effect at low concentrations (up to 1 µm) and inhibited spontaneous IL-8 production at higher concentrations (Fig.1 C). Monocytes exposed to 1 mm ATP exhibited cell swelling and a translucent cytoplasm that are typical features of necrosis (23Warny M. Kelly C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 276: C717-C724Crossref Google Scholar), whereas these alterations were absent in the other conditions (data not shown). We found undetectable levels of endotoxin in UDP when diluted at 100 µm, the optimal concentration. UDP preincubation for 1 h with 13 µg/ml potato apyrase III inhibited IL-8 response by 88% (Fig. 1 D). In separate experiments, we found that apyrase hydrolyzes UDP at the rate of 13.7 µmol of UDP/min/mg (data not shown). Heat denaturation (95°, 5 min) abolished apyrases effect. These data indicate that UDP is a potent activator of IL-8 release and IL-8 gene expression both in THP-1 cells and human primary monocytes. We have previously shown that UDP is the most potent agonist of human P2Y6 and that the anthraquinone-sulfonic acid derivative reactive blue 2 was a potent P2Y6antagonist (7Communi D. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether reactive blue could inhibit UDP-induced IL-8 production in THP-1 cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, reactive blue inhibited IL-8 production by 74% at 100 µm (IC50: 35 µm) but did not prevent IL-1β induced-IL-8 release. Similarly, the P2 nucleotide antagonist suramin caused selective inhibition of UDP-induced IL-8 release (IC50: 5 µm). To specifically evaluate the role of P2Y6, THP-1 cells were incubated in the presence of various concentrations of P2Y6antisense S-oligonucleotides (up to 5 µm) complementary to the P2Y6 translation initiation region. Antisense S-oligos prevented IL-8 release by 40% when compared with cells pretreated with sense S-oligos (Fig. 2 B, p< 0.001). By contrast, no inhibition was observed when cells were stimulated with Clostridium difficile toxin A, a 308-kDa protein that activates IL-8 production in human monocytes (20Warny M. Keates A.C. Keates S. Castagliuolo I. Zacks J.K. Aboudola S. Qamar A. Pothoulakis C. LaMont J.T. Kelly C.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To test further whether human P2Y6 mediates IL-8 production in response to UDP, we also used 1321N1 astrocytoma cells stably transfected with a pcDNA3 vector encoding P2Y6. Nontransfected 1321N1 cells have been shown not to respond to UDP (7Communi D. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In transfected 1321N1 stimulated for 5 h, UDP (up to 1 mm) induced a dose-dependent increase in IL-8 concentration (EC50: 2 µm) whereas control cells did not respond to UDP (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that P2Y6 mediates IL-8 gene expression in response to UDP in monocytic cells. Previous studies by others and us have shown that P2Y receptors signal through MAP kinase (24Soltoff S.P. Avraham H. Avraham S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2653-2660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To explore the signal transduction mechanism whereby P2Y6 mediates IL-8 gene expression, we investigated the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP), ERK, p38, and JNK. In THP-1 cells, UDP (100 µm) caused rapid and strong ERK activation whereas, p38 and JNK activation was minimal (Fig.3 A). To test whether ERK and p38 were involved in IL-8 gene expression induced by UDP, cells were preincubated in the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (20 µm) or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (2 µm) for 60 min. PD98059 prevented UDP-induced IL-8 production by 50% (Fig.3 B) and blocked ERK activation by UDP (Fig. 3 C). By contrast, SB203580 did not prevent IL-8 release in response to UDP. However, it decreased IL-8 release induced by toxin A by 71% (Fig.3 B). Thus, ERK activation by UDP mediates IL-8 production in THP-1 cells. Previous studies have implicated nucleotide receptor signaling as a component of monocyte/macrophage activation by LPS (15Hu Y. Fisette P.L. Denlinger L.C. Guadarrama A.G. Sommer J.A. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27170-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,16Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 17Imai M. Goepfert C. Kaczmarek E. Robson S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether extracellular nucleotides might regulate IL-8 production induced by LPS in THP-1 cells. First, we tested whether nucleotide receptor antagonists might prevent IL-8 production specifically induced by LPS. We found that suramin and reactive blue inhibited IL-8 release induced by LPS (100 ng/ml) but not by IL-1β (Fig. 4 A). Next, we observed that the enzyme potato apyrase grade III (2 units/ml) that degrades tri- and diphosphate nucleotides, inhibited LPS-induced IL-8 production by 70% and IL-8 gene expression by 71%. By contrast, apyrase had no effect on IL-8 production stimulated by C. difficile toxin A or IL-1 β (Fig. 4 B). However, apyrase failed to significantly inhibit IL-8 production in the presence of very high LPS concentrations (10 µg/ml; data not shown). Finally, we tested whether LPS stimulates the release of extracellular nucleotides in the system tested. Unfortunately, UDP release from monocytic cells could not be assessed because of a lack of an appropriately sensitive method. However, in THP-1 cells, we found that LPS (100 ng/ml) induced a 12-fold increase in extracellular ATP (from 150 pm up to 1,940 pm) at 5 min of stimulation after which ATP levels returned progressively to control value within 60 min (data not shown). In mouse peritoneal macrophages, LPS (100 ng/ml) induced a 28-fold increase in extracellular ATP within 10 min (from 160 ± 16 pm to 4,500 ± 140 pm). These data strongly suggest that extracellular nucleotides are rapidly released from monocytic cells following LPS stimulation and regulate IL-8 release. Having demonstrated that extracellular nucleotides regulate IL-8 release induced by LPS we tested whether P2Y6 might be involved. THP-1 cells exposure to P2Y6 antisense S-oligos inhibited IL-8 production induced by LPS by 56% in comparison to cells exposed to sense S-oligos (Fig.5 A, p < 0.001). By contrast, IL-8 production induced by C. difficiletoxin A or IL-1β was not inhibited. To confirm the involvement of P2Y6, we transiently overexpressed human P2Y6and an IL-8 luciferase reporter gene. P2Y6 transfection significantly increased IL-8 gene expression induced by LPS (Fig.5 B; p = 0.011). By contrast, P2Y6 did not cause an up-regulation of IL-8 expression in response to toxin A or to IL-1β. These results indicate that P2Y6 both regulates IL-8 gene expression and IL-8 production in monocytic cells stimulated with LPS. This study demonstrates that UDP stimulates IL-8 release via P2Y6 in human monocytic cells. It also shows that P2Y6 regulates IL-8 production induced by LPS. This is the first report that demonstrates a putative pathophysiological role for extracellular UDP involving the P2Y6 receptor. Previous studies have shown that ATP and UTP activate various pathways in monocytic cells. For instance, ATP can stimulate IL-1β maturation, arachidonic acid mobilization, intracellular calcium increase, and mobilizes nuclear factor of activated T-cells (12Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Johnson C.A. Dennis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36764-36768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal.

UTP can enhance inducible nitric-oxide synthase in macrophages (27Chen B.C. Chou C.F. Lin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29754-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, ATP and UTP were unable to induce IL-8 gene expression in THP-1 cells. Thus diphosphate nucleotides and especially UDP play a specific role in IL-8 production by monocytic cells. In support for a role of P2Y6 in inflammation and immune responses, P2Y6 expression was found strongly increased in activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infiltrating intestinal mucosa in active inflammatory bowel disease (28Somers G.R. Hammet F.M.A. Trute L. Southey M.C. Venter D.J. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1375-1383PubMed Google Scholar). Whether this increase is specific for inflammatory bowel disease is not known but would be unlikely. The fact that UDP activates monocytes and modulates LPS effect, suggests that P2Y6 is involved in various immune responses. Whether UDP also stimulates cytokine production by T cells has not been reported. In monocytic cells, UDP exhibited an EC50 of 2, 3, and 17 µm in THP-1, 1321N1 cells, and human peripheral blood monocytes, respectively. Whether this concentration can be achieved by autocrine release is not known. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, total cellular UDP is ∼44-fold less abundant than ATP (29Werner A. Maeba R. Shimasaki H. Ueta N. Gerber G. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 553: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Since cytosolic [ATP]i averages 3 to 5 mm, intracellular UDP concentration should be ∼90 µm. In the event of cell membrane or tissue damage, passive diffusion of UDP may activate P2Y6 receptors on neighboring cells and macrophages to stimulate leukocyte recruitment. Moreover, there is preliminary evidence that UDP as well as ATP and UTP are released from several cell types in vitro and interconverted (30Lazarowski E.R. Boucher B.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 31Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20402-20407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). UDP release was demonstrated by the observation that addition of [γ-32P]ATP in extracellular medium resulted in the accumulation of [γ-32P]UTP, presumably via by membrane diphosphokinase. However, identification of the mechanisms that regulate nucleotide release in basal conditions or in response to LPS will help to better understand the physiological role of UDP. Pericellular nucleotide concentration is also regulated by ecto-apyrases including CD39, the prototype nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (or NTPDase-1) (33Kaczmarek E. Koziak K. Sévigny J.

C., Enjyoji, K., Goepfert, C., Imai, M., Kaczmarek, E., Lin, Y., Sévigny, J., and Warny, M. (2001) Drug Dev. Res., in press.Google Scholar). This enzyme is the major NTPDase expressed by monocytes-macrophages and is expressed on THP-1 cells. 2M. Warny, S. C. Robson, and J. Sévigny, unpublished observations. In endothelial cells, CD39 overexpression can block ATP release induced by LPS and prevent subsequent maturation and release of IL-1α (17Imai M. Goepfert C. Kaczmarek E. Robson S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Since CD39 hydrolyzes diphosphonucleotides, this enzyme may regulate inflammatory responses mediated by UDP in monocytes. Another potential player in regulating UDP and P2Y6 activity is CD39-L4 (or NTPDase 5), a CD39 analogue (35Mullero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast to CD39, CD39-L4 is secreted and its role is not known. Interestingly, CD39-L4 transcripts were found only in macrophages. In addition, this enzyme was specific for diphosphate nucleotides and exhibited a maximal activity for UDP (35Mullero J.J. Yeung G. Nelken S.T. Ford J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20064-20067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, CD39-L4 might regulate inflammation and UDP-induced chemokine release. Our finding that LPS triggers ATP release from THP-1 cells and primary macrophages is consistent with previous studies in microglial cells (16Ferrari D. Chiozzi P. Falzoni S. Hanau S. Di Virgilio F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), HUVEC cells (17Imai M. Goepfert C. Kaczmarek E. Robson S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and Raw 264.7 macrophagic cells (13Sperlagh B. Hasko G. Nemeth Z. Vizi E.S. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 33: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, two other studies did not detect ATP release from a murine macrophage cell line (36Beigi R.D. Dubyak G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7189-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or from THP-1 cells (37Grahames C.B. Michel A.D. Chessell I.P. Humphrey P.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The reasons for these discrepancies are unclear, but in our experiments we have excluded artifactual ATP release by physical stimuli (medium change, shaking, or pipetting). This study extends previous reports implicating extracellular nucleotides in the regulation of intracellular responses induced by LPS in monocytes/macrophages (15Hu Y. Fisette P.L. Denlinger L.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29754-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is now well established that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediates LPS signaling. In concert with CD14 and MD-2, TLR4 plays a key role in mediating IL-8 production in response to LPS (38Yang H. Young D.W. Gusovsky F. Chow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20861-20866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 39Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). In vivo, TLR4 mutations are associated with hyporesponsiveness to LPS in mice and humans (40Poltorak A He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar, 41Arbour N.C. Lorenz E. Schutte B.C. Zabner J. Kline J.N. Jones M. Frees K. Watt J.L. Schwartz D.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar). However, TLR4 has not been shown to be the only signaling mechanism for LPS. Our finding that IL-8 production induced by LPS can be partially inhibited by nucleotidases or by P2Y6 antisense S-oligos suggest that UDP and perhaps other extracellular nucleotides act synergistically with TLR4. Whether TLR4 or CD14 might be implicated in nucleotide release is not known. In summary, this study demonstrates that UDP activates IL-8 gene expression and IL-8 release via P2Y6 in monocytic cells. Furthermore, it shows that LPS-induced IL-8 production is at least in part mediated by autocrine P2Y6 activation. These findings indicate a novel role for P2Y6 in inflammation and innate immune defenses. We thank Andrew C. Keates Ph.D. for providing the IL-8 luciferase construct."
https://openalex.org/W2053218983,"<i>Escherichia coli</i> ClpA and ClpX are ATP-dependent protein unfoldases that each interact with the protease, ClpP, to promote specific protein degradation. We have used limited proteolysis and deletion analysis to probe the conformations of ClpA and ClpX and their interactions with ClpP and substrates. ATPγS binding stabilized ClpA and ClpX such that that cleavage by lysylendopeptidase C occurred at only two sites. Both proteins were cleaved within in a loop preceding an α-helix-rich C-terminal domain. Although the loop varies in size and composition in Clp ATPases, cleavage occurred within and around a conserved triad, IG(F/L). Binding of ClpP blocked this cleavage, and prior cleavage at this site rendered both ClpA and ClpX defective in binding and activating ClpP, suggesting that this site is involved in interactions with ClpP. ClpA was also cut at a site near the junction of the two ATPase domains, whereas the second cleavage site in ClpX lay between its N-terminal and ATPase domains. ClpP did not block cleavage at these other sites. The N-terminal domain of ClpX dissociated upon cleavage, and the remaining ClpXΔN remained as a hexamer, associated with ClpP, and expressed ATPase, chaperone, and proteolytic activity. A truncated mutant of ClpA lacking its N-terminal 153 amino acids also formed a hexamer, associated with ClpP, and expressed these activities. We propose that the N-terminal domains of ClpX and ClpA lie on the outside ring surface of the holoenzyme complexes where they contribute to substrate binding or perform a gating function affecting substrate access to other binding sites and that a loop on the opposite face of the ATPase rings stabilizes interactions with ClpP and is involved in promoting ClpP proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1997818262,"Chromatin is thought to repress transcription by limiting access of the DNA to transcription factors. Using a yeast heat shock gene flanked by mating-type silencers as a model system, we find that repressive, SIR-generated heterochromatin is permissive to the constitutive binding of an activator, HSF, and two components of the preinitiation complex (PIC), TBP and Pol II. These factors cohabitate the promoter with Sir silencing proteins and deacetylated nucleosomal histones. The heterochromatic HMRa1 promoter is also occupied by TBP and Pol II, suggesting that SIR regulates gene expression not by restricting factor access to DNA but rather by blocking a step downstream of PIC recruitment. Interestingly, activation of silent promoter chromatin occurs in the absence of histone displacement and without change in histone acetylation state."

Vaults have been implicated in the phenomenon of multidrug resistance and as prognostic markers for cancer chemotherapy failure (7Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J.

Sumizawa T. Takebayashi Y. Chen Z.S. Furukawa T. Nagayama S. Tani A. Takao S. Aikou T. Akiyama S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although the majority of vaults are found in the cytoplasm, small amounts have been localized to the nuclear pore complexes (10Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. Kedersha N.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 23-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently a 31-Å resolution structure of the vault has been published indicating that vaults have a hollow interior consistent with a transport or sequestration function. Scanning transmission electron microscopic analysis has shown that the molecular mass of the vault is 12.9 ± 1 MDa, and cryo-EM single-particle reconstruction has provided overall dimensions of 42 × 75 nm (11Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Freeze-etch images of the vault on polylysine-coated mica show that each half of the vault midsection can open into eight distinct “petals” (3Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which has lead to the proposal that vaults may open and close in vivo. The MVP is presumed to be present in 96 copies/vault, based on the observed symmetry of the particle and the estimate that MVP accounts for ∼75% of the total protein mass in the particle. In many ways vaults are reminiscent of virus particles, in that they are MDa assemblies that have a protein shell composed of multiple copies of a single protein and have a large central cavity. The expression of specific viral proteins in baculovirus has become an invaluable tool for investigating the assembly of virus particles (12Kirnbauer R. Taub J. Greenstone H. Roden R. Durst M.

Toward this goal, we have expressed rat MVP in the Sf9 insect cell line using a baculovirus vector. Here we show that the expression of the rat MVP alone results in the formation of particles that have characteristics similar to endogenous rat vaults. The His-T7 tag was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the pET28a plasmid (Novagen) using the T7 primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and TCAGCCATGGCCATTTGCTGTCCACCAG, which contains a NcoI site. The amplified His-T7 tag was subcloned into the NcoI site at the ATG start site of rat MVP (22Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Gene. 1994; 151: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The His-T7-tagged rat MVP was subcloned into the pFASTBAC vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) at the XbaI and KpnI sites. The vsvg-tagged rat MVP, described previously (23Herrmann C. Golkaramnay E. Inman E. Rome L. Volknandt W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was subcloned into the pFASTBAC vector using EcoRI. Recombinant baculovirus was then generated as directed in the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sf9 cells adapted for serum-free growth (Life Technologies, Inc.) were cultured at 28 °C on an orbital shaker rotating at 135–150 rpm. Cultures were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/ml, inoculated with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2.0, and cultured for 48 h. After infection the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g and the pellets stored at −80 °C. Infected cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm MgCl2,) containing 1% Triton, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and a protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μm leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin), incubated on ice for 20 min, and then homogenized 10 times with a type A Dounce. Unbroken cells, organelles, and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g (S20) for 15 min at 4 °C. Large protein complexes (including vaults) were collected by further centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet (P100) was resuspended by Dounce homogenization with 1 ml of buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and the protease inhibitor mixture. This P100 fraction was then adjusted to 7% sucrose and Ficoll and centrifuged at 43,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and diluted 1:3 with buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and the protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for at least 3 h to pellet vaults. The pellet was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in 1 ml of buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and the protease inhibitor mixture. To remove contaminating ribosomes, 500 μg of RNase A and 50 units of RNase TI (Ambion) were added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The insoluble ribosomal proteins were then pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a sucrose step gradient of 20, 30, 40, 45, 50, and 60% sucrose steps and centrifuged at 78,000 × g for 16 h. The fractions were collected and diluted 1:9 with buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and the protease inhibitor mixture, and the vaults were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 3 h. The pellets were then resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, and the protease inhibitor mixture and analyzed by silver staining and Western blot. Sucrose gradient fractions were prepared for electron microscopy by absorption of samples onto fresh 1.8-nm-thick carbon film mounted on carbon-coated holey- film grids for 2–5 min at 4 °C. Following sample adsorption, grids were floated for 4 min on 1 ml of 1% uranyl acetate at 4 °C and dried on filter paper prior to viewing in a JEOL 1200EX microscope. The carbon coated holey-film grids and carbon film were the gift of Dr. Sergey Ryazantsev, Department of Biological Chemistry, UCLA School of Medicine. Micrographs were produced digitally from EM negatives (3 × 4 inch) scanned at 1500 dpi resolution in TIFF format using a Scitex scanner and processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. To study vault assembly, the baculovirus system was used for the expression of epitope (either vsvg or His-T7)-tagged rat MVP in Sf9 cells. Cell extracts from uninfected (control) and infected Sf9 cells were fractionated into a soluble (S100) and particulate (pellet, P100) fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Epitope-tagged rat MVP expressed in infected Sf9 cells was found abundantly in the P100 (Fig.1 A) similar to mammalian cell expression (2Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 7Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J. Rome L.H. J. Biol.

This finding suggested that the expressed MVP was either aggregating or assembling into some type of particle in vivo. No endogenous MVP was detected in cell extracts, S100, or P100 from uninfected (control) Sf9 cells (Fig. 1 A) using an anti-MVP antibody raised to a conserved region in MVP, amino acids 593–805 (17Siva A.C.

Several attempts were made to isolate vaults from uninfected Sf9 cells using a modified version of theDictyostelium (a cellular slime mold) vault purification protocol (see “Materials and Methods”). However, during the course of the purification, no proteins were detected that cross-reacted with the anti-MVP antibody described above. In addition, analysis of the purified material by electron microscopy did not reveal any vault-like particles (data not shown). Finally, no MVP homologue has yet been detected in any insect genome. Taken together the above results suggest that either Sf9 cells do not contain vaults or vaults in this organism are so highly divergent as to no longer resemble chemically or physically the vault particle that has been highly conserved from slime mold to man (1Kedersha N.L. Miquel M.C. Bittner D. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When Sf9 cells expressing tagged MVP were subjected to the vault purification protocol, analysis of the purified material showed that the tagged rat MVP was found predominantly in the 40 and 45% sucrose layers (Fig. 1 B) similar to what is found when vaults from numerous tissue culture cell lines are examined (7Kickhoefer V.A. Rajavel K.S. Scheffer G.L. Dalton W.S. Scheper R.J. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8971-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, the MVP in the 45% sucrose layer constituted ∼95–99% of the material that was silver-stained (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). This fractionation of the rat MVP in the 40 and 45% sucrose layers is consistent with the expressed protein forming a large particle. Expressed rat MVP was also found in the 50 and 60% sucrose fractions, similar to our earlier studies. Because of the abundant protein expression, one concern was that the spread of material from 40–60% sucrose was due to overloading of material onto the sucrose gradient. However, when only one-fifth as much sample was loaded, the same fractionation pattern was observed, and if material from the 60% sucrose fraction was re-applied to a second gradient, it was found to fractionate in the 60% layer (data not shown). Analysis of the material fractionating in the 40 and 45% sucrose layers by electron microscopy (EM) revealed the presence of vault-like particles (VLPs) (Fig. 2, arrowheads). Although a considerable variation in particle morphology was observed, most VLPs were similar in size and shape to purified rat vaults (3Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These particles varied from 32–37 nm in width to 59–65 nm in length and displayed the distinctive bifold symmetric vault central barrel with dual caps (for a gallery of these structures see Fig.3; see also top row, Fig.3 A, for a VLP with the barrel and caps labeled). The dimensions of these particles correlates very closely with negatively stained rat liver vaults examined with the same electron microscope. However, the negatively stained vaults and VLPs are about 15–20% smaller than unstained cryo-images of rat vaults, which have 42 × 75 nm dimensions (11Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These differences are likely due to shrinking of the negatively stained particles during air-drying and some variation in the calibration of the two different microscopes used. The presence of these apparently “complete” structures was unexpected, as vaults from most mammalian species also comprise VPARP and TEP1, two proteins that have been predicted to form the vault cap (18Kong L.B. Siva A.C. Kickhoefer V.A. Rome L.H. Stewart P.L. RNA. 2000; 6: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as the vault RNA. Although it is possible that certain insect proteins could substitute for the high molecular weight VPARP and TEP1 proteins, it is very likely that these complete particles comprise MVP alone. InDictyostelium, vaults appear to be formed of two (and possibly three) highly related MVPs (19Vasu S.K. Kedersha N.L. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15356-15360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vasu S.K. Rome L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16588-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, vaults isolated from Tep1-deficient mice also have a typical vault morphology with a central barrel and caps on either ends (21Kickhoefer V.A. Liu Y. Kong L.B. Snow B.E. Stewart P.L. Harrington L. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An examination of the most highly purified fraction of VLPs from MVP-expressing Sf9 cells (45% sucrose fraction) failed to detect any stoichiometric amounts of co-purified proteins (see Fig.1 B). Although these fractions are relatively homogenous with respect to protein composition (>90% silver-stained material is the expressed MVP), they are relatively heterogeneous with respect to structural variations. However, nearly all of the VLPs contained a distinctive cap, and therefore if one or two endogenous insect proteins were required for cap morphology they would likely be co-purified with MVP and observed in the silver-stained gels. The absence of distinct co-purified proteins, even ones at ∼10% of the abundance of MVP, indicate that multiple copies of MVP are sufficient for formation of both the vault barrel and cap. It should be noted, however, that the caps seen in many of the VLPs appeared abnormal. Many were flatter than those seen in vaults, and some were misshapen and distorted (see Fig.3 A, arrowheads). A more definitive picture of VLP structure will require a cryoreconstruction of these particles. Nevertheless, it is still remarkable that multiple copies of a single protein can polymerize into a non-spherically or non-cylindrically symmetrical structure as complex as the vault.Figure 3Vault-like particles formed in Sf9 cells.

The barrepresents 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Occasionally, VLPs were observed that appear to be flatter (with dimensions of ∼40 × 70 nm). These structures, which are shown in Fig. 3 B, resemble vaults generated in vitrofrom purified rat liver preparations treated with trypsin (3Kedersha N.L. Heuser J.E. Chugani D.C. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These structures could be formed in the insect cells by endogenous proteases acting on MVP or because of proteolysis occurring during purification. There was no difference in the VLPs formed when either the vsvg or His-T7 tags were used on the rat MVP, suggesting that the ability of MVP to form these particles is not effected by the addition of the tag (data not shown). Taken together, these biochemical and EM studies show that the rat MVP contains sufficient information to direct assembly of vault-like particles with characteristics similar to purified endogenous rat vaults. A close examination of the sucrose gradient fractions that contained expressed MVP (40, 45, 50, and 60% sucrose fractions) revealed various structures that appear to represent assembly intermediates and some higher order structures not previously observed in vault purifications. The assembly intermediates were open half-vaults that were present as partially “opened” barrels with the characteristic petals surrounding a central ring. These open half-vaults are seen occasionally in purified rat vault preparations and often inDictyostelium vault preparations (1Kedersha N.L. Miquel M.C. Bittner D. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A panel of these structures is shown in Fig.4 A. The larger VLP structures seen in the purified fractions are more difficult to explain. These ordered VLP polymeric structures (see Fig. 2, arrows), which we refer to as vaultimers, appear to contain three to more than a dozen half-VLPs (panels of these images are shown in Fig. 4,B–D). The most common vaultimer has four symmetrically arranged half-VLPs (see Fig. 4 B). Some of the 4-mers (Fig.4 B, bottom) have a central density that could represent one or two additional half-VLPs protruding above and below the plane of the micrograph, indicating that the 6-mer could also be a common form. Although most of the half-VLPs in the vaultimers are capped, polymeric structures containing some uncapped and distorted capped VLPs were also observed. Although they were less abundant, larger vaultimers likely composed of 8 to >12 half-VLPs were also seen (Fig. 4 D). As these larger structures appeared to be enriched at higher sucrose concentrations in the gradient, the mass of these structures likely affects their fractionation more than their density. Vaults have been purified from dozens of different species (1Kedersha N.L. Miquel M.C. Bittner D. Rome L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and from different tissues, 2V. A. Kickhoefer, unpublished results.. yet to our knowledge these vaultimers have never before been observed. It is possible that they arise in baculovirus as a result of MVP over-expression, which could overwhelm the cellular assembly machinery, or factors that are required for complete particle assembly. Alternately, they might arise when vault particles lacking VPARP, TEP1, and vault RNA are assembled. Preliminary experiments aimed at disrupting vaultimers with high salt have thus far been unsuccessful and may indicate that, like vaults, these structures are highly stable. In conclusion, the expression of rat MVP alone in Sf9 cells is sufficient to direct the assembly of vault-like particles. The fact that no endogenous Sf9 MVP or vaults could be detected supports the idea that these VLPs are formed solely from the expressed rat MVP. As stated previously, no MVP homologues have been identified in theDrosophila data base, and attempts to purify vaults from insects have been unsuccessful. However, it is possible that Sf9 cell proteins may interact weakly with the VLPs or in such low abundance, perhaps in a catalytic role, that they cannot be detected. In preliminary experiments (not shown), no vault-like particles were formed in vitro when MVP purified from MVP-expressing, urea-denatured Sf9 cell extracts was allowed to renature by dialysis, suggesting that cellular components might be required for assembly. Further work is now planned to identify such assembly factors. Co-expression studies with the other vault proteins, VPARP and TEP1, and with the vault RNA, are also planned to assess their role in particle morphology and VLP/vaultimer assembly.

We previously reported a homozygous mutation (R278H) in DNA ligase IV in a developmentally normal leukemia patient who overresponded to radiotherapy. The impact of this hypomorphic mutation has been evaluated using cellular, biochemical, and structural approaches. Structural modeling using T7 DNA ligase predicts that the activity and conformational stability of the protein is likely to be impaired. We show that wild type DNA ligase IV-Xrcc4 is an efficient double-stranded ligase with distinct optimal requirements for adenylate complex formation versus rejoining. The mutation impairs the formation of an adenylate complex as well as reducing the rejoining activity. Additionally, it imparts temperature-sensitive activity to the protein consistent with the predictions of the structural modeling. At the cellular level, the mutation confers a unique V(D)J recombination phenotype affecting the fidelity of signal joint formation with little effect on the frequency of the reaction. These findings suggest that hypomorphic mutations in ligase IV may allow normal development but confer marked radiosensitivity.

Many of these repair processes or the proteins involved in them have additional functions such as the role of excision repair proteins in transcription and the role of double strand break repair proteins in V(D)J recombination (1Lehmann A.R. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Inactivating mutations in many DNA repair proteins are associated with developmental abnormalities and confer characteristic clinical features such as those found in ataxia-telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum. There is mounting speculation and some evidence that subtle defects or polymorphisms in proteins involved in damage response mechanisms might not be associated with overt clinical features characteristic of a defined syndrome but nonetheless be responsible for some, and possibly the majority, of sporadic cancer incidence. The identification of mutations/polymorphisms in these genes and understanding their impact on cancer predisposition and sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is an important challenge ahead. Now that the phenotype conferred by null mutations in many of the DNA repair genes is known a next step is to understand the impact of hypomorphic mutations, and subsequently we may be able to evaluate the significance of more common polymorphic changes. Previously, we reported a mutation in DNA ligase IV in a 12-year-old leukemia patient who was developmentally normal until the onset of leukemia but dramatically overresponded to radiotherapy (2Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.H. Doherty A.J. Priestley A. Broughton B. Kysela B. Beamish H. Plowman N. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 19: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This represents a rare case in which the genetic defect in a developmentally normal, radiosensitive individual has been identified and marks DNA ligase IV as a protein contributing to clinical radiosensitivity. DNA ligase IV is one of five identified components that function in DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ),1 the major mechanism for DNA double strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells (3Teo S.-H. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4788-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Schar P. Herrmann G. Daly G. Lindahl T.

Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The other components include Xrcc4, a protein that interacts strongly with DNA ligase IV, and the three subunits of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), Ku70, Ku80, and the large catalytic subunit termed DNA-PKcs (DNA-PK catalytic subunit) (for reviews, see Refs. 6Jeggo P.A. Hall J.C. Dunlap J.C. Friedmann T. Giannelli F. Advances in Genetics. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 185-211Google Scholar and 7Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 90: 759-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). NHEJ also functions to effect rearrangements at site-specific DSBs introduced during V(D)J recombination (8Taccioli G.E. Rathbun G. Oltz E. Stamato T. Jeggo P.A. Alt F.W. Science. 1993; 260: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Cell lines defective in NHEJ proteins display radiosensitivity, a reduced capacity to repair DSBs, and impaired V(D)J recombination. Mice defective in the different NHEJ proteins show somewhat distinct phenotypes suggesting either that the proteins have additional functions or that the loss of the different components differentially impacts upon NHEJ. DNA ligase IV and Xrcc4 knock-out mice are embryonic lethal, and mice null for Ku70 or Ku80 are severely growth impaired, whereas DNA-PKcs-null mice grow and develop normally. DNA-PK-defective mice, however, show severe combined immunodeficiency. A cell line (180BR) derived from the radiosensitive patient defective in DNA ligase IV showed marked cellular radiosensitivity and defective DSB repair but surprisingly did not appear to be defective in the ability to carry out V(D)J recombination (9Badie C. Iliakis G. Foray N. Alsbeih G. Pantellias G.E. Okayasu R. Cheong N. Russell N.S. Begg A.C. Arlett C.F. Malaise E.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1232-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 10Badie C. Goodhardt M.

The patient showed no overt immunodeficiency or developmental abnormality other than the onset of leukemia (11Plowman P.N. Bridges B.A. Arlett C.F. Hinney A. Kingston J.E. Br. J. Radiol. 1990; 63: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The homozygous mutation in DNA ligase IV in 180BR cells is the substitution of a histidine for an arginine (R278H) within a motif close to the active site lysine that is highly conserved between ATP-dependent DNA ligases and GTP-dependent mRNA capping enzymes (2Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.H. Doherty A.J. Priestley A. Broughton B. Kysela B. Beamish H. Plowman N. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 19: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Initial studies of the impact of this mutational change on DNA ligase IV function suggested that it did not confer a null phenotype and that the mutant protein retains low residual adenylation activity (2Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.H. Doherty A.J. Priestley A. Broughton B. Kysela B. Beamish H. Plowman N. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 19: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined further the impact of this mutational change using a combination of cellular and biochemical analysis. We have used the known crystal structure of T7 DNA ligase to model the impact of the R278H mutation (12Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 13Odell M. Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nikolov D.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). By complementation analysis, we confirm that a mutation in DNA ligase IV is responsible for the radiosensitivity of 180BR cells and show that the cells do, in contrast to previous findings, have a subtle V(D)J recombination-defective phenotype that impacts most noticeably on signal joint formation. We have carried out a biochemical analysis of wild type and mutant DNA ligase IV-Xrcc4 complexes that provides insight into the activity of the wild type complex and the impact of the R278H mutation. Our findings suggest that a reduced level of DNA ligase IV activity is sufficient to carry out V(D)J recombination efficiently although with impaired fidelity. We suggest, however, that the ligase IV activity in this patient was insufficient to repair efficiently the large number of breaks induced by ionizing radiation thus conferring marked radiosensitivity. 180BRneo is an SV40-transformed but not immortalized cell line derived from primary 180BR cells. Transformed 180BRneo rather than primary 180BR cells were used in all experiments. 1BRneo is an SV40-transformed and immortalized cell line derived from a normal human fibroblast cell line. Cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin as described previously (14Arlett C.F. Green M.H.L. Priestley A. Harcourt S.A. Mayne L.V. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1988; 54: 911-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Survival following exposure to γ-rays was carried out using a cobalt-60 source (1 gray/min) as described previously (14Arlett C.F. Green M.H.L. Priestley A. Harcourt S.A. Mayne L.V. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1988; 54: 911-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged DNA ligase IV cDNA and β-galactosidase cDNA were each cloned into the retroviral vector LZRSpBMN. To create amphotropic retroviruses, the packaging cell line PT67 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) was transfected with 2 µg of LZRSpBMN-hisligIV or control LZRSpBMN-Z using the Fugene transfection procedure (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and then transferred to 33 °C. 48 h after transfection, 2 µg/ml puromycin was added to the culture. Between 10 and 30 days after transfection, virus-containing medium was collected, filtered through 0.45-µm filters, and used to infect 30% confluent 1BRneo or 180BRneo cells in the presence of Polybrene (10 µg/ml). The transduction efficiency was monitored by staining the cells infected with LZRSpBMN-Z virus supernatant for β-galactosidase. Between 60 and 80% of the cells stained positively for β-galactosidase. 2–3 × 106cells were labeled with 0.02 µCi/ml [14C]thymidine (50–60 mCi/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 48–50 h followed by incubation for 2 h in unlabeled medium. Agarose plugs were prepared from the cells (now in stationary phase) irradiated with 40-gray γ-rays and incubated for repair as described previously (15Kysela B.P. Lohrer H. Arrand J.E. Radiat. Res. 1995; 144: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in the plugs, and DNA fragments were separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis using a Bio-Rad CHEF DRIII with forward and backward pulse times of 30 min and a total electrophoresis time of 48 h at 1.5 V/cm. After electrophoresis, the gel was placed onto DE18 paper (Whatman), dried for 3 h at 50 °C, and analyzed on a STORM PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Assays to examine the frequency of V(D)J recombination were performed essentially as described previously using the recombination substrates pGG49 and pGG51 (16Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1987; 49: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 17Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Mol.

To assess the fidelity of signal joint formation, colonies bearing rearranged pGG49 plasmids (i.e.ampicillin/chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria) were subjected to colony-filter hybridization and challenged with a probe (SJ2) (19Oettinger M.A. Schatz D.G. Gorka C. Baltimore D. Science. 1990; 248: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) specific for a precise signal joint, and the percentage of hybridizing clones was determined. The plasmids from non-hybridizing clones were then chosen for sequence analysis. To sample the coding junctions, rearranged pGG51 plasmid DNA was recovered from ampicillin/chloramphenicol-resistant colonies, and the junctional sequence was determined. Three independent transfections were carried out for each experiment, and the mean results are presented. Both protein complexes were overexpressed in the Bac-To-BacTM Baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified to near homogeneity on metal chelate TALON affinity resin. For the biochemical studies both complexes were further purified and concentrated using MonoQ PC 1.3/5 ion-exchange resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aliquots of the purified complexes were stored in −80 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol. Protein complexes were pretreated with 5 mm disodium PPi for 15 min at room temperature in adenylation buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol). A Vivaspin 500 column (Sartorius) was used to remove PPi, and then [α-32P]ATP (0.5 µCi, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) was added to each reaction and incubated for 10 min at the indicated temperatures. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 volume of 2× standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and run on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fixed and dried gels were analyzed and quantified using a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The nick ligation assay was performed essentially as described previously (2Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.H. Doherty A.J. Priestley A. Broughton B. Kysela B. Beamish H. Plowman N. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 19: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Briefly, the indicated amounts of protein complexes were incubated for 1 h at different temperatures in 20 µl of reaction mixture (50 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.5, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12% polyethylene glycol, and the indicated amounts of ATP) with 10 ng of the nicked DNA substrate prepared by the annealing of three complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (50-, 33-, and 17-mer). The 17-mer was labeled at the 5′-end prior to annealing using T4-PNK (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 volume of standard formamide sequencing buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and aliquots were loaded onto a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Fixed and dried gels were analyzed and quantified using a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The AMP-DNA nick ligation intermediates were prepared as described previously using standard nicked substrates and T4 DNA ligase (20Yang S.W. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The indicated amounts of protein complexes were incubated for 2 h in 30 µl of reaction mixture (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 2 mmMg(OAc)2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 12% polyethylene glycol, and the indicated amounts of ATP) with 20 ng of the AflIII-PstI fragment of BLUESRIPT plasmid as a substrate ([γ-32P]ATP labeled on the 5′-end). After incubation, the reactions were deproteinized, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and precipitated with Pellet-Paint coprecipitant (Novagen). Aliquots of the reactions were run on 0.8% agarose gels. Dried gels were analyzed and quantified using a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Molecular modeling studies used the 2.6-Å resolution crystal structure of T7 DNA ligase (12Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1aOi). The structure of the ligase also contains co-ordinates for bound ATP. The arginine 39 of T7 ligase was replaced by a histidine, and its position was initially optimized manually to satisfy both steric and electrostatic constraints. Final optimization of the structures were achieved using energy minimization, and molecular dynamics protocols were carried out using the program Modeller (27Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 3: 318-326Crossref Scopus (958) Google Scholar) to relieve areas of steric strain. To verify that the R278H mutation is responsible for the repair defects in 180BR cells, we examined the ability of DNA ligase IV (LIGIV) cDNA to correct the characterized defects in 180BR cells. Transformed but not immortalized 180BR cells are available (designated 180BRneo). The 180BRneo transformed cells undergo 20–25 divisions before ceasing growth; this is insufficient to select transfectants expressing LIGIV and then carry out survival or repair experiments. We therefore used a retroviral infection procedure that gives a high transduction efficiency avoiding clonal expansion. In control experiments, the transduction frequency based on the number of cells expressing β-galactosidase was estimated to be around 60%. 180BRneo cells transduced with LIGIV cDNA showed significant correction of their radiosensitivity (Fig.1 A). Although the error bars for the complemented population overlap with the untransduced 180BRneo cells, significant elevated resistance is apparent. The partial correction is consistent with the estimated 60% transduction frequency. 180BRneo cells are also defective in the ability to rejoin radiation-induced DSBs, and infected 180BRneo cells also showed marked correction for DSB rejoining as analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B). We do not attach any significance to the apparent greater correction of the DSB rejoining defect than of radiosensitivity, which may be the result of the lower sensitivity of the DSB repair procedure. A further feature of 180BRneo cells is an inability to form DNA ligase IV-adenylate complexes. Recovery of adenylation activity was also seen in the transduced cells (Fig. 1 C). The recovery of this activity is marked, although it remains decreased relative to control cells, consistent with the 60% transduction frequency and with the intermediate survival response. Taken together these results verify that the R278H mutation in LIGIV is responsible for the radiosensitivity and DSB repair defect of 180BRneo cells. During V(D)J recombination, site-specific DSBs are introduced at the border between two recombination signal sequences and their adjacent antigen receptor coding gene segments (for reviews, see Refs. 21Alt F.W. Oltz E.M. Young F. Gorman J. Taccioli G. Chen J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 306-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar and 22Gellert M. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 64: 39-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting DSBs have two distinct structures, blunt signal and hairpin coding ends, that are subsequently rejoined by the NHEJ machinery to form two new junctions, signal and coding joints. In contrast to the marked radiosensitivity and impaired DNA DSB rejoining of 180BR cells, the cells have been reported to show a normal level of coding joint formation (9Badie C. Iliakis G. Foray N. Alsbeih G. Pantellias G.E. Okayasu R. Cheong N. Russell N.S. Begg A.C. Arlett C.F. Malaise E.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1232-1234PubMed Google Scholar, 10Badie C. Goodhardt M. Waugh A. Doyen N. Foray N. Calsou P. Singleton B. Gell D. Salles B. Jeggo P. Arlett C.F. Malaise E.-P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4600-4607PubMed Google Scholar). Although surprising considering the role of NHEJ in V(D)J recombination, this result was consistent with the fact that the patient displayed no obvious immunodeficiency (11Plowman P.N. Bridges B.A. Arlett C.F. Hinney A. Kingston J.E. Br. J. Radiol. 1990; 63: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The rejoining of signal and coding joints differs in details: DNA-PKcs is largely dispensable for signal joint formation but required for the formation of coding joints. Signal joints are normally precise, whereas coding joints frequently involve deletions and insertions of nucleotides. The previous report on V(D)J recombination in 180BR cells examined only the frequency of coding joint formation (10Badie C. Goodhardt M. Waugh A. Doyen N. Foray N. Calsou P. Singleton B. Gell D. Salles B. Jeggo P. Arlett C.F. Malaise E.-P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4600-4607PubMed Google Scholar). Here we examined the frequency and fidelity of both signal and coding joint formation using 180BRneo cells. The frequency of both signal and coding joint formation was slightly (2–3-fold) decreased in 180BRneo relative to control cells (Fig.2). A more marked phenotype was a decrease in the fidelity of signal joint formation; although the signal junctions from 1BR3neo cells were rejoined accurately (98%), deletions ranging from 2 to 40 nucleotides were observed in around 42% of the 180BRneo signal junctions (Fig. 2). Only 2 of the 20 junctions analyzed showed any evidence of microhomology at the junctions (Fig. 2;junctions 5 and 11). A similar analysis of the fidelity of coding junctions failed to show any marked difference between 1BRneo and 180BRneo cells (data not shown). We next examined whether LIGIV cDNA could complement the defect in signal junction fidelity by co-transfecting LIGIVcDNA with substrates and recombination activating genes. Significant correction was observed in both frequency and fidelity of rejoining (Fig. 2). The R278H mutation, therefore, does impact upon V(D)J recombination resulting in imprecise rejoining of signal ends. The R278H mutational change lies within a motif KXDGXR (designated motif I) that includes the active site lysine, which is highly conserved between ATP-dependent DNA ligases and GTP-dependent mRNA capping enzymes (12Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Shuman S.

The lysine ε-amino group in this motif forms a covalent bond with AMP in the ligase-adenylate complex. The crystal structure of the ATP-dependent bacteriophage T7 DNA ligase has revealed that the active site lysine is positioned adjacent to the ATP α-phosphate, and the KXDGXR motif forms a loop structure close to the ATP with the arginine residue forming a hydrogen bond with the 3′-OH of the ATP ribose sugar (12Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 26Doherty A.J. Suh S.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To assess the significance of the R278H mutational change, we used the T7 DNA ligase structure for modeling studies. Fig. 3 A shows hydrogen bond formation (hatched line) between Arg-39 (red), which is the equivalent of the Arg-278 in DNA ligase IV, and the 3′-OH group of the ribose of ATP (blue). Although the histidine residue has a very different side chain compared with arginine, it does have the potential to function directly in enzymatic reaction chemistry. Energy minimization studies and molecular dynamics calculations were carried out to assess the effect of the mutation on the structure (27Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 3: 318-326Crossref Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows three possible configurations of the imidazole side chain of which position 3 is the most energetically favorable. In this conformation the histidine is flipped back into a large cavity below the active site loop preventing any clashes with surrounding residues. All three conformations are likely to severely impair but not necessarily abolish hydrogen bond formation with the ribose. This structural analysis also suggested that the arginine residue in the active site may form a hydrogen bond network with other neighboring sites. Arg-39 of T7 ligase is held in place by a hydrogen bond to the main carbonyl of Phe-9 and a salt bridge to the Asp-91 (Fig.3 C). Asp-91 is in turn hydrogen-bonded with Tyr-228 (Fig.3 C) (12Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The PBCV-1 ligase has virtually the same network of protein interactions between the corresponding motif I Arg-32, motif III Asp-65, and the Tyr-172 side chains (Fig. 3 D) except that it hydrogen bonds to the main carbonyl of Leu-7 (13Odell M. Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nikolov D.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1183-1193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All these interacting residues, with the exception of Phe-9 of T7 ligase, are conserved in all ATP-dependent DNA ligases including human DNA ligase IV. It is likely that this network stabilizes the conformation of the active site loop. These interactions would be lost if the arginine were replaced by a histidine, raising the additional possibility that the active site may have decreased conformational stability. As a first step, we compared the global conformational stability of recombinant wild type or mutated DNA ligase IV-Xrcc4 complexes using far-UV circular dichroism. Both complexes showed remarkable stability up to high temperatures (95 °C), and no differences could be detected between their spectra (data not shown). These results show that the mutation does not confer a global change in protein stability, but they do not eliminate the possibility of a local conformational change involving the active site. The first step of the ligation reaction is the formation of a ligase-adenylate complex, most likely involving hydrogen bond formation with Arg 278 (12Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the majority of endogenous DNA ligase IV exists as a preadenylated complex (28Robins P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24257-24261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the presence of DNA ends, AMP is transferred to the 5′-phosphate group at the break site to form a DNA-adenylate complex (step 2), and finally the DNA is ligated with the release of AMP and non-adenylated DNA ligase IV (step 3). Using baculovirus-expressed wild type DNA ligase IV-Xrcc4 complexes no adenylate complex formation was observed without prior treatment with disodium PPi indicating that the majority of baculovirus-expressed DNA ligase IV is also preadenylated (Fig.4 A, lane 1, −PPi). Following PPi treatment, DNA ligase IV efficiently formed adenylate complexes (Fig. 4 A). We next examined the effect of temperature on this reaction and observed optimal activity at 16 °C that decreased markedly at 37 °C (Fig. 4 B). Previously we examined DNA ligase IV adenylation activity in 180BRneo and wild type cell extracts following immunoprecipitation of the complex with Xrcc4 antibodies and were unable to detect any residual activity using 180BRneo cell extracts (2Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.H. Doherty A.J. Priestley A. Broughton B. Kysela B. Beamish H. Plowman N. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Curr.

However, using bacterially expressed R278H mutant protein, low residual adenylation activity (0.5% wild type) was detected providing evidence that the mutant protein is impaired but not abolished in its ability to form a DNA ligase IV-adenylate complex (2Riballo E. Critchlow S.E. Teo S.H. Doherty A.J. Priestley A. Broughton B. Kysela B. Beamish H. Plowman N. Arlett C.F. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Curr.

It has been implicated in signaling events initiated by several extracellular signals, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin. In COS-7 cells, SHIP2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated at least at two separated tyrosine phosphorylation sites in response to EGF. SHIP2 was coimmunoprecipitated with the EGF receptor (EGFR) and also with the adaptor protein Shc. A C-terminal truncated form of SHIP2 that lacks the 366 last amino acids, referred to as tSHIP2, was also precipitated with the EGFR when transfected in COS-7 cells. The Src homology 2 domain of SHIP2 was unable to precipitate the EGFR in EGF-stimulated cells. Moreover, when transfected in COS-7 cells, it could not be detected in immunoprecipitates of the EGFR. When the His-tagged full-length enzyme was expressed in COS-7 cells and stained with anti-His6 monoclonal antibody, a signal was observed at plasma membranes in EGF-stimulated cells that colocalize with the EGFR by double staining. Upon stimulation by EGF, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and protein kinase B activity were decreased in SHIP2-transfected COS-7 cells as compared with the vector alone. SHIP2 appears therefore in a tyrosine-phosphorylated complex with at least two other proteins, the EGFR and Shc.

Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 405-414PubMed Google Scholar). Key events in receptor signaling are the interactions of proteins such as the adaptor protein Shc with other phosphorylated proteins. In epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 signaling, the activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) could mediate the phosphorylation of a series of proteins, such as the p85 subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (2Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation has been linked to the activation of PI 3-kinase, which plays an important role in signaling. All mammalian cell types express at least class IA PI 3-kinase isoform, and stimulation of almost every receptor that induces Tyr kinase activity also leads to class IA PI 3-kinase activation (3Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 4Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M. Trends Biochem.

PI 3-kinase class IA substrates in vitroare phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, whereas the preferred substratein vivo is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (2Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and/or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI 3,4-P2) could activate protein kinase B (PKB) through the binding to the PH domain of 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylating protein kinase B (5Alessi D.R.

J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The control of the levels of the second messenger PIP3 depends on the activity of both PI 3-kinase and PIP3 phosphatases (which are members of inositol and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase family) and 3-phosphatases, such as PTEN (phosphatase and tensin deleted from chromosome 10) (8Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 125-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). SHIP1 and SHIP2 (SH2 domain containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 and 2) belong to the inositol and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphatase family (9Mitchell C.A. Brown S. Campbell J.K. Munday A.D. Speed C.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys.

Both phosphatases contain different protein-protein interaction domains, such as an N-terminal-specific SH2 domain, a potential phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain binding site (NPAY), and C-terminal proline-rich sequences allowing binding of the SH3 domain. SHIP2 contains also a sterile α motif at the C-terminal end that was not present in SHIP1 (12Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding SHIP2 have been reported in human, mouse, and rat (12Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C.

In humans, the protein contains 1258 amino acids, whereas a splice variant that lacks exon 28 and the C-terminal sterile α motif has been isolated in rat skeletal muscle (13Ishihara H. Sasaoka T.

SHIP2 has been shown to be expressed in nonhemopoietic and hemopoietic cells, as shown by Western blotting (16Muraille E. Pesesse X. Kuntz C. Erneux C. Biochem.

When tested in vitro on recombinant SHIP2 produced in COS-7 cells, we could demonstrate PIP3 5-phosphatase activity. In another study, PIP3 5-phosphatase activity was also demonstrated in K562 cells after immunoprecipitation with anti-SHIP2 antibodies (18Wisniewski D. Strife A. Swendeman S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Kavanaugh W.M. Tempst P. Clarkson B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2707-2720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth factors (EGF and platelet-derived growth factor) and insulin stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP2 in various cell models, such as SH-SY5Y cells (19Habib T. Hejna J.A. Moses R.E. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18605-18609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SHIP2 was also constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in chronic myelogenous leukemia progenitor cells (18Wisniewski D. Strife A. Swendeman S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Kavanaugh W.M. Tempst P. Clarkson B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2707-2720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In B cells, SHIP2 was also maximally tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated to Shc after BCR and FcγRIIB cross-linking but not after stimulation of BCR alone (16Muraille E. Pesesse X. Kuntz C. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Muraille E. Bruhns P. Pesesse X. Daëron M. Erneux C. J. Immunology Lett. 2000; 72: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SHIP2 has been shown to control insulin sensitivity in a model of SHIP2 deficient mice (21Clément S. Krause U. De Smedt F.

Nature. 2000; 409: 92-97Crossref Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A role of SHIP2 in cellular adhesion and spreading has also been recently proposed (22Prasad N. Topping R.S. Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1416-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Previous data obtained in B cells have suggested that PIP3 initiates a PLCγ2-dependent inositol trisphosphate production through its ability to activate Tec kinases. Moreover FcγRIIB1, an inhibitory receptor that recruits SHIP1 eliminates BCR-induced PIP3 accumulation (23Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C.

The data implicate PIP3 as a crucial regulator of calcium signaling through its ability to initiate Tec kinase activation. The data also stressed the importance of SHIP1 as a PIP3 5-phosphatase in an intact cell model (26Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Given the potential role of SHIP2 in regulation of PI 3-kinase signaling by growth factors and insulin (19Habib T. Hejna J.A. Moses R.E. Decker S.J. J. Biol.

In the course of these studies, we observed that SHIP2 was coimmunoprecipitated with the EGFR and also with the adaptor protein Shc. The EGFR was also present in SHIP2 immunoprecipitates. We have observed a colocalization of SHIP2 and the EGFR in COS-7 cells stimulated by EGF.

The catalytic mutant of SHIP2 in which cysteine 689 was replaced by a serine was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis using SHIP2 subcloned into pBlueScript as a template according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 cells (platted at 1.5 × 106 cells/dish the previous day) were transfected in 10-cm dishes using the Superfect method of transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF at 37 °C for different times. The cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline and recovered in 1 ml of Buffer A containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Brij, 2 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin. After shaking the lysates for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifugation at 10,000 ×g, the supernatants were recovered and immediately subjected to immunoprecipitation. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitations: anti-SHIP2 (12Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Muraille E. Pesesse X. Kuntz C. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), anti-Shc (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-His6 (CLONTECH), and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). The supernatants were precleared for 5 min at 4 °C with 150 µl of 10% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose CL4B. This was centrifuged at 12000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was collected and incubated with the adequate antibodies and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C (10 µl of serum for anti-SHIP2, 10 µl for anti-Shc, 5 µl for anti-His6, and 25 µl for anti-EGFR). The immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation and washed four times in lysis buffer. The last wash was made without protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The immunoprecipitates were applied on SDS gels, followed by Western blotting. The blots were analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Affinity adsorption of SHIP2 and tSHIP2 was performed using coupled GGDGpYYDLSPL peptide to Actigel ALD. After addition of 30 µl of peptide conjugated resin to 1 ml of COS-7 lysate, the complex was recovered by centrifugation and washed as described above. The [3-32P]PIP3 was prepared as described (27Pesesse X. Moreau C. Drayer A.L. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using recombinant PI 3-kinase. TLC-purified [32P]PIP3 was evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended with 100 µg of phosphatidylserine into vesicles. The [32P]PIP3 5-phosphatase activity was measured as described (28Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G.

Briefly, a total of 20,000 cpm/sample of [32P]PIP3 was resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 µg of phosphatidylserine. After sonication, the reaction was started by adding immunoprecipitated SHIP2 from transfected COS-7 cells and 5 mm MgCl2. The assay was stopped, and lipids were extracted. PIP3 and PI 3,4-P2 were separated by thin layer chromatography in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30:26:24:14, v/v/v/v/v). The corresponding spots were analyzed by PhosphorImager and autoradiography. Two days after the transfection of 1.2 × 106 cells in 10-cm-diameter dishes (vector alone, tSHIP2, or full-length SHIP2 cDNAs), COS-7 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml EGF for different time, and reactions were stopped by addition of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). After lipid extraction, phospholipid were separated by TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30:26:24:14, v/v/v/v/v), and PIP3-PI 3,4-P2 spots were scraped and deacylated. Lipids were resolved by high performance liquid chromatography (strong anion-exchange column partisphere SAX) and eluted by a linear gradient (0–1 m(NH4)2HPO4) as described in Ref.30Gratacap M.-P.

PIP3 and PI 3,4-P2 were identified with internal standards. Immunofluorescence using anti-His6 and anti-EGFR antibodies was performed on transfected COS-7 cells. 1.2 × 105 transfected COS-7 cells were grown on uncoated glass coverslips in 3-cm-diameter dishes. Cells were stimulated or not with EGF, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and then fixed in 4% of paraformaldehyde solution in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 10 min. The cells were washed three times for 10 min in TBS, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 in TBS for 10 min, and washed again with TBS. The fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:20 normal serum in TBS (goat or horse serum depending on the origin of the secondary antiserum). Incubation with immune serum was performed overnight at room temperature in the presence of blocking serum diluted 1:20 in TBS. The anti-His6 antibody was used at a 1:1000 dilution, and the anti-EGFR antibody was used at a 1:250 dilution. After being rinsed with TBS, cells were incubated for 60 min in the dark with a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (direct immunofluorescence). For the colocalization experiments, a Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution and a fluorescein donkey anti-goat secondary antibody at a 1:250 dilution were used. The cells were then washed three times with TBS for 10 min and mounted with the SlowFade light antifade kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were observed under a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope, and images were obtained using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (MRC 1000, Bio-Rad) equipped with argon-krypton laser and COSMOS software (Bio-Rad). After transfection and stimulation of 1.2 × 106 COS-7 cells in 10-cm-diameter dishes, cells were lysed in 800 µl of ice-cold lysis buffer (80 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.75% Triton X-100, 80 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 200 mm NaF, protease inhibitors mixture). After 20 min of agitation at 4 °C, the different cell supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 4 µg of antibody to PKB coupled to 25 µl of protein A-Sepharose in a total volume of 400 µl of Buffer H (80 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors mixture). PKB activity was determined as described previously (31Blero D. De Smedt F. Pesesse X. Paternotte N. Moreau C. Patrastre B. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of SHIP2 was approximately 160 kDa in B cells (16Muraille E. Pesesse X. Kuntz C. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Muraille E. Bruhns P. Pesesse X. Daëron M. Erneux C. J. Immunology Lett. 2000; 72: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A similar value was determined in COS-7 cells. EGF was particularly potent in stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP2 in COS-7 cells: Fig. 1Ashows a time course study. SHIP2 tyrosine phosphorylation could be seen from 0.5 min to 120 min. When the blot was stripped and reprobed with SHIP2 antibodies, SHIP2 was recovered in the presence and absence of EGF, confirming that the immunoprecipitation was efficient in both cases (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). Similar results were obtained in SHIP2-transfected cells, although a higher basal phosphorylation of SHIP2 could be observed depending on the transfection (data not shown). In similar transfection experiments, immunoprecipitations were performed with an anti-phosphotyrosine, and the blot was probed with SHIP2 antibodies; we observed that a 160-kDa band corresponding to SHIP2 was increased when cells had been stimulated for 5 min with EGF (Fig. 1 B). The high basal level seen in unstimulated cells results either from the migration of other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at the same molecular weight that could recruit SHIP2 or of a basal SHIP2 phosphorylation seen in transfected cells. The association between the adaptor protein Shc and SHIP2 has been reported by others in EGF-stimulated and platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells and also in K562 cells or in B cells (17Bruyns C. Pesesse X. Moreau C. Blero D. Erneux C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Habib T. Hejna J.A. Moses R.E. Decker S.J. J. Biol.

Immunology Lett. 2000; 72: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This was also observed in our model of transfected COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with SHIP2 and immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibodies. Fig. 1 C shows that when probed with SHIP2, a 160-kDa protein band was detected in EGF-stimulated but not in control cells. We also tested whether SHIP2 could associate to the EGFR. When COS-7 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation of the EGFR, SHIP2 was immunodetected in the immunoprecipitate provided the cells had been stimulated by EGF. This result was obtained in untransfected or SHIP2-transfected cells (Fig.1 D). Fig. 1 D, bottom panel, shows the presence of the EGFR by immunodetection of the same blot. Moreover, when the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with SHIP2 and probed with EGFR antibodies, a protein of 170 kDa was detected in EGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 1 E). This band was not detected in control cells. Fig.1 E, bottom panel, shows that the same amounts of SHIP2 were immunoprecipitated in control and EGF-stimulated cells. Immunoprecipitation of the EGFR in SHIP2-transfected cells also shows the presence of Shc in immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Our data therefore indicate the presence of two proteins that co-precipitated with the EGFR: SHIP2 and Shc in EGF-stimulated cells. The phosphorylation of SHIP2 in response to EGF prompted us to test whether it was phosphorylated at its NPAY site at the C-terminal part of SHIP2 (Fig. 2). This site was indeed proposed to account for Shc binding through its PTB domain of SHIP2 (18Wisniewski D. Strife A. Swendeman S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Kavanaugh W.M. Tempst P. Clarkson B. Blood. 1999; 93: 2707-2720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have tested an antibody made against a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide, KNSFNNPApYYVLEGV, that surrounded SHIP2 NPAY site (Fig.3A). When SHIP2 was transfected in COS-7 cells, the antibody recognized SHIP2 in EGF-stimulated cells, particularly upon stimulation. It did not recognize tSHIP2, which does not have the NPAY site (Figs. 2 and3 A). Antibodies to SHIP2-phosphorylated peptide cross-reacted with the EGFR at 170 kDa that was strongly phosphorylated in response to EGF (confirmed by reprobing experiments with EGFR antibodies, data not shown). The presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated NPXY sites in autophosphorylated EGFR could perhaps explain the cross-reactivity. The data are consistent with the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP2 at NPAY site, i.e.Tyr-986, in response to EGF.Figure 3Western blot analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated SHIP2 in response to EGF. A,COS-7 cells (1.2 × 106 cells/condition) were transfected with SHIP2, tSHIP2, or ΔSH2-SHIP2 encoding cDNA and stimulated or not with 50 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. After lysis, crude lysates were probed with phosphorylated SHIP2 peptide antibodies (pSHIP2). B, a sample of each lysate was analyzed by Western blotting using SHIP2 antibodies. The migration of SHIP2 (160 kDa), ΔSH2-SHIP2 (150 kDa), and tSHIP2 (105 kDa) inA and B are indicated by arrows. The data are representative of one experiment out of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have prepared a construct, ΔSH2-SHIP2, that does not have SHIP2 SH2 domain. This construct was much less phosphorylated in response to EGF as compared with wild type SHIP2 (Fig. 3 A). Fig.3 B shows the expression of the constructs as detected by immunoblotting with anti-SHIP2 antibodies (SHIP2, ΔSH2-SHIP2, and tSHIP2). In previous studies, it was proposed that the optimal ligand for SHIP1 SH2 domain was Y(Y/D)X(L/I/V), consistent with SHIP1 binding to immunoreceptors (32Osborne M.A. Zenner G. Lubinus M. Zhang X.

SHIP2 could be isolated by the same peptides by affinity chromatography. 2Erneux, C., unpublished data.We used this procedure to isolate transfected SHIP2 and tSHIP2. Western blot analysis shows that the two constructs were tyrosine-phosphorylated, particularly in EGF-stimulated cells (Fig.4). Fig. 4, bottom panel,shows the expression of both constructs by anti-His immunoblotting. His-tagged SHIP2 was expressed in COS-7 cells, and its cellular localization was revealed by anti-His antibody and confocal analysis. Cells were stimulated or not by EGF. Cells transfected with the vector alone did not show any signal (Fig.5, A and B), in contrast to cells transfected with SHIP2 (Fig. 5, C andD). SHIP2-transfected cells showed a cytoplasmic localization in the absence of EGF (Fig. 5 C). In EGF-stimulated cells, a relocation of SHIP2 could be seen at plasma membranes, as shown in Fig. 5 D. The colocalization of SHIP2 and the EGFR in the same membranes by double staining is shown in Fig.5, E–G, arrows. Because we h"

By analysis of a box C/D snoRNA cDNA library constructed from rat brain RNAs, we have identified a novel box C/D snoRNA, RBII-36, which is devoid of complementarity to rRNA or an snRNA and exhibits a brain-specific expression pattern. It is uniformly expressed in all major areas of adult rat brain (except for choroid plexus) and throughout rat brain ontogeny but exclusively detected in neurons in which it exhibits a nucleolar localization. In vertebrates, known methylation guide snoRNAs are intron-encoded and processed from transcripts of housekeeping genes. In contrast, RBII-36 snoRNA is intron-encoded in a gene preferentially expressed in the rat central nervous system and not in proliferating cells. Remarkably, this host gene, which encodes a previously reported noncoding RNA, Bsr, spans tandemly repeated 0.9-kilobase units including the snoRNA-containing intron. The novel brain-specific snoRNA appears to result not only from processing of the debranched lariat but also from endonucleolytic cleavages of unspliced Bsr RNA (i.e. an alternative splicing-independent pathway unreported so far for mammalian intronic snoRNAs). Sequences homologous to RBII-36 snoRNA were exclusively detected in the Rattus genus of rodents, suggesting a very recent origin of this brain-specific snoRNA.

Pre-rRNA maturation involves a large number of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs),1 which can be defined as a metabolically stable association between small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and a specific set of proteins (1Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 897-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). All snoRNAs to date (except the RNA component for RNase MRP) fall into two major classes, box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs, based on the presence of short consensus sequence motifs (2Balakin A.G. Smith L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Whereas a few of them are involved in pre-rRNA nucleolytic cleavages, most box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNAs play a key role in specifying the two major types of rRNA nucleotide modification (2′-O-ribose methylations and pseudouridylations, respectively) through formation of a specific RNA duplex at the modification site (3Bachellerie J.P. Cavaillé J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4Bachellerie J.P. Cavaillé J. Qu L.H.

While function(s) of these nucleotide modifications are still elusive they are proposed to fine tune rRNA folding and interactions with ribosomal proteins. Thereby, they could play a role in the biogenesis and activity of mature cytoplasmic ribosomes, particularly with regard to their peptidyl transferase activities (7Maden B.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 39: 241-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Antisense box C/D snoRNAs contain conserved sequence motifs box C (5′-RUGAUGA-3′) and box D (5′-CUGA-3′), generally brought together by a short 5′–3′-terminal stem, and one (sometimes two) antisense element(s) (8Bachellerie J.P. Michot B. Nicoloso M. Balakin A. Ni J. Fournier M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 261-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Each antisense element, which exhibits an extended (10–21-nt) complementarity to a site of rRNA ribose methylation, is located immediately upstream from box D (or another copy of this motif, box D′, in the 5′ half of the snoRNA). In the corresponding snoRNA/rRNA duplexes, the 2′-O-ribose methylated nucleotide is systematically paired to the fifth nucleotide upstream from box D (or D′) (9Nicoloso M. Qu L.H. Michot B. Bachellerie J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 178-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Cell. 1996; 85: 1077-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Expression of an artificial box C/D snoRNA carrying an appropriate antisense element is sufficient to target a novel ribose methylation on the predicted pre-rRNA nucleotide and also, to a lesser extent, to RNA-polymerase II transcripts (4Bachellerie J.P. Cavaillé J. Qu L.H. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, Antibiotics, and Cellular Interactions. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 191-203Google Scholar, 11Cavaillé J. Nicoloso M. Bachellerie J.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), showing that the antisense element associated with box D (or D′) is the sole determinant of the site of methylation. Antisense box C/D snoRNAs able to direct the formation of three distinct ribose methylations in U6 and U5 snRNA have been reported (12Ganot P. Jady B.E. Bortolin M.L. Darzacq X. Kiss T. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as well as several other box C/D snoRNAs likely to represent bona fide guides for additional snRNA ribose methylations in U6, U2, and U4 snRNAs (15Hüttenhofer A. Kiefmann M. Meier-Ewert S. O'Brien J. Lehrach H. Bachellerie J.P. Brosius J. EMBO J. 2000; 20: 2943-2953Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Moreover, several novel mammalian box C/D snoRNAs devoid of complementarity to rRNA or snRNA remain without a presumptive RNA target (15Hüttenhofer A. Kiefmann M. Meier-Ewert S. O'Brien J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, the intriguing detection of one H/ACA- and three C/D-box snoRNAs exclusively expressed in the brain and also devoid of rRNA or snRNA complementarity opens new perspectives as to the potential range of functions of this unexpectedly large snoRNA family (17Cavaillé J. Buiting K. Kiefmann M. Lalande M. Brannan C.I. Horsthemke B. Bachellerie J.P. Brosius J. Huttenhofer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Remarkably, one of the novel brain-specific snoRNA displays an 18-nt antisense element that could play a key role in the processing of a brain-specific mRNA. Methylation guide snoRNAs are also intriguing by their unusual genomic organization and modes of biosynthesis. In vertebrates, they are encoded within introns and are not independently transcribed but processed from the pre-mRNA introns, in most cases by exonucleolytic digestion of the debranched lariat (18Cavaillé J.

Biol. 2000; 297: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Earlier observations that snoRNA host genes coded for proteins involved in ribosome biosynthesis and/or nucleolar function (e.g. ribosomal proteins, translation factors, nucleolin) suggested that this gene organization might provide a regulatory link between partners in the same biological process (1Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 897-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar,35Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1993; 75: 403-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, it is now clear that this hypothesis cannot be generalized. First, some intronic snoRNAs are hosted by different genes in different eukaryotic species, thus appearing as mobile genetic elements. Second, the function of some snoRNA host genes lack any obvious direct relationship with translation. Finally, an increasing number of snoRNAs have been found in introns of non-protein-coding genes of elusive function (36Bortolin M.L. Kiss T. RNA. 1998; 4: 445-454PubMed Google Scholar, 37Smith C.M.

However, all snoRNA host genes known to date are housekeeping genes exhibiting hallmarks of 5′ TOP genes (i.e. a C residue at the +1-position followed by a 5–15-nt-long polypyrimidine tract in a short 5′-untranslated region), which could provide the basis for a coordination of snoRNA biosynthesis at the transcriptional level (37Smith C.M. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6897-6909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,40Pelczar P. Filipowicz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4509-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have focused our attention on the identification of novel brain-specific box C/D snoRNAs, in order to better assess the complexity of their repertoire and provide insights into their biosynthetic pathway and function(s) in brain cells. Following the construction of a rat brain cDNA library specific for box C/D snoRNAs, we have identified and further characterized a novel brain-specific specimen, RBII-36, without apparent equivalent in mouse or human brain cells. Also devoid of complementarity to rRNA or snRNAs, RBII-36 shares with two brain-specific box C/D snoRNAs recently identified in mouse and human (17Cavaillé J. Buiting K. Kiefmann M. Lalande M. Brannan C.I. Horsthemke B. Bachellerie J.P. Brosius J. Huttenhofer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14311-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) an outstanding feature; the snoRNA is transcribed from a complex transcription unit spanning an array of tandemly repeated snoRNA-containing units. Moreover, RBII-36 snoRNA appears to be processed from intronic RNA through a superimposition of splicing-dependent and splicing-independent processing events. Unless otherwise noted, all techniques for cloning and manipulating nucleic acids were performed according to standard protocols. All oligonucleotides were synthesized on a PerSeptive Biosystems Expedite apparatus: MBII-52, 5′-TCAGCGTAATCCTATTGAGCAT-3′; MBII-85, 5′-ACAGAGTTTTCACTCATTTGTTC-3′; IPLIB-36, 5′-TCAGACTC(G/C)CAATGTTGTGGTCATCAT-3′; IPLIB36-2, 5′-TGGACCTCAGACTCGCAATGT-3′; IPLIB36-3, 5′-TTTT(T/A)TG(G/T)TCATCAATGAT; IPLIB36-4, 5′-TGGATGT(C/T)TCAGA(G/C)GACTCCCAGATG-3′; IPLIB36-5, 5′-TCAGACTC(G/C)CAATGTTGTGGTCATCATG(G/C)ATGT(T/C)TCAGA(G/C)GACTCCCA(G/C)A-3′; primer 1, 5′-AATAAAGCGGCCGCGGATCCAA-3′; primer 2, 5′-TTGGATCCGCGGCCGCTTTATTNNNNTCAG-3′; primer 3, 5′-AATAAAGCGGCCGCGGATCCAANNNNRTGATGA-3′; U3, 5′-AAATGATCCCTGAAAGTATAGTCTT-3′; U40, 5′-AGTCAGACATTGATACTGATTCAGG-3′; U21, 5′-TGCCATCAGTCCCGTCTTGAAAC-3′; 5.8 S, 5′-TCCTGCAATTCACATTAATTCTCGCAGCTAGC-3′; 5′ Bsr1, 5′-CGGGATCCAGAATTGTGAGAGTGTGAGTTCATCC-3′; 3′ Bsr1, 5′-CGGAATTCTCTCCCAAGATT ATCAACTCATAGGG-3′; 5′ RBII-36, 5′-CGCGGATCCGATCATTGATGACCCGAAAAAAA-3′; 3′ T7RBII-36, 5′-CCGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGGACCTCAGACTCCC-3′; 5′ Bsr exon, 5′-CGGGATCCTC(T/C)TGAGGT(T/G)TGGGATTCCCGGT(G/T)T(G/T)TGT-3′; 3′ Bsr exon, 5′-CGGAATTCTGAGGAAGAACT(T/C)(G/T)GA(G/A)ATCACCTTGGAGG-3′; Bsr junction, 5′-GAGGTAT(G/C)TATTACTCTC(G/A)(C/A)AATT-3′.

Half a dissected rat brain was resuspended in 6 ml of NET-150 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and homogenized at 1.53 kilobar using the One Shot Model (Constant Systems Ltd.). Brain extract was then clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 4 °C), and the supernatant was submitted to immunoprecipitation as described below. RNA extracted from 0.5 ml of PAS-Ig pellet was ligated to phosphorylated primer 1 (10 pmol) in the presence of T4 RNA ligase as described (10Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Cell. 1996; 85: 1077-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Ligation product was used as template for cDNA synthesis with primer 2 and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA product was then used as template for PCR by Taq polymerase (Appligene) with primers 2 and 3, and the PCR product was digested by BamHI and cloned in pKS vector. Individual clones were manually sequenced (T7 sequenase version 2.0, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Ten microliters of rabbit antitrimethyguanosine (anti-TMG R1131 (7 mg/ml), kindly provided by R. Lührmann) or monoclonal anti-fibrillarin 72B9 (kindly provided by M. Pollard) were incubated with gentle agitation for 120 min at room temperature with 2.5 mg of swollen protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) in 0.5 ml of NET-150 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). PAS-Ig pellets were washed eight times with 1 ml of NET-150 buffer. Ten micrograms of total RNA purified from rat brain or 0.5 ml of total brain extract (prepared as described above for construction of the rat cDNA library) was then added to PAS-R1131 (in 0.5 ml of NET-150) or PAS-72B9, respectively, and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. PAS pellet was then collected and washed eight times with 1 ml of NET-150 buffer. RNAs from pellet was recovered by SDS/phenol extraction and analyzed by Northern blot as described below. Primer extension was carried out as described previously (41Cavaillé J. Bachellerie J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1576-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) at 42 °C for 60 min. Direct RNA sequencing by primer extension was performed using the same conditions with dideoxynucleotides elongation mixes. Rat tissue freshly prepared from a dead animal according to French institutional guidelines and rat brain areas manually dissected were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Total cell RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (42Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62897) Google Scholar) adapted to our conditions (43Qu L.H. Nicoloso M. Michot B. Azum M.C. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Renalier M.H. Bachellerie J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+RNA purification was performed as recommended by manufacturer (Promega). Fractionation of RNAs was carried out by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde or 6% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Fractionated RNAs were transferred electrophoretically (120 min in 0.5× TBE at 1 mA) to nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cross-linked by UV irradiation (120,000 µJ/cm2, Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) before Northern blot hybridization. A rat brain cDNA library (Lamba ZAP II library from Stratagene) has been screened by hybridization as recommended by the manufacturer with a32P-labeled oligonucleotide specific for spliced Bsr RNA. A 0.9-kb-long repeat unit was PCR-amplified from rat genomic DNA with 5′Bsr1/3′Bsr1 primers and cloned into pBluescriptII plasmid opened byBamHI/EcoRI. This vector was used to clone by PCR RBII-36 snoRNA downstream from a T7 promoter (using 5′ RBII-36/3′ RBII-36T7 primers). A spliced Bsr riboprobe spanning four ligated exons was cloned by RT-PCR in pBluescriptII vector using 3′ Bsr exon and 5′ Bsr exon primers as indicated in Fig. 5 B. Internally labeled antisense RBII-36 snoRNA and spliced Bsr RNA riboprobes were synthesized by standard in vitro transcription of linearized vectors using T3 or T7 RNA polymerases, respectively, and [α-32P]CTP. Northern blot hybridizations were carried out with oligodeoxynucleotide probes 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]NTP (5·106 cpm/ml). Incubations were performed in 5× SSPE, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 150 µg/ml yeast tRNA at 50 °C or at 30 °C (low hybridization stringency conditions) either overnight or for 3 h. Membranes were washed twice for 15 min with 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS or with 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature (low hybridization stringency conditions). For riboprobe hybridization, Northern blots were carried out through overnight incubation at 65 °C in 5× SSPE, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, 150 µg/ml yeast tRNA, 50% (v/v) deionized formamide, and membranes were washed twice for 15 min in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then for 30 min in 1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS and finally for 15 min at room temperature in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. The 0.9-kb-long Bsr repeat unit was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with 5′ Bsr exon and 3′ Bsr exon primers and inserted into eukaryotic vector pRCEN downstream from the cytomegalovirus promoter. Transfection of the construct pCMV/RBII-36 into mouse cell line L929 and processing assays were as described (11Cavaillé J. Nicoloso M. Bachellerie J.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Detection of RBII-36 snoRNA and Bsr RNAs by in situ hybridization was performed on adult rat brain 10–15 µm cryostat sagittal sections as described (44Basyuk E. Bertrand E. Journot L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E46Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using digoxigenin-labeled antisense snoRNA or a spliced Bsr RNA riboprobe spanning four spliced exons. Taking advantage of the fact that nucleolar protein fibrillarin specifically binds all members of this large snoRNA family, we first constructed a rat brain cDNA library specific for box C/D snoRNAs (Fig. 1). Briefly, box C/D snoRNPs were immunoprecipitated from a total rat brain extract by an anti-fibrillarin antibody (72B9). Extracted RNAs were oligonucleotide-tagged at both ends by T4 RNA ligase and amplified by RT-PCR as described (10Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Cell. 1996; 85: 1077-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). RT-PCR primers were designed in such a way as to only amplify RNA molecules containing box C (RUGAUGA) and D (CUGA) motifs at the appropriate distance from their extremities (Fig. 1). Amplified DNAs were then cloned, and individual clones were systematically sequenced. A large proportion of the clones corresponded to rat homologues of ubiquitous box C/D snoRNAs already identified in humans, mice, or other mammals (3Bachellerie J.P. Cavaillé J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Hüttenhofer A. Kiefmann M. Meier-Ewert S. O'Brien J. Lehrach H. Bachellerie J.P. Brosius J. EMBO J. 2000; 20: 2943-2953Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Another substantial fraction corresponded to novel, ubiquitously expressed rat snoRNAs either able to target rRNA or snRNA ribose methylations or devoid of any obvious presumptive RNA target. Finally, a few clones corresponding to brain-specific box C/D snoRNAs were also isolated, three of them corresponding to rat homologues of brain-specific snoRNAs previously detected in mouse, MBII-52, MBII-85, and MBII-48 (15Hüttenhofer A.

In this study, we have focused our attention on three closely related clones without equivalent among previously detected mouse snoRNAs. Data base searches revealed that closely related sequences of clones IPLIB-36, IPLIB-76, and IPLIB-256 (Fig.2 A) shared 93–100% identity with four EST sequences (GenBankTM accession numbersAA900746, BE099838, AI599685, and AW919728) and also, interestingly, with the 5′-end of a brain-specific non-protein-coding RNA, Bsr, recently identified in rat (45Komine Y. Tanaka N.K. Yano R. Takai S. Yuasa S. Shiroishi T. Tsuchiya K. Yamamori T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 66: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 2 B(top), this region of Bsr contains a series of 0.9-kb-long tandemly repeated units. Within the snoRNA-like sequences of Bsr, the hallmark box motifs (C, D′, C′, and D, in that order) are generally conserved among the different repeated units, with polymorphism essentially restricted to length variation of a 5–19-nt-long adenosine tract located a few nt downstream from box C (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, segments immediately upstream from box D or D′ do not exhibit a complementarity to rRNA or an snRNA of at least 9 bp, thus making it unlikely that the snoRNA could direct a 2′-O-methylation of one of these potential targets (41Cavaillé J. Bachellerie J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1576-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Examination of all specimens of the snoRNA-like sequence of Bsr available in GenBankTMshowed that a perfect 5-bp-long 5′–3′-terminal stem could form in all cases at the expected location relative to the C and D motifs (Fig. 2 B). This reinforces the notion that part of the Bsr transcript actually encoded a box C/D snoRNA. To test this possibility, a Northern blot analysis of total rat brain RNA was performed with 32P-labeled probe IPLIB36-2. Three distinct radioactive signals were detected at about 76, 80, and 88 nt (Fig.2 C, left), in good agreement with the size expected for an RNA exhibiting the above-mentioned length polymorphism and ending at the expected 5′–3′-terminal stem. Intriguingly, we also observed a radioactive band of much faster mobility, at about 40 nt. Reverse transcription performed on total rat brain RNAs using IPLIB36-2 primer confirmed the expected location of the snoRNA 5′ end and revealed a snoRNA size heterogeneity consistent with its being expressed from multiple units of the Bsr repetitious array (Fig.2 C, right). In agreement with the presence of the 40-nt RNA band detected by Northern blot, an intense cDNA band doublet was also detected at 39–40 nt, indicating that the 5′-end of the shortened form was located 3–4 nt upstream from box C′. As expected, the RNA bands of 76, 80, and 88 nt detected in Northern blot with the IPLIB36-2 probe were all specifically immunoprecipitated with the 72B9 anti-fibrillarin antibody (Fig. 2 D,left) and also with anti-hNop58 and to a lesser extent with anti-Nop140 antibodies (data not shown). This was also the case for the 5′ truncated 40-nt-long species. Taken together, these data indicate that the three closely related sequences isolated from our cDNA library correspond to a bona fide box C/D snoRNA encoded in the Bsr locus. This snoRNA is devoid of a 5′-trimethyl cap, as indicated by its lack of immunoprecipitation with an anti-trimethyl cap (R1131) antibody (Fig. 2 D, right). In the course of their study, Komine et al. (45Komine Y. Tanaka N.K. Yano R. Takai S. Yuasa S. Shiroishi T. Tsuchiya K. Yamamori T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 66: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) detected with the 0.9-kb Bsr cDNA probe, in addition to the long Bsr transcript, an intriguing cross-hybridizing 80-nt-long RNA of elusive origin. In hindsight, it is now clear that this 80-nt-long RNA must correspond to the novel box C/D snoRNA identified in the present study, termed RBII-36 (for rat brain fraction II 36). To gain more information about the pattern of expression of RBII-36, a panel of total RNA samples extracted from various adult rat tissues was analyzed by Northern blot using the IPLIB36-2-specific probe (Fig.3 A). We detected a signal only in the brain RNA sample (lane 1), although very low levels of RBII-36 snoRNA could also be detected in ovaries and stomach after much longer exposures (data not shown). This tissue-specific expression pattern is in striking contrast to what has been observed for previously identified snoRNAs guiding rRNA or snRNA methylation. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3 A, U40 and U21 snoRNA were detected at roughly similar levels in all of the rat tissues checked. The same membrane was also probed with sequences derived from two brain-specific box C/D snoRNAs recently identified in mice, MBII-52 and MBII-85 (17Cavaillé J. Buiting K. Kiefmann M. Lalande M. Brannan C.I. Horsthemke B. Bachellerie J.P. Brosius J. Huttenhofer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14311-14316Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). As expected, rat homologs of these snoRNAs were detected, which were also specifically expressed in the brain, although a very weak signal could also be observed in other tissues for RBII-85 snoRNA after much longer exposures ("

Using this region of the gene as probe, a cDNA clone of 4.4 kilobase pairs was isolated by screening JEG-3 cell and human placental cDNA expression libraries. The open reading frame encodes three zinc fingers of the C2H2 subtype, and separate regions rich in glutamate, proline, and glutamine, which are indicative of a DNA-binding protein involved in gene transcription. Expression of the cDNA in vitro and in HeLa cells yields a protein of 132 kDa, which concurs with the predicted size. Northern blot analysis demonstrate expression of two TReP-132 transcripts of 4.4 and 7.5 kilobase pairs in the thymus, adrenal cortex, and testis; and expression is also found in the steroidogenic JEG-3, NCI-H295, and MCF-7 cell lines. Immunocytochemistry analysis demonstrates localization of the HA-tagged TReP-132 protein in the nucleus. The expression of exogenous TReP-132 in HeLa cells was demonstrated to interact with the −155/−131 region in bandshift analysis. Transfection of the cDNA in placental JEG-3 and adrenal NCI-H295 cells increases expression of a reporter construct controlled by the P450scc gene 5′-flanking region from nucleotides −1676 to +49. Moreover, a chimeric protein generated by fusion of TReP-132 with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was able to significantly increase promoter activity of a reporter construct via Gal4-binding sites upstream of the E1b minimal promoter. Coexpression of CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 with TReP-132 has an additive effect on promoter activity, and the proteins were demonstrated to interact physically.

TheCYP11A1 gene, which encodes P450scc, is expressed in steroidogenic tissues, which include the adrenal, ovary, testis, placenta, and brain (3Mellon S.H. Deschepper C.F.

In each of these tissues, steroid hormones play important physiological roles, which include regulation of tissue development, progression of secondary sexual characteristics, and maintenance of homeostasis. The hormonal regulation and developmental pattern of expression of P450scc are specific to each steroidogenic tissue; adrenocorticotropin increases steroidogenesis and accumulation of P450scc transcript in the human adrenal cortex, and similar effects are seen with luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in human ovarian granulosa cells, and with luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin in human testicular Leydig cells (5Waterman M.R.

Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) cells identified regions of the 5′-flanking DNA that conferred basal promoter activity and response to cAMP. However, it is apparent that different elements are utilized in a cell type-specific manner. The cAMP-responsive element identified in human JEG-3 cells differs from the element identified when studies were performed in mouse Y1, MA-10, and I-10 cells (16Moore C.C. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2045-2058PubMed Google Scholar, 18Guo I.-C. Tsai H.-M. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6362-6369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these mouse cell lines, cAMP-responsive elements were localized to sites in the vicinity of nucleotides −1620 and −600, whereas cAMP response in JEG-3 cells was conferred by a proximal region around nucleotide −117 (18Guo I.-C. Tsai H.-M. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6362-6369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Watanabe N. Inoue H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur J Biochem. 1994; 222: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, neither of these elements were functional in NCI-H295 cells (17Rodriguez H. Hum D.W. Staels B. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Positive cis-acting elements have also been identified, which confer expression of P450scc gene promoter activity in steroidogenic cell lines, but not in nonsteroidogenic cells. However, it is also apparent that some elements, such as those found between nucleotides −1931 and −1822, can increase promoter activity in Y1 and MA-10 cells, but not in NCI-H295 and JEG-3 cells (20Chou S.J. Lai K.N. Chung B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22125-22129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In other studies, the region between −155 and −131 was found to significantly increase promoter activity in JEG-3 cells (1Hum D.W. Aza Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Moore C.C. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2045-2058PubMed Google Scholar). These putative cis-acting elements in the 5′-flanking region of the human P450scc gene have been demonstrated to interact with multiple proteins, which include CREB/ATF (19Watanabe N. Inoue H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur J Biochem. 1994; 222: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), NF1- and Sp1-like proteins, and in particular the steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1). The orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 also known as adrenal binding protein (Ad4BP) has been demonstrated to promote cell specific expression of the human P450scc gene promoter in Y1 cells (19Watanabe N. Inoue H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Eur J Biochem. 1994; 222: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol.

(Tokyo). 1994; 116: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The human P450scc gene promoter is inactive in nonsteroidogenic CV-1 cells, but could be activated by expression of exogenous SF-1 (21Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 23Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the interaction of the P450scc gene 5′-flanking DNA with known proteins, the putative cis-acting elements have also been found to interact with unidentified presumably novel transcription factors. The positive element between −155 and −131 (−155/−131) was shown to interact specifically with at least two different proteins; however, the identity and role of neither of these proteins are known. Based on the many previous studies on P450scc gene expression, which demonstrate the cell type specific usage of cis-acting elements and involvement of multiple trans-acting factors, it is obvious that a clear understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of expression of this important gene will require identification and characterization of the transcription factors involved. Recently, Huang et al. (24Huang N. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2852-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) identified two proteins, LBP-1b and LBP-9, which interact with the −155/−131 element and regulate reporter activity via this element. In the present study, a novel protein TReP-132 was cloned by screening a placental cDNA expression library with a region of the P450scc gene 5′-flanking region from nucleotides −155 to −131 (−155/−131). Analysis of the predicted primary structure reveals a protein of 1200 residues, which contains three zinc fingers of the C2H2 subtype. TReP-132 also has other motifs characteristic of transcriptional regulating proteins including regions rich in glutamine, proline, and acidic residues. The TReP-132 primary structure contains two LXXLL motifs, which suggests the interaction of the protein with nuclear receptors such as SF-1 to regulate gene expression. The encoded protein with an apparent molecular mass of 132 kDa was shown to interact with the −155/−131 element by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Transient expression of this protein increased expression of a reporter construct controlled by the 5′-flanking region of the P450scc gene from nucleotides −1676 to +49. As well, the −155/−131 element was found to confer response to TReP-132. The interaction of TReP-132 with DNA, its subcellular localization in the cell nucleus, and its ability to increase promoter activity indicate its function as a transcriptional regulating protein. To further understand the mechanism by which TReP-132 regulates gene expression, it was shown to interact with the coregulator protein CBP/p300 to synergistically increase promoter activity. Transcripts encoding TReP-132 are expressed predominantly in the adrenal gland and testis, as well as steroidogenic cell lines, which is consistent with the potential role of this factor to regulate steroid synthesis. However, TReP-132 transcripts are also expressed in several other tissues examined, including the thymus, stomach, and heart, which indicates additional roles for TReP-132 other than regulation of steroid synthesis. A human placenta cDNA expression library (catalog no. HL3007b, CLONTECH; Palo Alto, CA) was screened with multimerized copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to nucleotides −155 to −131 of the human P450scc gene 5′-flanking DNA. Following hybridization of equal amounts of the sense and antisense oligonucleotides, they were multimerized with T4 DNA ligase and end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dGTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The λgt11 library was screened as described (25Huynh T.V. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 49-78Google Scholar) using a method for Southwestern blot analysis (1Hum D.W. Aza Blanc P. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 451Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After screening ∼2 × 106recombinants, three positive clones were isolated, including the initial partial TReP-132 clone (P1). A ZAP Express cDNA library was made using JEG-3 cell mRNA according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and an additional 4 × 106 recombinants were screened with the P1 cDNA but yielded only 10 partial clones, which did not contain the initiating codon. An additional 2 × 106 recombinants from another human placenta λgt11 cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Morag Park, McGill University) were screened to isolate 6 clones including P1-CL6 which contains the putative initiator codon. To subclone the full-length TReP-132 cDNA for subsequent studies, anKpnI/EcoRI fragment from the P1-CL6 cDNA in the Bluescript KS+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was ligated to theEcoRI-XbaI fragment of P1-CL4 in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (Fig. 2 A). Both strands of the TReP-132 cDNA were each sequenced at least twice, by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Québec, Canada). The sequence has been deposited to the GenBank™ data base and has been assigned accession numberAF297872. JEG-3 cell total RNA was isolated by the Tri reagent acid phenol method (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH), and poly(A) RNA was subsequently obtained by chromatography on oligo(dT). 2 μg of mRNA was separated on a 1.1% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membrane immobilized mRNA was hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes (Fig. 2 A) corresponding to the 5′ end of P1-CL6 and the 3′ end of P1-CL13 as described previously (26Hum D.W. Bell A.W. Rozen R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15946-15950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A radiolabeled riboprobe was generated using [α-32P]UTP and the MAXIscript in vitrotranscription kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The probe was generated following linearization of the TReP-132-HA cDNA in the pcDNA3 vector by digestion with NarI, and transcription from the Sp6 promoter. The transcribed probe is a 226-bp cRNA consisting of 174 bases from the 3′ end of the TReP-132 cDNA and 52 bases from the polylinker including the HA sequences. The 18 S riboprobe used for normalization was generated from the pTRI-18S-Human vector from Ambion and produces a protected fragment of 80 bp. RNase protection assays were performed using the Ribonuclease Protection Assay II kit from Ambion, according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA from different cell lines (20 μg) or yeast tRNA (20 μg) was hybridized to the probes at 45 °C, and then digested for 1 h at 37 °C at a dilution of 1:75 (RNase A/RNase T1 mix) in the RNase digestion buffer. The samples were resolved on a 6% urea-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TNT coupled in vitro system, Promega, Madison, WI) from plasmids containing a T7 promoter, according to the manufacturer's protocol with [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled proteins were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was dried and exposed to film for autoradiography. To assess the apparent molecular mass of TReP-132, protein was expressed both in vitro and in vivo. Whole cell lysate of HeLa cells transfected with TReP-132 tagged with the HA epitope (TReP-132-HA) or with pcDNA3 alone, and the product ofin vitro transcription/translation performed with the TReP-132-HA cDNA as template (or no template for control) were resuspended in 2× electrophoresis sample buffer. Total protein was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were preincubated 1 h in blocking solution containing 5% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (1/15,000, Covance, Richmond, CA). After three washes with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (1/10,000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) for 45 min. After three washes with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS and one wash with 2% Tween 20 in 10× TBS, development was performed with the Renaissance ECL Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to manufacturer's protocol. To assess if TReP-132 coimmunoprecipitates with p300, 1 × 106 HeLa cells were plated on a 100-mm dish and incubated for 24 h. Cells were transfected using 40 μl of ExGen 500/5 μg of the p300 construct and 5 μg of the TReP-132 construct tagged with a Flag epitope (TReP-132-Flag). Immunoprecipitation was performed according to the procedure described by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were collected in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation; the cell extract was then preincubated with normal rabbit IgG for 30 min (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The quantity of proteins in the supernatant was assessed by Bradford assay as instructed by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of 1 mg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 μg of monoclonal anti-Flag M2 antibody (F3165, Sigma) or 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-p300 antibody (sc-584, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 1 μg of rabbit non-immune IgG as control. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a mouse anti-Flag antisera (1/10,000) as the first antibody, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antisera (1/10,000, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Washes and visualization of proteins were performed as described above. EMSAs were performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the human P450scc gene sequence from nucleotides −155 to −131 (same region used for library screening). The probe was end-labeled with the Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Experiments were performed using 10 μg of nuclear extract isolated from JEG-3 cells or from HeLa cells expressing exogenous TReP-132 or transfected with the expression vector only. Extracts were incubated with 200 fmol (900,000 cpm) of DNA probe in the presence of 2 μg poly(dI-dC) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol in a final reaction volume of 20 μl for 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by native 4% PAGE in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA for 2 h at 150 V. Gels were dried and exposed to film for 6 h at −80 °C. HeLa cells (2 × 104) were plated on culture slides (Biocoat Culture Slides, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubated for 16 h. Transfection was then performed with Exgen 500 (MBI Fermentas, Flamborough, Ontario, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were washed three times with cold PBS, then fixed for 15 min with formalin (Sigma). Cells were washed five times with PBS before permeabilization with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (6% powder milk, 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS) to minimize unspecific binding of antibodies. Slides were then incubated with the rabbit anti-HA primary antibody (Covance) in binding buffer (blocking buffer diluted 1:10 with TBS) at a 1:100 dilution, for overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, the slides were washed twice with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and twice with PBS. The Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) was added at a 1:1000 dilution in binding buffer, and slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Washes were done as described for the primary antibody. Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counterstain was done by incubating slides for 10 min in the dark at room temperature with 0.1 μm dilactate DAPI (Molecular Probes Inc.). Cells were thoroughly washed with water, allowed to dry and were mounted as described in the Prolong Anti-Fade kit (Molecular Probes Inc.). For visualization, a Leica DMR-B epifluorescence microscope (Leica Inc. Deerfield, IL) was used in combination with standard photography. Typically, exposure times varied between 0.5 and 15 s with a Kodak Gold 100 ASA film. Human NCI-H295 adrenal tumor cells, choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, cervical HeLa cells, and transformed primary embryonal kidney HK-293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). NCI-H295 cells were cultured in monolayer as described previously (17Rodriguez H. Hum D.W. Staels B. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in equal amounts of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% insulin, transferin, selenium (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1% red phenol, 10−8m E2, and 10−8mHOCortisone. JEG-3 and HeLa cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% and 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), respectively. HK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All medium were supplemented with glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (55 units/ml), and streptomycin (55 μg/ml). The reporter plasmid 3×(−155/−131)TK32Luc comprises three copies of the −155/−131 element generated by annealing and multimerizing the oligonucleotides: 5′-GATCTCGCTGCAGAAATTCCAGACTGAACCG-3′ and 3′-AGCGACGTCTTTAAGGTCTGACTTGGCCTAG-5′. Three copies of this element was then subcloned upstream from the minimal HSV thymidine kinase promoter (TK32) into the BamHI site of the pLUC plasmid. The P450scc luciferase reporter construct −1676/+49sccLuc contains a fragment of the human P450scc gene, which spans from nucleotide −1676 at the 5′ end to nucleotide +49 at the 3′ end. The DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from a P450scc genomic clone kindly provided by Dr. Bon-chu Chung (Academia Sinica, Nanking, Taipei, Taiwan) using oligonucleotides that introduced a KpnI site andBglII site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Following amplification, the PCR product was digested with KpnI andBglII and then subcloned into the pGL3 reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The TReP-132-HA and the pLUC-HA vectors, containing the entire cDNA of TReP-132 or luciferase tagged with the HA epitope, were created by amplifying by PCR the TReP-132 or luciferase cDNA with oligonucleotides that introduced a KpnI site at the 5′ end and a HA site and a XbaI site and 3′ end. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and XbaI and subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The pcDNA3-GAL4 vector was generated by subcloning aHindIII/XbaI insert containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147) from the pSG424 plasmid (a gift from Dr Michael R. Green, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Research Laboratories, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA) into the corresponding sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector. The GAL4-TReP-132 plasmid was created by subcloning a PCR product corresponding to the entire coding region of TReP-132 into the pcDNA3-GAL4 vector. The P1 clone 2 plasmid used in GST pull-down analysis was created by inserting a PCR fragment corresponding to amino acids 751–1200 of TReP-132, fused in-frame downstream of GST sequences in the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All the constructs made were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pFR-LUC plasmid, which comprises five GAL4 elements upstream of a minimal E1b TATA box followed by the luciferase reporter gene, was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmids encoding p300 were kindly provided by Dr. Richard H. Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences University), and plasmids encoding E1A and the RG2 mutant as described by Wang et al. (27Wang H.-G.H. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Claude Labrie (CHUL Research Center). Plasmid encoding GST fusion protein with CBP fragments were provided by Dr. Ralf Janknecht (Salk Institute for Biological Studies) (28Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa and HK-293 cells were cultured in 12-well plates at an initial density of 1 × 105 cells/well; and JEG-3 and NCI-H295 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. Following 24 h of incubation, the medium was changed and transient transfections were carried out for 12 h. HeLa, HK-293, and JEG-3 cells were transfected with ExGen 500 (MBI Fermentas, Flamborough, Ontario, Canada) at a ratio of 8 μl of ExGen 500/1.5 μg of DNA. NCI-H295 cells were transfected with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) at a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 25 μl of Effectene. Following transfection for 12 h, the cells were incubated in fresh medium for 12–36 h. For luciferase assays, cells were lysed by the addition of 250 μl of lysis buffer (0.8% Triton X-100, 25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA) and incubated for 15 min. Fifteen μl of the cell lysate was assayed using the Luciferase assay system from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI) in a Berthold Lumat LB9501 luminometer. All experiments were normalized by cotransfecting 0.1 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid driven by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. β-Galactosidase assays were performed using 10 μl of lysate in the Galacto-Light Plus assay system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). For the transfection of each cell type, the efficiency of transfection was verified by a green fluorescence protein expression plasmid, and the efficiencies obtained were 60% or better. To ascertain the interaction between CBP/p300 and TReP-132 in vitro, fragments of CBP polypeptides from different regions of the protein were expressed as GST fusion proteins and were immobilized on glutathione-coupled Sepharose as described by Frangioni and Nell (29Frangioni J.V.

Surprisingly, we find that the N-terminal domain of Vam3p is not essential for fusion, although analogous domains in other syntaxins are indispensible for fusion and/or protein-protein interactions. In contrast to the N-terminal domain, mutations in the SNARE motif of Vam3p or replacement of the SNARE motif of Vam3p with the SNARE motif from other syntaxins inhibited fusion. Furthermore, the precise distance between the SNARE motif and the TMR was critical for fusion. Insertion of only three residues after the SNARE motif significantly impaired fusion and insertion of 12 residues abolished fusion. As judged by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the SNARE motif mutations and the insertions did not alter the association of Vam3p with Vam7p, Vti1p, Nyv1p, and Ykt6p, other vacuolar SNARE proteins implicated in fusion. In contrast, the SNARE motif substitutions interfered with the stable formation of Vam3p complexes with Nyv1p and Vti1p, although Vam3p complexes with Vam7p and Ykt6p were still present. Our data suggest that in contrast to previously characterized syntaxins, Vam3p contains only two domains essential for fusion, the SNARE motif and the TMR, and these domains have to be closely coupled to function in fusion.

At least four classes of proteins appear to be essential for all intracellular fusion reactions: SNARE1 proteins, the SNARE chaperones (NSF and p97 with adaptor molecules), Sec1/munc18-like proteins (SM proteins), and Rab proteins. SNARE proteins are identified by a signature sequence of ∼55 residues, the SNARE motif, which is followed in most SNAREs by a C-terminal transmembrane region (TMR) (5Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B.

At the mammalian synapse, three SNAREs mediate synaptic vesicle exocytosis: the vesicle protein synaptobrevin/VAMP and the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25. The SNARE motifs of these proteins (one each in syntaxin and synaptobrevin; two in SNAP-25) form a stable complex, the so-called core complex, that is composed of a four-helical bundle (8Söllner T.

Because the SNARE motifs are generally adjacent to TMRs, which in turn are anchored in opposing membranes, formation of core complexes by SNARE proteins may bring the two membranes into close proximity and thereby force membrane fusion (reviewed in Ref. 4Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In yeast, one of the best studied example of membrane fusion is the vacuole fusion reaction (reviewed in Refs.13Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Five SNARE proteins have been implicated in vacuole fusion: the syntaxin-like SNARE Vam3p, the SNAP-25 like SNAREs Vam7p and Vti1p, and the synaptobrevin/VAMP-like SNAREs Nyv1p and Ykt6p (16Wada Y.

These five vacuolar SNAREs probably function analogously to SNAREs in other fusion reactions, but it is currently unclear if Nyv1p and Ykt6p contribute to the formation of separate four-helical core complexes, or if a novel type of core complex is assembled. Syntaxin 1 is considered as the central SNARE protein in synaptic vesicle exocytosis because its SNARE motif participates in core complex formation, and its N-terminal domain is required for binding the SM protein munc18-1 (Ref. 23Hata Y.

Interestingly, two other syntaxin-like SNAREs were found to contain independently folded three-helical N-terminal domains, the yeast plasma membrane syntaxin Sso1p (31Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brünger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 32Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and yeast vacuolar syntaxin Vam3p (33Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This suggests that three-helical N-terminal domains can be considered a hallmark of syntaxins that may have an evolutionary conserved function. Indeed, similar to syntaxin 1, the N-terminal domain of Sso1p also folds back onto the SNARE motif into a closed conformation that is essential for yeast viability (32Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly the closed conformation of Sso1p does not appear to bind the SM protein Sec1p (34Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), although this result has been questioned (35Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Equally surprisingly, the yeast vacuolar syntaxin Vam3p appears to be constitutively open, and the N-terminal domain of Vam3p (different from the syntaxin 1 N-terminal domain) is not required for binding to the corresponding SM protein Vps33p (33Dulubova I. Yamaguchi T. Wang Y. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These results raise the question of whether syntaxins perform general functions in membrane fusion via their conserved three-helical N-terminal domains coupled to the SNARE motifs or if these domains are specialized for a given fusion reaction. To address this, we have now studied the functional importance of the conserved structural domains of the yeast vacuolar syntaxin Vam3p using the in vitrovacuole fusion reaction that allows a combination of yeast genetics with an in vitro assay (36Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We now show that, as expected, the SNARE motif of Vam3p is essential for vacuolar fusion. Unexpectedly, however, we find that the N-terminal domain is dispensable. The precise sequence of the SNARE motif is important for fusion, as is the distance of the motif from the TMR. Our results suggest that syntaxins only share general functions mediated by the SNARE motif and TMR, but not by the N-terminal domains. The yeast strains and the plasmid vectors used for transgenic expression of wild-type and mutant Vam3ps in this study are shown in Table I. Plasmids were constructed by standard methods; mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Vam3 deletion mutants of yeast (YWD1 and YWD2) were generated by transforming pBNeoΔVam3 into the DKY6218 and TVY1 strains (37Gerhardt B. Kordas T.J. Thompson C.M. Patel P. Vida T. J. Biol.

Deletion of the Vam3 gene in the transformants by homologous recombination was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using primers from outside of theVam3 gene. YWD1 and YWD2 were then transformed with the expression vectors listed in Table I containing the indicated coding sequences under control of the yeast Vam3 promoter in the episomal single copy expression vector pRS416. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing; protein expression in all yeast strains was confirmed by immunoblotting.Table IYeast strains and yeast expression vectorsStrainGenotypeSourceDKY6281MATα leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3-▵200 trp1-▵901 ade2–101 suc2-▵9 ▵pho8::TRP1Ref. 38Klionsky D.J.

Fusion reactions (volume: 30 µl) contained 4.5 µg of protein of vacuoles from the DKY6218 and TVY1 strains expressing the same wild-type or mutant Vam3p in 23.3 µl; 2.2 µl of 10× salt adjustment buffer (100 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 0.5m sorbitol, 1 m potassium acetate, 0.5m KCl, 50 mm MgCl2), 3 µl of a 10× ATP-regenerating system (creatine kinase 10 g/l, 0.4 mcreatine phosphate, 5 mm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2), 0.5 µl of protease inhibitor mixture PIC (50× PIC: 10 µl of leupeptin (0.5 g/liter), 50 µl of 1,10-phenanthroline (500 mm in ethanol), 25 µl of pepstatin A (1 mg/ml in methanol), 50 µl of Pefabloc (100 mm)), 1 µl of yeast cytosol (protein concentration: 1 g/liter). All components were added to 1.5-ml microfuge tubes on ice (vacuoles last), and the tubes were incubated at 30 °C or on ice (controls) for 90 min. Afterward, the tubes were placed on ice for 5 min, 470 µl of alkaline phosphatase developer solution (250 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 0.4% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate) were added, the tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and enzyme reactions were stopped with 0.5 ml of alkaline phosphatase stop solution (1 m glycine/KOH, pH 11.5). Alkaline phosphatase activity was then measured as the absorbance at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer against a sample containing a buffer blank. For calculation of the fusion value, the absorbance obtained with control vacuoles kept on ice was subtracted from the value obtained with vacuoles incubated at 30 °C. Rabbit anti-Vam3p antibodies were raised against purified recombinant Vam3p containing either the entire cytoplasmic region including the SNARE motif (residues 1–259; T2950) or only the N-terminal domain (residues 1–135; T2951). Rabbit anti-Vam7p antibody (T2409) was raised against recombinant N-terminal Vam7p-(1–195) GST fusion protein. Antibodies were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C. Spheroblasts were prepared from 1 liter yeast cultures expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type and mutant Vam3p and lysed on ice for 30 min in IP buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was adjusted to 6 ml using IP buffer, and 1.5 ml of supernatant was incubated with 30 µl of the appropriate antibody on ice for 1 h. 40 µl of protein A or protein G-Sepharose beads (50%) were added, beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with agitation, washed three times with IP buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to Vam3p, Vam7p, Vti1p, Nyv1p, and Ykt6p (the last three antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. W. Wickner, Dartmouth). Analysis was performed essentially as described (40Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells of the various genotypes were grown overnight in selection medium (−URA). Cells were then diluted to anA 600 of 0.2 in YPD medium and grown at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.8, pelleted, and resuspended in 16 µm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) in YPD medium. Afterward, cells were incubated for 15 min at 30°C with agitation, washed, immobilized on concanavalin A-coated slides, and viewed in a fluorescent microscope. The strategy pursued in this study was based on thein vitro vacuole fusion assay developed by Wickner and co-workers (36Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the proteolytic activation of vacuolar pro-alkaline phosphatase by vacuolar protease A (38Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2241-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Vacuoles from yeast cells lacking either protease A or pro-alkaline phosphatase have no enzymatically active alkaline phosphatase. When these vacuoles are fused in vitro, alkaline phosphatase is activated and can be easily monitored. Our overall goal was to employ the in vitro vacuole fusion assay to examine the effect of Vam3p mutations on fusion. To pursue this goal, we first generated yeast strains lacking Vam3p and either protease A or pro-alkaline phosphatase (YWD1 and YWD2; Table I). We then expressed wild-type and mutant Vam3ps in these strains from single-copy episomal vectors containing the normal Vam3promoter to avoid overexpression of the protein. All expressed Vam3ps carried an N-terminal FLAG epitope to allow protein detection independent of antigenic sites in Vam3p that may have been deleted in the mutants. In this manner we could verify by immunoblotting that the various Vam3p mutants were present on the purified vacuoles that were used for the vacuole fusion assays. In addition, we examined the Vam3p mutants for their ability to form heteromeric complexes with the other vacuolar SNARE proteins, Vam7p, Vti1p, Ykt6p, and Nyv1p, as an indication of the structural integrity and proper folding of the Vam3p mutants on the vacuoles. Finally, we tested these mutants in an independent assay for vacuole fusion competence, a fluorescence assay in which vacuoles are visualized in vivo by uptake of the dye FM4-64 (40Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). We first examined whether the two major cytoplasmic regions of Vam3p, the N-terminal three-helical domain, and the SNARE motif, are essential for fusion (Fig.1A). In purified vacuoles isolated from the mutant yeast cells, both mutant Vam3ps were present at levels similar to those of wild-type Vam3p (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of the N-terminal domain of Vam3p had no effect on overall fusion between vacuoles, whereas deletion of the SNARE motif abolished fusion (Fig. 1 C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments of Vam3p and Vam7p from the yeast cells used for the in vitrofusion assays demonstrated that wild-type FLAG-tagged Vam3p was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Vam7p using either monoclonal FLAG tag or polyclonal Vam7p antibodies (Fig.2, lanes 1–3). No co-immunoprecipitation of Vam7p and Vam3p was observed with mutant Vam3p lacking the SNARE motif using either Vam3p or Vam7p antibodies for immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6). In contrast, Vam3p lacking the N-terminal domain was as efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Vam7p as wild-type Vam3p (Fig. 2,lanes 7–9). Furthermore, the Vam3p immunoprecipitates from yeast cells expressing wild-type and N-terminally deleted Vam3p, but not SNARE-motif deleted Vam3p, contained all other SNARE proteins that are currently implicated in vacuole fusion (22Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Vit1p, Nyv1p, and Ykt6p were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type and with N-terminal-deleted Vam3p, but were absent from immunoprecipitates of SNARE motif-deleted Vam3p (Fig. 3,lanes 1–9). These results suggest that the SNARE motif of Vam3p is essential for vacuole fusion and for SNARE complex formation, whereas removal of the N-terminal domain of Vam3p has no major effect on either fusion or SNARE complexes. The necessity of the SNARE motif for fusion is not unexpected given the role of SNARE motifs in mediating assembly of core complexes during fusion (reviewed in Ref.4Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The dispensability of the N-terminal domains of Vam3p, however, is surprising in view of the similarity of this domain to the N-terminal domains of Sso1 that is essential for exocytosis (32Munson M. Chen X. Cocina A.E. Schultz S.M. Hughson F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and of syntaxin 1 that is essential for binding the SM protein Munc18 (23Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Südhof T.C.

Vam3p was immunoprecipitated from the vacuolar proteins by virtue of the N-terminal epitope tag attached to all Vam3ps, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies to Vti1p, Nyv1p, and Ykt6p as indicated on the right.

First, as described previously (22Ungermann C. von Mollard G.F. Jensen O.N. Margolis N. Stevens T.H. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), an antibody to Vam3p that reacts with the entire molecule including the SNARE motif (anti-Vam3p) inhibited vacuole fusion whereas preimmune serum (PIS) had no effect. An antibody to the N-terminal domain of Vam3p (anti-Vam3pN), however, was as inactive in inhibiting fusion as preimmune serum or control antibodies (Fig. 4). Second, when vacuoles were visualized in yeast cells expressing wild-type Vam3p or mutant Vam3ps with deletions of either the SNARE motif or the N-terminal domain, the morphology of the vacuoles in cells with wild-type and N-terminal-deleted Vam3p appeared normal (Fig. 5,panels A′, A′′, C′, andC′′). In contrast, cells expressing Vam3p with a deletion of the SNARE motif contained a fragmented staining pattern typical for a vauole fusion defect (Fig. 5, panels B′ and B′′). These results are consistent with the conclusion that the N-terminal domain of Vam3p is not directly involved in the fundamental fusion reaction, whereas the SNARE motif is essential.Figure 5Analysis of yeast cells expressing wild-type Vam3p (WT) and various Vam3p mutants by staining with FM4-64 as a vital dye that stains vacuoles in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2021980627,"The 5′ nuclease of DNA polymerase I (Pol I) of Escherichia coli is a member of an important class of prokaryotic and eukaryotic nucleases, involved in DNA replication and repair, with specificity for the junction between single-stranded and duplex DNA. We have investigated the interaction of the 5′ nuclease domain with DNA substrates from the standpoint of both the protein and the DNA. Phosphate ethylation interference showed that the nuclease binds to the nucleotides immediately surrounding the cleavage site and also contacts the complementary strand one-half turn away, indicating that contacts are made to one face only of the duplex portion of the DNA substrate. Phosphodiester contacts were investigated further using DNA substrates carrying unique methylphosphonate substitutions, together with mutations in the 5′ nuclease. These experiments suggested that two highly conserved basic residues, Lys78 and Arg81, are close to the phosphodiester immediately 5′ to the cleavage site, while a third highly conserved residue, Arg20, may interact with the phosphodiester 3′ to the cleavage site. Our results provide strong support for a DNA binding model proposed for the related exonuclease from bacteriophage T5, in which the conserved basic residues mentioned above define the two ends of a helical arch that forms part of the single-stranded DNA-binding region. The nine highly conserved carboxylates in the active site region appear to play a relatively minor role in substrate binding, although they are crucial for catalysis. In addition to binding the DNA backbone around the cleavage point, the 5′ nuclease also has a binding site for one or two frayed bases at the 3′ end of an upstream primer strand. In agreement with work in related systems, 5′ nuclease cleavage is blocked by duplex DNA in the 5′ tail, but the enzyme is quite tolerant of abasic DNA or polarity reversal within the 5′ tail.

DNA polymerase I flap endonuclease I DNA polymerase I (Pol I)1 of Escherichia coli has an intrinsic 5′ nuclease activity that is important for the removal of RNA primers from Okazaki fragments during lagging strand replication and for the removal of damaged nucleotides in DNA excision repair (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1992Google Scholar). Homologous 5′ nuclease domains are found in most other bacterial Pol I enzymes and in some bacteriophages, where the polymerase and 5′ nuclease exist as separate polypeptides (2Gutman P.D. Minton K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4406-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The bacterial 5′ nuclease family also shows substantial sequence similarity to the FEN-1 eukaryotic nucleases, which are involved in various DNA transactions (4Robins P. Pappin D.J.C. Wood R.D.

Although the 5′ nucleases were originally called 5′-3′ exonucleases, these enzymes are more accurately described as structure-specific nucleases, with specificity for the junction between a base paired region and a single-stranded 5′ overhang or “flap” (9Lundquist R. Olivera B. Cell. 1982; 31: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Dahlberg J.E.

Cleavage by these nucleases usually takes place between the first two paired bases at the junction between the duplex and the single-stranded 5′ tail (see Fig. 1), although some variability has been observed (10Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1993; 260: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 11Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Recent work suggests that the preferred substrate of the bacterial nucleases has a single unpaired base at the 3′ end of the primer upstream of the 5′ nuclease cleavage site (thus facilitating formation of a ligatable nick), and it seems likely that any variability in the observed cleavage position may reflect rearrangement via branch migration of the 5′ and 3′ single-stranded flaps (14Lyamichev V.

Alignment of the sequences of the bacterial and bacteriophage 5′ nucleases revealed nine invariant carboxylates (2Gutman P.D. Minton K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4406-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the majority of which are also conserved in the FEN-1 family (6Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C.

Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The large number of conserved carboxylates raises the possibility that the 5′ nuclease reaction, like the polymerase and 3′-5′ exonuclease reactions, may be catalyzed by divalent metal ions coordinated to the enzyme via carboxylate ligands (17Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutagenesis studies in several systems have demonstrated the importance of the carboxylates in the 5′ nuclease reaction (3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Mizrahi V. Huberts P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4845-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Bhagwat M.

Crystal structures have been determined for three of the prokaryotic 5′ nucleases, the intrinsic 5′ nuclease of Thermus aquaticus(Taq) DNA polymerase I (22Kim Y. Eom S.H. Wang J. Lee D.S. Suh S.W. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), bacteriophage T4 RNase H (6Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and bacteriophage T5 exonuclease (23Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Sück D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and for two archaebacterial FEN-1 analogs (24Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The core structures of all five enzymes are very similar with the invariant carboxylates clustered in the central portion of the molecule, some coordinated to divalent metal ions, although the precise locations of the metal ions and the ligand geometries are somewhat variable (3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Sayers J.R. Artymiuk P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the absence of any crystalline complexes with bound DNA, little information exists on how the 5′ nucleases interact with their substrate. A plausible candidate for a DNA-binding region in the prokaryotic 5′ nucleases is a cluster of highly conserved and mostly basic residues. The relevant region of the protein structure is not well resolved in the Taq DNA polymerase and T4 RNase H structures, but in T5 exonuclease it is located on one side of an unusual helical arch structure (23Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Sück D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The two FEN-1 structures have a flexible loop in place of the helical arch (24Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In all three structures the loop or arch is large enough to accommodate single-stranded DNA, suggesting that the single-stranded 5′ end of the DNA substrate may be threaded through this part of the protein (Refs.23Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Sück D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 24Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, and 26Sayers J.R. Artymiuk P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, see Fig. 2 B), with the duplex DNA portion held close to the base of the loop or arch by a helix-loop-helix motif present in all five of the available structures (25Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The threading model was originally proposed based on observations that 5′ nuclease cleavage requires a free 5′ end and is blocked by significant obstructions (e.g. annealed primers) in the single-stranded tail (3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Dahlberg J.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30377-30383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, recent work has shown that FEN-1 can tolerate a variety of modifications, including an 11-nucleotide branch, within the 5′ flap DNA, prompting re-examination of the threading model (28Bornarth C.J. Ranalli T.A. Henricksen L.A. Wahl A.F. Bambara R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13347-13354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this work, we have investigated the interaction between the 5′ nuclease and its DNA substrate from the perspective of both the protein and the DNA, and have attempted to identify contacts between particular protein side chains and individual phosphodiester groups on the DNA. Oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis and for 5′ nuclease substrates were synthesized by the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale Medical School. Those used as reaction substrates were purified by gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using calculated extinction coefficients (29Puglisi J.D. Tinoco I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides containing abasic spacers or regions with reversed polarity were kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Kaplan, and have been described elsewhere (30Kaplan D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. N-Ethyl-N-nitrosourea was purchased from Sigma. DNase I was from Cooper Biomedical. T4 polynucleotide kinase, DNA ligase, and restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs or Roche Molecular Biochemicals and were used according to the accompanying instructions. Following our published methods (3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), mutations in the 5′ nuclease were constructed and subcloned into an expression plasmid for the 323-amino acid 5′ nuclease domain, and the mutant proteins were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To remove low levels of contamination by intact Pol I, the purification method was modified in either of two ways. When preparing 5′ nuclease mutants on a small scale, the peak fractions from the MonoQ HR 16/20 column were assayed for polymerase activity (31Setlow P. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 29: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and only those fractions that had no measurable polymerase activity were combined and applied to the phenyl-Superose column. For large scale purification, a final gel filtration step was included. The 5′ nuclease pool from the phenyl-Superose column was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (120-ml bed volume) and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl. These modifications were necessary for the present study because low-level contamination by full-length Pol I interfered with DNase I footprinting experiments, particularly with weak binding 5′ nuclease mutants. Because the DNA binding affinity of the polymerase domain is much greater than that of the 5′ nuclease, competition between the two was a problem even though the amount of Pol I was not sufficient to affect enzyme activity assays and was not detectable on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. We believe that the contaminating Pol I in our preparations was derived from the chromosomal polA locus rather than from readthrough of the amber codon in our expression plasmid for the 5′ nuclease domain (3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) because the problem was not alleviated by subcloning the 5′ nuclease mutations into an analogous expression construct that lacked the complete polymerase coding region. Single-turnover measurements of 5′ nuclease cleavage were carried out using the substrates shown in Fig.1 a. The DNA oligonucleotides were labeled with32P at either the 5′ or the 3′ end (see legend to Fig. 1). Reactions contained ≈5 nm DNA substrate and the 5′ nuclease at a series of 7–8 concentrations (typically from 0.1 to 40 µm), chosen so as to bracket the K Dvalue. All reactions were carried out at ambient temperature (23 °C) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 µm p(dT)10. The reactions catalyzed by the mutant 5′ nuclease derivatives (requiring sampling at time intervals of ≥10 s) were conducted as described previously (3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by the wild-type 5′ nuclease was too fast for manual sampling, and was instead carried out on a rapid quench-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Model RQF-3) by mixing a solution containing the DNA substrate with an equal volume of enzyme solution (both at twice the desired final concentration in the buffer described above) and quenching with 150 mm EDTA. Samples, obtained either manually or from rapid-quench experiments, were fractionated over a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel, and quantitated as described previously (3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For each set of reaction conditions, the enzyme concentration was much higher than that of the substrate, so that the reaction followed pseudo first-order kinetics. The observed rate constants (k obs) were then plotted as a function of enzyme concentration (E 0), and the DNA binding constant, K D, and cleavage rate constant,k c, were obtained by fitting to the equation:k obs =k c E 0/(K D +E 0). All determinations were carried out at least in duplicate. Details of the reaction conditions for 5′ nuclease cleavage of modified substrates are given in the relevant figure legends. Footprinting of the 112-mer double-hairpin oligonucleotide (Fig. 1 b), as a function of 5′ nuclease concentration, was carried out as described previously (15Xu Y. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20949-20955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Polesky A.H. Steitz T.A. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14579-14591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After gel fractionation, appropriate fragments were quantitated by phosphorimaging. For each enzyme concentration, the percent of uncomplexed DNA was calculated by determining the ratio of the radioactivity in a DNA band within the protected region to that in a band outside the protected region, and comparing with the same ratio from a control lane with no enzyme present. The binding constant,K D, equals the enzyme concentration at which 50% of the DNA is bound, which was determined by curve fitting. For this analysis to be valid, the DNA concentration in the reaction must be substantially below K D, so that the total enzyme concentration approximates the concentration of free enzyme. This condition was fulfilled because of the relatively highK D values for the 5′ nuclease and its mutant derivatives. CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a solution of wild-type or mutant 5′ nuclease (≈4–10 µmin 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 15 mmNaCl, 15% (v/v) glycerol) in a 2-mm path length quartz cuvette (110-QS, Hellma) which was placed in a thermostated sample holder in an Aviv 62 DS CD spectrometer (Lakewood, NJ). Thermal denaturation measurements were performed in the same buffer by monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature, over the range 10–70 °C in 1 °C increments (samples were equilibrated for 2 min at each temperature). The data were processed as described (33Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1945-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), to give T m, the temperature at which the protein is 50% unfolded. The procedure was modified from published procedures (34Rimphanitchayakit V. Grindley N.D.F. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. A Laboratory Guide to in Vitro Studies of Protein-DNA Interactions. Birkhauser Verlag Basel, Basel1991: 111-120Crossref Google Scholar, 35Wissman A. Hillen W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The 5′ end-labeled 132-mer double-hairpin substrate (Fig. 1 b) was used to analyze phosphate contacts close to the cleavage site. To ≈2 pmol of the DNA substrate in 0.1 ml of 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 8, was added 0.1 ml of ethanol saturated with ethylnitrosourea at 50 °C. After incubation at 50 °C for about 25 min, the ethylnitrosourea was removed by five extractions with 1-ml portions of water-saturated ether. The ethylated DNA solution (≈0.1 ml) was adjusted to 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and incubated at room temperature with wild-type 5′ nuclease (≈200 pmol). One-third of the reaction mixture was quenched with an equal volume of formamide- dyes containing 30 mm EDTA, at time intervals chosen so as to obtain three samples having ≈25, 50, and 75% product formation, respectively. The 36-mer product was separated from unreacted 132-mer substrate in each sample by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 40% (v/v) formamide and 7 murea. The DNA bands were located by autoradiography, excised, eluted into 240 µl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, containing 0.5 m NH4OAc, and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The resulting DNA samples were cleaved at the ethylated phosphate positions by heating for 30 min at 90 °C in 10 µl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, containing 75 mm NaOH. A portion (up to 4 µl) of each sample was mixed with 2 µl of formamide- dyes, and fractionated on a 12% polyacrylamide-urea gel. Size markers were generated by restriction enzyme digestion (see Fig. 1 b), and by limited chemical cleavage at guanine residues (36Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5477) Google Scholar). Data analysis is described in the legend to Fig. 3. To analyze phosphate contacts on the DNA strand opposite the cleavage site, the same procedure was carried out using the 112-mer, and analyzing samples from the pool of unreacted substrate on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 40% (v/v) formamide and 7 m urea. To determine which amino acid side chains of the 5′ nuclease are involved in binding the DNA substrate, we studied mutations in two groups of highly conserved residues (Table I). One was the nine carboxylates, shown to be crucial for 5′ nuclease cleavage in our previous study (3Xu Y. Derbyshire V. Ng K. Sun X.C. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 284-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also made alanine substitutions at Arg20, Arg70, Tyr77, Lys78, and Arg81 (Fig. 2 A); in the structure of the T5 5′ nuclease the equivalent residues define the base of the helical arch that is proposed to form part of the DNA-binding site (23Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Sück D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). The effects of all these mutations were studied in context of the separate 5′ nuclease domain (residues 1–323 of Pol I) so as to avoid ambiguities due to the DNA binding properties of the other domains of Pol I.Table IConservation of 5′ nuclease residues mutated in this workResidue inE. coli Pol IConservation1-aThe alignment from which this analysis was derived is available on the web at pantheon.yale.edu/∼cjoyce/align.html.47 Bacterial pols11 Bacterial nucleases1-bCoding regions identified as members of the 5′ nuclease family on the basis of sequence similarity.

Open table in a new tab Cleavage of our standard (22 + 68)-mer substrate (Fig. 1) by the wild-type and mutant 5′ nuclease derivatives was measured under single-turnover conditions (excess enzyme) as a function of enzyme concentration, giving the enzyme-DNA dissociation constant (K D) and the maximum cleavage rate (k c), which reflects the rate of steps up to and including phosphoryl transfer (Table II). All of the mutations tested caused substantial decreases in cleavage rate, ranging from ≈20-fold (R20A and R81A) to >5 × 105-fold (D115A). R20A and K78A were the only mutations that caused a significant decrease in DNA binding affinity; some of the carboxylate mutations, particularly D63A, D138A, and D185A, caused an increase in DNA binding affinity. For a few 5′ nuclease mutants, the DNA binding affinity was measured by a DNase I footprint titration; this showed good agreement with the kinetic determinations and had the added advantage that the measured binding constant is related to a binding site which can be visualized on a gel (Ref. 15Xu Y.

Footprinting was clearly the preferred method for the D115A mutant protein, which had no measurable activity in the 5′ nuclease assay; conversely, footprinting was not appropriate for mutants with relatively high nuclease activity which degraded the DNA substrate during the experiment.Table IIProperties of wild-type and mutant derivatives of the 5′ nuclease domainEnzymeKinetics2-aKinetic measurements were made using the (22 + 68)-mer substrate (Fig. 1 a).Footprinting2-bDNase I protection was carried out using the 112-mer substrate (Fig. 1 b).

To evaluate whether this response involves insertion of ion channels, plasma membrane turnover was measured in a model liver cell line using the fluorescent membrane marker FM1–43. Under basal conditions, the rate of constitutive membrane turnover was ∼2%min−1, and balanced exocytosis and endocytosis maintained the total cell membrane area constant. Exposure to insulin stimulated a transient increase in membrane turnover of up to 10-fold above constitutive rates. The response was concentration-dependent (0.001–10 µm). Insulin also caused a parallel increase in membrane conductance as measured by whole-cell patch clamp recording due to opening of Cl−- and K+-selective ion channels. The insulin-stimulated membrane turnover did not appear to involve the constitutive recycling compartments, suggesting that a distinct pool of vesicles may be involved. The effects of insulin on membrane turnover and membrane conductance were inhibited by blockers of phosphoinositide 3-kinase LY294002 and wortmannin or by disrupting microtubule assembly with nocodazole. Taken together, these findings indicate that insulin stimulates recruitment of new membranes through phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent mechanisms. Thus, regulated insertion of a separate population of ion channel-containing vesicles may represent one mechanism for mediating the changes in membrane conductance that are essential for the cellular response to insulin.

Changes in the concentration of solutes in the extracellular space are followed by increased uptake of glucose, amino acids, and bile acids as well as an increase in the activity of specific enzymes that regulate glucose metabolism and bile formation. While many of the individual transport proteins involved have been molecularly defined, little is known regarding the cellular strategies for regulating the number, type, and activity of transporters in the plasma membrane under defined physiological conditions.In other cells, insertion or retrieval of transport proteins through vesicular exocytosis or endocytosis regulates the protein composition of the plasma membrane (1al-Awqati Q. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In adipocytes, for example, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated by insertion of glucose transporter GLUT4-containing vesicles, leading to an increase in total transport capacity (2Pessin J.E.

In liver, insulin receptor binding leads to an increase in ion channel activity, and the resulting increases in membrane conductance appear to be an early and essential step necessary for subsequent changes in transport and metabolic activity.

However, the mechanisms that couple receptor binding to the increase in membrane conductance have not been defined.In general, liver cells are thought to function as constitutive secretory cells where export of secretory proteins occurs at a constant rate. Under defined physiological conditions, the insertion of specific membrane transporters into the plasma membrane of hepatocytes has been proposed to be a mechanism that contributes to bile formation (11Boyer J.L.

Because insulin stimulates bile formation (15Thomsen O.O. Larsen J.A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1982; 17: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Thomsen O.O. Larsen J.A. Orskov H. Scand.

Our findings support the presence of active constitutive membrane trafficking that is regulated in part by PI 3-kinase. In addition, insulin receptor binding transiently stimulates membrane turnover that contributes to the insertion of Cl−- and K+-selective ion channels into the plasma membrane.DISCUSSIONThe principal findings of this study in a model liver cell line are that (a) there is a constitutive membrane turnover that includes both exocytosis and endocytosis, (b) insulin receptor binding transiently stimulates membrane turnover through a PI 3-kinase- and microtubule-dependent mechanisms, and (c) inhibition of insulin-evoked membrane turnover blocks insulin-stimulated increases in membrane ion conductance. These findings suggest that a population of insulin-responsive vesicles contains ion channels and that regulated insertion of these channel-containing vesicles may represent one mechanism mediating the changes in membrane conductance essential for the cellular response to insulin.We utilized FM1–43 fluorescence as a probe to evaluate the kinetics of membrane turnover in individual HTC cells. Under basal conditions, FM1–43 fluorescence continuously increased at a rate of 2%min−1. This constitutive membrane turnover was associated with an equivalent accumulation of fluorescence into intracellular compartments, indicating that exocytic recruitment of new membranes is balanced by an equivalent rate of endocytic retrieval, which maintains the plasma membrane area constant. The rates of turnover correspond to endocytosis of ∼1.2 times the plasma membrane every hour, a value similar to that defined using fluid phase endocytosis in hepatocytes (38Scharschmidt B.F. Lake J.R. Renner E.L. Licko V. Van Dyke R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and other cells (39Steinman R.M. Brodie S.E. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 665-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 40Steinman R.M. Mellman I.S. Muller W.A. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar).Exposure to insulin transiently increased the rate of membrane turnover to values up to 10-fold above constitutive rates. This represents the first direct evidence for such an effect in a liver cell model. Several observations indicate that the insulin response involves recruitment of a separate population of exocytic vesicles and not a simple transient increase in the rate of constitutive membrane recycling. First, the rate of turnover from constitutive endocytic recycling compartments to the plasma membrane is not increased by insulin (Fig. 4). Second, there appear to be differences in the regulation of these vesicle populations. While the insulin response is completely inhibited by wortmannin, LY294002, or nocodazole, constitutive recycling is only partially inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002 and is not sensitive to nocodazole. Similarly, microtubules are necessary in liver for regulated exocytic insertion of canalicular multispecific organic anion transporters (13Roelofsen H. Soroka C.J. Keppler D. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for insertion of Cl−/HCO3− exchange proteins (12Bruck R. Benedetti A. Strazzabosco M. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G347-G353PubMed Google Scholar), and for transport of polymeric IgA receptor to the plasma membrane (41Saucan L. Palade G.E. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The most direct interpretation of these observations is that insulin receptor binding mobilizes a separate population of vesicles that undergo fusion with the plasma membrane, resulting in a transient increase in FM1–43 fluorescence. This formulation is reminiscent of findings in adipocytes, where insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated by the insertion of GLUT4-containing vesicles, leading to an increase in total glucose transport capacity (2Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To identify candidate proteins that might be found in these insulin-responsive vesicles, the effects of inhibitors of membrane turnover on membrane ion conductance were assessed. Emphasis was placed on the conductance response because it takes place over a time course of minutes, similar to the changes in membrane turnover, and constitutive membrane recycling is not associated with any change in membrane conductance over time (data not shown). Furthermore, the increase in conductance is essential for the liver cell response to insulin. The observation that inhibition of insulin-stimulated membrane turnover by two biochemically distinct mechanisms decreases the conductive response supports the hypothesis that ion channels are contained in the insulin-responsive vesicles.Previous studies of HTC cells and primary hepatocytes indicate that the primary (but not the only) conductance response to insulin involves an increase in the activity of nonselective cation channels, which mediate influx of Na+ and Ca2+ ions under physiological conditions (7Mathe L. Vallerand D. Haddad P.S. Can. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 14: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 8Benzeroual K. van de Werve G. Meloche S. Mathe L. Romanelli A. Haddad P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1425-G1432PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified at least two channel types that may be contained in insulin-responsive vesicles. A major contribution comes from the outwardly rectifying channels permeable to Cl− ions. Also, it appears that there is a small contribution from K+ channels. Although the reversal potential of insulin-evoked whole-cell currents did not decrease when NMDG+ replaced monovalent cations in the external solution, the presence of nonselective cation channels in insulin-responsive vesicles cannot be ruled out, since the amplitude of whole-cell currents measured in this work is about 10 times larger than macroscopic currents produced only by nonselective cation channels (7Mathe L. Vallerand D. Haddad P.S. Can. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 14: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Therefore, nonselective cation currents may have been masked by large Cl−- and K+-selective currents. At present, the molecular identification of none of these insulin-responsive channels is established. This represents an important goal necessary for localization of specific channel proteins in insulin-responsive vesicles.In intact livers, insulin stimulates bile formation by mechanisms that are poorly understood (15Thomsen O.O. Larsen J.A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1982; 17: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The formation of bile in isolated perfused livers is stimulated by changes in cell volume through mechanisms that involve microtubule-dependent exocytosis as well as activation of Cl− and K+ ion channels (42Haddad P. Beck J.S. Boyer J.L. Graf J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G340-G348PubMed Google Scholar,43Bruck R. Haddad P. Graf J. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G806-G812PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the increase in membrane permeability to Cl− and K+ ions through insulin-evoked insertion of Cl− and K+ ion channels into the plasma membrane may represent a mechanism by which insulin stimulates bile formation in liver.Assuming that these findings are relevant to liver cells in vivo, several limitations or uncertainties of these results merit emphasis. First, the transient change in membrane turnover induced by insulin appears to be completely dependent on the activity of PI 3-kinase. Consequently, rapid membrane recruitment would require very strong activity of PI 3-kinase during the first 2 min of insulin action. However, the time course of PI 3-kinase activity found in hepatocytes (17Benzeroual K. Pandey S.K. Srivastava A.K. van de Werve G. Haddad P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Chinese hamster ovary cells (44Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and adipocytes (45Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) follows a different profile, with more gradual accumulation of lipid mediators over time. This discrepancy may be related to localization of PI 3-kinase to specific cytosolic domains or to involvement of additional signaling mechanisms. Second, since the molecular identity of the insulin-responsive ion channels is not known, a direct effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors or nocodazole on these channels that are already present in the plasma membrane cannot be completely excluded. This seems unlikely, since these inhibitors have no direct effect on ion channel activity in excised patches (46Harvey J. McKay N.G. Walker K.S. Van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Ashford M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4660-4669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 47Terzic A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 395-404Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar).There are emerging paradigms for receptor-induced trafficking of ion channels in other cell types, including insertion of cation-permeable channels into the plasma membrane of B lymphocytes by insulin-like growth factor-I (48Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and insertion of potassium channels into the plasma membrane of myocytes from diabetic animals by insulin (49Shimoni Y. Ewart H.S. Severson D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 735-745Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, since the maximal effect of insulin on membrane turnover was observed at lower concentrations than the maximal effects on membrane conductance, it seems likely that ion channels are not the only protein components of insulin-responsive vesicles. It should be emphasized that insulin in intact liver has multiple effects, including stimulation of bile formation (15Thomsen O.O. Larsen J.A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1982; 17: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and other membrane transport processes (10Graf J. Haussinger D. J Hepatol. 1996; 24 Suppl. 1: 53-77PubMed Google Scholar).From a physiological perspective, regulated insertion of channel-containing vesicles may represent one mechanism for mediating the changes in membrane conductance essential for the cellular response to insulin. Consequently, identification of the signaling pathways and transport proteins involved is likely to provide novel strategies for modulating the metabolic and transport effects of insulin on liver cells. Moreover, it is attractive to speculate that other vesicular populations may differ in protein composition, providing a mechanism for selective regulation of ion transport to meet rapidly changing physiological demands. Liver cells exhibit rapid regulation of solute transport across the plasma membrane in response to changing physiological demands. Changes in the concentration of solutes in the extracellular space are followed by increased uptake of glucose, amino acids, and bile acids as well as an increase in the activity of specific enzymes that regulate glucose metabolism and bile formation. While many of the individual transport proteins involved have been molecularly defined, little is known regarding the cellular strategies for regulating the number, type, and activity of transporters in the plasma membrane under defined physiological conditions.

Our findings support the presence of active constitutive membrane trafficking that is regulated in part by PI 3-kinase. In addition, insulin receptor binding transiently stimulates membrane turnover that contributes to the insertion of Cl−- and K+-selective ion channels into the plasma membrane. DISCUSSIONThe principal findings of this study in a model liver cell line are that (a) there is a constitutive membrane turnover that includes both exocytosis and endocytosis, (b) insulin receptor binding transiently stimulates membrane turnover through a PI 3-kinase- and microtubule-dependent mechanisms, and (c) inhibition of insulin-evoked membrane turnover blocks insulin-stimulated increases in membrane ion conductance. These findings suggest that a population of insulin-responsive vesicles contains ion channels and that regulated insertion of these channel-containing vesicles may represent one mechanism mediating the changes in membrane conductance essential for the cellular response to insulin.We utilized FM1–43 fluorescence as a probe to evaluate the kinetics of membrane turnover in individual HTC cells. Under basal conditions, FM1–43 fluorescence continuously increased at a rate of 2%min−1. This constitutive membrane turnover was associated with an equivalent accumulation of fluorescence into intracellular compartments, indicating that exocytic recruitment of new membranes is balanced by an equivalent rate of endocytic retrieval, which maintains the plasma membrane area constant. The rates of turnover correspond to endocytosis of ∼1.2 times the plasma membrane every hour, a value similar to that defined using fluid phase endocytosis in hepatocytes (38Scharschmidt B.F. Lake J.R. Renner E.L. Licko V. Van Dyke R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9488-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and other cells (39Steinman R.M. Brodie S.E. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 68: 665-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 40Steinman R.M. Mellman I.S. Muller W.A. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar).Exposure to insulin transiently increased the rate of membrane turnover to values up to 10-fold above constitutive rates. This represents the first direct evidence for such an effect in a liver cell model. Several observations indicate that the insulin response involves recruitment of a separate population of exocytic vesicles and not a simple transient increase in the rate of constitutive membrane recycling. First, the rate of turnover from constitutive endocytic recycling compartments to the plasma membrane is not increased by insulin (Fig. 4). Second, there appear to be differences in the regulation of these vesicle populations. While the insulin response is completely inhibited by wortmannin, LY294002, or nocodazole, constitutive recycling is only partially inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002 and is not sensitive to nocodazole. Similarly, microtubules are necessary in liver for regulated exocytic insertion of canalicular multispecific organic anion transporters (13Roelofsen H. Soroka C.J. Keppler D. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1137-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for insertion of Cl−/HCO3− exchange proteins (12Bruck R. Benedetti A. Strazzabosco M. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G347-G353PubMed Google Scholar), and for transport of polymeric IgA receptor to the plasma membrane (41Saucan L. Palade G.E. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The most direct interpretation of these observations is that insulin receptor binding mobilizes a separate population of vesicles that undergo fusion with the plasma membrane, resulting in a transient increase in FM1–43 fluorescence. This formulation is reminiscent of findings in adipocytes, where insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated by the insertion of GLUT4-containing vesicles, leading to an increase in total glucose transport capacity (2Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To identify candidate proteins that might be found in these insulin-responsive vesicles, the effects of inhibitors of membrane turnover on membrane ion conductance were assessed. Emphasis was placed on the conductance response because it takes place over a time course of minutes, similar to the changes in membrane turnover, and constitutive membrane recycling is not associated with any change in membrane conductance over time (data not shown). Furthermore, the increase in conductance is essential for the liver cell response to insulin. The observation that inhibition of insulin-stimulated membrane turnover by two biochemically distinct mechanisms decreases the conductive response supports the hypothesis that ion channels are contained in the insulin-responsive vesicles.Previous studies of HTC cells and primary hepatocytes indicate that the primary (but not the only) conductance response to insulin involves an increase in the activity of nonselective cation channels, which mediate influx of Na+ and Ca2+ ions under physiological conditions (7Mathe L. Vallerand D. Haddad P.S. Can. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 14: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 8Benzeroual K. van de Werve G. Meloche S. Mathe L. Romanelli A. Haddad P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1425-G1432PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified at least two channel types that may be contained in insulin-responsive vesicles. A major contribution comes from the outwardly rectifying channels permeable to Cl− ions. Also, it appears that there is a small contribution from K+ channels. Although the reversal potential of insulin-evoked whole-cell currents did not decrease when NMDG+ replaced monovalent cations in the external solution, the presence of nonselective cation channels in insulin-responsive vesicles cannot be ruled out, since the amplitude of whole-cell currents measured in this work is about 10 times larger than macroscopic currents produced only by nonselective cation channels (7Mathe L. Vallerand D. Haddad P.S. Can. J. Gastroenterol. 2000; 14: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Therefore, nonselective cation currents may have been masked by large Cl−- and K+-selective currents. At present, the molecular identification of none of these insulin-responsive channels is established. This represents an important goal necessary for localization of specific channel proteins in insulin-responsive vesicles.In intact livers, insulin stimulates bile formation by mechanisms that are poorly understood (15Thomsen O.O. Larsen J.A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1982; 17: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The formation of bile in isolated perfused livers is stimulated by changes in cell volume through mechanisms that involve microtubule-dependent exocytosis as well as activation of Cl− and K+ ion channels (42Haddad P. Beck J.S. Boyer J.L. Graf J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G340-G348PubMed Google Scholar,43Bruck R. Haddad P. Graf J. Boyer J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G806-G812PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the increase in membrane permeability to Cl− and K+ ions through insulin-evoked insertion of Cl− and K+ ion channels into the plasma membrane may represent a mechanism by which insulin stimulates bile formation in liver.Assuming that these findings are relevant to liver cells in vivo, several limitations or uncertainties of these results merit emphasis. First, the transient change in membrane turnover induced by insulin appears to be completely dependent on the activity of PI 3-kinase. Consequently, rapid membrane recruitment would require very strong activity of PI 3-kinase during the first 2 min of insulin action. However, the time course of PI 3-kinase activity found in hepatocytes (17Benzeroual K. Pandey S.K. Srivastava A.K. van de Werve G. Haddad P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), Chinese hamster ovary cells (44Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and adipocytes (45Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) follows a different profile, with more gradual accumulation of lipid mediators over time. This discrepancy may be related to localization of PI 3-kinase to specific cytosolic domains or to involvement of additional signaling mechanisms. Second, since the molecular identity of the insulin-responsive ion channels is not known, a direct effect of PI 3-kinase inhibitors or nocodazole on these channels that are already present in the plasma membrane cannot be completely excluded. This seems unlikely, since these inhibitors have no direct effect on ion channel activity in excised patches (46Harvey J. McKay N.G. Walker K.S. Van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Ashford M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4660-4669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 47Terzic A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 492: 395-404Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar).There are emerging paradigms for receptor-induced trafficking of ion channels in other cell types, including insertion of cation-permeable channels into the plasma membrane of B lymphocytes by insulin-like growth factor-I (48Kanzaki M. Zhang Y.Q. Mashima H. Li L. Shibata H. Kojima I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) and insertion of potassium channels into the plasma membrane of myocytes from diabetic animals by insulin (49Shimoni Y. Ewart H.S. Severson D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 735-745Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, since the maximal effect of insulin on membrane turnover was observed at lower concentrations than the maximal effects on membrane conductance, it seems likely that ion channels are not the only protein components of insulin-responsive vesicles. It should be emphasized that insulin in intact liver has multiple effects, including stimulation of bile formation (15Thomsen O.O. Larsen J.A. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1982; 17: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and other membrane transport processes (10Graf J. Haussinger D. J Hepatol. 1996; 24 Suppl. 1: 53-77PubMed Google Scholar).From a physiological perspective, regulated insertion of channel-containing vesicles may represent one mechanism for mediating the changes in membrane conductance essential for the cellular response to insulin. Consequently, identification of the signaling pathways and transport proteins involved is likely to provide novel strategies for modulating the metabolic and transport effects of insulin on liver cells. Moreover, it is attractive to speculate that other vesicular populations may differ in protein composition, providing a mechanism for selective regulation of ion transport to meet rapidly changing physiological demands. The principal findings of this study in a model liver cell line are that (a) there is a constitutive membrane turnover that includes both exocytosis and endocytosis, (b) insulin receptor binding transiently stimulates membrane turnover through a PI 3-kinase- and microtubule-dependent mechanisms, and (c) inhibition of insulin-evoked membrane turnover blocks insulin-stimulated increases in membrane ion conductance.

We found that T cells from Jak3-deficient mice exhibit impairment of not only cytokine signaling but also early activation signals and that Jak3 is phosphorylated upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. TCR-mediated phosphorylation of Jak3 is independent of IL-2 receptor/γc but is dependent on Lck and ZAP-70. Jak3 was found to be assembled with the TCR complex, particularly through direct association with CD3ζ via its JH4 region, which is a different region from that for γc association. These results suggest that Jak3 plays a role not only in cell growth but also in T cell activation and represents cross-talk of a signaling molecule between TCR and growth signals.

The TCR complex is composed of clonotypic TCRαβ dimers recognizing the antigen-major histocompatibility complex as well as the CD3 complex responsible for signal transduction and is comprised of three dimers: γε, δε, and ζ homodimers (1Klausner R.D.

All CD3 chains contain a common signaling motif, ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), within the cytoplasmic region. The CD3γ, δ, and ε chains each contains one ITAM whereas CD3ζ possesses three. Antigen recognition by TCR induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAM of the CD3 chains, particularly the CD3ζ chain, by src family tyrosine kinases, Lck or Fyn, followed by recruitment of ZAP-70 to the phosphorylated ITAM (3Weiss A.

Subsequently, activated ZAP-70 induces downstream phosphorylation of various adaptor proteins including LAT, SLP-76, Vav, and PLCγ (4Wange R.L. Samelson L.E.

On the other hand, growth signals in T cells are mediated through cytokine receptors such as IL-2R, IL-4R, or IL-7R. These cytokine receptor complexes contain a common γ chain (γc) as a component that has been shown to be crucial for signal transduction of cell growth (5Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N.

Park S.Y. Ishida Y. Arase H. Saito T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These analyses led us to assume the possible involvement of Jak3 in TCR signaling. Indeed, the present study demonstrates that Jak3 is directly associated with the TCR complex, particularly with the CD3ζ chain, and is phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation. We found that Jak3 utilizes a region for assembling with CD3ζ that is distinct from that with γc. These data suggest that Jak3 may be involved in TCR activation signals independently of γc that is involved in growth signals, and they imply the occurrence of cross-talk by a signaling molecule between pathways for antigen-recognition signals and growth signals. 23-1-8 is a KLH-specific T cell clone and is maintained by periodic antigen stimulation as previously described (19Miyatake S.

Anti-CD3ε mAb (145-2C11) was a gift from Dr. Jeff Bluestone (Chicago Univ., Chicago, IL). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) and anti-FLAG(M2) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc., Lake Placid, NY and SIGMA, respectively, and goat anti-hamster Ig Ab (GAH) and sheep anti-mouse Ig Ab (SAM) were from Organon Teknica Corp. To analyze the association of Jak3 and CD3ζ and the phosphorylation of Jak3, 1–3 × 106 293T cells were transiently transfected with the expressible constructs of Jak3 (pME-Jak3), CD3ζ (pME-ζ) as well as with Lck and ZAP-70 using the LipofectAMINETMReagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The C-and N-terminal deletion mutants and the kinase-dead mutant Jak3 (K855A) were previously generated (23Chen M. Cheng A. Chen Y.Q. Hymel A. Hanson E.P. Kimmel L. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Changelian P.S. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6910-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ΔJH4 deletion mutant of Jak3 lacking Phe289–Ser432 was constructed. Wild type and ΔJH4 Jak3 were attached with a FLAG tag and subcloned into pME18S. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA expressive vector sequencing using Applied Biosystems PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For biochemical analysis, T cells were stimulated by cross-linking with anti-CD3ε mAb (2C11) and GAH as described previously (24Takase K. Wakizaka K. von Boehmer H. Wada I. Moriya H. Saito T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 741-747PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wakizaka K. Masuda Y. Saito T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Stimulated T cells were lysed with a lysis buffer (1% digitonin, 1% Brij 97 or 1% Nonidet P-40/0.1% SDS (radioimmune precipitation buffer), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), antipain (25 μg/ml), chymostatin (25 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and 10 mmiodoacetamide) at 4 °C for 40 min, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated Abs followed by analysis on SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was blotted with Abs and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For analysis of cell-surface labeling, cells were labeled by surface-biotinylation as previously described (24Takase K. Wakizaka K. von Boehmer H. Wada I. Moriya H. Saito T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 741-747PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wakizaka K. Masuda Y. Saito T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A construct of GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of CD3ζ (GST-ζ) has been described (26Nakano H. Yamazaki T. Miyatake S. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Saito T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6483-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 35S-labeled, in vitro translated Jak3 probe containing the JH2-JH4 region (amino acids 281–783) was constructed by subcloning of SacI fragment of Jak3 into pCITE vector and was in vitro transfected using [35S]methionine. In vitro binding assay using the 35S-labeled Jak3 probe was performed as described previously (26Nakano H. Yamazaki T. Miyatake S. Nozaki N. Kikuchi A. Saito T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6483-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Shiratori T. Miyatake S. Ohno H. Nakaseko C. Isono K. Bonifacino J.S. Saito T. Immunity. 1997; 6: 583-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST-ζ was adsorbed onto glutathione-Sepharose® 4B-beads and incubated with in vitrotranslated Jak3 protein. Subsequently, Jak3 attached to the beads was eluted by 10–50 bead volumes of 20 mm glutathione and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. 1 × 106 purified splenic T cells were loaded with Indo-1 (Indo-1 AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the presence of F127 (Molecular Probes), washed, and incubated with anti-CD4-phycoerythrin and anti-CD8-fluorescein isothiocyanate(PharMingen, San Diego, CA) in the presence or absence of anti-CD3ε-biotin plus anti-CD4-biotin (RM4-5-biotin). The binding of RM4-5 to CD4 molecules was not blocked by another anti-CD4 mAb (PL-172) (data not shown). After washing, T cells were stimulated by cross-linking with anti-CD3ε mAb (2C11) alone or with a mixture of anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 mAbs followed by co-cross-linking with streptavidin. Labeled and stimulated cells were subjected to Ca2+ analysis by FACS Vantage (Becton Dickenson, Mountain View, CA). The Ca2+ flux was monitored for 512 s, and the results were analyzed with MULTITIME software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). We reported previously that splenic T cells from Jak3-deficient mice exhibited impaired early activation signals such as Ca2+ response upon cross-linking of the TCR complex with anti-CD3ε mAb (18Saijo K. Park S.Y. Ishida Y. Arase H. Saito T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, Thomis et al. (28Thomis D.C. Lee W. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4708-4719PubMed Google Scholar) described a similar analysis with a different conclusion, namely, that Jak3−/− peripheral T cells exhibited Ca2+ flux comparable with normal T cells upon TCR stimulation. The different results appear to be explainable by the different stimuli used in the two systems. We stimulated T cells by cross-linking with anti-CD3ε mAb alone, whereas Thomis et al. utilized stimulation by cross-linking of both CD3 and CD4 with biotin-conjugated anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 mAbs together with avidin. It is known that cross-linking of CD4 induces a severalfold increase of Lck activity (29Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Samelson L.E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1989; 338: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), and further co-cross-linking of CD3 and CD4 with biotinylated Abs and avidin induced extremely strong activation signals for Lck activation and Ca2+ flux. We assumed that such strong signals might bypass the involvement of Jak3 for T cell activation. To examine this possibility, CD4+ T cells from Jak3−/− mice were stimulated by cross-linking with either CD3 alone or CD3+CD4 in the biotin-avidin system, and Ca2+ responses were compared (Fig.1). We found that Jak3−/− T cells failed to elicit Ca2+ flux upon CD3 cross-linking alone as we previously described (18Saijo K. Park S.Y. Ishida Y. Arase H. Saito T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but these cells did respond at a level fairly similar to wild-type T cells upon cross-linking of CD3+CD4 in the biotin-avidin system. These results suggest that Jak3 is involved in early TCR activation signals. Therefore, we next tested whether Jak3 is phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation in normal T cells. Because T cells from Jak3-deficient mice did not proliferate at all and the cellularity was small, we could not use them for biochemical analysis, so we used T cell clones and hybridoma cells as described below. Jak3 is assembled with IL-2 receptor through the association with γc and is known to be phosphorylated upon IL-2 stimulation. Therefore, to avoid the involvement of IL-2 signaling in testing Jak3 phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation, a normal T cell clone 23-1-8 was cultured in the absence of exogenous IL-2 for 2 days, and then T cells in the resting stage were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3ε mAb for 2–5 min. The cell lysates of stimulated T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak3 Ab and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) and anti-Jak3 Ab. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 was induced as early as 2 min (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation of Jak3 from IL-2 dependent T cell line CTLL-2 was used as a positive control for phosphorylated Jak3 (Fig. 2A,lane 6). It is unlikely that IL-2 secreted from the T cells upon TCR stimulation induced Jak3 phosphorylation during such a short period. When T cells were also stimulated in the presence of inhibitory mAbs against IL-2Rα and β chains to avoid the contribution of growth signals through IL-2R, Jak3 phosphorylation was similarly induced under such condition (data not shown). Furthermore, because T cell hybridoma cells lack the functional expression of IL-2R, we stimulated two widely used T cell hybridoma cell lines, 2B4 specific for cytochrome c (Fig. 2B) and DO11.10 specific for ovalbumin (data not shown). Jak3 phosphorylation was also observed upon TCR stimulation in both cell lines. To confirm whether TCR-induced Jak3 phosphorylation is also observed in normal T cells, purified splenic T cells were stimulated similarly with anti-CD3ε mAb and immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak3 Ab. As with T cell clones and T cell hybridoma cells, Jak3 was phosphorylated upon TCR cross-linking in normal splenic T cells within 2 min (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that Jak3 is phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation independently of IL-2R signaling. Although our results showed that IL-2 signals were not involved in TCR-induced Jak3 phosphorylation (Fig.3), we found that T cell hybridoma cells do not express IL-2Rα and β chains but do express γc on the cell surface (data not shown). Then, to avoid the possible involvement of γc in TCR-mediated Jak3 phosphorylation, T hybridoma cells were stimulated for 2 min in the presence of an anti-γc mAb that is known to inhibit γc-mediated signals. Despite the fact that all growth signals through IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7 were completely blocked under this condition (30Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 31Kondo M. Takeshita T. Higuchi M. Nakamura M. Sudo T. Nishikawa S. Sugamura K. Science. 1994; 263: 1453-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), Jak3 was similarly phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, cross-linking of γc with anti-γc mAb and anti-rat Ig Ab did not induce Jak3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, lane 4), ruling out the possibility that γc cross-linking with Abs induced Jak3 phosphorylation. One other possible mechanism of the involvement of γc in inducing Jak3 phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation is that γc might be physically assembled in the TCR complex and that Jak3 is phosphorylated through γc upon T cell activation. To investigate this possibility, T hybridoma cells were stimulated by TCR cross-linking after surface biotinylation, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3ε mAb to analyze the TCR complexes on the cell surface. Although γc was clearly detected with anti-γc Ab, even if only one-tenth of the lysate was used (Fig. 3B,lanes 5 and 6), the band corresponding to γc was not detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3ε mAb (Fig.3B, lanes 1–4), suggesting that γc was not involved in the TCR complex upon T cell activation. Collectively, these results indicate that TCR stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 independently of γc. We next addressed the question of how Jak3 is activated upon TCR stimulation. To determine the tyrosine kinase responsible for phosphorylating Jak3, we first analyzed Jak3 phosphorylation in Jurkat variant cell lines lacking either Lck (J.CaM1) (20Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or ZAP-70 (P116) (22Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The wild-type Jurkat cells induced Jak3 phosphorylation upon TCR cross-linking, but the Jurkat cell line lacking either Lck or ZAP-70 failed to induce the phosphorylation of Jak3, suggesting that Lck and ZAP-70 are involved in phosphorylation of Jak3 as upstream kinases in TCR activation (Fig.4A). Next, to elucidate how Lck and ZAP-70 contribute to the phosphorylation of Jak3, we analyzed by transfection with Jak3 and these kinases. We used a mutant Jak3 (K855A) bearing a point mutation at the ATP binding site as a substrate to avoid auto-phosphorylation. Transfection of either Lck or ZAP-70 induced Jak3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B,lanes 2 and 3), and enhanced phosphorylation was observed when Lck and ZAP-70 were transfected together with Jak3 (Fig.4B, lane 4). Collectively, these data demonstrated that Lck and ZAP-70 cooperatively phosphorylate Jak3. The phosphorylation data suggested the possibility that Jak3 might directly associate with the TCR complex. To test this possibility, cell lysates of normal T cell clones were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3 Ab and blotted with anti-Jak3 Ab. As shown in Fig.5A (top panel), both anti-CD3ε and CD3ζ mAbs, which precipitate the TCR-CD3 complex, immunoprecipitated Jak3 whereas a control hamster mAb did not indicating that Jak3 is physically and constitutively associated with the TCR complex in normal T cells. On the other hand, Jak1 and Jak2 were not detected in the immunoprecipitation of the TCR complexes (Fig.5A, middle and bottom panels, respectively). To examine which CD3 chain interacts with Jak3, we first tested the CD3ζ chain because anti-CD3ζ Ab clearly co-precipitated Jak3. The expressible cDNAs encoding CD3ζ and Jak3 were co-transfected into 293T cells and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-CD3ζ (Fig. 5B,left panel) or anti-Jak3 (Fig. 5B, right panel) Abs, followed by blotting with anti-Jak3 or CD3ζ mAbs, respectively. Jak3 was co-precipitated with CD3ζ in both experiments (Fig. 5B, lanes 1, 4), suggesting that Jak3 is directly associated with CD3ζ. The direct association between Jak3 and CD3ζ was further confirmed by in vitro binding analysis, where the binding capacity of in vitro translated35S-labeled Jak3 protein corresponding to JH2-JH4 to a GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic tail of CD3ζ (GST-ζ) was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5C, Jak3 specifically bound to GST-ζ but not to GST, whereas luciferase as a control did not bind to GST-ζ. These in vivo and in vitroresults strongly suggest that Jak3 directly associates with the TCR-CD3 complex, particularly with the CD3ζ, though the possibility of a similar association with CD3ε remains. We next attempted to determine the binding region of Jak3 to CD3ζ and, in particular, to discover whether γc and CD3ζ bind to the same region of Jak3. For this purpose, we prepared a series of C-terminal (J1-J5) and N-terminal (ΔJ7 and ΔJ7-5) deletion mutants of Jak3 (Fig.6, A and B,upper panels). cDNAs corresponding to various Jak3 mutants were co-transfected with CD3ζ into 293T cells. The association between CD3ζ and the Jak3 mutants was then assessed by immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3ζ mAbs, followed by blotting with Abs against the N or C terminus of Jak3. As shown in Fig.6A, because deletion of JH1-JH3 did not affect the association between Jak3 and CD3ζ, the JH1–3 domains were not required for the Jak3-CD3ζ interaction (Fig. 6A,lanes 1–4). However, the J4 mutant lacking JH1-JH4 as well as J5 lacking JH1-JH5 failed to bind to CD3ζ (Fig. 6A,lane 5), suggesting that the JH4 domain is a crucial region for Jak3-CD3ζ association. This conclusion was further supported by the analysis using N-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 6B). Even ΔJ7-5 lacking JH7-JH5 was still co-precipitated with CD3ζ (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–3), indicating that the JH7-JH5 domains were not necessary for the CD3ζ binding. Finally, to confirm that the JH4 region is required for the association with CD3ζ, FLAG-tagged wild-type Jak3 and JH4-deletion mutant, ΔJH4, which lacks only the JH4 region, were constructed. As shown in Fig.6C, ΔJH4 failed to associate with CD3ζ. Collectively, these data demonstrate that JH4 of Jak3 is the crucial domain of Jak3 for the association with CD3ζ. In the present study, we demonstrated that Jak3 is activated upon TCR stimulation. Although Beadling et al. (32Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5605-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) reported that cytokine but not TCR stimulation induced the activation of Jak and STATs, they analyzed Jak1, Jak2, and various STATs but not Jak3 activation. On the other hand, Welte et al. (33Welte T. Leitenberg D. Dittel B.N. al-Ramadi B.K. Xie B. Chin Y.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Bothwell A.L.M. Bottomly K. Fu X.Y. Science. 1999; 283: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) recently reported that STAT5 is activated upon TCR stimulation and assembles with the TCR complex. We have not observed significant induction of STAT5 phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation even by using Abs specific for phosphotyrosine of STAT5 in our system. 2K. Tomita, K. Saijo, and T. Saito, unpublished observation. A recent paper on STAT5-deficient mice (34Moriggl R. Sexl V. Piekorz R. Topham D. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 1999; 11: 225-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) as well as the paper by Beadlinget al. (32Beadling C. Guschin D. Witthuhn B.A. Ziemiecki A. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Cantrell D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5605-5615Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) also concluded that STAT5 is not involved in TCR activation signals. Considering these data that TCR stimulation does not induce STAT activation despite the fact that a minor population of STAT5 might be activated upon TCR stimulation, the activation of Jak3 and subsequent signaling through activated Jak3 may dominate the contribution to T cell activation. The STAT5 activation observed by Welte et al. (33Welte T. Leitenberg D. Dittel B.N. al-Ramadi B.K. Xie B. Chin Y.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Bothwell A.L.M. Bottomly K. Fu X.Y. Science. 1999; 283: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) might be induced through TCR-activated Jak3, or alternatively, there may be another pathway to activate STAT5 independently of Jak3 activation. The recent report by Malaviyaet al. demonstrating that Jak3 is phosphorylated in mast cells by FcεRI cross-linking (35Malaviya R. Zhu D. Dibirdik I. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27028-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) is consistent with our results in terms of γc-independent and ITAM-containing receptor-mediated activation of Jak3. We started to analyze the involvement of Jak3 in TCR signaling from our previous analysis of Jak3-deficient mice (15Park S.Y. Saijo K. Takahashi T. Osawa M. Arase H. Hirayama N. Miyake K. Nakauchi H. Shirasawa T. Saito T. Immunity. 1995; 3: 771-782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 18Saijo K. Park S.Y. Ishida Y. Arase H. Saito T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that peripheral CD4+ T cells in Jak3−/−− mice showed impaired early activation signals such as Ca2+ mobilization upon T cell activation. In the present study, we solved the discrepancy from Thomis et al. (28Thomis D.C. Lee W. Berg L.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4708-4719PubMed Google Scholar), which described that Jak3−/− peripheral T cells exhibited Ca2+ flux comparable with normal T cells, by analyzing stimulation conditions. When Jak3−/− T cells exhibited impaired Ca2+ response by CD3 cross-linking alone, strong aggregation of CD3+CD4 in the biotin-avidin system resulted in the induction of Ca2+ flux in Jak3−/− T cells comparable with normal T cells (Fig. 1). This result suggests that such strong signals may bypass some function of Jak3 for early T cell activation. A similar requirement has been described for CD4/CD8 co-receptors (36Viola A. Salio M. Tuosto L. Linkert S. Acuto O. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in which strong activation such as super antigen skips the requirement of co-receptors but the same receptor needs a co-receptor for stimulation with a weak agonist. Such strong cross-linking may induce superactivation of Lck, which then bypasses the requirement of some signaling molecules such as Jak3 and induces strong activation of ZAP-70 and the downstream signaling pathway. Therefore, it is possible that under the physiological conditionin vivo of stimulation with antigen/major histocompatibility complex or a suboptimal activation condition Jak3 may play a role in augmenting T cell activation signals. Because Jak3 is involved in both T cell activation and growth, these results provide evidence of the cross-talk of a signaling molecule between TCR signal and growth signal in the same T cells. Recently, similar cross-talk between cytokine signal and TCR signal has been reported in which IFN signals in T cells for growth arrest utilize TCR signal machinery including ZAP-70 and CD45 (37Petricoin III, E.F. Ito S. Williams B.L. Audet S. Stancato L.F. Gamero A. Clouse K. Grimley P. Weiss A. Beeler J. Finbloom D.S. Shores E.W. Abraham R. Larner A.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas IFN signals in cells other than T cells utilize Jak-STAT pathways. In this case, the choice of TCR machineryversus Jak-STAT pathway by IFN-R appears to be determined in a cell type-specific manner. In our case, in contrast, Jak3 can be used in both TCR- and cytokine-signal pathways by assembling with distinct receptor components, CD3ζ and γc, in the same cells. It is important to determine how TCR-stimulated Jak3 and IL-2R-stimulated Jak3 discriminate the downstream signaling pathway in the same cells without mixing the two activation signals. Physiologically, the association of Jak3 with both TCR complex and IL-2R complex indicates that Jak3 plays pivotal roles in regulating T cell activation/growth at two distinct time points in the sequence of T cell activation events. Jak3 contributes to initial TCR activation signals (on day 0), then T cells start to express cytokine receptors and produce cytokines, and thereafter Jak3 mediates growth signals upon cytokine binding on the receptors (on days 2–3). Thus, the constitutive associations of Jak3 to TCR and IL-2R induce T cell activation and cell growth, respectively. A possible mechanism for the differential activation of Jak3 by TCR and IL-2 signals may be based on the physical dissection of these two signaling complexes by membrane compartmentalization. Recent findings revealed that the glycolipid-enriched membrane compartment (GEM)/raft contains most of the phosphorylated signaling molecules such as phospho-CD3ζ, ZAP-70, LAT, Lck, and PLCγ and is crucial for T cell activation (38Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 39Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P. Pierres M. He H.T.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). It is possible to assume that TCR-activated Jak3 is localized within GEM/raft and may be involved in the activation of these TCR signaling molecules, whereas IL-2-activated Jak3 may not be located within GEM/raft. The association of Jak3 with γc is mediated by the consensus sequence box1 (7Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O.

CD40 has been reported to associate with Jak3 as a non-cytokine receptor (42Hanissian S.H. Geha R.S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, because CD40 contains a box1-like motif, the association appears to follow a similar rule to γc-associated cytokine receptors. In contrast, the CD3ζ chain does not contain such a box1-like motif. However, considering that the association of STAM with Jak3 has been shown to be mediated through the ITAM region within STAM (12Takeshita T. Arita T. Higuchi M. Asao H. Endo K. Kuroda H. Tanaka N. Murata K. Ishii N. Sugamura K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in the absence of its phosphorylation, it might be possible that Jak3 associates with CD3ζ through the non-phosphorylated ITAM. In this study, we determined the JH4 region of Jak3 to be the responsible region for the association with CD3ζ. The failure of CD3ζ binding by the specific JH4-deletion mutant of Jak3 supports this conclusion, although the possibility of an indirect structural alteration by JH4 deletion is not excluded. In addition, although we focused on CD3ζ as a responsible CD3 chain of Jak3-association, the possibility of a similar association with CD3ε still remains because anti-CD3ε Ab immunoprecipitated Jak3. In contrast, it has been demonstrated that γc associates with Jak3 through the N terminus region including JH7-6 (23Chen M. Cheng A. Chen Y.Q. Hymel A. Hanson E.P. Kimmel L. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Changelian P.S. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6910-6915Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, the distinct association of Jak3 with CD3ζ and γc appears to be regulated through distinct regions of Jak3 as the binding sites (JH4 for TCR, JH7 for γc) as well as through different kinetics during T cell activation (day 0 for TCR stimulation, days 2–3 for IL-2R signaling). The precise mechanism and maps of the association between Jak3 and the TCR-CD3 complex may enable us to discriminate the in vivo contributions of Jak3 to activation and growth of T cells. We thank S.

https://openalex.org/W1974144826,"In Escherichia coli, transport of hexose 6-phosphates is mediated by the Pi-linked antiport carrier, UhpT, a member of the major facilitator superfamily. We showed earlier that Lys391, a member of an intrahelical salt bridge (Asp388/Lys391) in the eleventh transmembrane segment (TM11) of this transporter, can function as a determinant of substrate selectivity (Hall, J. A., Fann, M.-C., and Maloney, P. C. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 6148–6153). Here, we examine in detail the role of TM11 in setting substrate preference. Derivatives having an uncompensated cationic charge at either position 388 or 391 (the D388C, D388V, or D388K/K391C variants) are gain-of-function mutants in which phosphoenolpyruvate, not sugar 6-phosphate, is the preferred organic substrate. By contrast, when an uncompensated anionic charge is placed at position 388 (K391C), we observed behavior consistent with an increased preference for monovalent rather than divalent sugar 6-phosphate. Because positions 388 and 391 lie deep within the UhpT hydrophobic sector, these findings suggested that an extended length of TM11 may be accessible to external substrates and probes. To explore this issue, we used a panel of TM11 single cysteine variants to examine the transport of glucose 6-phosphate in the presence and absence of the membrane-impermeant, thiol-reactive agentp-chloromercuribenzosulfonate (PCMBS). Accessibility to PCMBS, together with the pattern of substrate protection against PCMBS inhibition, leads us to conclude that TM11 spans the membrane as an α-helix, with approximately two-thirds of its surface lining a substrate translocation pathway. We suggest that this feature is a general property of carrier proteins in the major facilitator superfamily and that for this reason residues in TM11 will serve to carry determinants of substrate selectivity.

Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 573-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This taxonomic group is comprised of single-polypeptide carriers that show great diversity in both substrate specificity and kinetic mechanism. Despite this heterogeneity, most members of the MFS share a common structural theme, one characterized by the presence of 12 transmembrane segments believed to transverse the membrane in α-helical conformation. In select cases, a high preponderance of α-helix has been confirmed by circular dichroism or electron spin resonance spectroscopies (7Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Similar tests suggest that an unrelated transporter, the Na+/H+antiporter, NhaA, also has 12 transmembrane helices, and in this case two-dimensional crystallography has confirmed the inference (10Williams K.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In no case, however, has the structure of a secondary transporter been solved to a resolution affording molecular analysis. In the absence of detailed information concerning the structure of such transport proteins, helix relationships and helix function in members of the MFS have been analyzed by less direct genetic approaches, such as second-site suppressor, site-directed, and cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. Application of these techniques has clarified structural features for several important model systems. For example, second-site suppressor and site-directed mutagenesis has been used to identify intra- and interhelical salt bridges in the H+/lactose cotransporter LacY, the Pi:sugar 6-phosphate antiporter UhpT, and the H+:metal-tetracycline exchanger TetA(B), as well as in the unrelated Na+/melibiose carrier MelB (11Lee J.-I.

In work described here, we examined UhpT, the Pi-linked hexose phosphate antiport carrier of Escherichia coli(25Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Sonna L.A. Varadhachary A. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Maloney P.C. Wilson T.H. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M.

Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6625-6630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with an emphasis on the study of TM11. We focused on this target because earlier work showed that one of its residues, Lys391, can play a direct role in determining substrate selectivity (15Hall J.A. Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that TM11 lines the substrate translocation pathway. In the present analysis, we used both cysteine-scanning and site-directed mutagenesis to broadly probe the role(s) of TM11 and to ask whether other residues in this segment might also influence substrate selectivity. Our analysis implicates positions 388 and 391 in TM11 as crucial determinants of substrate selectivity and suggests that TM11 is an α-helix, with roughly two-thirds of its surface facing a water-filled translocation pathway.

Plasmid pTrc(HisC0S6) encodes the histidine-tagged, cysteine-less UhpT (15Hall J.A. Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that served as parent for all UhpT derivatives described in this study. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the sequential polymerase chain reaction (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Morton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). To confirm the desired mutation and to rule out the presence of other changes, mutant alleles were sequenced either in the laboratory, using the Sequenase (version 2.0) reaction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or at the Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility of Johns Hopkins Medical School. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using cell extracts without preheating in sample buffer, as described (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a peptide-directed rabbit antibody reactive to a UhpT C-terminal epitope (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Western blots were developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and expression of UhpT and its derivatives was quantitated by densitometry of digitized images (32Matos M.

Expression levels for each mutant were determined in at least three independent trials; mean values were used to normalize G6P transport for calculation of specific activity. Unless otherwise indicated, overnight cultures were diluted 200-fold into LB broth plus antibiotics (10 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml ampicillin), grown at 37 °C to a density of 2–5 × 108 cells/ml, and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed twice and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm MOPS/K+, 100 mmK2SO4, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7) at OD660 = 1.4, equivalent to about 2 × 109 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature, and tests of G6P, F6P, or PEP transport were initiated by adding a one-twentieth volume of labeled substrate to a final concentration of 50 μm. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed for filtration on Millipore filters (0.45-μm pore size), followed by two washes with 5 ml of buffer A lacking MgSO4. To monitor PCMBS inhibition of G6P and PEP transport, cells were first incubated for 10 min with PCMBS (0.05–200 μm) at room temperature. Aliquots were then filtered to remove the inhibitor, and after two washes with 5 ml of buffer A, tests of transport were initiated by overlaying cells (on the filter) with buffer A containing 50 μm labeled substrate. To assess substrate protection, the same procedure was used except that cells were preincubated with either 1 mm unlabeled substrate or 1 mm unlabeled substrate plus PCMBS. For assays of UhpT-mediated Pi transport, cells were grown in M63 minimal medium (34Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar) (pH 7) containing thiamine (2 μg/ml), required amino acids (50 μg/ml), necessary antibiotics, and 0.2% (w/v) glucose as carbon source. The high Pi content of M63 ensured maximal repression of other Pi transporters (Pst and Pit) present in broth-grown cells, so that most Pitransport occurred via UhpT (15Hall J.A. Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Rosenberg H. Rosen B.P. Silver S. Ion Transport in Prokaryotes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1987: 205-248Crossref Google Scholar). (Broth- and M63-grown cells had comparable behavior with regard to the organophosphates transported by UhpT.) The maximal velocity (V max) and Michaelis constant (K m ) of Pi transport were estimated using the method of Hofstee (36Hofstee B.H.J. Nature. 1959; 184: 1296-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The inhibition constants (K i ) for 2-dG6P, F6P, or PEP as inhibitors of Pi transport were determined using linear Dixon plots (37Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar), with the assumption of competitive inhibition between Piand the test substrate. In these latter assays, the unlabeled test substrates (G6P, 2-dG6P, F6P, PEP) contained 0.5–1.0% Pi(38Maloney P.C. Ambudkar S.V. Thomas J. Schiller L. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 238-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because this was ignored in calculation of kinetic constants, the derived K i values should be considered minimal estimates. To monitor in vivo function of UhpT and its derivatives, cells from an overnight broth culture were diluted 1000-fold into M63 containing 0.15% F6P or 0.15% PEP as carbon source. Cultures were placed at 37 °C with continuous shaking, and growth was monitored by changes in optical density at 660 nm. [14C]G6P (52.8 μCi/μmol) and [32P]KPi (1 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14C]F6P (300 μCi/μmol) and [14C]PEP (29 μCi/μmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Unlabeled organophosphate substrates (G6P, 2-dG6P, F6P, PEP) were obtained from Sigma. In previous work, we had identified Asp388 and Lys391 of UhpT TM11 as participants in an intrahelical salt bridge (15Hall J.A. Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further study of this ion pair showed that if the anionic partner is replaced by cysteine, the derivative protein has a substrate selectivity biased toward compounds, such as PEP, that carry an additional anionic charge (15Hall J.A. Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because PgtP, the related PEP transporter of Salmonella typhimurium, has arginine at this position, we argued that the gain-of-function phenotype reflects the presence of an uncompensated positive charge (lysine) at position 391 and not the presence of cysteine, a proton donor, at position 388. In the present study, this supposition is confirmed by the finding of an equivalent result after replacement of Asp388 with Val, the amino acid occupying the corresponding position in PgtP. Thus, although phosphate transport by both the D388C and D388V variants shows a kinetic profile resembling the parent protein (Table I), each mutant has a 20–25-fold reduced affinity for hexose 6-phosphate, coupled with a 10-fold increase in the affinity for PEP (Table I). Tests of both growth and transport confirmed that each mutant, but not their parent, could use PEP as sole carbon source for growth (Fig.1).Table ITransport properties of UhpT mutants displaying altered substrate selectivityUhpT derivativePitransport1-aRates of Piself-exchange were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” using the method of Hofstee (36).K i 1-cInhibition constants (K i ) were determined for each substrate as an inhibitor of Pi self-exchange using linear Dixon plots (37), with the assumption of competitive inhibition between Pi and the test substrate.

Open table in a new tab Such findings confirm that an uncompensated positive charge at position 391 alters selectivity so as to favor substrates with an increased anionic character. With this in mind, we next asked whether the location of such charge is also a critical determinant of specificity. To do this, we constructed the D388C/K391C variant to remove both partners in the natural salt bridge. This variant, like its parent, is able to transport sugar 6-phosphates but not PEP (Fig. 1). We then scanned this derivative with lysine placed at positions in a registration (i, i ± 3 or 4) that would span four turns of an α-helix. In most cases (positions 384, 387, 395, and 398), the introduction of lysine into the D388C/K319C background yielded a non-functional protein (data not shown). It was evident, however, that placement of Lys at either position 388 or 391 altered UhpT substrate selectivity so as to favor PEP. Thus, the D388K/K391C variant showed a 10-fold decrease in affinity for 2-dG6P at the same time its affinity for PEP increased 40-fold (TableI). As before, this gain-of-function derivative was able to both transport and use PEP as sole carbon source for growth (Fig. 1). The finding that UhpT selectivity is biased in favor of more anionic substrates upon placement of a lone cationic residue at position 388 or 391 led us to ask if a change in selectivity would also arise on introduction of a negative charge at either of these positions. The K391D/D388C variant, in which aspartate is moved to position 391, was too poorly expressed for such study, so that only the K391C variant was examined. We considered two possible models. On the one hand, an uncompensated anionic residue at position 388 might bias selectivity to favor substrates carrying an extra cationic group. Equivalently, altered selectivity might favor substrates with one less negative charge. That the K391C variant had near parental activity, with only a 2–5-fold decrease in affinity for both G6P and F6P (Tables I andII; Figs. 1A,2C, and3B) did not favor the first model. In the same way, tests (data not shown) using either glucosamine 6-phosphate and O-phosphorylethanolamine as inhibitors of Pi transport failed to support the idea.Table IIUhpT expression and function in single-cysteine TM11 variantsDerivativeUhpT expression2-aValues are means of three independent experiments.Specific activity2-bValues are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.

If so, one might expect enhanced transport and growth under more acidic conditions where monovalent sugar phosphate is enriched. To test this possibility, we measured transport and growth at external pH values from pH 5.5 to 8.25, a range that spans the pK 1 of sugar phosphate (pK 1 = 6.1). In such work, we found that maximal transport by the mutant (tested at 50 μmsubstrate) occurred at a pH approximately 0.5 pH units more acidic than found for the parent protein (pH 6.3 and 6.9, respectively) (Fig.2C). We also found that the K391C variant, unlike its parent, showed a marked decrease in function above pH 7. Both observations are consistent with the idea that the mutant works best when monovalent sugar phosphate is the predominant species. This idea was further supported by kinetic work showing that theK m for sugar 6-phosphate transport by the mutant increased 4–5-fold at alkaline pH (125–640 μm), whereas that of the parental protein remained constant throughout the entire pH range studied (Fig. 3). In similar fashion, growth of the K391C derivative was pH-dependent. Thus, although the parent protein supports growth equally well between pH 5.5 and 7.0, the K391C mutant grows at progressively slower rates as the environment becomes more alkaline, with complete growth stasis at pH 7 (Fig. 2,A and B). This finding, coupled with the kinetic observations (Fig. 3), leads us to suggest that in this variant the capacity to handle divalent sugar phosphate is compromised. This interpretation further emphasizes the region in and around these positions as essential determinants in substrate specificity. Because the topology of UhpT shows the Lys391-Asp388 salt bridge to be deep within the hydrophobic sector (15Hall J.A. Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C.

Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seemed plausible that a water-filled pathway would extend inward from the periplasm to at least position 388. If so, we reasoned that one might identify the part of TM11 bordering this pathway by use of a suitable probe. Accordingly, we next analyzed a library of single-cysteine variants encompassing the whole of TM11 (residues 383–404), so that individual positions along TM11 could be probed by PCMBS, an impermeant, thiol-directed agent with the same molecular volume and charge as the normal substrates of UhpT (20Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5973-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An initial screen of TM11 single-cysteine variants showed that most were expressed at a level sufficient for functional analysis (usually 30%) (Table II). In the preceding work (Table I, Fig. 1; Ref.15Hall J.A. Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we found that gain-of-function variants in which Lys391 acts as a selectivity determinant retained UhpT-mediated Pi transport despite a defect in transport of G6P. By contrast, of the six TM11 single-cysteine derivatives with substantially reduced G6P transport (∼10% or less) (Table II), all but one had comparable reductions in Pi transport (data not shown); the exceptional case was the D388C variant, which retained normal levels of Pi transport, as described in the earlier study (15Hall J.A. Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6148-6153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, generation of a gain-of-function phenotype by cysteine substitution may be a rare event. In other experiments, we examined each single-cysteine variant with regard to its response to the impermeant thiol-reactive probe PCMBS. The first trials monitored the effects of a 10-min exposure to 200 μm PCMBS. As judged by inhibition of G6P transport, we concluded that eight positions were accessible to the probe (positions 391, 393, 395, 397, 398, 401, 402, and 404); study of PEP transport by the D388C derivative showed that position 388 was also accessible to PCMBS (Table III). For each of these PCMBS-responsive mutants, we then estimated the PCMBS concentration yielding 50% inhibition (K 0.5) (Table III). This effort suggested two classes of derivatives. Most mutants (seven of nine) showed a relatively high sensitivity, withK 0.5 values in the range of 0.05–3 μm, whereas two variants showed relatively low sensitivity (K 0.5 of 20–40 μm) (Table III). Finally, for each PCMBS-responsive protein, we evaluated whether protection was afforded by coincubation with substrate (1 mm G6P or PEP), using a prob"

While the role of some of these proteins has been well studied, the function of other proteins in the complex remains unclear. In this study, we showed that the carboxyl-terminal region of p45SKP2 associates directly with CksHs1 and that CksHs1 negatively regulated the interaction between p45SKP2 and CDK2. Moreover, we showed that overexpression of CksHs1 inhibits CDK2 kinase activity and that additional expression of p45SKP2overcame this inhibition and restored CDK2 kinase activity.

Therefore the regulation of Cyclin A-CDK2 kinase activity is extremely important and is accomplished by several mechanisms. CDK2 structure consists of a central deep cleft positioned between the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal lobes, which contains the catalytic residues, the substrate-binding site, and the ATP-binding site. Mechanisms of CDK2 regulation involve protein-protein interactions and phosphorylations, reviewed elsewhere (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). CDK2 kinase activation is mainly achieved by cyclin binding and phosphorylation of the conserved residue Thr-160. On the other hand, cyclin kinase inhibitors binding to the Cyclin A-CDK2 complex inhibit CDK2 kinase activity by direct blockade of the CDK2 substrate-binding site (2Morgan D.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The active form of the Cyclin A-CDK2 enzyme complexes associates with other proteins such as p45SKP2, CksHs1, and p19SKP1 (3Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of action of these proteins as regulatory molecules of CDK2 kinase activity is not fully understood. Human p45SKP2 is an F-box/leucine-rich repeat-containing protein that was originally identified by its association with Cyclin A-CDK2 (3Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), hence its designation as an S phase kinase-associated protein (SKP2). Levels of p45SKP2 protein are cell cycle regulated, increasing during G1-S phases, accumulating during S phase, and dropping toward M phase (4Lisztwan J. Marti A. Sutterluty H. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Krek W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 5Michel J.J. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar). The level of p45SKP2 is also increased in many transformed cells (3Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Moreover, p45SKP2 functional interference in cultured cells inhibits S phase entry (3Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and p45SKP2ectopic expression in quiescent fibroblasts causes mitogen-independent S phase entry (6Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). As an F-box containing protein, p45SKP2 is involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation by functioning as a substrate-specific receptor of the SCFSKP2(p19SKP1-CDC53 (CUL1)-p45SKP2) ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase complex (E3). The SCF complexes function as the main ubiquitin ligases controlling the abundance of the cell cycle regulatory proteins at the G1-S transition; they consist of p19SKP1, CUL1, and Rbx1/ROC1 as the invariable components and the F-box protein as the variable component and the substrate recognition subunit. The ubiquitin-dependent cell cycle regulatory role of p45SKP2 is growing in importance due to the number of cell cycle proteins found to interact with p45SKP2. There is evidence that the cell cycle-regulated transcription factor E2F-1 binds to SCFSKP2 and is ubiquitinated by this complex (7Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Scheffner M. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It is also described that p45SKP2 promotes p27Kip1ubiquitination and degradation (6Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 8Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). p45SKP2 is also responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of B-myb, a DNA-binding protein (10Charrasse S. Carena I. Brondani V. Klempnauer K.H. Ferrari S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2986-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Taken together, the existing evidence suggests that p45SKP2plays a prominent role in progression of cells through phases G1-S and S of the cell cycle. The requirement of p45SKP2 function may be partially explained by its F-box-dependent implication in cell cycle protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. However, recent experimental evidence suggests involvement of p45SKP2 in several CDK2 regulatory functions, not only related to its amino-terminal F-box domain, but also to its carboxyl-terminal cyclin-protein kinase-binding domain, such as Cyclin A accumulation and Cyclin A- and Cyclin E-associated kinase activation (6Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations is the hypothesis that p45SKP2 exerts other cell cycle regulatory functions involving protein-protein interactions through its carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeats. To investigate novel p45SKP2protein-protein interactions, a p45SKP2 two-hybrid screening was performed. This study defines and characterizes the novel p45SKP2-CksHs1 interaction and analyzes its effects on the CDK2 complex formation and the CDK2 kinase function. Plasmid DNAs, yeast strains, and the HeLa cell cDNA library used for the interaction-trap assay were provided by Dr. R. Brent and colleagues and used as described (11Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar, 12Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The human lymphocyte LexA cDNA library, derived from the HTLV-1-transformed T-cell line SLB-I, used for the interaction-trap assay was from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., (Palo Alto, CA). The various p45SKP2, CDK2, p19SKP1, and CksHs1 regions fused to LexA or the B42 transcription activation domain are shown in Fig. 1. The yeast strains EGY048 (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::pLexAop6-LEU2) and EGY191 (MATa trp1 ura3 his3 LEU2::pLexAop2-LEU2), used as hosts for all the interaction assays, were kindly provided by Dr. E. Golemis. Both yeast strains contain the plasmid pSH18-34, which includes the reporter lacZ gene under the control of a modifiedGal1 promoter. The different expression constructs were made using standard techniques and confirmed by DNA sequencing. pSK-p45SKP2 and pSK-p19SKP1 were a gift from Dr Beach. pCMV-CDK2 was a gift from Dr Harlow. All the CksHs1 cDNA clones were isolated from the interaction-trap HeLa and human lymphocyte cDNA libraries. The CksHs1 full coding region was generated by PCR using the above mentioned lymphocyte cDNA library. CksHs1 and p45SKP2 deletion mutants were generated by PCR. For COS-7 cell transient transfections, different regions of p45SKP2, CDK2, p19SKP1, and CksHs1 cDNAs were cloned into pMT2 derived plasmids. These included pMT2-HA, which encodes a HA epitope tag sequence immediately upstream of the cloning site (12Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), pMT2-myc, which encodes a myc epitope tag sequence immediately upstream of the cloning site (13Medley Q.G. Serra-Pages C. Iannotti E. Seipel K. Tang M. O'Brien S.P. Streuli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36116-36123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and pMT-GST, which contains the glutathione S-transferase gene coding sequence immediately upstream of the cloning site. The anti-p45SKP2 rabbit polyclonal Ab was generated by immunizing rabbits with purified, Escherichia coli-derived GST-p45SKP2 (amino acids 1–435). For precipitation studies we used the rabbit polyclonal Ab anti-p45SKP2 (H-435) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-HA mAb HA11 was from Berkeley Antibody Co. (Richmond, CA). The rabbit polyclonal Ab anti-CDK2 (sc-163) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal Ab anti-CksHs1 (FL-79) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-myc tag mAb 9E10 was described previously (14Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Transient transfection into COS-7 cells (ECACC 87021302) were performed by the DEAE-dextran/Me2SO method using 2 μg of plasmid DNA per 2 × 105 cells in a 9-cm2 dish. The cells were harvested ∼48 h after transfection (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, 1987Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis was done essentially as described previously (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, 1987Google Scholar). COS-7 cells that were transiently transfected with various constructs were harvest ∼48 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture complete from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Insoluble material was removed from the lysates by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE or precipitated using the indicated Abs and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Precipitates were washed with buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF)-Hybond-P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and probed with various mAbs and polyclonal antibodies followed by species-specific peroxidase-labeled antibodies from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and visualized by fluorography with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL), essentially as described by the supplier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells expressing exogenous CDK2 were lysed and precipitated as described above. The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and histone H1, using the CDK1/cdc2 kinase kit from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), according to the manufacture's instructions. The reactions were done in the presence of 20 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide, 2 μm PKA inhibitor peptide, and 20 μmcompound R24571. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions followed by autoradiography (6–12 h). To identify novel proteins that interact with p45SKP2, the interaction-trap system was used (11Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). DNA encoding p45SKP2 (amino acids 3–436) was cloned into the pEG202 plasmid to create the LexA-p45SKP2 bait. This plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain EGY048, which contains the LEU2 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of the LexA operon. Unfortunately, this yeast strain could not be used for an interactor hunt, since the LexA-p45SKP2 bait was a weak transcription activator. The plasmid was then transformed into the less sensitive yeast strain EGY191, which contains one operator instead of three upstream of the LEU2 gene and was co-transfected with the lacZ reporter (pSH18-34). The resulting yeast strain was then transformed with a pJG4-5 based lymphoid cDNA library that conditionally expresses fusion proteins combining the B42 activation domain and the lymphoid proteins. A total of 106 independent transformants of the lymphoid cDNA library were screened. One of the clones isolated that had the desired phenotype, namely Leu+, lacZ+ when grown using galactose, but not glucose, was identified as CksHs1. This clone encoded amino acids 19–79 of the full-length CksHs1 protein. Several other clones encoding the CksHs1 gene were also found to interact with p45SKP2when we performed an interaction-trap screening with a HeLa cDNA library. A cDNA encoding full-length CksHs1 was cloned by PCR, and interaction-trap assays were also used to quantify the interactions between p45SKP2 and CksHs1 (Fig.1A). The interaction-trap assays showed that p45SKP2 strongly interacted with full-length CksHs1 (696 β-gal units). p19SKP1, which was previously known to interact with p45SKP2, and was also obtained in the present screening, was used as a positive control (161 β-gal units). To further characterize the p45SKP2 and CksHs1 interaction, quantitative interaction-trap assays were performed using amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of p45SKP2. These deletions were cloned by PCR into the appropriate vector. One construct consisted of amino acids 3–232, which contains the F-box domain (p45SKP2 ΔC3–232), while the other consisted of amino acids 153–436, which contains the leucine-rich domain (p45SKP2ΔN153–436). As detailed in Fig. 1A, p45SKP2ΔN153–436 bound to CksHs1 (422 β-gal units), while p45SKP2 ΔC3–232 did not interact with CksHs1 (6 β-gal units) despite being able to bind to p19SKP1. Quantitative interaction-trap assays were also used to test the interaction between CDK2 and either p45SKP2 or CksHs1. As shown in Fig. 1B, CDK2 strongly interacted with CksHs1 (483 β-gal units) but not with p45SKP2 (2 β-gal units). To confirm the interaction between p45SKP2 and CksHs1 in vivo, co-precipitation assays were performed in the lymphoid cell lines Jurkat and Cem (Fig.2A). p45SKP2 was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated Jurkat and Cem cells using an anti-p45SKP2 antibody. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, subjected to Western blotting, and the membranes probed using an anti-CksHs1 antibody. In both cell lines CksHs1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with p45SKP2. Similarly, co-precipitation experiments were done in COS-7 cells that were transfected with GST expression vectors encoding either CksHs1 or CksHs1ΔN, which corresponds to the initial clone obtained in the interaction-trap screening, and myc-tagged p45SKP2(myc-p45SKP2). The precipitation of the corresponding lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads and the immunoblot with an anti-myc antibody resulted in a specific co-precipitation of p45SKP2 with CksHs1 and CksHs1ΔN (Fig.2B). Since CDK2-p45SKP2 and CDK2-CksHs1 interactions were reported previously; this newly defined interaction of CksHs1 with p45SKP2 brings into question whether the same domain of CksHs1 is responsible for the interaction with both p45SKP2and CDK2. Since the CksHs1 residues involved in the CDK2 interaction have been determined (amino acids 7–23 and 57–70) (16Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Arvai A.S. Bernstein S.L. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Struct.

Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), four CksHs1 deletion mutants were constructed accordingly (Fig.3A). The mutant CksHs1-(19–79) did not include the first 18 amino acids and therefore lacked some of the CDK2-binding sites. The three other mutants constructed encoded CksHs1-(36–79), CksHs1-(1–71), and CksHs1-(36–71). Of all the mutants tested, only CksHs1-(1–71) included all the described CDK2-binding sites. Expression vectors encoding full-length CksHs1 and the four CksHs1 mutants mentioned above were fused to GST and were co-transfected in COS-7 cells with either myc-p45 (Fig. 3B) or HA-tagged CDK2 (HA-CDK2; Fig. 3C). The lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the precipitates were immunoblotted using an anti-myc or anti-HA antibody, respectively. All the deletion mutants tested were able to bind p45SKP2, but only the full-length GST-CksHs1 and the mutant lacking the last 8 amino acids was able to bind CDK2. These results mapped the CksHs1-p45SKP2 binding region to CksHs1-(36–71) and confirmed that CksHs1 binds to p45SKP2 or CDK2 through different regions (Fig. 3). To test whether CksHs1 has any effect on the p45SKP2-CDK2 interaction, a series of p45SKP2-CDK2 co-precipitation assays were performed in the presence of varying the amounts of CksHs1. Increasing amounts of HA-CksHs1 (0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 μg) were expressed in COS-7 cells, together with fixed amounts of GST-CDK2 and HA-p45. HA-p45SKP2 co-precipitation with GST-CDK2 was detected by anti-HA immunoblotting of glutathione-Sepharose precipitates. As shown in Fig. 4A, less p45SKP2 is bound to CDK2 when higher amounts of CksHs1 are present. Similarly, a parallel co-precipitation assay was done using CksHs1-(19–79) instead of full-length CksHs1. CksHs1-(19–79), as shown in Fig. 3, binds to p45SKP2 but does not bind to CDK2. The results shown in Fig. 4B indicate that the presence of increasing amounts of CksHs1-(19–79) also resulted in less p45SKP2 bound to CDK2. The possibility that p45SKP2 binds to CDK2 indirectly through CksHs1 cannot be excluded based on either the previous data concerning p45SKP2 and CksHs1 interaction with CDK2 or our results about the interaction between p45SKP2 and CksHs1. Additionally, two-hybrid assays using CDK2 as bait did not result in its interaction with p45SKP2(Fig. 1B), suggesting that a p45SKP2-CDK2 interaction is indeed indirect. To further assess the involvement of CksHs1 in the interaction of p45SKP2 and CDK2, we tested the effect of increasing amounts of p45SKP2 on CksHs1 binding to CDK2. Increasing amounts of myc-p45SKP2 (0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 μg) were expressed in COS-7 cells together with fixed quantities of GST-CDK2 and myc-CksHs1. Glutathione-Sepharose precipitates were subjected to anti-myc immunoblotting and showed that less CksHs1 is bound to CDK2 when higher amounts of p45SKP2 are present (Fig.5A). This result argues against the hypothesis of CksHs1 acting like a bridge between p45SKP2 and CDK2. To further confirm this fact, glutathione-Sepharose precipitates containing GST-CDK2 or GST protein produced in COS-7 cells were incubated with saturating amounts of His-CksHs1 protein produced in bacteria. The resulting precipitates were then incubated with lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with HA-p45SKP2. These precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using an anti-HA antibody, which allowed the amount of p45SKP2 protein bound to CDK2 with and without the addition of His-CksHs1 protein to be determined. The results indicated that less p45SKP2 protein co-precipitated with His-CksHs1-saturated CDK2 precipitates in comparison with the p45SKP2 co-precipitated with CDK2 precipitates without the exogenous addition of His-CksHs1 (Fig. 5B). This result indicates that the exogenous His-CksHs1 blocks the interaction between CDK2 and p45SKP2, presumably by structural impediments, and that CksHs1 probably does not function as a bridge molecule between p45SKP2 and CDK2. To examine whether CksHs1 or p45SKP2 can alter the CDK2 kinase activity in vitro, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GST-CDK2 and either myc-CksHs1, HA-CksHs1-(19–79), or myc-p45SKP2. Subsequently the CDK2 kinase activity of the GST-CDK2 precipitates was measured using histone H1 as a substrate. The results showed that overexpression of the full-length CksHs1 substantially inhibited CDK2 kinase activity in vitro, whereas overexpression of the mutant CksHs1-(19–79) failed to inhibit the CDK2 kinase activity, consistent with its lack of binding to CDK2 (Fig. 6A). In a separate experiment, the construct encoding GST-CDK2 transfected with increasing amounts of either CksHs1 or CksHs1-(19–79) further illustrated the inhibition that CksHs1 has over the CDK2 kinase activity (Fig.6B). The presence of increasing amounts of full-length CksHs1 corresponded with a progressive inhibition of the CDK2 kinase activity, whereas in the case of CksHs1-(19–79), there was no effect on kinase activity. Once it was established that CksHs1 inhibited CDK2 kinase activity, we investigated whether the p45SKP2-CksHs1 interaction could modulate the effect of CksHs1 on the CDK2 kinase activity. The same CDK2 kinase assay was done in COS-7 cells transfected with GST-CDK2, an inhibitory concentration of myc-CksHs1 (0.8 μg), and increasing amounts of myc-p45SKP2 (0, 4, 0, 8 and 1, 6 μg). Our results showed that the increasing amounts of p45SKP2 were able to progressively relieve CDK2 from the inhibitory effect of CksHs1 and restore CDK2 kinase activity (Fig. 6C). It is noteworthy that overexpression of p45SKP2 alone slightly increased CDK2 kinase activity. The same histone H1 kinase assay was performed in COS-7 cells transfected with GST-CDK2 adding His-CksHs1 protein produced in bacteria to the CDK2 precipitates. In this case CksHs1 failed to inhibit CDK2 kinase activity (Fig. 6D), suggesting that CksHs1 inhibits CDK2 kinase activity using an indirect mechanism. In this study we provide evidence for the interaction between p45SKP2 and CksHs1. Both p45SKP2 and CksHs1 were known to be associated with the Cyclin A-CDK2 complexes, but the direct interaction between p45SKP2 and CksHs1 had never been reported. We identified CksHs1 as a candidate p45SKP2-interacting protein in an interaction-trap screening using p45SKP2 as a bait. The interaction was confirmed by co-precipitation studies in the lymphoid cell lines Cem and Jurkat and using COS-7 transfected with various constructs encoding p45SKP2 and CksHs1. This interaction has been mapped to the carboxyl-terminal region of p45SKP2, which contains several leucine-rich repeats, while the amino-terminal F-box domain has proved not to be necessary for this association. p45SKP2 is an F-box/leucine-rich repeat-containing protein that belongs to both the ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes SCFSKP2 (4Lisztwan J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The association between p45SKP2 and Cyclin A-CDK2 complexes has been well documented, but the exact nature of the interaction remains unclear. We have not found any evidence in favor of a direct protein-protein interaction, and in fact when we assayed this in an interaction-trap assay the results were negative. On the other hand, CksHs1 belongs to the Cks family of cell cycle regulatory proteins composed of small proteins (9–18 kDa). Cks proteins are bound to the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase as described in yeast (20Hayles J. Beach D. Durkacz B. Nurse P. Mol. Gen.

Human cells contain two isoforms of Cks proteins, namely CksHs1 and CksHs2, that each can bind to CDK2 (25Richardson H.E. Stueland C.S. Thomas J. Russell P. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1332-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure of CksHs1 as well as the human CDK2 kinase bound to CksHs1 has been described (17Bourne Y.

Biol. 1995; 249: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but besides this knowledge in terms of sequence and structure, little is known about CksHs1 function (28Pines J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Even though Cks proteins have been related to the cyclosome/APC (anaphase promoting complex) (29Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2549-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Patra D. Wang S.X. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 257: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and p45SKP2 has been related to the SCFSKP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, both CksHs1 and p45SKP2 have been related to the S phase Cyclin A-CDK2 complexes. Since both CksHs1 and p45SKP2 bind to the Cyclin A-CDK2 complexes, it is possible that their interaction is important in the structure and function of these complexes. Thus, once the CksHs1-p45SKP2 interaction was characterized, our studies focused on the role of this interaction in the structure and function of the S phase cyclin-CDK2 complexes. This does not preclude different roles for the CksHs1-p45SKP2 complexes in addition to their regulation of S phase kinase activity however. The interaction between CksHs1 and p45SKP2 and CDK2 as analyzed by co-precipitation studies indicated that different sites of CksHs1 interact with p45SKP2 and CDK2. While the CksHs1 residues found to interact with CDK2 agreed with previous studies (24Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,33Moreno S. Hayles J. Nurse P. Cell. 1989; 58: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 34Tang Y. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we mapped the CksHs1-p45SKP2 binding region to CksHs1 amino acids 36–71. Furthermore, our results indicate that CksHs1 modulates the interaction between p45SKP2 and CDK2. We have seen that excess amounts of either CksHs1 or CksHs1-(19–79), an amino-terminal deletion of CksHs1 that does not bind to CDK2 but does bind to p45SKP2, blocks the interaction between p45SKP2 and CDK2. This fact can be explained if p45SKP2 and CDK2 interact through CksHs1 or if CksHs1 blocks the CDK2-interacting region of p45SKP2. To clarify the situation, we performed the inverse experiment, showing that excess amounts of p45SKP2 blocked the interaction between CksHs1 and CDK2. This result indicated that p45SKP2 can bind either CksHs1 or the CDK2 complex but not both simultaneously. In further confirmation of this hypothesis, CksHs1 exogenously produced in bacteria was added to a CDK2 precipitate, and the resulting complex reduced the amount of p45SKP2 pulled from a cell extract by the CDK2 alone, indicating that p45SKP2 competes for a binding site on the cyclin-CDK2 complex with CksHs1 or that the p45SKP2-CksHs1 complex formation results in blocking of the cyclin-CDK2-binding sites on each protein. Taken together, these results suggest the co-existence of at least two different cyclin-CDK2 complexes together with p45SKP2 or CksHs1. The two different cyclin-CDK2 complexes may be cyclin-CDK2-p45SKP2and cyclin-CDK2-CksHs1, where p45SKP2 and CksHs1 bind to the complexes in a mutually exclusive way. The structure of the cyclin-CDK2-CksHs1 complex is well determined, but little is known about the role CksHs1 binding plays in CDK2 regulation. Overexpression or depletion experiments performed on fission yeast, budding yeast, and Xenopus eggs implicate the Cks family of proteins in a wide variety of functions; namely entry into mitosis, exit from mitosis, and transition between G1 and S or between G2 and M (24Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Moreno S. Hayles J. Nurse P. Cell. 1989; 58: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 34Tang Y. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Reynard G.J. Reynolds W. Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5858-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). According to most experiments, Cks proteins modulate the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the major mitotic CDK and may therefore have quite different effects on cell cycle progression depending upon when in the cell cycle the interaction occurs (24Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 36Dunphy W.G. Newport J.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 181-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). When CksHs1 function was tested in our experimental model, CksHs1 clearly inhibited CDK2 kinase activity in mammalian cells transfected with both CDK2 and CksHs1. This result demonstrates that CksHs1 complexed with cyclin-CDK2 exerts an inhibitory effect over the CDK2 kinase activity. However, there was no CDK2 kinase activity inhibition when exogenous CksHs1 protein was added to mammalian cells transfected with CDK2. This result clearly indicates that, in contrast to other CDK2 inhibitors like p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, which inhibit due to their direct interaction with the kinase (37Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 38Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), CksHs1-mediated CDK2 kinase inhibition is probably through an indirect mechanism involving another regulatory protein. Since binding between p45SKP2 and CksHs1 inhibits each of their respective interactions with cyclin-CDK2, the p45SKP2-CksHs1 complex also has functional implications regarding CDK2 activity. The results of our experiments show that p45SKP2 restores basal kinase activity after CksHs1-mediated CDK2 kinase inhibition by blocking CksHs1 binding to CDK2. Thus our findings attribute a new role to p45SKP2 in CDK2 kinase regulation and therefore S phase progression, which is different from the p45SKP2 function in the ubiquitin degradation pathway. Finally, our data also suggest that factors that regulate the CksHs1-p45SKP2 interaction may have an important role in cell cycle progression as they would regulate CksHs1-CDK2 interaction and hence kinase activity.
