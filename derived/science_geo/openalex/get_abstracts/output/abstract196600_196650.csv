https://openalex.org/W1591418317,"The use of sulfate of exogenous origin in the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate was suggested (1) and then demonstrated by the isolation of chondroitin sulfate-W from the cartilage of rats given sulfate-V6 (2, 3). Confirmatory reports have supplemented the earlier observations (4, 5). Autoradiography has been particularly effective in showing that administered sulfate-S36 is concentrated to a greater extent in regions which have a high acid mucopolysaccharide concentration (6-21) than in regions in which the concentration of such polysaccharides is low or in which they are absent. Results of experiments in which tissue cultures (22) and cartilage slices (23, 24) were used strongly suggest that the incorporation of sulfate into chondroitin sulfate is enzymatically controlled. It is likely that the reverse reaction, namely, the hydrolytic cleavage of the sulfate group from chondroitin sulfate, is similarly affected. However, the presence in mammalian tissues of an enzyme to catalyze such a reaction has not been demonstrated. The following is a report of the fate of the sulfate group of chondroitin sulfate-W when the latter is administered to rats by stomach tube or by intraperitoneal injection."

https://openalex.org/W10365356,"SUMMARY A pancreatic digest of casein, the key material in a defined medium for the production of tetanus toxin, has been separated by means of reversible resin columns into three main fractions: (1) an acidic fraction, (2) a neutral fraction, and (3) a basic fraction. The part,icipation of the basic fraction in the production of toxin has now been elucidated. By means of silver precipitation it has been separated into three subfractions; free arginine and lysine will substitute for the corresponding two subfractions, and the essential component in the histidine fract,ion has been identified as histidine in peptide linkage. Synthetic histidine peptides can be successfully sub- stituted for the naturally occurring material, and differences in their effect on toxin production have been observed. Glycyl-L-histidine and a-amino- n-butyryl-L-histidine mere the most active of those tested. Carnosine or acetylhistidine will substitute, but good toxin is produced only when large amounts of these substances are used. Free L-histidine is without effect on toxin production but will support growth of the organism. Preliminary experiments on the remaining unknown components in the acidic and neu- tral fractions indicate that they also may be pept.ide in nature."

By this method hypotaurine-S36 has been pre- pared and its metabolism has been studied in rats and mice. The conversion of hypotaurine to taurine is confirmed. Furthermore, a rapid and extensive formation of sulfate from hypotaurine is demonstrated. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Awapara, J., J. Biol. Chem., 203,133 (1953). 2.

We have recently been investigating quantitative aspects of sympathin output from the spleen with particular attention to the effect of the frequency of stimulation."

He was able by indirect experiments to localize the curare-block in the end-plates of skeletal muscle. Some time ago when we investigated the metabolism of carbon-14 – curarine I in the cat2, we tried to obtain auto-radiographs of muscle, intending to show the fixation of this alkaloid directly at the neuro-muscular junctions."

The disappearance from the gastrointestinal tract and the concentrations in the blood were fol- lowed for 10 hours. Free n-tryptophan was absorbed and utilized most rapidly and acetyl-D-tryptophan the least rapidly. Differences among the various isomers are discussed. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Gibson, Q.
