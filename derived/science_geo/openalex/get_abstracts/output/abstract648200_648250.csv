Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome–CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS–CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS–CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS–CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogs. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i + 3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3′–5′ exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.

In this study, we establish a link between the state of the actin cytoskeleton and the expression of pancreatic transcription factors that drive pancreatic lineage specification. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated that different degrees of actin polymerization biased cells toward various endodermal lineages and that conditions favoring a polymerized cytoskeleton strongly inhibited neurogenin 3-induced endocrine differentiation. Using latrunculin A to depolymerize the cytoskeleton during endocrine induction, we developed a two-dimensional differentiation protocol for generating human pluripotent stem-cell-derived β (SC-β) cells with improved in vitro and in vivo function. SC-β cells differentiated from four hPSC lines exhibited first- and second-phase dynamic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Transplantation of islet-sized aggregates of these cells rapidly reversed severe preexisting diabetes in mice at a rate close to that of human islets and maintained normoglycemia for at least 9 months."
https://openalex.org/W3008725968,"The majority of the human genome does not encode proteins. Many of these noncoding regions contain important regulatory sequences that control gene expression. To date, most studies have focused on activators such as enhancers, but regions that repress gene expression-silencers-have not been systematically studied. We have developed a system that identifies silencer regions in a genome-wide fashion on the basis of silencer-mediated transcriptional repression of caspase 9. We found that silencers are widely distributed and may function in a tissue-specific fashion. These silencers harbor unique epigenetic signatures and are associated with specific transcription factors. Silencers also act at multiple genes, and at the level of chromosomal domains and long-range interactions. Deletion of silencer regions linked to the drug transporter genes ABCC2 and ABCG2 caused chemo-resistance. Overall, our study demonstrates that tissue-specific silencing is widespread throughout the human genome and probably contributes substantially to the regulation of gene expression and human biology."
https://openalex.org/W3008816475,"The Hall–Petch relationship, according to which the strength of a metal increases as the grain size decreases, has been reported to break down at a critical grain size of around 10 to 15 nanometres1,2. As the grain size decreases beyond this point, the dominant mechanism of deformation switches from a dislocation-mediated process to grain boundary sliding, leading to material softening. In one previous approach, stabilization of grain boundaries through relaxation and molybdenum segregation was used to prevent this softening effect in nickel–molybdenum alloys with grain sizes below 10 nanometres3. Here we track in situ the yield stress and deformation texturing of pure nickel samples of various average grain sizes using a diamond anvil cell coupled with radial X-ray diffraction. Our high-pressure experiments reveal continuous strengthening in samples with grain sizes from 200 nanometres down to 3 nanometres, with the strengthening enhanced (rather than reduced) at grain sizes smaller than 20 nanometres. We achieve a yield strength of approximately 4.2 gigapascals in our 3-nanometre-grain-size samples, ten times stronger than that of a commercial nickel material. A maximum flow stress of 10.2 gigapascals is obtained in nickel of grain size 3 nanometres for the pressure range studied here. We see similar patterns of compression strengthening in gold and palladium samples down to the smallest grain sizes. Simulations and transmission electron microscopy reveal that the high strength observed in nickel of grain size 3 nanometres is caused by the superposition of strengthening mechanisms: both partial and full dislocation hardening plus suppression of grain boundary plasticity. These insights contribute to the ongoing search for ultrastrong metals via materials engineering. High-pressure diamond anvil cell experiments reveal that compression strengthening of nanocrystalline nickel increases as its grain sizes decrease to 3 nanometres, owing to dislocation hardening and suppression of grain boundary plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W3008005410,"The process of metastasis is complex1. In breast cancer, there are frequently long time intervals between cells leaving the primary tumour and growth of overt metastases2,3. Reasons for disease indolence and subsequent transition back to aggressive growth include interactions with myeloid and fibroblastic cells in the tumour microenvironment and ongoing immune surveillance4-6. However, the signals that cause actively growing cells to enter an indolent state, thereby enabling them to survive for extended periods of time, are not well understood. Here we reveal how the behaviour of indolent breast cancer cells in the lung is determined by their interactions with alveolar epithelial cells, in particular alveolar type 1 cells. This promotes the formation of fibronectin fibrils by indolent cells that drive integrin-dependent pro-survival signals. Combined in vivo RNA sequencing and drop-out screening identified secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2) as a key mediator of this interaction. Sfrp2 is induced in breast cancer cells by signals from lung epithelial cells and promotes fibronectin fibril formation and survival, whereas blockade of Sfrp2 expression reduces the burden of indolent disease."
https://openalex.org/W3008769615,"During endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD), misfolded proteins are polyubiquitinated, extracted from the ER membrane and degraded by the proteasome1–4. In a process called retrotranslocation, misfolded luminal proteins first need to traverse the ER membrane before ubiquitination can occur in the cytosol. It was suggested that the membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 forms a retrotranslocation pore regulated by cycles of auto- and deubiquitination5–8. However, the mechanism by which auto-ubiquitination affects Hrd1 and allows polypeptides to cross the membrane and whether Hrd1 forms a membrane-spanning pore remained unknown. Here, using purified Hrd1 incorporated into different model membranes, we show that Hrd1 auto-ubiquitination leads to the opening of a pore. Substrate binding increases the pore size and its activity, whereas deubiquitination closes the pore and renders it unresponsive to substrate. We identify two binding sites for misfolded proteins in Hrd1, a low-affinity luminal site and a high-affinity cytoplasmic site formed following auto-ubiquitination of specific lysine residues in Hrd1’s RING domain. We propose that the affinity difference between the luminal and cytoplasmic binding sites provides the initial driving force for substrate movement through Hrd1. Ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 is essential for endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation. Vasic et al. demonstrate that Hrd1 forms a retrotranslocation channel controlled by auto-ubiquitination and substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W3008751896,"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and cellular workload are tightly balanced by the key cellular regulator, calcium (Ca2+). Current models assume that cytosolic Ca2+ regulates workload and that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake precedes activation of matrix dehydrogenases, thereby matching OXPHOS substrate supply to ATP demand. Surprisingly, knockout (KO) of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) in mice results in only minimal phenotypic changes and does not alter OXPHOS. This implies that adaptive activation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases by intramitochondrial Ca2+ cannot be the exclusive mechanism for OXPHOS control. We hypothesized that cytosolic Ca2+, but not mitochondrial matrix Ca2+, may adapt OXPHOS to workload by adjusting the rate of pyruvate supply from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Here, we studied the role of malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS)-dependent substrate supply in OXPHOS responses to changing Ca2+ concentrations in isolated brain and heart mitochondria, synaptosomes, fibroblasts, and thymocytes from WT and MCU KO mice and the isolated working rat heart. Our results indicate that extramitochondrial Ca2+ controls up to 85% of maximal pyruvate-driven OXPHOS rates, mediated by the activity of the complete MAS, and that intramitochondrial Ca2+ accounts for the remaining 15%. Of note, the complete MAS, as applied here, included besides its classical NADH oxidation reaction the generation of cytosolic pyruvate. Part of this largely neglected mechanism has previously been described as the “mitochondrial gas pedal.” Its implementation into OXPHOS control models integrates seemingly contradictory results and warrants a critical reappraisal of metabolic control mechanisms in health and disease.

https://openalex.org/W3007146357,"Objectives To identify sociodemographic and illness-related factors associated with quality of life among people with Schizophrenia. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was employed among 351 people with schizophrenia and attending the followup service at Jimma University Medical Center, psychiatric clinic during the study period. Participants were recruited using a systematic random sampling method and a sample fraction of two was used after the first person was identified by a lottery method. Data entry was done using EpiData version 3.1 and then exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25 for analysis. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the statistically significant association between quality of life and independent variables. Results Among the four domains of quality of life, respondents scored the lowest mean in the social relationships domain (10.14 ± 3.12). Final adjusted multiple regression model revealed, being divorced was negatively associated with the physical domain (β = −0.72, p = 0.02), having no formal education was negatively associated with physical health domain (β = −0.69, p = 0.001) and age was positively associated with the psychological domain (β = 0.371, p = 0.071). Being rural resident was negatively associated with physical domain (β = −0.48, p = 0.01), with environmental domain (β = −0.64, p = 0.03), with social relationships domain (β = −0.45, p = 0.04), and with overall quality of life (β = −1.93, p = 0.006). Positive symptoms (β = −0.22, p = 0.001), negative symptoms (β = −0.36, p = 0.001), and general psychopathology (β = −0.098, p = 0.006) were inversely associated with overall quality of life. Conclusion In this study, the social relationship domain of quality of life among people with schizophrenia has the lowest mean score. Some socio-demographic variables and psychiatric symptoms were found to be key significant associated factors of quality of life. Priority interventions to improve the social deficits and addressing psychiatric symptoms of people with schizophrenia is essential to improve their quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W3008978910,"The placenta, a tissue that is metabolically active and rich in mitochondria, forms a critical interface between the mother and developing fetus. Oxidative stress within this tissue, derived from the dysregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been linked to a number of adverse fetal outcomes. While such outcomes have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrially generated ROS in altering the process of placentation remains unclear. In this study, mitochondrial complex I activity was attenuated using 10 nM rotenone to induce cellular oxidative stress by increasing mitochondrial ROS production in the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line. Increased mitochondrial ROS resulted in a significant decrease in the transcripts which encode for proteins associated with fusion (GCM1, ERVW-1, and ERVFRD-1) resulting in a 5-fold decrease in the percentage of BeWo fusion. This outcome was associated with increased indicators of mitochondrial fragmentation, as determined by decreased expression of MFN2 and OPA1 along with an increase in a marker of mitochondrial fission (DRP1). Importantly, increased mitochondrial ROS also resulted in a 5.0-fold reduction of human placental lactogen (PL) and a 4.4-fold reduction of insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2) transcripts; hormones which play an important role in regulating fetal growth. The pre-treatment of rotenone-exposed cells with 5 mM N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) resulted in the prevention of these ROS mediated changes in BeWo function and supports a central role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in the maintenance and function of the materno-fetal interface."
https://openalex.org/W3007017013,"Since chemerin’s identification as an adipokine, it has been associated with a number of human diseases including diabetes and obesity. However, the basic scientific foundation for these clinical determinations is still lacking. Fibroblastic mouse 3T3 cells are unable to develop lipid droplets if chemerin is not present. Thus, we hypothesized that an in vivo rat model chemerin knockout (KO; an advancement from the previously mentioned in vitro cultures) would have limited accumulation of lipid in adipocytes compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Female WT/KO rats (Sprague Dawley background) were fed a low-fat diet starting at 8 weeks of age with weekly body weight and food consumption monitoring. At 25 weeks of age, adipose tissue depots were dissected and flash frozen for PCR analysis or fixed with paraformaldehyde for histology. Over the 17 weeks of experimentation, WT and KO animals did not have differences in total body weight or food consumption but KO animals had a significantly reduced amount of visceral fat compared to WT animals (via microCT at 8 and 25 weeks). Histology of retroperitoneal and mesenteric depots demonstrated a significant leftward shift in adipocyte size in the mesenteric but not the retroperitoneal depot of the KO compared to WT animals. Similarly, in the mesenteric fat of the KO rat, gene expression of adiponectin, fatty acid synthase, perilipin, and leptin were significantly reduced compared to mesenteric fat of WT animals and retroperitoneal fat of both WT and KO animals. Adiponectin was highlighted by a protein-protein interaction network as being important for the physiological effects of chemerin removal. These data are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate chemerin’s adipokine potential in vivo and identify it as fat depot location-specific."

https://openalex.org/W4231097042,"Background Current guidelines underline the importance of high-quality chest compression during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), to improve outcomes. Contrary to this many studies show that chest compression is often carried out poorly in clinical practice, and long interruptions in compression are observed. This prospective cohort study aimed to analyse whether chest compression quality changes when a real-time feedback system is used to provide simultaneous audiovisual feedback on chest compression quality. For this purpose, pauses in compression, compression frequency and compression depth were compared. Methods The study included 292 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in three consecutive study groups: first group, conventional resuscitation (no-sensor CPR); second group, using a feedback sensor to collect compression depth data without real-time feedback (sensor-only CPR); and third group, with real-time feedback on compression quality (sensor-feedback CPR). Pauses and frequency were analysed using compression artefacts on electrocardiography, and compression depth was measured using the feedback sensor. With this data, various parameters were determined in order to be able to compare the chest compression quality between the three consecutive groups. Results The compression fraction increased with sensor-only CPR (group 2) in comparison with no-sensor CPR (group 1) (80.1% vs. 87.49%; P < 0.001), but there were no further differences belonging compression fraction after activation of sensor-feedback CPR (group 3) (P = 1.00). Compression frequency declined over the three study groups, reaching the guideline recommendations (127.81 comp/min vs. 122.96 comp/min, P = 0.02 vs. 119.15 comp/min, P = 0.008) after activation of sensor-feedback CPR (group 3). Mean compression depth only changed minimally with sensor-feedback (52.49 mm vs. 54.66 mm; P = 0.16), but the fraction of compressions with sufficient depth (at least 5 cm) and compressions within the recommended 5–6 cm increased significantly with sensor-feedback CPR (56.90% vs. 71.03%; P = 0.003 and 28.74% vs. 43.97%; P < 0.001). Conclusions The real-time feedback system improved chest compression quality regarding pauses in compression and compression frequency and facilitated compliance with the guideline recommendations. Compression depth did not change significantly after activation of the real-time feedback. Even the sole use of a CPR-feedback-sensor (“sensor-only CPR”) improved performance regarding pauses in compression and compression frequency, a phenomenon known as the ‘Hawthorne effect’. Based on this data real-time feedback systems can be expected to raise the quality level in some parts of chest compression quality.

https://openalex.org/W3007459557,"Purpose To assess the influence of capsular tension ring (CTR) on surgical outcomes of toric and multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) in eyes at high risk of zonular instability. Methods Fifty-five eyes of 43 patients who had undergone phacoemulsification and IOL implantation were included in the analysis. They had some risk of zonular weakness, such as pseudoexfoliation, shallow anterior chamber, high myopia, and phacodonesis, or were judged to have unstable zonules during surgery. Toric IOL was implanted in 9 eyes with CTR and 22 eyes without CTR, while multifocal IOL was used in 9 eyes with CTR and 15 eyes without CTR. Manifest refraction, refractive astigmatism, visual acuity, and degree of IOL decentration and tilt measured using swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography were analyzed. Axis misalignment of toric IOLs were also evaluated. Results In toric IOLs, co-implantation of CTR significantly reduced decentration and axis misalignment of IOL, resulting in better uncorrected and corrected visual acuity after surgery. In multifocal IOLs, combined use of CTR significantly prevented IOL tilt, leading to better intermediate visual acuity. Spherical equivalent and residual astigmatism were not significantly affected by the use of CTR. Conclusions CTR reduces decentration and axis misalignment of toric IOL and tilt of multifocal IOL, achieving improvement of postoperative visual function in eyes with suspected zonular instability."
https://openalex.org/W3008060627,"Background Cattleyak are the hybrid offspring between cattle and yak and combine yak hardiness with cattle productivity. Much attempt has been made to examine the mechanisms of male sterility caused by spermatogenic arrest, but yet there is no research systematically and precisely elucidated testis gene expression profiling between cattleyak and yak. Methods To explore the higher resolution comparative transcriptome map between the testes of yak and cattleyak, and further analyze the mRNA expression dynamics of spermatogenic arrest in cattleyak. We characterized the comparative transcriptome profile from the testes of yak and cattleyak using high-throughput sequencing. Then we used quantitative analysis to validate several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in testicular tissue and spermatogenic cells. Results Testis transcriptome profiling identified 6477 DEGs (2919 upregulated and 3558 downregulated) between cattleyak and yak. Further analysis revealed that the marker genes and apoptosis regulatory genes for undifferentiated spermatogonia were upregulated, while the genes for differentiation maintenance were downregulated in cattleyak. A majority of DEGs associated with mitotic checkpoint, and cell cycle progression were downregulated in cattleyak during spermatogonial mitosis. Furthermore, almost all DEGs related to synaptonemal complex assembly, and meiotic progression presented no sign of expression in cattleyak. Even worse, dozens of genes involved in acrosome formation, and flagellar development were dominantly downregulated in cattleyak. Conclusion DEGs indicated that spermatogenic arrest of cattleyak may originate from the differentiation stage of spermatogonial stem cells and be aggravated during spermatogonial mitosis and spermatocyte meiosis, which contributes to the scarcely presented sperms in cattleyak."
https://openalex.org/W3007885594,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on growth performance and nutrient utilisation when supplementing diets deficient in energy and protein with carbohydrase enzymes or xylo-oligosaccharide in broilers challenged with coccidia. 960 Ross 308 broilers were used in this 21-day study. The treatments were arranged into a 2×4 factorial with 2 challenge states (challenged and non-challenged) and 4 different additive types (control, xylanase alone, xylanase and β-glucanase mixture and xylo-oligosaccharide). On day 14, the challenged group received 12× the recommended dose of coccidiosis vaccine while the non-challenged group received a sham treatment of water only. The birds and feed were weighed on days 0, 14 and 21. On day 21, two birds per pen were euthanized, the caeca were removed and the contents collected for short chain fatty acid analysis. Six more birds per pen were euthanized and ileal digesta were collected and pooled per pen for nutrient digestibility analysis. Feed intake was greater (P < 0.05) on days 14 and 21 when xylo-oligosaccharide was included in the diet compared to the xylanase and β-glucanase mixture in birds challenged with coccidiosis. Including xylo-oligosaccharide in the diet improved (P < 0.05) the digestibility of nitrogen and supplementing diets with the xylanase and β-glucanase mixture improved (P < 0.05) the digestibility of several amino acids. The concentration of arabinose and xylose was (P < 0.001) greater when broiler diets were supplemented with carbohydrase enzymes or xylo-oligosaccharide compared to the control. Although there was an increase in short chain fatty acid production due to the addition of carbohydrase enzymes or xylo-oligosaccharide, there was no additive effect on the %G+C profile of caecal bacteria however there was a negative effect of coccidiosis. In conclusion, the similarity in the response to carbohydrase enzymes or xylo-oligosaccharide supplementation illustrates that the hydrolysis products from carbohydrase activity may have prebiotic like effects."
https://openalex.org/W3007556826,"Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a form of distraction therapy that has shown potential as an analgesia and sedation sparing agent. This study assessed the effect of IVR on the self-administered sedation requirements of patients undergoing joint replacement surgery under regional anesthesia in a single center.This study was a single-center, randomized control trial at St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Fifty patients undergoing elective total knee and total hip arthroplasty were randomized to IVR and Propofol patient-controlled sedation (PCS) or propofol PCS alone. The primary outcome measure was intra-operative propofol use. Secondary outcomes included pattern of propofol use over time, use of adjunct analgesia, unmet propofol demand, and patient satisfaction survey scores. Of 50 total patients, 25 received IVR in conjunction with PCS, and 25 received PCS alone. All patients received adjunct analgesia from the treating Anesthesiologist. Median propofol use/hour over the entire procedure in the control group was 40 (11.1, 93.9) mg/hour compared with 45 (0, 94.7) mg/hour in the IVR group (p = 0.90). There were no differences in patterns of propofol use over the course of each procedure. Adjusting for various baseline characteristics did not change the results. Postoperative satisfaction scores were equivalent in both groups. The VR intervention was well tolerated by all patients, with no report of major side effects. Key limitations were relatively small sample size, the non-blinded nature of the study, and use of adjunct analgesia.In patients receiving joint replacement surgery under regional anesthesia with PCS, IVR was well tolerated but did not decrease the overall sedation requirement."
https://openalex.org/W3008352355,"Radiogenic strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) have long been used in analyses of paleomobility within Mesoamerica. While considerable effort has been expended developing 87Sr/86Sr baseline values across the Maya region, work in central Mexico is primarily focused on the Classic period urban center of Teotihuacan. This study adds to this important dataset by presenting bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr values across central Mexico focusing on the Basin of Mexico. This study therefore serves to expand the utility of strontium isotopes across a wider geographic region. A total of 63 plant and water samples were collected from 13 central Mexican sites and analyzed for 87Sr/86Sr on a Thermo-Finnigan Neptune multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). These data were analyzed alongside 16 published 87Sr/86Sr values from two additional sites within the region of interest. A five-cluster k-means model was then generated to determine which regions of the Basin of Mexico and greater central Mexico can and cannot be distinguished isotopically using 87Sr/86Sr values. Although the two clusters falling within the Basin of Mexico overlap in their local 87Sr/86Sr ranges, many locations within the Basin are distinguishable using 87Sr/86Sr values at the site-level. This study contributes to paleomobility studies within central Mexico by expanding knowledge of strontium isotope variability within the region, ultimately allowing researchers to detect intra-regional residential mobility and gain a greater understanding of the sociopolitical interactions between the Basin of Mexico and supporting outlying regions of central Mexico."

https://openalex.org/W3007841915,"The Italian wolf (Canis lupus italicus) population has remained isolated South of the Alps for the last few thousand years. After a strong decline, the species has recolonized the Apennines and the Western Alps, while it is currently struggling to colonize the Eastern Alps. Recently, the species was detected in a lowland park connecting the Northern Apennines to the Central Alps. If the park was able to sustain a net wolf dispersal flow, this could significantly boost the connection with the Eastern Alps and the Dinaric-Balkan population. We investigated the suitability of the park as a functional ecological corridor for the wolf through the unhospitable lowland of Northern Italy. We collected wolf occurrence data in two study areas. We modeled species distribution running a separate ensemble model for each study area and then merging the output of the models to obtain an integrated suitability map. We used this map to identify corridors for the wolf adopting a factorial least-cost path and a cumulative resistant kernel approach. The connectivity models showed that only two corridors exist in the lowland areas between the Northern Apennines and the Central Alps. The Western corridor is a blind route, while the eastern corridor passes through the park and has a continuous course. However, the models also revealed a scarce resilience of corridor connectivity in the passageways between the park and the Apennines and the Prealps, which suggests that urgent management actions are necessary to ensure the future functionality of this important corridor."

Existing studies mainly explored the factors affecting individuals' initial intentions to start using a shared bicycle, but few looked at the likelihood that a user would continue using one. Based on a post-acceptance model of information system (IS) continuance, this investigation proposed a research model to investigate factors influencing riders' intentions to continued usage of shared bikes. Analysis involved structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on data from 376 shared bicycle riders. The results from SEM showed that perceived usefulness, service quality, riders' habits, overall satisfaction and the nature of the weather were the most important factors positively influencing users' intentions to continue bike sharing.

Medical charts were retrospectively reviewed for 43 consecutive eyes with PCV treated with combination therapy of PDT and intravitreal injection of ranibizumab(n = 13) or aflibercept(n = 30) and completed 5-year follow-up. The variants of ARMS2 A69S and CFH I62V were genotyped using TaqMan assay. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) significantly improved at 5-year (P = 0.01) with 20% reduction of subfoveal choroidal thickness irrespective of presence or absence of recurrence. Visual improvement was associated with baseline shorter greatest linear dimension (GLD) (P = 1.0×10−4). Mean time to recurrence was 28.6±23.1 months (95% CI: 21.5–35.7, Median:18.0) and time to recurrence was associated with G allele (protective allele) of ARMS2 A69S and GLD (P = 4.0×10−4 and 1.0×10−2, respectively). Multiple regression analysis revealed that time to recurrence extended by 15.5 months when the G allele of ARMS2 A69S increased by one allele (TT: 15.7±17.0, TG: 30.8±23.5, GG: 41.1±22.6 months). The combination therapy resulted in a favorable visual outcome for PCV during 5-year follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3007227805,"IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is a scaffold protein that interacts with numerous binding partners and thereby regulates fundamental biological processes. The functions of IQGAP1 are modulated by several mechanisms, including protein binding, self-association, subcellular localization, and phosphorylation. Proteome-wide screens have indicated that IQGAP1 is ubiquitinated, but the possible effects of this post-translational modification on its function are unknown. Here we characterized and evaluated the function of IQGAP1 ubiquitination. Using MS-based analysis in HEK293 cells, we identified six lysine residues (Lys-556, -1155, -1230, -1465, -1475, and -1528) as ubiquitination sites in IQGAP1. To elucidate the biological consequences of IQGAP1 ubiquitination, we converted each of these lysines to arginine and found that replacing two of these residues, Lys-1155 and Lys-1230, in the GAP-related domain of IQGAP1 (termed IQGAP1 GRD-2K) reduces its ubiquitination. Moreover, IQGAP1 GRD-2K bound a significantly greater proportion of the two Rho GTPases cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) and Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1) than did WT IQGAP1. Consistent with this observation, reconstitution of IQGAP1-null cells with IQGAP1 GRD-2K significantly increased the amount of active CDC42 and enhanced cell migration significantly more than WT IQGAP1. Our results reveal that ubiquitination of the CDC42 regulator IQGAP1 alters its ability to bind to and activate this GTPase, leading to physiological effects. Collectively, these findings expand our view of the role of ubiquitination in cell signaling and provide additional insight into CDC42 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W3009017878,"Many members of the C-type lectin family of glycan-binding receptors have been ascribed roles in the recognition of microorganisms and serve as key receptors in the innate immune response to pathogens. Other mammalian receptors have become targets through which pathogens enter target cells. These receptor roles have often been documented with binding studies involving individual pairs of receptors and microorganisms. To provide a systematic overview of interactions between microbes and the large complement of C-type lectins, here we developed a lectin array and suitable protocols for labeling of microbes that could be used to probe this array. The array contains C-type lectins from cow, chosen as a model organism of agricultural interest for which the relevant pathogen–receptor interactions have not been previously investigated in detail. Screening with yeast cells and various strains of both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria revealed distinct binding patterns, which in some cases could be explained by binding to lipopolysaccharides or capsular polysaccharides, but in other cases they suggested the presence of novel glycan targets on many of the microorganisms. These results are consistent with interactions previously ascribed to the receptors, but they also highlight binding to additional sugar targets that have not previously been recognized. Our findings indicate that mammalian lectin arrays represent unique discovery tools for identifying both novel ligands and new receptor functions.

Our findings indicate that mammalian lectin arrays represent unique discovery tools for identifying both novel ligands and new receptor functions. Soluble and membrane-bound mammalian glycan-binding proteins in the C-type lectin family are responsible for recognition of microorganisms and for cell–cell interactions (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Recent insights into structures and functions of C-type lectins in the immune system.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Sugar-binding activity of these receptors resides in modular carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) 2The abbreviations used are: CRDcarbohydrate-recognition domainCFDA-SEcarboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl esterLPSlipopolysaccharideDC-SIGNdendritic cell-specific ICAM-3–grabbing nonintegrin. and is based on ligation of adjacent hydroxyl groups, usually at the 3- and 4-position in a monosaccharide target, to a conserved Ca2+ in the primary binding site. The CRDs in the roughly 25 members of the family fall broadly into two groups: those that interact with sugars related to mannose and GlcNAc, through their equatorial 3- and 4-OH groups, and those that interact with galactose and GalNAc, in which the 4-OH group is axial. Many CRDs in the mannose-recognition group also bind to fucose. Binding to ligands depends on the presence of free OH groups. Thus, target monosaccharides are often found in the nonreducing ends of oligosaccharides. Selective binding to specific oligosaccharide ligands results from additional interactions with further sugar residues in secondary binding sites. carbohydrate-recognition domain carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester lipopolysaccharide dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3–grabbing nonintegrin. The C-type lectins play multiple roles in the innate immune system. The soluble C-type lectins are collectins, which contain collagen-like domains in addition to the C-type CRDs (3Howard M. Farrar C.A. Sacks S.H. Structural and functional diversity of collectins and ficolins and their relationship to disease.Semin. Immunopathol. 2018; 40 (28894916): 75-8510.1007/s00281-017-0642-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Collectins are mostly found in blood and in the surfactant layer on the surface of the alveolar fluid in the lungs. These proteins aid in neutralization of pathogens by activating complement, by opsonizing proteins for uptake by complement-binding receptors on macrophages, and by causing agglutination. Membrane-bound C-type lectins are found on various cells of the innate system, including macrophages and dendritic cells (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Recent insights into structures and functions of C-type lectins in the immune system.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 34 (26163333): 26-3410.1016/j.sbi.2015.06.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Many of these receptors mediate endocytosis of ligands, which can be a route for neutralizing pathogens as well as subsequently stimulating the adaptive immune response. C-type lectins involved in endocytosis are also found on hepatocytes and vascular endothelial cells (2Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Mammalian sugar-binding receptors: known functions and unexplored roles.FEBS J. 2019; 286 (30657247): 1800-181410.1111/febs.14759Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Extensive genomic and biochemical analysis has provided a nearly complete account of receptors containing C-type CRDs in the human immune system, but C-type lectins from other mammals, apart from mouse, have not been as well-studied. Because there are many differences between the mouse and human immune systems, there is need to study other species. Cows are not only important agriculturally, but can also be a useful model for infectious diseases in humans (4Gibson A.J. Coffey T.J. Werling D. Of creatures great and small: the advantages of farm animal models in immunology research.Front.

For example, mouse models of tuberculosis do not mimic the pathology of the disease in humans whereas tuberculosis in cattle and humans is more similar. In addition, due to the large size and large blood volume of cattle, immune cells can quite easily be obtained from various tissues, making cattle attractive models for studying the cellular effects of lectin–microbe interactions. Investigation of the cow immune response is also important for understanding potential zoonotic diseases. Screening of large glycan arrays has been instrumental in determining specificity of lectins from various mammalian species for mammalian oligosaccharides (6Blixt O. Head S. Mondala T. Scanlan C.

However, the lower availability of pure, well-characterized glycans from microorganisms is a limitation for using glycan arrays to study lectin–pathogen interactions. Arrays of glycans purified from natural sources or chemically synthesized provide one way to probe these interactions (9Stowell S.R. Arthur C.M. McBride R. Berger O. Razi N. Heimburg-Molinaro J.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of glycans found on bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites are not available in this format. Lectin arrays have previously been constructed using plant and bacterial lectins for the purpose of deducing the structures of glycans present in samples such as glycoproteins and performing other types of glycomic analysis (12Pilobello K.T. Krishnamoorthy L. Slawek D. Mahal L.K. Development of a lectin microarray for the rapid analysis of protein glycopatterns.Chembiochem. 2005; 6 (15798991): 985-98910.1002/cbic.200400403Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 13Hirabayashi J.

As an alternative approach, a mammalian lectin array provides the opportunity to screen many different lectins simultaneously with labeled, intact microorganisms to develop a profile in which receptors interact with each organism. Use of a lectin array constructed with bovine C-type lectins provides a rapid way to perform comparative analysis of specificity of C-type lectins and inform future studies to determine the roles of different lectins in the immune system and potentially to develop carbohydrate-based vaccines. A model mammalian lectin array has been developed using CRDs from bovine C-type lectins modified with single-site biotin tags. The array has been used to reveal novel and unexpected interactions between bacteria and the receptors of the innate immune system. Bovine genomic sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information databases were screened for annotated instances of the C-type CRD motif. To distinguish sugar-binding proteins from C-type lectin-like domains, the presence of amino acids at positions for ligating to the conserved Ca2+ was used to sort the annotated sequences (14Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. The C-type lectin superfamily in the immune system.Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163 (9700499): 19-3410.1111/j.1600-065X.1998.tb01185.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, 32 potential sugar-binding proteins were identified. Most of these proteins could be identified as orthologs of human and murine proteins. The names assigned in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database accurately reflect the fact that the proteins share the same overall domain organization as the corresponding human orthologs, and the sequences of the CRDs are largely conserved (1Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Recent insights into structures and functions of C-type lectins in the immune system.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2015; 34 (26163333): 26-3410.1016/j.sbi.2015.06.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Most receptors found in the immune system of humans, including mincle, the receptor for trehalose dimycolate on mycobacteria, and dectin-1, which binds to β-glucans on fungi, are well-conserved in cows (15Feinberg H. Jégouzo S.A. Rowntree T.J. Guan Y. Brash M.A. Taylor M.E. Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Mechanism for recognition of an unusual mycobacterial glycolipid by the macrophage receptor mincle.J. Biol.

However, there is a single form of DC-SIGN in cows, compared with two in humans, and several members of the collectin subfamily, including conglutinin, CL-43, and CL-46, which appear to be ruminant-specific sugar-binding receptors (17Gjerstorff M.

For the purposes of producing a prototype mammalian lectin array for analyzing interactions with microbes, CRDs from the 23 proteins highlighted in Fig. 1 were selected, based on their expression on cells of the innate immune system and exposure to the blood compartment. The cow ortholog of dectin-1 was also included as it is the only protein in which a domain with the C-type lectin fold has been shown to have sugar-binding activity despite lacking a canonical Ca2+-binding site (19Plato A. Willment J.A. Brown G.D. C-type lectin-like receptors of the dectin-1 cluster: ligands and signaling pathways.Int. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 32 (23570314): 134-15610.3109/08830185.2013.777065Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A mutant version of this protein, which is linked to Johne's disease, was also included for comparison (20Pant S.D. Verschoor C.P. Schenkel F.S. You Q. Kelton D.F. Karrow N.A. Bovine CLEC7A genetic variants and their association with seropositivity in Johne's disease ELISA.Gene. 2014; 537 (24393710): 302-30710.1016/j.gene.2013.12.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The resulting catalog of C-type CRD sequences is given in Fig. S1. Construction of the lectin array was based on use of biotinylation tags to display the CRDs in defined orientations on streptavidin-coated wells. Biotinylation was achieved by appending a 13-amino acid biotinylation sequence at one end of the CRD (21Schatz P.J. Use of peptide libraries to map the substrate specificity of a peptide-modifying enzyme: a 13-residue consensus peptide specifies biotinylation in Escherichia coli.Biotechnology. 1993; 11 (7764094): 1138-114310.1038/nbt1093-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). A lysine residue in this sequence is a target for biotin ligase, which can be co-expressed with receptor fragments in Escherichia coli for biotinylation in vivo (22Smith P.A. Tripp B.C. DiBlasio-Smith E.A. Lu Z. LaVallie E.R. McCoy J.M. A plasmid expression system for quantitative in vivo biotinylation of thioredoxin fusion proteins in Escherichia coli.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26 (9490786): 1414-142010.1093/nar/26.6.1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the purified enzyme can be used to treat fragments in vitro. The arrangements of different C-type lectins are summarized in Fig. 2A, along with different ways in which N- and C-terminal biotinylation sequences have been used for immobilization. Because both ends of the polypeptide project from the face of the CRD opposite to the sugar-binding site, immobilization through tags attached to the ends of the CRDs orients the sugar-binding site projecting away from the surface of the wells. In a few cases, additional fragments larger than single CRDs have been included. The mannose receptor contains eight C-type lectin-like domains (23Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. Contribution to ligand binding by multiple carbohydrate-recognition domains in the macrophage mannose receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1730714): 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CRD 4 has been shown to be the main site of sugar binding, but a pair of domains containing CRDs 4 and 5 has enhanced sugar-binding activity, so this two-domain fragment is also included in the array. As a further test case, attachment of an N-terminal biotin tag to the full extracellular portion of the Kupffer cell receptor mimics the orientation of the trimeric receptor at the cell surface (24Fadden A.J. Holt O.J. Drickamer K. Molecular characterisation of the rat Kupffer cell glycoprotein receptor.Glycobiology. 2003; 13 (12672702): 529-53710.1093/glycob/cwg068Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Most of the tagged CRD fragments were prepared by expression in E. coli, followed by solubilization of inclusion bodies in guanidine and renaturation by dialysis and purification by affinity chromatography on immobilized sugars following protocols developed for many of these proteins from other species. This approach ensures that the proteins are correctly folded and have sugar-binding activity. Dectin-1 was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Ca2+-independent sugar-binding activity was confirmed by immobilization in streptavidin-coated cells and probing with fluorescein-conjugated zymosan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described below. Collectin ColL1 was also purified by conventional chromatography. SDS-PAGE in the presence and absence of reducing agents indicated that disulfide bonds were formed as expected. However, no suitable sugar-containing target ligands have been identified, so it was impossible to prove unambiguously that it was correctly folded. For each CRD preparation, a series of different concentrations were tested in the streptavidin-coated wells. Probing with fluorescein-conjugated zymosan was used to determine what concentration of CRD was required to ensure saturation of the streptavidin in the wells. Examples of the results for DC-SIGN, dectin-2, and langerin are shown in Fig. 3. Based on these results, aliquots of each receptor preparation suitable for coating four wells were lyophilized. For the proteins that did not bind zymosan, collectin ColL1, SP-A, and mincle, saturation coating of the wells was confirmed by elution of the coated protein from the wells with SDS and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Arrays were then generated by dissolving the panel of aliquots and coating the wells in parallel. Initial tests of the array were performed using zymosan particles derived from S. cerevisiae because this preparation contains multiple types of sugar structures and binds to most of the C-type CRDs (Fig. 4A). Screening of the prototype array with zymosan confirms this broad spectrum of binding (Fig. 4B). The lectins have been grouped based on their primary monosaccharide-binding properties. Interaction with the mannose-binding CRDs is not surprising, given the abundance of mannan structures on the surface of yeast. Interaction of zymosan with galactose-binding receptors has been previously reported and presumably reflects the presence of galactose-containing glycans (25Jang S. Ohtani K. Fukuoh A. Yoshizaki T. Fukuda M. Motomura W. Mori K. Fukuzawa J. Kitamoto N. Yoshida I. Suzuki Y. Wakamiya N. Scavenger receptor collectin placenta 1 (CL-P1) predominantly mediates zymosan phagocytosis by human vascular endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19073604): 3956-396510.1074/jbc.M807477200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When the array screening was performed at multiple different concentrations, the absolute intensity changed but the overall pattern remained the same. Analysis of binding across a range of concentrations confirmed that for most receptors the fluorescence observed was linearly related to the input concentrations of zymosan (Fig. 4C). This relationship indicates that the ligands were below saturating concentrations and makes the relative results broadly comparable regardless of concentration. Laboratory strains of E. coli were used to test methods for preparing bacterial samples to screen against the lectin array. Initially, labeling of cells of strain BL21(DE3) by treatment with the membrane-permeable derivative of fluorescein, carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE), was investigated (26Fuller M.E. Streger S.H. Rothmel R.K. Mailloux B.J. Hall J.A. Onstott T.C. Fredrickson J.K. Balkwill D.L. DeFlaun M.F. Development of a vital fluorescent staining method for monitoring bacterial transport in subsurface environments.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66 (11010903): 4486-449610.1128/AEM.66.10.4486-4496.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Compared with direct surface labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), this reagent primarily reacts with amino groups inside the cells, increasing the intensity of labeling and also reducing the potential for modification of the surface properties of the bacteria. Screening of the lectin array directly with live bacteria or following paraformaldehyde fixation of the bacteria gave similar results (Fig. 5A). Compared with zymosan, a more restricted set of receptors gave signals for the bacterial samples. Many of the membrane receptors and serum collectins that bind mannose-containing glycans bound well to the bacteria, but there are notable exceptions, such as conglutinin, Endo180, dectin-2, and dectin-1, which bound well to zymosan but not to the bacteria. Generally, lower signals were observed for galactose-specific receptors, but again there was selective binding: to one of the subunits of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, to the scavenger receptor C-type lectin, and to the Kupffer cell receptor. Bacteria could also be labeled with fluorescent proteins (27Valdivia R.H. Cormack B.P. Falkow S. The uses of green fluorescent protein in prokaryotes.Methods Biochem. Anal. 2006; 47 (16335713): 163-178PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the results for strain BL21(DE3) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the chemically-labeled cells shows very good concordance of results (Fig. 5A). Compared with chemical labeling, expressing fluorescent proteins can be more species-restricted, because appropriate promotors need to be used for expression. However, many bacteria expressing fluorescent proteins have been developed for use in endocytosis assays, for example, and the results shown here indicate that such samples can be adapted for use in screening the array (27Valdivia R.H. Cormack B.P. Falkow S. The uses of green fluorescent protein in prokaryotes.Methods Biochem. Anal. 2006; 47 (16335713): 163-178PubMed Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the surface of the outer membrane of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) contains inner and outer core structures, but no O-antigen extensions (Fig. 5B) (28Klein G. Lindner B. Brade H. Raina S.

Residues at the nonreducing termini of these glycans are potential targets for the lectins that were observed to bind the bacteria. The presence of some terminal galactose residues is consistent with the observed binding of galactose-specific lectins, and the presence of glucose and GlcNAc residues might account for binding of receptors that bind mannose-related sugars. However, robust binding is observed for ClearColi BL21(DE3) cells, a derivative of strain BL21(DE3) that has only the lipid A portion of LPS (Fig. 5C). The close similarity in the binding patterns for BL21(DE3) and ClearColi BL21(DE3) cells suggests that there are other targets besides those on LPS. A further comparison was made with E. coli strain K12, which also lacks an O-antigen and has an LPS outer core structure distinct from the LPS on BL21(DE3) (29Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Molecular basis for structural diversity in the core regions of the lipopolysaccharides of Escherichia coli Salmonella enterica.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30 (9791168): 221-23210.1046/j.1365-2958.1998.01063.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Compared with strain BL21(DE3), broadly similar binding to lectins that bind mannose-type sugars was observed, but there was little binding to any of the galactose-specific receptors, even though there is a galactose residue in the LPS core glycan (Fig. 5C). These results are consistent with the suggestion that a significant component of the binding to several of the receptors is LPS-independent, probably reflecting the presence of additional glycosylated structures on the surface of the outer membrane. Two examples of pathogenic E. coli serotypes that have been isolated from human and cattle were also tested. Strain E2348/69 (O127:H6), a commonly used prototype enteropathogenic strain, showed strong binding to almost all of the galactose-specific receptors, with the exception of the scavenger receptor C-type lectin, which has a narrow specificity for galactose in the context of the Lewisx trisaccharide (Fig. 6A). The strong binding correlates with the presence of galactose in the repeat unit of the O127 polysaccharide (Fig. 6B) (30Widmalm G. Leontein K. Structural studies of the Escherichia coli O127 O-antigen polysaccharide.Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 247 (7693348): 255-26210.1016/0008-6215(93)84258-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The galactose residue present in each copy of the backbone repeat would be a target for the galactose-binding C-type lectins, because it retains free 3- and 4-OH groups. The adaptive immune response to most bacteria is dominated by the O-antigens, but these results suggest that some O-antigens could also be targets for receptors of the innate immune system. In contrast, enterohemorrhagic E. coli strain EDL933 (O157:H7) binds very few receptors on the array, although CD23 and LSECtin show consistent signals (Fig. 6A). There is no obvious target for binding to these receptors in the O-antigen structure (Fig. 6B) (31Nishiuchi Y. Doe M. Hotta H. Kobayashi K. Structure and serologic properties of O-specific polysaccharide from Citrobacter freundii possessing cross-reactivity with Escherichia coli O157:H7.FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 28 (10799808): 163-17110.1111/j.1574-695X.2000.tb01472.xCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). If found at the nonreducing termini of the polysaccharides, the constituent sugars GalNAc, glucose, and fucose would be potential targets for receptors. However, the absence of binding to most of the receptors indicates that there are few such terminal sugars exposed on the O157:H7 strain. The finding that terminal sugars are not common targets in the O157:H7 strain, compared with the strong binding to the O127:H6 strain to multiple receptors, suggests that binding to O-antigens is likely to be dominated by internal sugars that have appropriately exposed OH groups. The poor binding of the O157:H7 strain to most receptors also demonstrates that expression of O-antigens lacking target residues provides a way to escape detection by the innate immune system. Many common modifications, such as methylation and acetylation, block the 3- and 4-OH groups and would thus prevent binding (32Whitfield C. Szymanski C.M. Aebi M. Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D.

One possible target for binding across multiple bacterial strains is the enterobacterial common antigen, which can appear in a linear, lipid-linked form on the surface of the outer membrane (33Kuhn H.M. Meier-Dieter U. Mayer H. ECA, the enterobacterial common antigen.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 4 (3078744): 195-22210.1111/j.1574-6968.1988.tb02743.xCrossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Two unidentified patients’ cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) datasets with and without right maxillary central incisor were used to create the FEA models. Three different FEA models were made with bone structures that represent a healed socket (HS), reduced bone width edentulous site (RB), and immediate extraction socket with graft (EG). A one-piece abutment-implant fixture mimicking Straumann Standard Plus tissue level RN 4.1 X 11.8mm, for titanium alloy (Ti) and Zir were modeled. 178 N oblique load and 200 N vertical load were used to simulate occlusal loading. Von Mises stress and equivalent strain values for around each implant model were measured. Within the HS and RB models the labial-cervical region in the cortical bone exhibited highest stress, with Zir having statistically significant lower stress-strain means than Ti in both labial and palatal aspects. For the EG model the labial-cervical area had no statistically significant difference between Ti and Zir; however, Zir performed better than Ti against the graft. FEA models suggest that Ti, a more elastic material than Zir, contributes to the transduction of more overall forces to the socket compared to Zir. Thus, compared to Ti implants, Zir implants may be less prone to peri-implant bone overloading and subsequent bone loss in high stress areas especially in the labial-cervical region of the cortical bone. Zir implants respond to occlusal loading differently than Ti implants. Zir implants may be more favorable in non-grafted edentulous or immediate extraction with grafting."

In this study, we investigated why people may experience social interaction and what factors contributed to their subjective experience. We furthermore investigated whether implying social interaction modulated gaze behavior to people's faces, specifically the eyes. To imply the potential for interaction, participants received either one of two instructions: 1) they would be presented with a person via a 'live' video-feed, or 2) they would be presented with a pre-recorded video clip of a person. Prior to the presentation, a confederate walked into a separate room to suggest to participants that (s)he was being positioned behind a webcam. In fact, all participants were presented with a pre-recorded clip. During the presentation, we measured participants' gaze behavior with an eye tracker, and after the presentation, participants were asked whether they believed that the confederate was 'live' or not, and, why they thought so. Participants varied greatly in their judgements about whether the confederate was 'live' or not. Analyses of gaze behavior revealed that a large subset of participants who received the live-instruction gazed less at the eyes of confederates compared with participants who received the pre-recorded-instruction. However, for both the live-instruction group and the pre-recorded instruction group, another subset of participants gazed predominantly at the eyes. The current findings may contribute to the development of experimental designs aimed to capture the interactive aspects of social cognition and visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W3007732400,"Site-specific conjugation of ubiquitin onto a range of DNA repair proteins regulates their critical functions in the DNA damage response. Biochemical and structural characterization of these functions are limited by an absence of tools for the purification of DNA repair proteins in purely the ubiquitinated form. To overcome this barrier, we designed a ubiquitin fusion protein that is N-terminally biotinylated and can be conjugated by E3 RING ligases onto various substrates. Biotin affinity purification of modified proteins, followed by cleavage of the affinity tag leads to release of natively-mono-ubiquitinated substrates. As proof-of-principle, we applied this method to several substrates of mono-ubiquitination in the Fanconi anemia (FA)-BRCA pathway of DNA interstrand crosslink repair. These include the FANCI:FANCD2 complex, the PCNA trimer and BRCA1 modified nucleosomes. This method provides a simple approach to study the role of mono-ubiquitination in DNA repair or any other mono-ubiquitination signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3007081390,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common form of brain cancer, with an average life expectancy of fewer than two years post-diagnosis. We have previously reported that cancer cell originated exosomes, including GBM, have NANOG and NANOGP8 DNA associated with them. The exosomal NANOG DNA has certain differences as compared to its normal counterpart that are of immense importance as a potential cancer biomarker. NANOG has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, and its pseudogene, NANOGP8, is suggested to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. Similarly, SOX2 is another stemness gene highly expressed in cancer stem cells with an intimate involvement in GBM progression and metastasis as well as promotion of tumorigenicity in Neuroblastoma (NB). Since exosomes are critical in intercellular communication with a role in dissipating hallmark biomolecules responsible for cancer, we conducted a detailed analysis of the association of the SOX2 gene with exosomes whose sequence modulations with further research and appropriate sample size can help to identify diagnostic markers for cancer. We have detected SOX2 DNA associated with exosomes and have identified some of the SNPs and nucleotide variations in the sequences from a GBM and SH-SY5Y sample. Although a further systematic investigation of exosomal DNA from GBM and NB patient's blood is needed, finding of SOX2 DNA in exosomes in the current study may have value in clinical research. SOX2 is known to be misregulated in cancer cells by changes in miRNA function, such as SNPs in the binding sites. Our finding of cancer-specific SNPs in exosomal SOX2 DNA sequence may reflect those changes in the cancer stem cells as well as cancer cells. A series of our study on embryonic stem cell gene analysis in exosomal DNA may lead to a minimally invasive exosome-based diagnosis, and give us a key in understanding the mechanisms of cancer formation, progression, and metastasis."

The assist algorithm should not interfere with the recovery motion, and should enhance the ability of the user to recover after tripping. Thus, in this study, we investigated the recovery motion affected by the assist robot after tripping. We compared the recovery motion with different reaction algorithms. Principal component analysis revealed the effects of the reaction algorithm. Correspondingly, principal components were related to the recovery motion during two steps following tripping. Specifically, the effects of the reaction algorithm were related to a principal component that represented the motion of the second step after tripping and that increased the margin of stability. Furthermore, the margin of stability became significantly large when the assistive torque was applied during the recovery motion. The result of this study suggests that the assist robot can potentially enhances the recovery motion of its user following tripping."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the carcinogenesis, particularly in TSAs, remain largely uncharacterized. To clarify their molecular and clinicopathological characteristics, we performed mutation and methylation analyses of cancer-associated genes in 78 serrated lesions, including TSAs, SSAs and microvesicular hyperplastic polyps. Target exon sequence analysis was performed with 39 genes, including genes known to be frequently mutated in colorectal cancers and/or serrated lesions. We also used bisulfite pyrosequencing to assess the methylation status of various cancer-associated genes and marker genes of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). The prevalence of mutations in genes associated with Wnt signaling was significantly higher in TSAs than SSAs (65% vs. 28%, p < 0.01). Among those, RNF43 mutations were observed in 38% of TSAs and 17% of SSAs. In immunohistochemical studies of 39 serrated lesions, the prevalence of abnormal nuclear β-catenin accumulation was significantly higher in TSAs (57%) than SSAs (8%) (P = 0.01). SMOC1 methylation was detected in 54% of TSAs but in no SSAs (p < 0.01). Additionally, SMOC1 methylation was more prevalent among TSAs with KRAS mutation (82%) than with BRAF mutation (38%, p = 0.03). Lesions with CIMP-high or RNF43 mutations were detected only in TSAs with BRAF mutation, suggesting two distinct carcinogenic pathways in TSAs. Mutations in genes associated with Wnt signaling play a greater role in the carcinogenesis of TSAs than SSAs."
https://openalex.org/W3007353474,"Objective This study is aimed at determining the preoperative nutritional status of patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE), and subsequently establish a concise and reasonable nutritional evaluation indicator. The established evaluation method could be used for clinical preoperative risk assessment and prediction of post-operation recovery. Methods The basic patient information on height, body weight, BMI and hepatic encephalopathy of 93 HAE patients were examined. Subsequently, abdominal ultrasonography, blood coagulation and liver function tests were done on the patients. Liver function was assessed using the Child-Pugh improved grading method while nutritional status was evaluated using the European Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) method. Additional parameters including hospitalization time, the hemoglobin (HGB) level on the 3rd day after the operation, and the number of postoperative complications of HAE patients were also recorded. Results The NRS 2002 score was negatively correlated with body weight, body mass index (BMI)and albumin (ALB) (P<0.01), and positively correlated with the transverse and longitudinal diameters of the lesions (P<0.01). A worse grading of liver function was associated with a low ALB and a high NRS 2002 score (P<0.01). Results of the NRS 2002 score indicate that the hospitalization time of the normal nutrition group was significantly shorter than that of the malnourished group (P < 0.05). The HGB level of the control group on the 3rd day after the operation was significantly higher than that of the malnourished group (P < 0.05), and the number of postoperative complications was lower than that of malnutrition group (P < 0.05). Conclusion Malnutrition is common in HAE patients. The nutritional status of HAE patients is related to many clinical factors, such as Child-Pugh classification of liver function, size of the lesion, and ALB among others. Although both BMI and ALB can be used as primary screening indicators for malnutrition in HAE patients, NRS 2002 is more reliable and prudent in judging malnutrition in HAE patients. Therefore, BMI and ALB are more suitable for preoperative risk assessment and prediction of postoperative recovery."

Here we evaluate the effects of this steroid co-treatment on subsequent time to ovulation and egg quality in shortfinned eels artificially matured by hypophysation. Co-treatment with 11KT (1 mg) and E2 (0.2 or 2 mg) significantly reduced time to ovulation and therefore, the amount of pituitary homogenate required, without any detrimental effects on gonadosomatic index, oocyte diameter or the total weight of stripped eggs. E2 treatment resulted in promising increases in fertilization rates. These indicators suggest that co-treatment with 11KT and E2 holds promise for future artificial maturation practices in terms of minimising fish handling and stress, and of reducing the need for expensive pituitary preparations."

We have stimulated murine macrophages from WT, MyD88−/−, Trif−/−, MyD88−/−Trif−/−, MK2−/−, and Zfp36−/− mice with graded doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and various inhibitors to evaluate the role of various genes in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)–induced necroptosis. Necrosome signaling, cytokine production, and cell death were evaluated by immunoblotting, ELISA, and cell death assays, respectively. We observed that during TLR4 signaling, necrosome activation is mediated through the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF, and this is inhibited by MK2. In the absence of MK2-mediated necrosome activation, lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFα expression was drastically reduced, but MK2-deficient cells became highly sensitive to necroptosis even at low TNFα levels. In contrast, during tonic TLR4 signaling, WT cells did not undergo necroptosis, even when MK2 was disabled.

However, this enhancement of cell death by the inhibition of MK2 was not dependent on MLKL or RipK3 but required the kinase function of RipK1 (34Lalaoui N. Hänggi K. Brumatti G. Chau D. Nguyen N.Y.

Here we evaluated the impact of MK2 and TTP in macrophages, and we demonstrate that TTP inhibits necrosome activation during tonic TLR signaling through the inhibition of TNFα and JNK expression/activation. Necrosome signaling is induced in cells by engagement of TLRs or cytokine receptors (TNF-R/IFNAR) signaling in the absence of caspase-8 activity (17Christofferson D.E. Yuan J. Necroptosis as an alternative form of programmed cell death.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22 (20045303): 263-26810.1016/j.ceb.2009.12.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 38McComb S.

We stimulated macrophages with various concentrations of the TLR4 ligand LPS in the presence of a high concentration of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (50 μm) to identify the relative concentration of LPS required to induce cell death by necroptosis. To confirm the mechanism of cell death as necroptosis, we treated cells with necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) to inhibit the kinase region of RipK1 and consequent RipK1–RipK3 interaction. Our results indicate that a minimal concentration of 200 pg/ml of LPS is required to induce necroptosis of macrophages (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, at 10 ng/ml of LPS, 50% cell death of macrophages occurred by 6 h post stimulation, whereas at 0.1 ng/ml LPS, 50% cell death occurred at 24 h (Fig. 1B). Necroptosis was not induced when the concentration of LPS was reduced to 0.01 ng/ml. This suggests that higher concentrations of LPS accelerate the timing of necroptosis. We stimulated primary macrophages with high (100 ng/ml) (Fig. 1, A, C–I) or low (1 ng/ml) (Fig. S1, A–F) concentration of LPS, and/or zVAD-fmk (50 μm) and measured cell death at 24 h. Both at high and low concentration of LPS, cell death depended on RipK3 and was rescued by the RipK3 inhibitor GSK872 (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A). Whereas Ifnar1−/− macrophages showed resistance against necroptosis at both LPS concentrations (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A), Tnfr2−/− macrophages showed protection only in response to stimulation with low concentration of LPS (Fig. S1A). Thus, higher concentration of LPS shifts the dependence of cell death less toward TNFR2 and more toward IFN-R. There was no impact of TNFR1 on necroptosis. Although we have previously reported that TRIF-signaling promotes necroptosis of macrophages (38McComb S. Cessford E. Alturki N.A. Joseph J. Shutinoski B. Startek J.B. Gamero A.M. Mossman K.L. Sad S. Type-I interferon signaling through ISGF3 complex is required for sustained Rip3 activation and necroptosis in macrophages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Combined deficiency in MyD88 and Trif compromised necrosome signaling in macrophages as revealed by lack of Ser-166 phosphorylation of RipK1 and undetectable Ser-345 phosphorylation of MLKL (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, the total phosphorylation of RipK1 (upper band) was undetectable in MyD88−/−Trif−/− macrophages (Fig. 1F). We further observed that the phosphorylation of RipK3 was reduced in Trif−/− but completely inhibited in MyD88−/−Trif−/− macrophages (Fig. 1G). This suggests that both TLR4 adaptor proteins synergize to induce necroptosis with TRIF playing a more dominant role over MyD88. We observed that MyD88 promoted the expression of TNFα whereas TRIF induced IFN-I. The expression of both cytokines was inhibited only in macrophages with double deficiency of TRIF and MyD88 (Fig. 1H and Fig. S1C). Interestingly, the activation of p38MAPK was reduced in MyD88−/− and Trif−/− macrophages but was undetectable in MyD88−/−Trif−/− macrophages (Fig. 1F). Thus, despite little p38MAPK phosphorylation in MyD88−/−Trif−/− macrophages, there was poor necroptosis of macrophages. This result is surprising because p38MAPK pathway has been recently shown to induce an inhibitory phosphorylation of RipK1 and inhibit cell death (35Menon M.B. Gropengießer J. Fischer J. Novikova L.

Because we observed that the phosphorylation of RipK1 (Ser-166)-dependent necroptosis was also inhibited in MyD88−/−Trif−/− macrophages, this result suggests that the inhibition of the p38MAPK-induced inhibitory phosphorylation of RipK1 does not necessarily drive the cells toward necroptosis in the absence of TNFα and IFN-I. Because p38MAPK and the downstream kinase MK2 promotes TNFα expression by macrophages following LPS treatment (3Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. MAPKAP kinase 2 is essential for LPS-induced TNF-α biosynthesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1 (10559880): 94-9710.1038/10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), we evaluated the impact of p38MAPK inhibitor (LY2228820, 4 μm) or MK2 inhibitor (PF3644022, 5 μm) on necroptosis induced by high (Fig. 1I) or low (Fig. S1D) concentrations of LPS. There was no appreciable increase in necroptosis when the p38MAPK pathway was disabled. Similar results were observed with Mk2−/− macrophages (Fig. 1I and Fig. S1E). Total phosphorylation of RipK1 (upper band) was inhibited in Mk2−/− cells and there was a slight increase in the Ser-345 phosphorylation of MLKL at earlier time period (Fig. S1F). Whereas induction of necroptosis in macrophages requires high concentrations of zVAD-fmk (>25 μm) (Fig. 2A), lower concentrations are needed to inhibit caspase activity (39Rijal D. Ariana A. Wight A. Kim K. Alturki N.A. Aamir Z. Ametepe E.S. Korneluk R.G. Tiedje C. Menon M.B. Gaestel M. McComb S. Sad S.

We therefore revised our experimental model and treated cells with LPS (1 ng/ml) and a reduced concentration of zVAD-fmk (10 μm) that does not induce significant necroptosis (Fig. 2A) to determine whether the inhibition of p38MAPK induces their sensitivity to cell death under these conditions. Our results indicate that the inhibition of p38MAPK makes the cells significantly susceptible to cell death (Fig. 2B), which correlates with Ser-345 phosphorylation of MLKL (Fig. 2C). We observed that the inhibition of p38MAPK accelerated the kinetics and magnitude of necroptosis (Fig. 2D) compared with the cells that did not receive the p38MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 1B). Induction of cell death by the inhibition of p38MAPK was still dependent on RipK3, TNFα (Fig. 2E), and MLKL (Fig. 2F) further confirming the mechanism of cell death to be necroptosis. In the absence of the p38MAPK inhibitor, there was no detectable cell death in WT, RipK3−/−, or TNFα−/− macrophages upon treatment with LPS (1 ng/ml) and low level of zVAD-fmk (10 μm) (Fig. S2A). Similar results were obtained with the MK2 inhibitor (Fig. 2G). To further confirm the role of MK2, we tested the cell death of Mk2−/− macrophages and observed that the deficiency of MK2 promotes significantly increased cell death when cells are treated with reduced zVAD-fmk concentration (Fig. 2H). Furthermore, Mk2−/− macrophages displayed an absence of overall RipK1 phosphorylation (upper band), and an increase in the stimulatory phosphorylation of RipK1 (Ser-166) and that was associated with phosphorylation of RipK3 and MLKL (Fig. 2I). We observed that when necroptosis was induced by treatment of cells with LPS (1 ng/ml) + zVAD-fmk (10 μm) + p38MAPK inhibitor (4 μm), cell death was mainly dependent on TRIF at 6 h post stimulation of cells (Fig. S2B). However, at 24 h post stimulation, complete rescue of cell death was observed only when both MyD88 and TRIF were disabled (Fig. 2J and Fig. S2C), suggesting that both adaptor proteins synergize to promote necroptosis under these conditions. We observed that the expression of TNFα was potently reduced in Mk2−/− cells in response to stimulation with LPS (Fig. S2D) or LPS+zVAD-fmk (Fig. 2K), although cell death occurring in the absence of MK2 is TNFα dependent (Fig. 2G). To reconcile this paradox, we treated Tnfa−/− macrophages with LPS (1 ng/ml)+zVAD-fmk (10 μm) in the presence of increasing concentrations of recombinant TNFα. Our results indicate that the inhibition of MK2 or p38MAPK makes macrophages highly sensitive (>100-fold) to minimal concentrations of TNFα required to induce cell death (Fig. 2L and Fig. S2E). These results suggest that the inhibition of p38MAPK/MK2 signaling increases the sensitivity of macrophages to necroptosis induced by very low levels of TNFα. We observed that when we use higher concentration (50 μm) of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, potent necroptosis is induced in macrophages, and addition of the p38MAPK inhibitor has negligible impact (Fig. 1J). However, when the concentration of zVAD-fmk is lowered to 10 μm, then necroptosis is induced only when the p38MAPK pathway is inhibited (Fig. 2B). Thus, the use of higher zVAD-fmk concentration masks the important role of p38MAPK in the inhibition of necrosome signaling. Interestingly, treatment of macrophages with LPS (1 ng/ml) and the specific caspase-8 inhibitor (zIETD-fmk, 50 μm) or another pan-caspase inhibitor (Q-VD-OPh, 50 μm) did not induce necroptosis (Fig. 2M). These results suggest that zVAD-fmk is uniquely able to induce necroptosis. Interestingly, we observed that zIETD-fmk does induce necroptosis of macrophages only when p38MAPK is inhibited (Fig. 2, M and N). In addition to zIETD-fmk, treatment of cells with Q-VD-OPh resulted in cell death only upon co-treatment with LPS and p38MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 2M). Because the zIETD-fmk induced potent necrosome signaling in macrophages only when p38MAPK/MK2 signaling was inhibited, this suggests that zIETD-fmk was functional as a caspase-8 inhibitor. Furthermore, treatment of macrop"

The questionnaire was self-administered in paper by 183 university students, in the age span of 18 to 30. Both Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure and Bartlett's sphericity test were performed to ensure the validity of the factorization. In order to analyze the principal components, factors which obtained eigenvalues greater than 1 were chosen. The extraction of factors was performed after computing a Promax rotation and a Kaiser criterion. In each extracted factor, the internal consistency was used to prove its reliability. Bartlett's sphericity test was statistically significant (p <0.001), and the Both Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test was 0.89, confirming the factorization of this instrument. Exploratory factor analysis followed by a Promax rotation and scree plots graphic, extracted three factors that explained 62.1% of the total variance. The composition of each factor suggests the following meanings: Factor 1 (somatic sensation) includes 8 of 15 items; Factor 2 (impaired vision) includes 3 of 15 items; Factor 3 (cognitive performance) includes 4 of 15 items. Cronbach's alpha coefficient demonstrated good internal consistency (α> 0.75) in three dimensions. The multivariate statistical analysis of the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey revealed a three-factor structure, so new forms of questionnaire analysis can be designed in order to obtain gains in the management of a symptomatic patient, using 3 subscores, one for each factor, instead of a total score. The factorial structure of the questionnaire can be used with a high level of confidence in future investigations, which aim to assess which dimensions are most affected in each type of visual changes and develop more targeted therapeutic performances."
https://openalex.org/W3007371975,"Food allergy is an emerging clinical condition in pediatrics, so recommendations on its management have been widely published. Studying pediatricians’ adherence to these clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and understanding the reasons for their non-compliance can help to promote better management of this condition. A cross-sectional study was conducted by a survey among Brazilian pediatricians, randomly selected during the 38th Brazilian Congress of Pediatrics, which took place in October, 2017. A validated questionnaire with 16 questions addressing knowledge and practice on food allergy, as well as self-reported adherence to international guidelines was applied. Of the total of 415 pediatricians from all regions of the country who were surveyed, only 69 (16.7%) had a satisfactory adherence rate (≥80%). Adequate adherence to the guidelines was associated with the variables: ‘evaluating more than 10 children with suspected cow’s milk allergy (CMA) per month'; 'having read the Brazilian consensus'; or 'being aware of any international food allergy guideline'. In 8 of the 10 questions that assessed conscious adherence, a minority of those surveyed (20.3–42.3% variation) stated that they knew that their response was in line with the guidelines. This finding was statistically significant (p<0.05) in 7 of these 8 questions. The self-reported adherence of Brazilian pediatricians to international food allergy guidelines was low. Pediatricians who evaluated a higher number of children with suspected CMA or who were aware of the recommendations, had a higher rate of adherence. The results of the survey found that lack of resource was the major reported barrier to guideline adherence but lack of awareness must be a relevant non perceived barrier. This study shows the pediatricians´ self-reported adherence to food allergy guidelines in a widely overview for the first time in Brazil. More studies are necessary to investigate adherence to guidelines by pediatricians in other countries and to develop strategies to improve adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3008638017,"Background Adolescents’ high academic expectations predict future health and successful societal integration. Yet, little is known about which factors may promote adolescents’ expectations of their future education and academic achievement. Aims To explore whether potentially modifiable factors such as parents’ engagement and expectations regarding their child’s education; or student individual factors such as school engagement, academic achievement, sense of identity, and positive mental health predict positive development of academic expectations in early adolescence. Methods A longitudinal study of 3,203 adolescents and their parents was conducted with information collected between 7th grade (13 years of age) and 9th grade (16 years of age). Parental and adolescents’ own academic expectations and engagement in school, academic achievement, identity synthesis, and mental health were self-reported in annual questionnaires. We used logistic regression to analyze the associations between the aforementioned factors and two binary outcomes related to changes in expectations from 7th to 9th grade: A. resolved uncertainty regarding own academic expectations; B. raised academic expectations. Results Student engagement, and higher academic grades predicted both resolved uncertainty in expectations and raised academic expectations. Higher parental involvement in education was related to resolved uncertainty, while high parental expectations were related to raised student expectations. Identity synthesis and mental health did not appear to predict either outcome. Conclusion Our findings indicate that a supportive parental attitude concerning their child’s education during adolescence, student engagement, and positive progressions in academic achievements may contribute to a positive development of academic expectations, thus to positive educational trajectories."
https://openalex.org/W3008827415,"The chloroplast is a central part of plant cells, as this is the organelle where the photosynthesis, fixation of inorganic carbon, and other key functions related to fatty acid synthesis and amino acid synthesis occur. Since this organelle should be an integral part of any genome-scale metabolic model for a microalgae or a higher plant, it is of great interest to generate a detailed and standardized chloroplast model. Additionally, we see the need for a novel type of sub-model template, or organelle model, which could be incorporated into a larger, less specific genome-scale metabolic model, while allowing for minor differences between chloroplast-containing organisms. The result of this work is the very first standardized chloroplast model, iGR774, consisting of 788 reactions, 764 metabolites, and 774 genes. The model is currently able to run in three different modes, mimicking the chloroplast metabolism of three photosynthetic microalgae-Nannochloropsis gaditana, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. In addition to developing the chloroplast metabolic network reconstruction, we have developed multiple software tools for working with this novel type of sub-model in the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB, including tools for connecting the chloroplast model to a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction in need of a chloroplast, for switching the model between running in different organism modes, and for expanding it by introducing more reactions either related to one of the current organisms included in the model, or to a new organism."
https://openalex.org/W3007039267,"Runoff from heavy precipitation events can lead to microbiological contamination of source waters for public drinking water supplies. Philadelphia is a city of interest for a study of waterborne acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI) because of frequent heavy precipitation, extensive impervious landcover, and combined sewer systems that lead to overflows. We conducted a time-series analysis of the association between heavy precipitation and AGI incidence in Philadelphia, served by drinking water from Delaware River and Schuylkill River source waters. AGI cases on each day during the study period (2015-2017) were captured through syndromic surveillance of patients' chief complaint upon presentation at local emergency departments. Daily precipitation was represented by measurements at the Philadelphia International Airport and by modeled precipitation within the watershed boundaries, and we also evaluated stream flowrate as a proxy of precipitation. We estimated the association using distributed lag nonlinear models, assuming a quasi-Poisson distribution of the outcome variable and with adjustment for potential confounding by seasonal and long-term time trends, ambient temperature, day-of-week, and major holidays. We observed an association between heavy precipitation and AGI incidence in Philadelphia that was primarily limited to the spring season, with significant increases in AGI that peaked from 8 to 16 days following a heavy precipitation event. For example, the increase in AGI incidence related to airport precipitation above the 95th percentile (vs no precipitation) during spring reached statistical significance on lag day 7, peaked on day 16 (102% increase, 95% confidence interval: 16%, 252%), and declined while remaining significantly elevated through day 28. Similar associations were observed in analyses of watershed-specific precipitation in relation to AGI cases within the populations served by drinking water from each river. Our results suggest that heavy precipitation events in Philadelphia result in detectable local increases in waterborne AGI."
https://openalex.org/W3007231037,"Vanadium is a transition metal that has been added recently to the EU list of Raw Critical Metals. The growing needs of vanadium primarily in the steel industry justify its increasing economic value. However, because mining of vanadium sources (i. e. ores, concentrates and vanadiferous slags) is expanding, so is vanadium environmental contamination. Bioleaching comes forth as smart strategy to deal with supply demand and environmental contamination. It requires organisms that are able to mobilize the metal and at the same time are resistant to the leachate generated. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying vanadium resistance in Ochrobactrum tritici strains. The highly resistant strain 5bvl1 was able to grow at concentrations > 30 mM vanadate, while the O. tritici type strain only tolerated < 3 mM vanadate concentrations. Screening of O. tritici single mutants (chrA, chrC, chrF and recA) growth during vanadate exposure revealed that vanadate resistance was associated with chromate resistance mechanisms (in particular ChrA, an efflux pump and ChrC, a superoxide dismutase). We also showed that sensitivity to vanadate was correlated with increased accumulation of vanadate intracellularly, while in resistant cells this was not found. Other up-regulated proteins found during vanadate exposure were ABC transporters for methionine and iron, suggesting that cellular responses to vanadate toxicity may also induce changes in unspecific transport and chelation of vanadate."
https://openalex.org/W3007580305,"Introduction International medical electives, whereby undergraduates visit an institution in a country other than their own, are a common part of medical training. Visiting students are often asked to provide local teaching, which may be acceptable where the visitor is acting within the bounds of their own competency and the normal practices of both their home and host institutions. However, the extent to which teaching is an accepted student activity globally has not previously been described. This study aims to address this using an international survey approach. Methods A voluntary electronic survey, created using the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES) framework, was distributed across established international medical student networks. This assessed the involvement of medical students in teaching and the educator training they receive, with the intention of comparing experiences between high-income countries (HICs) and low/middle-income countries (LMICs) to gauge the engagement of both “host” and “visiting” students. Results 443 students from 61 countries completed the survey, with an equal proportion of respondents from LMICs (49.4%, 219/443) and HICs (50.6%, 224/443). Around two thirds of students reported providing teaching whilst at medical school, with most reporting teaching numerous times a year, mainly to more junior medical students. There was with no significant difference between LMICs and HICs. Around 30 per cent of all medical students reported having received no teacher training, including 40 per cent of those already providing teaching. Conclusion This study suggests that students are engaged in teaching globally, with no difference between HIC and LMIC contexts. However, students are underprepared to act as educators in both settings. Providing teaching as part of an elective experience may be ethically acceptable to both host and home institutions, but needs to be supported by formal training in delivering teaching."
https://openalex.org/W3007713916,"Histidine protein kinases (HKs) are prevalent prokaryotic sensor kinases that are central to phosphotransfer in two-component signal transduction systems, regulating phosphorylation of response regulator proteins that determine the output responses. HKs typically exist as dimers and can potentially autophosphorylate at each conserved histidine residue in the individual protomers, leading to diphosphorylation. However, analyses of HK phosphorylation in biochemical assays in vitro suggest negative cooperativity, whereby phosphorylation in one protomer of the dimer inhibits phosphorylation in the second protomer, leading to ∼50% phosphorylation of the available sites in dimers. This negative cooperativity is often correlated with an asymmetric domain arrangement, a common structural characteristic of autophosphorylation states in many HK structures. In this study, we engineered covalent dimers of the cytoplasmic domains of Escherichia coli CpxA, enabling us to quantify individual species: unphosphorylated, monophosphorylated, and diphosphorylated dimers. Together with mathematical modeling, we unambiguously demonstrate no cooperativity in autophosphorylation of CpxA despite its asymmetric structures, indicating that these asymmetric domain arrangements are not linked to negative cooperativity and hemiphosphorylation. Furthermore, the modeling indicated that many parameters, most notably minor amounts of ADP generated during autophosphorylation reactions or present in ATP preparations, can produce ∼50% total phosphorylation that may be mistakenly attributed to negative cooperativity. This study also establishes that the engineered covalent heterodimer provides a robust experimental system for investigating cooperativity in HK autophosphorylation and offers a useful tool for testing how symmetric or asymmetric structural features influence HK functions.

Unequal twins: Unraveling the reaction mechanism of dimeric histidine kinasesJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 295Issue 23PreviewHistidine kinases (HKs), together with their partner proteins, the response regulators (RRs), form the ubiquitous two-component systems that are global players in control and adjustment of microbial lifestyle. Although their basic function (i.e. the transfer of a phosphate group from the HK to its RR partner) is simple to articulate, deciphering the molecular details of this process has proven anything but simple, especially when quantitative aspects come into play. Bouillet et al. report a series of elegant and sophisticated experiments to quantitatively understand HK functions, clearing up several open questions and providing a new strategy for future work in the field.

HKs, usually functioning as homodimers, sense stimuli through their variable sensing domains and modulate phosphorylation levels of their cognate RRs. HKs display multiple enzyme activities, including autokinase, phosphotransferase that is catalyzed in conjunction with the RR protein, and often phosphatase activity toward the phosphorylated cognate RR. The conserved catalytic core of an HK consists of a dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain that contains the conserved histidine residue for receiving and transferring the phosphoryl group and a catalytic ATP-binding (CA) domain that contains residues critical for kinase activity. Structures of HKs and HK-RR complexes representing different enzymatic states have been captured, providing mechanistic details of HK activities.

Symmetry or asymmetry in the catalytic core domains refers to the packing of DHp helices and the relative positioning of the two CA domains. Although the phosphatase state of an HK is often symmetric, with two CA domains held at positions unfavorable for phosphorylation, the autokinase state harbors an asymmetric conformation with one CA domain in close proximity of one phosphorylatable histidine, whereas the other CA domain is located far from the other histidine. The CA domain that provides the reactive ATP and the histidine receiving the phosphoryl group can be from the same or different protomers, resulting in a cis- or a trans-phosphorylation mechanism in different HKs. Nevertheless, both mechanisms make use of similar asymmetric conformations that only allow phosphorylation of one histidine at a time (16Albanesi D. Martín M. Trajtenberg F. Mansilla M.C. Haouz A.

Such asymmetric structures are often intuitively associated with asymmetric phosphorylation, in which phosphorylation of one protomer hinders phosphorylation of the second protomer, leading to hemiphosphorylation in the extreme case, with a single phosphorylation event per dimer. For example, observation of asymmetric conformations in CpxA led to implication of hemiphosphorylation despite the experimental observation of a 70% total phosphorylation level, where the phosphorylation exceeding 50% was attributed to subunit exchange of protomers within HK dimers (17Mechaly A.E.

As structural asymmetry is repeatedly demonstrated for the kinase state, is phosphorylation asymmetry also a general trend in HKs? Asymmetric phosphorylation, or negative cooperativity, has been biochemically explored in several HKs (19Casino P. Miguel-Romero L. Marina A. Visualizing autophosphorylation in histidine kinases.Nat.

Negative cooperativity has been attributed to an exceptionally rapid reverse reaction, with transfer of the phosphoryl group from the diphosphorylated HK to ADP generating the hemiphosphorylated HK; thus, ADP has a large inhibitory effect on diphosphorylation of HK dimers. Hemiphosphorylated HKs have also been observed on native gels in studies of HK853 (19Casino P. Miguel-Romero L. Marina A. Visualizing autophosphorylation in histidine kinases.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 (24500224): 325810.1038/ncomms4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A complete diphosphorylation of HK853 dimers was not achieved unless ADP present in the reaction mixture was continuously recycled back to ATP. An even stronger negative cooperativity has been demonstrated for DesK (24Trajtenberg F. Graña M. Ruétalo N. Botti H. Buschiazzo A.

The observed phosphorylation stoichiometry of DesK was ∼0.5, and full phosphorylation was not achieved even in the presence of a coupled enzyme system that continuously converted ADP to ATP, indicating an extremely high negative cooperativity. Such extreme negative cooperativity may be uncommon for HKs because full phosphorylation at high ATP levels or in the presence of ATP regeneration has been documented for many HKs (19Casino P.

Biochemical analyses of negative cooperativity of phosphorylation often rely on deriving equilibrium constants by measuring HK phosphorylation levels across a wide range of ATP concentrations.

The initial amount of ADP, relative to that generated during the phosphorylation reaction, is nontrivial when high concentrations of ATP are used. Under such conditions, the inhibitory effect of the contaminating ADP might not be negligible, as presumed in prior analyses, and could impact interpretation of negative cooperativity. Here, we take account of the initial ADP concentration in the kinetic equilibrium modeling and show that the neglect of ADP contamination can lead to significant overestimation of negative cooperativity. We develop a strategy to examine the phosphorylation cooperativity by measuring the un-, mono-, and diphosphorylated HK dimer species using a covalently linked HK dimer. Applying this strategy to E. coli CpxA, we demonstrate that autophosphorylation of CpxA is not negatively cooperative, or asymmetric, despite the structural asymmetry. Commercial ATP is typically contaminated by its hydrolysis product ADP, and even ultrapure ATP (e.g. Sigma) contains ∼0.4% ADP (27Young C. Karbstein K. Analysis of cofactor effects on RNA helicases.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 511 (22713322): 213-23710.1016/B978-0-12-396546-2.00010-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 28Hazra S. Henderson J.N.

The exact value of ADP contamination may vary depending on the provider, lot, storage conditions, and storage time. We measured the ADP level in our ATP reagent using the NADH-coupled enzyme assay (26Tawa P. Stewart R.C. Kinetics of CheA autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation reaction.Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (8011654): 7917-792410.1021/bi00191a019Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Approximately 1% ADP was present in the ATP stock solutions (Fig. S1). In phosphorylation equilibrium assays with ATP concentrations often exceeding 1 mm, 1% ADP contamination would provide more than 10 μm ADP and could significantly impact HK phosphorylation. To assess the inhibitory effect of the contaminating ADP, we modeled the HK phosphorylation equilibrium with the simple bi-bi reaction model (Fig. 1A) that has been previously used to derive equilibrium constants and cooperativity (23Jiang P. Peliska J.A. Ninfa A.J. Asymmetry in the autophosphorylation of the two-component regulatory system transmitter protein nitrogen regulator II of Escherichia coli.Biochemistry. 2000; 39 (10819971): 5057-506510.1021/bi992921wCrossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The monophosphorylated species contains two indistinguishable forms, with phosphorylation occurring at each individual protomer. Thus, the macroscopic equilibrium constant for phosphorylation of the first His, Kma, equals twice the microscopic constant K, whereas the constant for phosphorylation of the second His, K′ma, is half K if the cooperativity constant c is equal to 1 (see details in supporting information and Fig. S2A). The steady-state phosphorylation percentages of all phosphorylatable His sites, which are often readily quantifiable by various experimental methods, such as assays with radiolabeled ATP or Phos-tag gels, were simulated at different ATP concentrations. Unsurprisingly, increasing the contaminating ADP percentage, ADP0/ATP0, has a negative impact on total phosphorylation levels (Fig. 1B). Despite a noncooperative system simulated with the c value at 1, at high ATP concentrations, ADP contamination at 2% yields a total phosphorylation level within the range of 40–60%, a range often estimated as ∼50% phosphorylation and intuitively associated with hemiphosphorylation. Clearly, a total phosphorylation level close to 50% does not indicate hemiphosphorylation or negative cooperativity, and a range of 40–60% phosphorylation can be achieved with different combinations of equilibrium constants and ATP and ADP concentrations (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2B, shaded area). Because both ADP contamination and negative cooperativity can negatively impact the total phosphorylation level, we examined whether the inhibitory effect of ADP contamination could be misinterpreted as negative cooperativity. Our simulations indicate that ATP-dependent phosphorylation profiles can be extremely similar for distinctly different scenarios, one with negative cooperativity and the other with no cooperativity but with a higher ADP contamination percentage (Fig. 1B, magenta and black dashed-dotted curves) or with a lower value of the equilibrium constant (Fig. S2C, magenta and black lines). Generally, stronger negative cooperativity causes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation to be more graded than that with no cooperativity, but such distinction can be obscured by data variations. Within the range of experimental error, different combinations of cooperativity, ADP contamination, and equilibrium constants can result in curves that are highly similar to each other (Fig. S2D) and thus prone to misinterpretation. As shown in Fig. 1C, data were simulated (black line) with no cooperativity, ADP contamination at 1% and an equilibrium constant of 0.1, a value within the same magnitude of measured constants for some HKs (23Jiang P.

Although the Turin criteria are well defined, the pathological features that could serve as diagnostic and prognostic factors remain controversial. Materials and methods Forty-nine consecutive PDTC cases were identified in a single cancer center between 2000 and 2018. We analyzed the impact of routine histopathological and immunohistochemical features and several parameters that are not routinely included in pathology reports such as the presence of atypical mitoses, the amount of necrosis, or insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA-binding protein 3 immunostaining on the survival of patients with PDTC. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Of the 49 PDTC 34 (69.4%) showed the insular pattern of growth. The median of poorly differentiated area was 95% (range, 1–100), and 30 (61.2%) patients had a predominant (>50%) insular area. The 5-year OS and DSS rates at a median follow-up of 57 months were 60.6% and 64.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that tumor size >4 cm, presence of atypical mitoses, Ki-67 >5%, and thyroglobulin (Tg)-negative immunostaining were associated with a higher risk of PDTC-related death. Atypical mitoses and Tg negativity were independent factors of worse DSS in multivariate analysis. Patients with insular and predominant insular areas showed a 3- and 6-fold higher risk of PDTC death when they displayed atypical mitoses. Conclusions In PDTC, the presence of atypical mitoses may be helpful in identifying patients with poorer outcome and worth including in pathology reports, particularly in tumors with a dominant insular pattern of growth. Additionally, the inclusion of Tg immunostaining may be considered in a prognostic context, and not only as a diagnostic feature."
https://openalex.org/W3007403662,"Recent research using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) demonstrated an association between maternal grandmother smoking in pregnancy and the autistic traits of impaired social communication and repetitive behaviour in granddaughters but not grandsons, but of paternal grandmother smoking and early development of myopia in the grandchild. Here we investigate whether grandmaternal smoking in pregnancy is associated with intolerance to loud sounds. ALSPAC collected information during the index pregnancy from the study parents on the smoking habits, social and other features of their own parents. Maternal report when the child was aged 6 and 13 included hating loud sounds; at age 11 the child was tested for volume preference for listening to music through headphones. Statistical analysis compared results for grandchildren in relation to whether a parent had been exposed in utero to maternal smoking, adjusted for their grandparents' social and demographic attributes. We hypothesised that there would be sex differences in the effects of grandmaternal prenatal smoking, based on previous intergenerational studies. For 6-year-old children maternal report of intolerance to loud noise was more likely in grandsons if the maternal grandmother had smoked [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03,1.56; P = 0.025], but less likely in girls [AOR 0.82; 95%CI 0.63,1.07] Pinteraction <0.05. If the paternal grandmother had smoked the grandchildren were less likely to be intolerant, especially girls. The objective measure of choice of volume for music through headphones showed that grandsons of both maternal and paternal smoking grandmothers were less likely to choose high volumes compared with granddaughters (P<0.05). In line with our prior hypothesis of sex differences, we showed that grandsons were more intolerant of loud sounds than granddaughters particularly at age 6, and this was confirmed by objective measures at age 11."

However, studies on sleepiness-related risks and incidents, particularly among emergency medical services (EMS) workers are limited.This study sought to investigate the prevalence of sleepiness and related workplace incidents among EMS workers.This study utilized a cross-sectional survey design on a convenient sample of 500 EMS workers from 41 EMS squads across Taiwan. Data were collected using structured online questionnaires on workplace sleepiness and related safety incidents based on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and a modified 25-item EMS Safety Inventory respectively.With a response rate of 79.8% (n = 399), 36.9% of the respondents were identified as having mild daytime sleepiness, while 39.2% of the respondents were identified as having excessive daytime sleepiness. Multivariate analysis indicated that not only was working on rotating shifts the main cause of the high ESS scores among EMS workers, but also that higher ESS scores increased their risk of sustaining a workplace injury. Furthermore, ill-at-work incidents were associated with an increased risk of workplace-related injuries.Overall, the findings indicated a correlation among working on rotation shifts, the prevalence of sleepiness, and a higher risk of workplace injury among EMS workers."
https://openalex.org/W3009035748,"Background Given their geographical proximity but differences in cultural and religious dietary customs, we hypothesize that children from the three main ethnic populations (Han, Hui, and Tibetan) residing in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau region differs in their non-iatrogenic antibiotic loads. Methods To determine the antibiotic burden of the school children unrelated to medical treatment, we quantified the antibiotic residues in morning urine samples from 92 Han, 72 Tibetan, and 85 Muslim Hui primary school children aged 8 to 12 years using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and performed correlation analysis between these data and concurrent dietary nutrition assessments. Results Sixteen of the 18 targeted antibiotics (4 macrolides, 3 β-lactams, 2 tetracyclines, 4 quinolones, 3 sulfonamides, and 2 aminoanols) were identified in the urine samples with an overall detection frequency of 58.63%. The detection frequency of the six antibiotic classes ranged from 1.61% to 32.53% with ofloxacin showing the single highest frequency (18.47%). Paired comparison analysis revealed significant differences in antibiotic distribution frequency among groups, with Tibetans having higher enrofloxacin (P = 0.015) and oxytetracycline (P = 0.021) than Han children. Norfloxacin (a human/veterinary antibiotic) was significantly higher in the Hui children than in the Han children (P = 0.024). Dietary nutrient intake assessments were comparable among participants, showing adequate levels of essential vitamins and minerals across all three ethnic groups. However, significant differences in specific foods were observed among groups, notably in lower fat consumption in the Hui group. Conclusions The introduction and accumulation of antibiotic residues in school children through non-iatrogenic routes (food or environmental sources) poses a serious potential health risk and merits closer scrutiny to determine the sources. While the exact sources of misused or overused antibiotics remains unclear, further study can potentially correlate ethnicity-specific dietary practices with the sources of contamination."
https://openalex.org/W3006781906,"Variability during spirometry can persist despite control of technical and personal factors. We postulate spirometry induces gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), which may cause variability and affect results of spirometry. Fifty-eight (58) subjects undergoing GOR investigation with oesophageal manometry and 24hr pH monitoring were recruited. Oesophageal dysmotility and GOR were assessed as part of clinical care. Subjects performed 2 sets of spirometry separated by a 10-minute rest period. The assessment of GOR during spirometry procedure (defined by a lower oesophageal pH<4) started from the first set of spirometry and concluded when the second set of spirometry was completed. We calculated variability (%) of FEV1, FVC and PEFR within each set as well as changes over 10-minutes. Twenty-six subjects (45%) recorded GOR during assessment. Of these, 23 subjects recorded GOR during the 10-minute rest period. Four subjects had GOR recorded only during spirometry tests. We did not find variability of spirometry parameters between the groups with and without GOR during spirometry procedure. However, in subjects with GOR, we found small but significant reductions of PEFR (0.5L/s, 8%, p<0.001) and FEV1 (84 mL, 3%, p = 0.048) in the second set of spirometry compared to the first spirometry set. This pilot study demonstrates that GOR can occur during and following spirometry. Presence of GOR during spirometry in this patient population caused small decreases in PEFR and FEV1 when it is repeated 10-minutes later however not increase variability in a single series of measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3008504633,"Objective The number of young adults on disability pension (DP) is increasing in European countries, creating a need to understand the related risk factors. This study aimed to determine whether adverse perinatal conditions are associated with receiving a DP early in life. Methods This longitudinal cohort study consisted of all persons (N = 453,223) born in Sweden during 1973–1977, observed from 1991 through 2010 when they were aged between 16 and 37 years. Statistics Sweden provided linked national data on the children and their parents. We used logistic regression to assess the association between perinatal health conditions (birth defect, Apgar score, and small for gestational age) and receiving a DP, adjusting for maternal education and the sex of the child. Results New recipients of DP were significantly more likely to have had a birth defect (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.74, 95% CI: 2.49–3.00), to have had low Apgar score (AOR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.77–2.52), to have been small for gestational age (AOR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.54–1.94) and to be females (AOR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.46–1.64). Higher maternal education was associated with lower odds of receiving a DP (AOR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.69–0.79) for those with high school education and (AOR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.59–0.75) for those with university education. Age-stratified analysis confirmed increased odds of receiving a DP among those with birth defects and small for gestational age, but this effect reduced with increasing age. Apgar score was significantly associated with starting to receive a DP at ages 16–18 and 19–29, but not at ages 30–33. Women had lower odds of receiving a DP at ages 16–18 (AOR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64–0.85); however, this reversed from age 19 and upwards (AOR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.41–1.67) and (AOR 2.16, 95% CI: 1.95–2.40) for the age groups of 19–29 and 30–33, respectively. Persons with high maternal education were less likely to receive a DP regardless of age at receiving a DP. Conclusion Having a birth defect was the strongest indicator of receiving a DP during early adulthood, followed by small for gestational age and low Apgar score. Overall, the effects of the studied perinatal health conditions were pronounced in those who received a DP at 16–18 years, but this effect weakened with increasing age at receiving a DP. Our findings suggest that policies and programs geared at promoting optimal health at birth might contribute to a reduction in receiving a DP."

https://openalex.org/W3008011410,"Learning synaptic weights of spiking neural network (SNN) models that can reproduce target spike trains from provided neural firing data is a central problem in computational neuroscience and spike-based computing. The discovery of the optimal weight values can be posed as a supervised learning task wherein the weights of the model network are chosen to maximize the similarity between the target spike trains and the model outputs. It is still largely unknown whether optimizing spike train similarity of highly recurrent SNNs produces weight matrices similar to those of the ground truth model. To this end, we propose flexible heuristic supervised learning rules, termed Pre-Synaptic Pool Modification (PSPM), that rely on stochastic weight updates in order to produce spikes within a short window of the desired times and eliminate spikes outside of this window. PSPM improves spike train similarity for all-to-all SNNs and makes no assumption about the post-synaptic potential of the neurons or the structure of the network since no gradients are required. We test whether optimizing for spike train similarity entails the discovery of accurate weights and explore the relative contributions of local and homeostatic weight updates. Although PSPM improves similarity between spike trains, the learned weights often differ from the weights of the ground truth model, implying that connectome inference from spike data may require additional constraints on connectivity statistics. We also find that spike train similarity is sensitive to local updates, but other measures of network activity such as avalanche distributions, can be learned through synaptic homeostasis."
