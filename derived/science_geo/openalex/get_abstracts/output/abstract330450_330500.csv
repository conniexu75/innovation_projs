https://openalex.org/W1976873738,"New data on the three major determinants of the carbon release from tropical forest clearing are used in a computer model that simulates land use change and its effects on the carbon content of vegetation and soil in order to calculate the net flux of carbon dioxide between tropical ecosystems and the atmosphere. The model also permits testing the sensitivity of the calculated flux to uncertainties in these data. The tropics were a net source of at least 0.4 x 10(15) grams but not more than 1.6 x 10(15) grams of carbon in 1980, considerably less than previous estimates. Decreases in soil organic matter were responsible for 0.1 x 10(15) to 0.3 x 10(15) grams of the release, while the burning and decay of cleared vegetation accounted for 0.3 x 10(15) to 1.3 x 10(15) grams. These estimates are lower than many previous ones because lower biomass estimates and slightly lower land clearing rates were used and because ecosystem recovery processes were included. These new estimates of the biotic release allow for the possibility of a balanced global budget given the large remaining uncertainties in the marine, terrestrial, and fossil fuel components of the carbon cycle."

Whether ""normal,"" antiferromagnetic, or superconducting, their electronic behavior differs drastically from their ordinary metallic counterparts. The physical origin of the large mass and unusual superconducting and magnetic properties is the strong coupling between the conduction electrons and the local f-electron moment fluctuations characteristic of these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2076027897,"Two years of GEOSAT altimeter observations are used to investigate the response of sea level to anomalous westerly wind bursts in the tropical Pacific Ocean before and during the 1986-87 El Niño. Sea level time series along the equator show examples of both positive and negative anomalies of 10-centimeter amplitude and 2- to 4-week time scale propagating across the Pacific with phase speeds of 2.4 to 2.8 meters per second, suggesting downwelling and upwelling Kelvin waves, respectively. A comparison of island wind observations with sea level indicates one instance (May 1986) in which a positive sea level anomaly can be related to westerly winds caused by a cross-equatorial cyclone pair in the western Pacific. This episode was followed by additional wind bursts later in the year, and finally by sustained westerlies in the western Pacific during November-December 1986, at the height of El Niño. The GEOSAT observations reveal the sea level response to these meteorological events and provide a synoptic description of the El Niño oceanographic phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2015333749,"Satellite ozone data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer from 1979 through 1986 show that recent decreases of total ozone have not been confined to the Antarctic spring season (the Antarctic ozone hole), but are global in extent. The losses are about twice the estimated uncertainty in the satellite data. The decreases are largest in middle and high latitudes and occur in all seasons of the year. The decreases for this 8-year period are comparable in magnitude to the increases observed during the 1960s. Southern Hemisphere values from 1986 are generally greater than those from 1985."
https://openalex.org/W2017963743,"Pliocene and Pleistocene fossil localities near the western shoreline of Lake Turkana, ranging in age between 1 million and 3.5 million years in age, have produced important new hominid specimens including most of a Homo erectus skeleton and a relatively complete early robust australopithecine cranium. The lacustrine, fluviatile, and terrestrial strata are designated the Nachukui Formation, which is subdivided into eight members. The distribution of sedimentary facies within the Nachukui Formation suggests that, as today, the Labur and Murua Rith ranges formed the western margin of the basin and were drained by eastward-flowing rivers that fed into the forerunner of the present lake or a major river system. There is also stratigraphic evidence for tectonic movement during the deposition of these sediments. Twenty-three of the tuffs observed in the succession occur also in the Koobi Fora Formation east of the lake and in the Shungura Formation of the lower Omo Valley and permit precise correlation among these three localities. Fortyseven fossiliferous sites from West Turkana have yielded more than 1000 specimens of 93 mammalian species. The mammalian fossils represent nine sequential assemblages that augment information about faunal and environmental change from elsewhere in the basin."

https://openalex.org/W2127286806,"A new law has been attached to the budget reconciliation bill for 1988. It directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to stop exploratory work at two of three sites already chosen as candidates for a waste repository. From now on, the investigation is to focus exclusively on a third site at Yucca Mountain, a desert area of volcanic tuff about 110 miles from Las Vegas. It will become the national burial ground for all spent reactor fuel, unless researchers find in the next 5 to 7 years that it is not environmentally fit. If the Nevada site fails to measure up, the secretary of energy is directed to return to Congress for further instructions."
https://openalex.org/W4253808972,"In the report ""Distribution and detection of positrons from an orbiting nuclear reactor"" by E. W. Hones and P. R. Higbie (28 Apr., p. 448), the following corrections should be noted. The first sentence of the caption for figure 1 should have read, ""Location of SMM (dots) and Cosmos 1176 (triangles) at the times of 21 of the most intense 511-keV gamma events recorded by SMM during the 29 April to 2 September 1980 operating period."" The first sentence of the caption for figure 3 should have read, ""Estimated differential energy spectrum positrons escaping from Cosmos 1176 per joule of fission energy."" On page 450, the second sentence of the first full paragraph should have referred to event 5, not event 59."
