https://openalex.org/W3002770500,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful approach for reconstructing cellular differentiation trajectories. However, inferring both the state and direction of differentiation is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple, yet robust, determinant of developmental potential-the number of expressed genes per cell-and leverage this measure of transcriptional diversity to develop a computational framework (CytoTRACE) for predicting differentiation states from scRNA-seq data. When applied to diverse tissue types and organisms, CytoTRACE outperformed previous methods and nearly 19,000 annotated gene sets for resolving 52 experimentally determined developmental trajectories. Additionally, it facilitated the identification of quiescent stem cells and revealed genes that contribute to breast tumorigenesis. This study thus establishes a key RNA-based feature of developmental potential and a platform for delineation of cellular hierarchies."

A promising approach to quantum sensing relies on entangling a well-controlled system (the sensor) to the system of interest to detect quanta of excitations in the latter. By entangling a superconducting qubit with a ferrimagnetic crystal, Lachance-Quirion et al. demonstrate that they can detect a quantum of magnetic excitation (a magnon) within the sample. The demonstration of a high-efficiency single-magnon detector will be useful for quantum sensing as well as an active component of hybrid quantum systems and should find a wide range of applications in quantum technologies.

How cells cope with concentration fluctuations when precision is important is unclear. Klosin et al. used a combination of theoretical and experimental work to demonstrate that phase-separated compartments can effectively reduce protein concentration noise in cells (see the Perspective by Riback and Brangwynne). The results suggest that phase separation provides a mechanism to enhance the robustness of biological systems. Science , this issue p. 464 ; see also p. 364"

Trevino et al. avoided this problem by developing three-dimensional organoid models of human forebrain development and examining chromatin accessibility and gene expression at the single-cell level. From this analysis, they matched developmental profiles between the organoid and fetal samples, identified transcription factor binding profiles, and predicted how transcription factors are linked to cortical development. The researchers were able to correlate the expression of neurodevelopmental disease risk loci and genes with specific cell types during development. Science , this issue p. eaay1645"

Yuan et al. adsorbed water and carbon monoxide (CO) on a reconstructed nanocrystalline anatase titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) surface that has protruding TiO 3 ridges every four unit cells, which provide regions of distinct contrast. Water adsorption on this surface during environmental TEM experiments led to the formation of twinned protrusions.

https://openalex.org/W3001353383,"Shaping the early amniote embryo Gastrulation is an essential step in development in which the internal tissues of the body are set apart. In birds and mammals, a similar cascade of molecular events is known to specify embryonic territories, but how they are physically remodeled has remained elusive. Working with avian embryos, Saadaoui et al. identified a cable that encircles the embryo as the engine of gastrulation and described the collective cell movements as similar to the motion of a fluid. One side of this contractile ring pulls more strongly than the other, entraining the large-scale tissue movements that shape the early body plan. The embryo margin, previously known to function in molecular regulation, thus emerges as a dual mechanical and molecular organizer of development. Science , this issue p. 453"

A hydrophobic cuticle around the embryo protects it from catastrophic water loss during the early days of growth. Doll et al. identified a back-and-forth signaling pathway that ensures an intact cuticle. The precursor of a signaling peptide is made in the embryo and transferred to the endosperm, where it is processed into an active form. The activated peptide diffuses back into the embryo to activate receptor-like kinases that drive cuticle development. Serve and return continues until all leaks in the cuticle are filled in and the peptide can no longer cross the barrier. Science , this issue p. 431"

Unfortunately, stress responses that mitigate disturbances in proteostasis, such as the unfolded protein response of the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER), become defunct with age. In this work, we expressed the constitutively active UPRER transcription factor, XBP-1s, in a subset of astrocyte-like glia, which extended the life span in Caenorhabditis elegans Glial XBP-1s initiated a robust cell nonautonomous activation of the UPRER in distal cells and rendered animals more resistant to protein aggregation and chronic ER stress. Mutants deficient in neuropeptide processing and secretion suppressed glial cell nonautonomous induction of the UPRER and life-span extension. Thus, astrocyte-like glial cells play a role in regulating organismal ER stress resistance and longevity."
https://openalex.org/W3001999014,"Interneurons control brain arousal states The underlying circuit mechanisms coordinating brain arousal and motor activity are poorly understood. Liu et al. found that glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 (GAD2)–expressing, but not parvalbumin-expressing, interneurons in a part of the brain known as the substantia nigra promote sleep (see the Perspective by Wisden and Franks). Parvalbuminergic neurons fire at higher rates in states of high motor activity, and their activation increases movement termination consistent with the function of the substantia nigra in suppressing unwanted movements during action selection. By contrast, GAD2 neurons are preferentially active in states of low motor activity. In addition to motor suppression, their activation powerfully enhances the transition from quiet wakefulness to sleep, which differ mainly in the arousal level rather than motor behavior. GAD2 interneurons thus provide general suppression of both motor activity and brain arousal to promote states of quiescence. Science , this issue p. 440 ; see also p. 366"

https://openalex.org/W3001218508,"Background Anaemia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women and children worldwide. Because deficiencies in essential micronutrients such as iron, folate and vitamin B12 prior to and during gestation increase a woman’s risk of being anaemic, adequate dietary intake of such nutrients is vital during this important phase in life. However, information on the dietary micronutrient intakes of pregnant women in Ghana, particularly of those resident in rural areas is scanty. Thus, this study aimed to assess anaemia prevalence and dietary micronutrient intakes in pregnant women in urban and rural areas in Ghana. Methods A comparative cross sectional study design involving 379 pregnant women was used to assess the prevalence of anaemia and low intake of dietary nutrients in pregnant women living in rural and urban areas in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Anaemia status and mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) were used as proxy for maternal nutritional status. Haemoglobin measurements were used to determine anaemia prevalence and the dietary diversity of the women were determined with a 24-hour dietary recall and a food frequency questionnaire. Results Overall, anaemia was present in 56.5% of the study population. Anaemia prevalence was higher among rural residents than urban dwellers. Majority of the respondents had inadequate intakes of iron, zinc, folate, calcium and vitamin A. The mean dietary diversity score (DDS) of the study population from the first 24-hour recall was 3.81 ± 0.7. Of the 379 women, 28.8% met the minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W). The independent predictors of haemoglobin concentration were, gestational age, maternal age and dietary diversity score. Such that respondents with low DDS were more likely to be anaemic than those with high DDS (OR = 1.795, p = 0.022, 95% CI: 1.086 to 2.967). Conclusions A large percentage of pregnant women still have insufficient dietary intakes of essential nutrients required to support the nutritional demands during pregnancy. Particularly, pregnant women resident in rural areas require interventions such as nutrition education on the selection and preparation of diversified meals to mitigate the effects of undernutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3002698994,"We investigated the association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and gastrointestinal tract cancer in the general population. Retrospective data on individuals aged ≥20 years who received healthcare checkups from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009 were analyzed using the National Health Insurance Database in Korea. NAFLD was defined based on the fatty liver index (FLI ≥60). The primary outcome was newly diagnosed esophageal, stomach, or colorectal cancer using ICD-10 codes during follow-up until 31 December 2017. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Among 8,120,674 subjects, 936,159 adults (11.5%) were identified as having NAFLD. Their mean age was 46.7 ± 14.1 years, and 52.1% were male. During the follow-up period (7.2 years), 3,792 esophageal, 57,292 stomach and 68,769 colorectal cancer cases were identified. FLI ≥60 was significantly associated with the development of esophageal (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.88-2.35), stomach (HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.14-1.22), and colon cancer (HR, 1.23, 95% CI 1.19-1.26) after multivariable adjustment. Compared to subjects without NAFLD, all-cause mortality in patients with esophageal (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.28-1.67), stomach (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.18-1.34), and colorectal cancer (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.10-1.22) was significantly increased in subjects with NAFLD (FLI ≥60). NAFLD defined using FLI was a good predictive indicator for GI tract malignancy and all-cause mortality in the general population. Subjects with NAFLD are needed for active surveillance of esophageal, stomach, and colorectal cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3105175308,"Superluminous supernovae radiate up to 100 times more energy than normal supernovae. The origin of this energy and the nature of their stellar progenitors are poorly understood. We identify neutral iron lines in the spectrum of one such transient, SN 2006gy, and show that they require a large mass of iron (>~0.3 Msun) expanding at 1500 km/s. We demonstrate that a model of a standard Type Ia supernova hitting a shell of circumstellar material produces a light curve and late-time iron-dominated spectrum that match SN 2006gy. In such a scenario, common envelope evolution of the progenitor system can synchronize envelope ejection and supernova explosion and may explain these bright transients."
https://openalex.org/W3002403926,"The shallow tidal and freshwater coastal wetlands adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon provide a vital nursery and feeding complex that supports the life cycles of marine and freshwater fish, important native vegetation and vital bird habitat. Urban and agricultural development threaten these wetlands, with many of the coastal wetlands becoming lost or changed due to the construction of artificial barriers (e.g. bunds, roads, culverts and floodgates). Infestation by weeds has become a major issue within many of the wetlands modified (bunded) for ponded pasture growth last century. A range of expensive chemical and mechanical control methods have been used in an attempt to restore some of these coastal wetlands, with limited success. This study describes an alternative approach to those methods, investigating the impact of tidal reinstatement after bund removal on weed infestation, associated changes in water quality, and fish biodiversity, in the Boolgooroo lagoon region of the Mungalla wetlands, East of Ingham in North Queensland. High resolution remote sensing, electrofishing and in-water logging was used to track changes over time– 1 year before and 4 years after removal of an earth bund. With tides only penetrating the wetland a few times yearly, gross changes towards a more natural system occurred within a relatively short timeframe, leading to a major reduction in infestation of olive hymenachne, water hyacinth and salvina, reappearance of native vegetation, improvements in water quality, and a tripling of fish diversity. Weed abundance and water quality does appear to oscillate however, dependent on summer rainfall, as changes in hydraulic pressure stops or allows tidal ingress (fresh/saline cycling). With an estimated 30% of coastal wetlands bunded in the Great Barrier Reef region, a passive remediation method such as reintroduction of tidal flow by removal of an earth bund or levee could provide a more cost effective and sustainable means of controlling freshwater weeds and improving coastal water quality into the future."
https://openalex.org/W3002486005,"Tau aggregation underlies neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies. We and others have proposed that transcellular propagation of pathology is mediated by Tau prions, which are ordered protein assemblies that faithfully replicate in vivo and cause specific biological effects. The prion model predicts the release of aggregates from a first-order cell and subsequent uptake into a second-order cell. The assemblies then serve as templates for their own replication, a process termed “seeding.” We have previously observed that heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface mediate the cellular uptake of Tau aggregates. This interaction is blocked by heparin, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan. Indeed, heparin-like molecules, or heparinoids, have previously been proposed as a treatment for PrP prion disorders. However, heparin is not ideal for managing chronic neurodegeneration, because it is difficult to synthesize in defined sizes, may have poor brain penetration because of its negative charge, and is a powerful anticoagulant. Therefore, we sought to generate an oligosaccharide that would bind Tau and block its cellular uptake and seeding, without exhibiting anticoagulation activity. We created a compound, SN7–13, from pentasaccharide units and tested it in a range of assays that measured direct binding of Tau to glycosaminoglycans and inhibition of Tau uptake and seeding in cells. SN7–13 does not inhibit coagulation, binds Tau with low nanomolar affinity, and inhibits cellular Tau aggregate propagation similarly to standard porcine heparin. This synthetic heparinoid could facilitate the development of agents to treat tauopathy. Tau aggregation underlies neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies.

Taken together, GAGs may be a promising therapeutic target to inhibit the progression of pathology in tauopathies and other neurodegenerative disorders. Because of its high molecular mass and charge, anticoagulation properties, and the associated risk of hemorrhage, heparin is not suitable for chronic administration to treat neurodegeneration. We thus sought to generate a low-molecular-weight heparinoid that potently inhibits Tau uptake and intracellular seeding and lacks anticoagulation activity. We used a pentasaccharide analog of fondaparinux, a low-molecular-weight anticoagulant, as the starting molecule for the synthesis of SN7–13 (Fig. 1). Fondaparinux binds antithrombin (10Petitou M.

We found that replacing N-sulfate moieties with “linkable linkers” retained Tau binding and inhibitory activities similar to heparin (Figure 1, Figure 2). We linked several pentasaccharides by carbon chains (Figure 1, Figure 2), thereby extending the GAG length without increasing the overall charge of the molecule. We generated and tested seven series of compounds. The final product was SN7–13 (Figure 1, Figure 2), a polydisperse compound composed of 2–4 pentasaccharides with a molecular mass from 2.5 to 8 kDa. This molecular mass is significantly lower than the average molecular mass of standard heparin, which ranges from 3 to 30 kDa (26Hemker H.C. A century of heparin: past, present and future.J. Thromb.

Like heparin, SN7–13 did not affect the prothrombin time (PT). However, although heparin dose-dependently increased the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) at therapeutic concentrations, SN7–13 had no activity, even at high concentrations (100 μg/ml).Table 1SN7–13 does not affect PTT or PT Open table in a new tab We used a biolayer interferometry (BLI) kinetic binding assay (Octet, FortéBio) to analyze binding of Tau monomer to SN7–13 compared with heparin (Fig. 3 and Table 2). We biotinylated Tau monomer and immobilized it on super streptavidin biosensors, which were subsequently exposed to serial dilutions of heparin or SN7–13. Analysis of the binding kinetics indicated that heparin bound Tau with very high avidity, with an apparent KD of 60 ± 30 pm (Fig. 3A). The interaction had a fast on rate (≈ 9 × 105m−1 s−1) and a slow off rate (≈ 6 × 10−5m−1 s−1). In comparison, SN7–13 bound to Tau with an apparent KD = 2 ± 1 nm (Fig. 3B). The interaction had a fast on rate (≈ 1.6 × 105m−1 s−1 and a slow off rate (≈3.1 × 10−4m−1 s−1), qualitatively similar to heparin. In summary, SN7–13 demonstrated high binding efficiency for Tau, albeit slightly weaker than heparin.Table 2Results of biolayer inferometry kinetic assay for binding of Tau to heparin and SN7–13Kinetic variableHeparinSN7–13KD60 ± 30 pm2 ± 1 nmkon (m−1 s−1)9 × 105 (± 2 × 105)1.6 × 105 (± 0.9 × 105)koff (s−1)6 × 10−5 (± 4 × 10−5)3.1 × 10−4 (± 0.66 × 10−4) Open table in a new tab We have previously observed that heparin prevents the binding of Tau to HSPGs on the cell surface, blocking aggregate uptake via HSPG-mediated macropinocytosis (3Holmes B.B.

To test the efficacy of SN7–13, we labeled recombinant Tau fibrils with Alexa 647 dye and incubated them with HEK293T cells in culture for 4 h, titrating concentrations of heparin and SN7–13 (Fig. 4A). We quantified aggregate uptake by measuring the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) per cell using flow cytometry (3Holmes B.B. DeVos S.L. Kfoury N. Li M. Jacks R. Yanamandra K. Ouidja M.O.

Heparin reduced Tau uptake by ∼50% even at the lowest concentration tested (0.2 μg/ml). Higher concentrations of heparin decreased Tau uptake virtually to zero. SN7–13 had slightly lower potency but inhibited uptake similarly to heparin. A growing number of studies suggest that Tau oligomers may play an important role in Tau pathology (13Wang P. Lo Cascio F.

We therefore used established protocols to purify oligomeric assemblies (31Mirbaha H. Holmes B.B. Sanders D.W. Bieschke J. Diamond M.I.

We sonicated labeled fibrils to create fragments and used SEC to purify oligomeric assemblies of defined sizes (3-mer, ∼10-mer, and ∼20-mer), with which we incubated with cultured HEK293T cells. Heparin and SN7–13 both inhibited oligomer uptake (Fig. 4B). Multiple pathways for cellular Tau uptake and downstream pathways have been proposed (1Stopschinski B.E. Diamond M.I.

Therefore, we tested whether SN7–13 blocks Tau seeding in a well-characterized “biosensor” cell line. These cells stably express the Tau repeat domain (RD) containing the disease-associated mutation P301S, tagged with CFP or YFP (28Furman J.L. Holmes B.B. Diamond M.I.

When exposed to extracellular Tau fibrils, Tau aggregates bind to the cell surface, trigger their own uptake, and induce intracellular aggregation of Tau RD-CFP/YFP, bringing the fluorophores in close proximity and enabling FRET. We used FRET to measure intracellular seeding by flow cytometry. We exposed Tau fibrils to heparin or SN7–13 for 2 h prior to addition to the biosensor cells. These were incubated for 72 h and harvested for flow cytometry. Both heparin and SN7–13 dose-dependently reduced seeding, with similar potency (Fig. 5A). We next tested effects on oligomeric assemblies. We purified assemblies (3-mer, ∼10-mer, and ∼20-mer) as above and incubated them with biosensors along with heparin (200 μg/ml) or SN7–13 (20 and 200 μg/ml). Both compounds inhibited seeding by these species as efficiently as they inhibited seeding by fibrils (Fig. 5B). HEK293T cells might have different HSPG content than neurons, and thus we tested whether SN7–13 would inhibit Tau uptake in primary cultured neurons. We isolated mouse hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 17.5 CD1 mice and cultured them in 96-well plates with 30,000 neurons/well. Between DIV 7 and 14, we exposed them to labeled Tau fibrils for 16 h and quantified Tau uptake by measuring the MFI via flow cytometry. Heparin and SN7–13 both dose-dependently reduced Tau uptake (Fig. 6), consistent with a common mode of HSPG binding in both cell types. We have previously studied the progressive Tau seeding activity that develops in a transgenic mouse line (PS19) in which 1N4R human Tau containing the disease-associated mutation (P301S) is driven by the PrP promoter (29Holmes B.B.

https://openalex.org/W3001207146,"Recent protests by athletes focused on raising awareness of social issues and injustices, such as the Black Lives Matter protests led by Colin Kaepernick of the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers, have generated a great deal of attention and debate within society. Notably, the protests conducted by these players before games in the 2016 and 2017 seasons became such a sensational topic, that extraordinary amounts of attention was paid to it by the media, consumers, and even politicians who often denounced the players as being unpatriotic. Against this backdrop, the current research examines whether fluctuations in attendance at National Football League games are associated with explicit attitudes towards race, implicit racial prejudice, and racial animus within a population. Specifically, using multiple measures of racial attitudes as part of an econometric model estimating attendance at games, the results suggest that having a higher level of implicit bias in a market leads to a decline in consumer interest in attending games. Additionally, using interaction effects, it is found that while protests generally reduced the negative effects of implicit bias on attendance, markets with lower levels of implicit bias actually had greater declines of attendance during the protests. From this, the current study advances the understanding of racial attitudes and racial animus, and its impact on consumer behavior at the regional level. That is, this research highlights that racial sentiments in a local market were able to predict changes in market behaviors, suggesting that race relations can have wide reaching impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3001191030,"Reduced representation (RRL) sequencing approaches (e.g., RADSeq, genotyping by sequencing) require decisions about how much to invest in genome coverage and sequencing depth, as well as choices of values for adjustable bioinformatics parameters. To empirically explore the importance of these “simple” methodological decisions, we generated two independent sequencing libraries for the same 142 individual lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) using a nextRAD RRL approach: (1) a larger number of loci at low sequencing depth based on a 9mer (library A); and (2) fewer loci at higher sequencing depth based on a 10mer (library B). The fish were selected from populations with different levels of expected genetic subdivision. Each library was analyzed using the STACKS pipeline followed by three types of population structure assessment (FST, DAPC and ADMIXTURE) with iterative increases in the stringency of sequencing depth and missing data requirements, as well as more specific a priori population maps. Library B was always able to resolve strong population differentiation in all three types of assessment regardless of the selected parameters, largely due to retention of more loci in analyses. In contrast, library A produced more variable results; increasing the minimum sequencing depth threshold (-m) resulted in a reduced number of retained loci, and therefore lost resolution at high -m values for FST and ADMIXTURE, but not DAPC. When detecting fine population differentiation, the population map influenced the number of loci and missing data, which generated artefacts in all downstream analyses tested. Similarly, when examining fine scale population subdivision, library B was robust to changing parameters but library A lost resolution depending on the parameter set. We used library B to examine actual subdivision in our study populations. All three types of analysis found complete subdivision among populations in Lake Huron, ON and Dore Lake, SK, Canada using 10,640 SNP loci. Weak population subdivision was detected in Lake Huron with fish from sites in the north-west, Search Bay, North Point and Hammond Bay, showing slight differentiation. Overall, we show that apparently simple decisions about library construction and bioinformatics parameters can have important impacts on the interpretation of population subdivision. Although potentially more costly on a per-locus basis, early investment in striking a balance between the number of loci and sequencing effort is well worth the reduced genomic coverage for population genetics studies. More conservative stringency settings on STACKS parameters lead to a final dataset that was more consistent and robust when examining both weak and strong population differentiation. Overall, we recommend that researchers approach “simple” methodological decisions with caution, especially when working on non-model species for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W3001257603,"Patients with the mesenchymal subtype colorectal cancer (CRC) have a poor prognosis, in particular patients with stroma-rich tumors and aberrant SMAD4 expression. We hypothesized that interactions between SMAD4-deficient CRC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts provide a biological explanation. In transwell invasion assays, fibroblasts increased the invasive capacity of SMAD4-deficient HT29 CRC cells, but not isogenic SMAD4-proficient HT29 cells. A TGF-β/BMP-specific array showed BMP2 upregulation by fibroblasts upon stimulation with conditioned medium from SMAD4-deficient CRC cells, while also stimulating their invasion. In a mouse model for experimental liver metastasis, the co-injection of fibroblasts increased metastasis formation of SMAD4-deficient CRC cells (p = 0.02) but not that of SMAD4-proficient CRC cells. Significantly less metastases were seen in mice co-injected with BMP2 knocked-down fibroblasts. Fibroblast BMP2 expression seemed to be regulated by TRAIL, a factor overexpressed in SMAD4-deficient CRC cells. In a cohort of 146 stage III CRC patients, we showed that patients with a combination of high stromal BMP2 expression and the loss of tumor SMAD4 expression had a significantly poorer overall survival (HR 2.88, p = 0.04). Our results suggest the existence of a reciprocal loop in which TRAIL from SMAD4-deficient CRC cells induces BMP2 in fibroblasts, which enhances CRC invasiveness and metastasis."

To examine the function of SURF4 in vivo, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to generate mice with germline loss-of-function mutations in Surf4. Heterozygous Surf4+/- mice exhibit grossly normal appearance, behavior, body weight, fecundity, and organ development, with no significant alterations in circulating plasma levels of PCSK9, apolipoprotein B, or total cholesterol, and a detectable accumulation of intrahepatic apoliprotein B. Homozygous Surf4-/- mice exhibit embryonic lethality, with complete loss of all Surf4-/- offspring between embryonic days 3.5 and 9.5. In contrast to the milder murine phenotypes associated with deficiency of known SURF4 cargoes, the embryonic lethality of Surf4-/- mice implies the existence of additional SURF4 cargoes or functions that are essential for murine early embryonic development."

DFUs are colonized by complex microbial communities, and infection is one of the most common reasons for diabetes-related hospitalizations and amputations. In this study, we examined how DFU microbiomes respond to initial sharp debridement and offloading and how the initial composition associates with 4 week healing outcomes. We employed 16S rRNA next generation sequencing to perform microbial profiling on 50 samples collected from 10 patients with vascularized neuropathic DFUs. Debrided wound samples were obtained at initial visit and after one week from two DFU locations, wound bed and wound edge. Samples of the foot skin outside of the wounds were also collected for comparison. We showed that DFU wound beds are colonized by a greater number of distinct bacterial phylotypes compared to the wound edge or skin outside the wound. However, no significant microbiome diversity changes occurred at the wound sites after one week of standard care. Finally, increased initial abundance of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC), especially Peptoniphilus (p < 0.05; n = 5 subjects), was associated with impaired healing; thus, GPAC’s abundance could be a predictor of the wound-healing outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3003078177,"The diversity of living cells, in both size and internal complexity, calls for imaging methods with adaptable spatial resolution. Soft x-ray tomography (SXT) is a three-dimensional imaging technique ideally suited to visualizing and quantifying the internal organization of single cells of varying sizes in a near-native state. The achievable resolution of the soft x-ray microscope is largely determined by the objective lens, but switching between objectives is extremely time-consuming and typically undertaken only during microscope maintenance procedures. Since the resolution of the optic is inversely proportional to the depth of focus, an optic capable of imaging the thickest cells is routinely selected. This unnecessarily limits the achievable resolution in smaller cells and eliminates the ability to obtain high-resolution images of regions of interest in larger cells. Here, we describe developments to overcome this shortfall and allow selection of microscope optics best suited to the specimen characteristics and data requirements. We demonstrate that switchable objective capability advances the flexibility of SXT to enable imaging cells ranging in size from bacteria to yeast and mammalian cells without physically modifying the microscope, and we demonstrate the use of this technology to image the same specimen with both optics."

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess corticospinal excitability via area under the motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curve before and following training. Corticospinal excitability was unchanged after HI and MOD, suggesting no effect of acute exercise on neuroplasticity as measured via TMS in sedentary, young individuals. Repeated bouts of exercise, i.e., physical training, may be required to induce short-term changes in corticospinal excitability in previously sedentary individuals."

We present pyKNEEr, a framework for open and reproducible research on femoral knee cartilage from MR images. pyKNEEr is written in python, uses Jupyter notebook as a user interface, and is available on GitHub with a GNU GPLv3 license. It is composed of three modules: 1) image preprocessing to standardize spatial and intensity characteristics; 2) femoral knee cartilage segmentation for intersubject, multimodal, and longitudinal acquisitions; and 3) analysis of cartilage morphology and relaxometry. Each module contains one or more Jupyter notebooks with narrative, code, visualizations, and dependencies to reproduce computational environments. pyKNEEr facilitates transparent image-based research of femoral knee cartilage because of its ease of installation and use, and its versatility for publication and sharing among researchers. Finally, due to its modular structure, pyKNEEr favors code extension and algorithm comparison. We tested our reproducible workflows with experiments that also constitute an example of transparent research with pyKNEEr, and we compared pyKNEEr performances to existing algorithms in literature review visualizations. We provide links to executed notebooks and executable environments for immediate reproducibility of our findings."
https://openalex.org/W3002681795,"Campylobacter jejuni infection is one of the most frequently reported foodborne bacterial diseases worldwide. The main transmission route of these microorganisms to humans is consumption of contaminated food, especially of chicken origin. The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic relatedness of C. jejuni from chicken sources (feces, carcasses, and meat) and from humans with diarrhea as well as to subtype the isolates to gain better insight into their population structure present in Poland. C. jejuni were genotyped using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and sequence types (STs) were assigned in the MLST database. Among 602 isolates tested, a total of 121 different STs, including 70 (57.9%) unique to the isolates' origin, and 32 STs that were not present in the MLST database were identified. The most prevalent STs were ST464 and ST257, with 58 (9.6%) and 52 (8.6%) C. jejuni isolates, respectively. Isolates with some STs (464, 6411, 257, 50) were shown to be common in chickens, whereas others (e.g. ST21 and ST572) were more often identified among human C. jejuni. It was shown that of 47 human sequence types, 26 STs (106 isolates), 23 STs (102 isolates), and 29 STs (100 isolates) were also identified in chicken feces, meat, and carcasses, respectively. These results, together with the high and similar proportional similarity indexes (PSI) calculated for C. jejuni isolated from patients and chickens, may suggest that human campylobacteriosis was associated with contaminated chicken meat or meat products or other kinds of food cross-contaminated with campylobacters of chicken origin. The frequency of various sequence types identified in the present study generally reflects of the prevalence of STs in other countries which may suggest that C. jejuni with some STs have a global distribution, while other genotypes may be more restricted to certain countries."
https://openalex.org/W3001095453,"Research on the sustainable development of the marine economy has conventionally revolved around the relationship between efficiency and development. However, most studies have neglected examining how excessive marine resource inputs under certain conditions may lead to resource congestion that restricts output efficiency and sustainable development. To fill this research gap, we optimized an index system to evaluate the input level of marine resources. Using the data of 11 coastal provinces and cities in China from 2000 to 2016, we calculated the congestion of marine resources and analyzed its spatiotemporal evolution and primary influencing factors. Finally, we separated the inefficiency driven by congestion from pure technical inefficiency. The results showed the following: (1) Grave, long-term marine resource congestion does exist in China, and it has evolved from fast to slow, strong to weak, and agglomeration to dispersion; (2) Congestion in the coastal areas has gradually weakened from north to south, and the center of gravity has experienced a shift from the center of China toward the north; (3) Marine resource congestion is mainly affected by the input of resource and capital, resource endowment, and industrial structure; (4) Factors leading to inefficiencies include resource congestion and long-term pure technical inefficiency. By combining congestion and efficiency, we produce values for studying inefficiency and the sustainable development of the marine economy, with the benefit of providing targeted strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3002103777,"Peromyscus leucopus (the white-footed mouse) is a known reservoir of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Sampling of white-footed mice allows for year-round B. burgdorferi surveillance as well as opportunities to establish the diversity of the different variants in a geographic region. This study explores the prevalence of B. burgdorferi infections in the tissues of white-footed mice, investigates the correlations between B. burgdorferi infected tissues, and determines the optimum field methods for surveillance of B. burgdorferi in P. leucopus. A total of 90 mice and 573 tissues (spleen, liver, ear, tongue, tail, heart, and kidney) were screened via nested PCR for B. burgdorferi infections. A large number of infections were found in the 90 mice as well as multiple infections within individual mice. Infections in a single mouse tissue (spleen, liver, ear, tongue and tail) were predictive of concurrent infection in other tissues of the same mouse at a statistically significant level. Ear tissue accounted for 68.4% of detected infections, which increased to 78.9% of the infected mice with the inclusion of tail samples. The use of ear punch or tail snip samples (used individually or in tandem) have multiple advantages over current Lyme disease ecological studies and surveillance methodologies, including lower associated costs, minimization of delays, year-round B. burgdorferi testing opportunities, as well as longitudinal monitoring of B. burgdorferi in defined geographic regions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, personal prevention measures are currently the most effective way to reduce Lyme disease transmission to humans. Thus, the identification and monitoring of environmental reservoirs to inform at-risk populations remains a priority. The sampling methods proposed in this study provide a reasonable estimate of B. burgdorferi in white-footed mice in a timely and cost-effective manner."
https://openalex.org/W3002365172,"The olfactory pathway integrates the odor information required to generate correct behavioral responses. To address how changes of serotonin signaling in two contralaterally projecting, serotonin-immunoreactive deutocerebral neurons impacts key odorant attraction in Drosophila melanogaster, we selectively alter serotonin signaling using the serotonin transporter with mutated serotonin binding sites in these neurons and analyzed the consequence on odorant-guided food seeking. The expression of the mutated serotonin transporter selectively changed the odorant attraction in an odorant-specific manner. The shift in attraction was not influenced by more up-stream serotonergic mechanisms mediating behavioral inhibition. The expression of the mutated serotonin transporter in CSD neurons did not influence other behaviors associated with food seeking such as olfactory learning and memory or food consumption. We provide evidence that the change in the attraction by serotonin transporter function might be achieved by increased serotonin signaling and by different serotonin receptors. The 5-HT1B receptor positively regulated the attraction to low and negatively regulated the attraction to high concentrations of acetic acid. In contrast, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors negatively regulated the attraction in projection neurons to high acetic acid concentrations. These results provide insights into how serotonin signaling in two serotonergic neurons selectively regulates the behavioral response to key odorants during food seeking."
https://openalex.org/W3002131486,"The cranium is an anatomically complex structure. One source of its complexity is due to its modular organization. Cranial modules are distinct and partially independent units that interact substantially during ontogeny thus generating morphological integration. Artificial Cranial Deformation (ACD) occurs when the human skull is intentionally deformed, through the use of different deforming devices applied to the head while it is developing. Hence, ACD provides an interesting example to assess the degree to which biomechanical perturbations of the developing neurocranium impact on the degree of morphological integration in the skull as a whole. The main objective of this study was to assess how ACD affects the morphological integration of the skull. This was accomplished by comparing a sample of non-deformed crania and two sets of deformed crania (i.e. antero-posterior and oblique). Both developmental and static modularity and integration were assessed through Generalized Procrustes Analysis by considering the symmetric and asymmetric components of variation in adults, using 3D landmark coordinates as raw data. The presence of two developmental modules (i.e. viscero and neurocranium) in the skull was tested. Then, in order to understand how ACD affects morphological integration, the covariation pattern between the neuro and viscerocranium was examined in antero-posterior, oblique and non-deformed cranial categories using Partial Least-Squares. The main objective of this study was to assess how ACD affects the morphological integration of the skull. This was accomplished by comparing a sample of deformed (i.e. antero-posterior and oblique) and non-deformed crania. Hence, differences in integration patterns were compared between groups. The obtained results support the modular organization of the human skull in the two analyzed modules. The integration analyses show that the oblique ACD style differentially affects the static morphological integration of the skull by increasing the covariance between neuro and viscerocranium in a more constrained way than in antero-posterior and non-deformed skulls. In addition, the antero-posterior ACD style seems to affect the developmental integration of the skull by directing the covariation pattern in a more defined manner as compared to the other cranial categories."
https://openalex.org/W3003115753,"Temperate grasslands are one of the most altered ecosystems on Earth. Consequently, conservation of important characteristics of such ecosystems (e.g., biodiversity) is uncertain even within grasslands that have been protected. Invasion by non-native plants is considered a primary threat to intact grasslands. Here, we evaluated native and non-native vegetation composition change over seven years in the largest Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass remnant. We sampled 124 permanent plots across the Zumwalt Prairie Preserve (northeastern Oregon, USA) twice, seven years apart. With data collected from three grassland community types (xeric prairie, mesic prairie, old fields), we asked: (1) how has species composition changed over time; (2) which species showed the greatest changes in abundance; and (3) how did abundance of Ventenata dubia (the most abundant non-native species) relate to patterns of native and non-native plant abundance? Vegetation composition changed in all three plant communities. Ventenata dubia, an annual non-native grass: (1) became the third most dominant species across the study area; (2) was the only non-native that increased in abundance substantially in all three communities; and (3) was negatively related to native perennial forb cover. Relative cover of non-native species decreased in old fields concomitant with increases in native bunchgrass (Festuca idahoensis) and V. dubia cover. Increased cover of native perennial grasses and non-native annual grasses in old fields were associated with loss of bare ground, but not with reductions in non-native perennial grass cover. Native species dominated in the mesic prairie; however, non-native cover (particularly V. dubia) increased (mean cover increased from 3 to 10%) while mean native perennial forb cover decreased (from 30 to 25%) over time. Continued shifts towards non-native annual grass dominance coupled with potentially declining native perennial forbs, may challenge conservation efforts in one of the last large tracts of Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie."
https://openalex.org/W3002024512,"Motor learning and compensatory movement are important aspects of prosthesis training yet relatively little quantitative evidence supports our current understanding of how motor control and compensation develop in the novel body-powered prosthesis user. The goal of this study is to assess these aspects of prosthesis training through functional, kinematic, and kinetic analyses using a within-subject paradigm compared across two training time points. The joints evaluated include the left and right shoulders, torso, and right elbow. Six abled-bodied subjects (age 27 ± 3) using a body-powered bypass prosthesis completed the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test and the targeted Box and Blocks Test after five training sessions and again after ten sessions. Significant differences in movement parameters included reduced times to complete tasks, reduced normalized jerk for most joints and tasks, and more variable changes in efficiency and compensation parameters for individual tasks and joints measured as range of motion, maximum angle, and average moment. Normalized jerk, joint specific path length, range of motion, maximum angle, and average moment are presented for the first time in this unique training context and for this specific device type. These findings quantitatively describe numerous aspects of motor learning and control in able-bodied subjects that may be useful in guiding future rehabilitation and training of body-powered prosthesis users."
https://openalex.org/W3001562442,"High-density lipoprotein (HDL), a well-known atheroprotective factor, can be converted to proatherogenic particles in chronic inflammation. HDL-targeted therapeutic strategy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently under development. This study aims to assess the role of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) in abnormal HDL and its related disorders in scavenger receptor class B type I deficient (SR-BI−/−) mice. First, we demonstrated that MsrA overexpression attenuated ROS level and inflammation in HepG2 cells. For the in vivo study, SR-BI−/− mice were intravenously injected with lentivirus to achieve hepatic MsrA overexpression. High-level hepatic MsrA significantly reduced the plasma free cholesterol contents, improved HDL functional proteins apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI), apoE, paraoxonase1 (PON1), and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), while decreased the pro-inflammatory property of dysfunctional HDL, contributing to reduced atherosclerosis and hepatic steatosis in Western diet-fed mice. Furthermore, the study revealed that hepatic MsrA altered the expression of several genes controlling HDL biogenesis, cholesterol esterification, cholesterol uptake mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and biliary excretion, as well as suppressed nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which largely relied on liver X receptor alpha (LXRα)-upregulation. These results provide original evidence that MsrA may be a promising target for the therapy of dysfunctional HDL-related CVD."

However, in China, housing safety management (HSM) is just in its beginning stage and it lacks thorough research. Housing safety awareness is one of the most significant aspects of housing safety management. Therefore, in order to investigate the housing safety awareness of Shanghai residents, this paper investigates the safety attitudes of residents living in housing of different ages using consulting questionnaires and Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. The results show that in Shanghai, the residents lack an understanding of housing management law, policy, and awareness of safety use and have low willingness to buy commercial insurance. Based on these results, the factors that affect the safety awareness of Shanghai residents are summarized as follows: (1) asymmetric information; (2) assessment of the safety status of the premises; and (3) differences in house users."
https://openalex.org/W3001283749,"Envelope (Env) phenotype(s) that provide transmitted founders (TF) with a selective advantage during HIV-1 transmission would be the ideal target for preventative therapy. We generated Env clones from four individuals infected with a single virus and one participant infected with multiple variants at transmission and compared phenotype with matched Envs from chronic infection (CI). When we determined whether pseudovirus (PSV) of the five TF and thirteen matched CI Env clones differed in their ability to 1) enter TZM-bl cells, 2) bind DC-SIGN, and 3) trans-infect CD4+ cells there was no association between time post-infection and variation in Env phenotype. However, when we compared the ability of PSV to induce monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) to secrete Interleukin-10 (IL-10), we found that only TF Envs from single variant transmission cases induced MDDCs to secrete either higher or similar levels of IL-10 as the CI clones. Furthermore, interaction between MDDC DC-SIGN and Env was required for secretion of IL-10. When variants were grouped according to time post-infection, TF PSV induced the release of higher levels of IL-10 than their CI counterparts although this relationship varied across MDDC donors. The selection of variants during transmission is therefore likely a complex event dependent on both virus and host genetics. Our findings suggest that, potentially due to overall variation in N-glycosylation across variants, nuanced differences in binding of TF Env to DC-SIGN might trigger alternative DC immune responses (IRs) in the female genital tract (FGT) that favour HIV-1 survival and facilitate transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3001799984,"During aerobic growth, the Gram-positive facultative anaerobe and opportunistic human pathogen <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> generates large amounts of hydrogen peroxide that can accumulate to millimolar concentrations. The mechanism by which this catalase-negative bacterium can withstand endogenous hydrogen peroxide is incompletely understood. The enzyme alkylhydroperoxidase D (AhpD) has been shown to contribute to pneumococcal virulence and oxidative stress responses <i>in vivo</i>. We demonstrate here that <i>Sp</i>AhpD exhibits weak thiol-dependent peroxidase activity and, unlike the previously reported <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> AhpC/D system, <i>Sp</i>AhpD does not mediate electron transfer to <i>Sp</i>AhpC. A 2.3-Å resolution crystal structure revealed several unusual structural features, including a three-cysteine active site architecture that is buried in a deep pocket, in contrast to the two-cysteine active site found in other AhpD enzymes. All single-cysteine <i>Sp</i>AhpD variants remained partially active, and LC-MS/MS analyses revealed that the third cysteine, Cys-163, formed disulfide bonds with either of two cysteines in the canonical Cys-78-<i>X–X</i>-Cys-81 motif. We observed that <i>Sp</i>AhpD formed a dimeric quaternary structure both in the crystal and in solution, and that the highly conserved Asn-76 of the AhpD core motif is important for <i>Sp</i>AhpD folding. In summary, <i>Sp</i>AhpD is a weak peroxidase and does not transfer electrons to AhpC, and therefore does not fit existing models of bacterial AhpD antioxidant defense mechanisms. We propose that it is unlikely that <i>Sp</i>AhpD removes peroxides either directly or via AhpC, and that <i>Sp</i>AhpD cysteine oxidation may act as a redox switch or mediate electron transfer with other thiol proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3002380099,Cancer is one of the life-threatening diseases of human beings; the pathogenesis of cancer remains to be further investigated. Toll like receptor (TLR) activities are involved in the apoptosis regulation. This study aims to elucidate the role of Mal (MyD88-adapter-like) molecule in the apoptosis regulation of lung cancer (LC) cells.The LC tissues were collected from LC patients. LC cells and normal control (NC) cells were isolated from the tissues and analyzed by pertinent biochemical and immunological approaches.We found that fewer apoptotic LC cells were induced by cisplatin in the culture as compared to NC cells. The expression of Fas ligand (FasL) was lower in LC cells than that in NC cells. FasL mRNA levels declined spontaneously in LC cells. A complex of FasL/TDP-43 was detected in LC cells. LC cells expressed less Mal than NC cells. Activation of Mal by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased TDP-43 expression in LC cells. TDP-43 formed a complex with FasL mRNA to prevent FasL mRNA from decay. Reconstitution of Mal or TDP-43 restored the sensitiveness of LC cells to apoptotic inducers.LC cells express low Mal levels that contributes to FasL mRNA decay through impairing TDP-43 expression. Reconstitution of Mal restores sensitiveness of LC cells to apoptosis inducers that may be a novel therapeutic approach for LC treatment.

https://openalex.org/W3001266149,"My Ph.D. adviser called me into his office, saying I needn't bring my notebook. Puzzled, I followed him and sat down. We'd met for 2 hours the day before to finalize our project plan for the coming months, and it wasn't clear what more we had to discuss. He started by saying, “Anurag, this conversation isn't going to be easy,” instantly sending my mind into a flurry of thoughts about what was to follow. After 15 minutes of listing positive things about my academic capabilities, he looked me in the eye and said, “You are fired from the lab.” I stared back, blinking in disbelief. “Is he joking?” I wondered. “How is this possible?”

> “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” 

I had moved to Israel from my native India the year before, excited to experience a new culture and pursue a Ph.D. I'd already completed a master's degree in the Netherlands, and at first things went well in my new lab: I got along with my Ph.D. adviser, and my experiments progressed as planned. Then, 3 months before I was fired, I ran into some problems. I made a few mistakes in the lab that slowed my research, but I wasn't aware that my adviser noticed them, and he never spoke to me about any concerns.

That's why I was caught off guard in his office that day. I'm still not sure why he fired me, but I suspect it was because of those mistakes. He wasn't confident that I could complete my research in the time frame we'd planned.

The first few days after my dismissal were especially difficult. I spent hours staring at my computer screen, unable to get anything done. One day all I could do was sit on a beach, crying as I looked out across the Mediterranean Sea and wondered what I should do.

My adviser gave me 2 months to wrap up my work. I tried to change his mind with promising results, but he remained resolute. I could not break the news to my family in India, as the fear of disappointing them overwhelmed me. I soon spiraled into a state of depression and anxiety. Meanwhile, the date for me to leave the country was drawing near, as my visa required me to be enrolled as a student. I was lonely and without hope.

I started to wonder whether my experience was unique. Poking around on the internet, I was relieved to discover that many Ph.D. students never finish their studies for various reasons, one of which is a broken relationship with their adviser. At least I wasn't alone.

Around that time, I watched Dasvidaniya , a Bollywood movie that's about a man who is told that he has 3 months to live. He responds by reframing his perspective on life and setting out to make the most of his remaining months. Even though it is a common saying, one line from the movie stuck out to me: “When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.” What kind of “lemonade” could I make out of my current situation?

My desire to complete a Ph.D. was never in doubt; it was my confidence that had taken a hit after my dismissal. After much reflection, I told myself that one failed attempt was not the end of the world, and that I needed to give it another try. I reminded myself that even if I am not the most skilled researcher in the lab, I am a good teacher and I care passionately about mentoring students. My goal is to go back to India to work as a professor, a job I think I would excel at.

With renewed confidence, I emailed prospective advisers and applied to other programs. My previous adviser had not yet secured tenure; this time, I sent my applications to more senior, tenured professors. I thought they would have more experience working with international students and would be more patient as I developed my research abilities. Within 2 months of that fateful conversation in my adviser's office, I landed an offer from a Ph.D. program in Italy. I accepted it and relocated to Europe, happy that my goal of completing a Ph.D. was alive once again.

I've faced other challenges during my current Ph.D. program, but my adviser has been supportive, and I've felt comfortable going to him for help and guidance. I'm thankful that I didn't give up on my dream and that I found another professor willing to take me on. So, if you find yourself in a similar situation and life gives you lemons, ask yourself: “How can I make lemonade?”
