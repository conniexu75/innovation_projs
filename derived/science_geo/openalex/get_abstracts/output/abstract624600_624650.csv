https://openalex.org/W2904125429,"RAS genes are the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human cancers. Despite tremendous efforts over the past several decades, however, RAS-specific inhibitors remain elusive. Thus, targeting RAS remains a highly sought-after goal of cancer research. Previously, we have reported a new approach to inhibit RAS-dependent signaling and transformation in vitro by targeting the α4-α5 dimerization interface with a novel RAS-specific monobody termed NS1. Expression of NS1 inhibits oncogenic K-RAS and H-RAS signaling and transformation in vitro. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of targeting RAS dimerization as an approach to inhibit tumor formation in vivo. Using a doxycycline (DOX)-regulated NS1 expression system, we demonstrate that DOX-induced NS1 inhibited oncogenic K-RAS-driven tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we observed context-specific effects of NS1 on RAS-mediated signaling in 2D vs 3D growth conditions. Finally, our results highlight the potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting the α4-α5 dimerization interface as an approach to inhibit RAS-driven tumors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2905735591,"Tamoxifen has been used for many years to target estrogen receptor signalling in breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen is also an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), a GPCR ubiquitously expressed in tissues that mediates the acute response to estrogens. Here we report that tamoxifen promotes mechanical quiescence in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), stromal fibroblast-like cells whose activation triggers and perpetuates liver fibrosis in hepatocellular carcinomas. This mechanical deactivation is mediated by the GPER/RhoA/myosin axis and induces YAP deactivation. We report that tamoxifen decreases the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins through a mechanical mechanism that involves actomyosin-dependent contractility and mechanosensing of tissue stiffness. Our results implicate GPER-mediated estrogen signalling in the mechanosensory-driven activation of HSCs and put forward estrogenic signalling as an option for mechanical reprogramming of myofibroblast-like cells in the tumour microenvironment. Tamoxifen, with half a century of safe clinical use, might lead this strategy of drug repositioning."

https://openalex.org/W4210288419,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia. However, the mechanisms responsible for development of AD, especially for the sporadic variant, are still not clear. In our previous study, we discovered that a small noncoding RNA (miR-188-3p) targeting β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE)-1, a key enzyme responsible for Aβ formation, plays an important role in the development of neuropathology in AD. In the present study, we identified that miR-338-5p, a new miRNA that also targets BACE1, contributes to AD neuropathology. We observed that expression of miR-338-5p was significantly down-regulated in the hippocampus of patients with AD and 5XFAD transgenic (TG) mice, an animal model of AD. Overexpression of miR-338-5p in the hippocampus of TG mice reduced BACE1 expression, Aβ formation, and neuroinflammation. Overexpression of miR-338-5p functionally prevented impairments in long-term synaptic plasticity, learning ability, and memory retention in TG mice. In addition, we provide evidence that down-regulated expression of miR-338-5p in AD is regulated through the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our results suggest that down-regulated expression of miR-338-5p plays an important role in the development of AD.-Qian, Q., Zhang, J., He, F.-P., Bao, W.-X., Zheng, T.-T., Zhou, D.-M., Pan, H.-Y., Zhang, H., Zhang, X.-Q., He, X., Sun, B.-G., Luo, B.-Y., Chen, C., Peng, G.-P. Down-regulated expression of microRNA-338-5p contributes to neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2905981829,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is ranked the third most common cancer in human worldwide. However, the exact mechanisms of CRC are not well established. Furthermore, there may be differences between mechanisms of CRC in the Asian and in the Western populations. In the present study, we utilized a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic approach supported by the 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing to investigate the functional and taxonomical differences between paired tumor and unaffected (normal) surgical biopsy tissues from 17 Malaysian patients. Metabolomic differences associated with steroid biosynthesis, terpenoid biosynthesis and bile metabolism could be attributed to microbiome differences between normal and tumor sites. The relative abundances of Anaerotruncus, Intestinimonas and Oscillibacter displayed significant relationships with both steroid biosynthesis and terpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways. Metabolites involved in serotonergic synapse/ tryptophan metabolism (Serotonin and 5-Hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) were only detected in normal tissue samples. On the other hand, S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), a metabolite involves in methionine metabolism and methylation, was frequently increased in tumor relative to normal tissues. In conclusion, this study suggests that local microbiome dysbiosis may contribute to functional changes at the cancer sites. Results from the current study also contributed to the list of metabolites that are found to differ between normal and tumor sites in CRC and supported our quest for understanding the mechanisms of carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2905644828,"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is becoming the leading risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC development related to MS may occur in advanced or non-advanced liver fibrosis, suggesting specific molecular pathways. Among these pathways, basal inflammatory state and adipokines production are involved. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4). In this study, we demonstrate the specific overexpression of FABP4 in human HCC samples from patients with MS compared to other risk factors for chronic liver disease with FABP4 expression restricted to peritumoral endothelial cells. In vitro, glucose, insulin, VEGFA and hypoxia upregulated endothelial FABP4, which was reversed by metformin through mTOR pathway inhibition. FABP4 exerts oncogenic effects on hepatoma cell lines by upregulating the angiogenesis gene signature and pathways involved in the cell cycle, leading to increased cell proliferation and migration, and downregulating HIF1 pathway; effects were reversed in the presence of a specific FABP4 inhibitor (BMS309403). We showed the role of microvesicles as FABP4 vectors between endothelial and tumor cells. In vivo, BMS309403 significantly reduces tumor growth in heterotopic and orthotopic xenografted mice model. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the emerging oncogenic role of liver endothelial cells through FABP4 in HCC related to MS, and highlights new anti-neoplastic mechanism of metformin."
https://openalex.org/W2949583421,"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest and most severe form of all inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) and the most frequent cause of inherited blindness in children. The phenotypic overlap with other early-onset and severe IRDs as well as difficulties associated with the ophthalmic examination of infants can complicate the clinical diagnosis. To date, 25 genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LCA. The disorder is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, although rare dominant cases have been reported. We report the mutation spectra and frequency of genes in 27 German index patients initially diagnosed with LCA. A total of 108 LCA- and other genes implicated in IRD were analysed using a cost-effective targeted next-generation sequencing procedure based on molecular inversion probes (MIPs). Sequencing and variant filtering led to the identification of putative pathogenic variants in 25 cases, thereby leading to a detection rate of 93%. The mutation spectrum comprises 34 different alleles, 17 of which are novel. In line with previous studies, the genetic results led to a revision of the initial clinical diagnosis in a substantial proportion of cases, demonstrating the importance of genetic testing in IRD. In addition, our detection rate of 93% shows that MIPs are a cost-efficient and sensitive tool for targeted next-generation sequencing in IRD."
https://openalex.org/W2906039668,"Gastric cancer (GC) has been classified as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Due to their ability to suppress the expression of target genes, microRNAs (miRNAs) are listed as one of the key elements involved in the formation and development of tumors. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the effects of microRNA-135b (miR-135b) on cisplatin [ds-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP)] resistance of GC cells through the MAPK signaling pathway by targeting mammalian ste20-like kinase 1 (MST1). A microarray-based gene expression analysis was performed to screen the GC-related differentially expressed genes. The 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay was performed to determine the sensitivity of GC cells to CDDP. The bioinformatics database and dual lucif erase reporter gene assay were used to check whether MST1 was a direct target gene of miR-135b. GC cell lines were prepared with high CDDP resistance, after which they were cultured and transfected respectively, followed by the administration of transfected cells into nude mice and subsequent treatment with CDDP in an attempt to identify the underlying mechanisms and functions of miR-135b in relation to MST1 in GC progression. The results were highly indicative of the crucial role played by MST1 in the development of GC and the sensitivity of GC to CDDP. miR-135b was found to regulate MST1, which in turn had an impact on the development of GC. MKN28 was observed to be most sensitive to CDDP, whereas MKN45 presented with the poorest sensitivity to CDDP. Furthermore, the down-regulation of miR-135b resulted in inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway; increased the expression of MST1 and Bax; and decreased expression of p-p38MAPK, p-ERKl/2, P-glycoprotein, p38MAPK, ERK1/2, multidrug resistance protein 1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, lung resistance-related protein, and Bcl-2, thus inhibiting CDDP resistance of GC cells. The down-regulation of miR-135b also restrained cell proliferation and induced the apoptosis rate of GC cells. In summary, the results of this study showed that the down-regulation of miR-135b induced apoptosis, and it inhibited proliferation and CDDP resistance of GC cells by inactivating the MAPK signaling pathway and increasing the expression of MST1.—Zhou, J., Chen, Q. Poor expression of microRNA-135b results in the inhibition of cisplatin resistance and proliferation and induces the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through MST1-mediated MAPK signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2906578344,"H1N1 is the earliest emerging subtype of influenza A viruses with available genomic sequences, has caused several pandemics and seasonal epidemics, resulting in millions of deaths and enormous economic losses. Timely determination of new antigenic variants is crucial for the vaccine selection and flu prevention. In this study, we chronologically divided the H1N1 strains into several periods in terms of the epidemics and pandemics. Computational models have been constructed to predict antigenic variants based on epidemic and pandemic periods. By sequence analysis, we demonstrated the diverse mutation patterns of HA1 protein on different periods and that an individual model built upon each period can not represent the variations of H1N1 virus. A stacking model was established for the prediction of antigenic variants, combining all the variation patterns across periods, which would help assess a new influenza strain’s antigenicity. Three different feature extraction methods, i.e. residue-based, regional band-based and epitope region-based, were applied on the stacking model to verify its feasibility and robustness. The results showed the capability of determining antigenic variants prediction with accuracy as high as 0.908 which performed better than any of the single models. The prediction performance using the stacking model indicates clear distinctions of mutation patterns and antigenicity between epidemic and pandemic strains. It would also facilitate rapid determination of antigenic variants and influenza surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2906060794,"Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) is a well-established genetics-based system that uses yeast to selectively display binary protein-protein interactions (PPIs). To meet the current need to unravel complex PPI networks, several adaptations have been made to establish medium- to high-throughput Y2H screening platforms, with several having successfully incorporated the use of the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to increase the scale and sensitivity of the method. However, these have been to date mainly restricted to the use of fully annotated custom-made open reading frame (ORF) libraries and subject to complex downstream data processing. Here, a streamlined Y2H library screening strategy, based on integration of Y2H with NGS, called Y2H-seq, was developed, which allows efficient and reliable screening of Y2H cDNA libraries. To generate proof of concept, the method was applied to screen for interaction partners of two key components of the jasmonate signaling machinery in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, resulting in the identification of several previously reported as well as hitherto unknown interactors. Our Y2H-seq method offers a user-friendly, specific and sensitive screening method that allows identification of PPIs without prior knowledge of the organism’s ORFs, thereby extending the method to organisms of which the genome has not entirely been annotated yet. The quantitative NGS readout allows to increase genome coverage, thereby overcoming some of the bottlenecks of current Y2H technologies, which will further strengthen the value of the Y2H technology as a discovery platform."
https://openalex.org/W2906336366,"On September 7, 2017, three potentially autochthonous cases of chikungunya were notified in the Lazio region. An Outbreak investigation based on established surveillance system data and molecular analysis of viral variant(s) were conducted. Epidemiological analysis suggested the occurrence of 3 main foci of local transmission. The major focus involved 317 cases with epidemiological link with the area of Anzio. The other two foci occurred in Rome (80 cases) and Latina (8 cases). Cumulative incidence in Anzio and Latina were 331.4 and 7.13 per 100,000 residents, respectively. Cumulative incidences ranged from 1.4 to 14.3/100,000 residents in Rome. This is the first report of a chikungunya outbreak involving a densely populated urban area in a western country. The outbreak probably started in Anzio, spread by continuity to neighbouring villages, and then to the metropolitan area of Rome and to the Latina area favoured by the touristic nature of the Anzio area."
https://openalex.org/W2905764934,"Background Chronic liver disease is an escalating problem both in the United Kingdom and worldwide. In the UK mortality rates have risen sharply over the previous 50 years predominantly due to alcohol, however the increasing prevalence of non-alcohol related fatty liver disease both in the UK and elsewhere is also of concern. Liver disease develops silently hence early detection of fibrosis is essential to prevent progression. Primary care presents an opportunity to identify at risk populations, however assessment largely comprises of indirect markers of fibrosis which have little prognostic value. We hypothesised that setting up nurse-led primary care based liver clinics using additional non-invasive testing would increase the number of new diagnoses of liver disease compared to usual care. Methods This was a prospective, cluster randomised feasibility trial based in urban primary care in Southampton, United Kingdom. 10 GP practices were randomised to either intervention (liver health nurse) or control (care as usual). Pre recruitment audits were carried out in each practice to ascertain baseline prevalence of liver disease. Participants were subsequently recruited in intervention practices from July 2014-March 2016 via one of 3 pathways: GP referral, nurse led case finding based on risk factors or random AUDIT questionnaire mailouts. Liver assessment included the Southampton Traffic Light test (serum fibrosis markers HA and P3NP) and transient elastography (FibroScan). Cases were ascribed as ‘no fibrosis’, ‘liver warning’, ‘progressive fibrosis’ or ‘probable cirrhosis’. Post recruitment audits were repeated and incident liver diagnoses captured from July 2014-September 2016. Each new diagnosis was reviewed in a virtual clinic by a consultant hepatologist. Findings 910 participants were seen in the nurse led clinic—44 (4.8%) probable cirrhosis, 141 (15.5%) progressive fibrosis, 220 (24.2%) liver warning and 505 (55.5%) no evidence of liver fibrosis. 450 (49.5%) cases were due to NAFLD with 356 (39.1%) from alcohol. In the 405 with a liver disease diagnosis, 136 (33.6%) were referred by GP, 218 (53.8%) from nurse led case finding and 51 (12.6%) from the AUDIT mailout. 544 incident cases were identified in the intervention arm compared to 221 in the control arm in the period July 2014-September 2016 (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 2.8). Conclusions The incorporation of a liver health nurse into GP practices was simple to arrange and yielded a much higher number of new diagnoses of liver disease compared to usual care. Nearly half of all participants recruited had a degree of liver disease. Nurse led case finding and GP referrals were most effective compared to AUDIT questionnaire mailouts in an urban population in identifying unknown disease. Utilising study and previous data allowed quick and effective virtual review by a hepatologist. Identifying those who are at risk of liver disease from harmful alcohol use remains a challenge and needs to be addressed in future work."
https://openalex.org/W2905659301,"Aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) peptides in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are hypothesized to trigger several downstream pathologies, including cerebrovascular dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Aβ peptides can have antiangiogenic properties, which may contribute to vascular dysfunction in the early stages of the disease process. We have generated data showing that brain endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to toxic Aβ1-42 oligomers can readily enter a senescence phenotype. To determine the effect of Aβ oligomers on brain ECs, we treated early passaged human brain microvascular ECs and HUVECs with high MW Aβ1-42 oligomers (5 µM, for 72 h). For controls, we used no peptide treatment, 5 µM Aβ1-42 monomers, and 5 µM Aβ1-42 fibrils, respectively. Brain ECs treated with Aβ1-42 oligomers showed increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining and increased senescence-associated p21/p53 expression. Treatment with either Aβ1-42 monomer or Aβ1-42 fibrils did not induce senescence in this assay. We then measured vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) expression in the Aβ1-42 oligomer-treated ECs, and these cells showed significantly increased VEGFR-1 expression and decreased VEGFR-2 levels. Overexpression of VEGFR-1 in brain ECs readily induced senescence, suggesting a direct role of VEGFR-1 signaling events in this paradigm. More importantly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of VEGFR-1 expression in brain ECs was able to prevent up-regulation of p21 protein expression and significantly reduced induction of senescence following Aβ1-42 oligomer treatment. Our studies show that exposure to Aβ1-42 oligomers may impair vascular functions by altering VEGFR-1 expression and causing ECs to enter a senescent phenotype. Altered VEGFR expression has been documented in brains of AD patients and suggests that this pathway may play a role in AD disease pathogenesis. These studies suggest that modulating VEGFR-1 expression and signaling events could potentially prevent senescence and rejuvenate EC functions, and provides us with a novel target to pursue for prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.-Angom, R.

https://openalex.org/W2905942425,"Anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, which plays a role in the regulation of protein homeostasis and the unfolded protein response pathway (UPR). AGR2 has also been characterized as a proto-oncogene and a potential cancer biomarker. Cellular localization of AGR2 is emerging as a key component for understanding the role of AGR2 as a proto-oncogene. Here, we provide evidence that extracellular AGR2 (eAGR2) promotes tumor metastasis in various in vivo models. To further characterize the role of the intracellular-resident versus extracellular protein, we performed a comprehensive protein-protein interaction screen. Based on these results, we identify AGR2 as an interacting partner of the mTORC2 pathway. Importantly, our data indicates that eAGR2 promotes increased phosphorylation of RICTOR (T1135), while intracellular AGR2 (iAGR2) antagonizes its levels and phosphorylation. Localization of AGR2 also has opposing effects on the Hippo pathway, spheroid formation, and response to chemotherapy in vitro. Collectively, our results identify disparate phenotypes predicated on AGR2 localization. Our findings also provide credence for screening of eAGR2 to guide therapeutic decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2905733100,"Visceral lipid accumulation, organ hypertrophy and a reduction in skeletal muscle strength are all signs associated with the severity of obesity-related disease. Intermittent fasting (IF) and high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) are natural strategies that, individually, can prevent and help treat obesity along with metabolic syndrome and its associated diseases. However, the combinatorial effect of IF and HIIE on energetic metabolism is currently not well understood. We hypothesized that their combination could have a potential for more than strictly additive benefits. Here, we show that two months of every-other-day intermittent fasting regimen combined with a high-intensity intermittent exercise protocol (IF/HIIE) produced a synergistic effect, enhancing physical endurance (vs. control, HIIE and IF) and optimizing metabolic pathways of energy production in male Wistar rats. The IF/HIIE group presented enhanced glucose tolerance (vs. control, HIIE and IF), lower levels of plasma insulin (vs. control and HIIE), and a global activation of low Km hexokinases in liver (vs. control, HIIE and IF), heart (vs. control and HIIE) and skeletal muscle (vs. control, HIIE and IF). The IF/HIIE synergism, rather than a simply additive effect, is evidenced by increase in muscle mass and cross-section area, activation of the FoF1 ATP synthase, and the gain of characteristics suggestive of augmented mitochondrial mass and efficiency observed in this group. Finally, important reductions in plasma oxidative stress markers were present preferentially in IF/HIIE group. These findings provide new insights for the implementation of non-pharmaceutical strategies to prevent/treat metabolic syndrome and associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2905875418,"Combining DNA-damaging drugs with DNA checkpoint inhibitors is an emerging strategy to manage cancer. Checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors (CHK1is) sensitize most cancer cell lines to DNA-damaging drugs and also elicit single-agent cytotoxicity in 15% of cell lines. Consequently, combination therapy may be effective in a broader patient population. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanism of sensitization to gemcitabine by the CHK1i MK8776. Brief gemcitabine incubation irreversibly inhibited ribonucleotide reductase, depleting dNTPs, resulting in durable S phase arrest. Addition of CHK1i 18 h after gemcitabine elicited cell division cycle 7 (CDC7)- and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)-dependent reactivation of the replicative helicase, but did not reinitiate DNA synthesis due to continued lack of dNTPs. Helicase reactivation generated extensive single-strand (ss)DNA that exceeded the protective capacity of the ssDNA-binding protein, replication protein A. The subsequent cleavage of unprotected ssDNA has been termed replication catastrophe. This mechanism did not occur with concurrent CHK1i plus gemcitabine treatment, providing support for delayed administration of CHK1i in patients. Alternative mechanisms of CHK1i-mediated sensitization to gemcitabine have been proposed, but their role was ruled out; these mechanisms include premature mitosis, inhibition of homologous recombination, and activation of double-strand break repair nuclease (MRE11). In contrast, single-agent activity of CHK1i was MRE11-dependent and was prevented by lower concentrations of a CDK2 inhibitor. Hence, both pathways require CDK2 but appear to depend on different CDK2 substrates. We conclude that a small-molecule inhibitor of CHK1 can elicit at least two distinct, context-dependent mechanisms of cytotoxicity in cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2905953278,"Homeobox protein Emx2 is a transcription factor that is encoded by the EMX2 gene. In this study, using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Thyroid Cancer (TCGA-THCA), we aimed to examine the expression profile of EMX2 and its antisense transcript EMX2OS in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), their prognostic value and potential regulatory networks. Results showed that in the three variants of PTC, EMX2 was significantly downregulated in classical PTC, while EMX2OS were significantly downregulated in follicular and classical PTC, compared with adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that EMX2 and EMX2OS expression was not related to RFS in follicular PTC. In comparison, the high EMX2 or EMX2OS group were associated with better RFS compared with their respective low expression group in classical PTC (p = 0.007 and 0.004 respectively). Correlation analysis showed that EMX2 and EMX2OS were highly co-expressed in PTC tissues (Spearman's r = 0.83). By performing stepwise regression, we found that EMX2OS was better than EMX2 in predicting RFS in classical PTC. Multivariate analysis confirmed that high EMX2OS expression was an independent indicator of favorable RFS in classical PTC (HR: 0.239, 95%CI: 0.100 = 0.569, p = 0.001), after adjustment of pathological stages and residual tumors. By performing in silico analysis, we found that the genes co-expressed with EMX2 or EMX2OS were highly overlapped. KEGG pathway analysis showed that these genes were enriched in the ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling, protein digestion and absorption and proteoglycans in cancer pathways, which are closely related to cancer initiation and progression. Based on the findings, we infer that decreased EMX2OS expression might be a valuable prognostic biomarker of unfavorable RFS in classical PTC."

Computational models can be used to test the efficacy of respiratory infection prevention interventions, but require data on social mixing patterns, which are sparse in developing countries. We describe social mixing patterns among a rural community in northern India. During October 2015-February 2016, trained field workers conducted cross-sectional face-to-face standardized surveys in a convenience sample of 330 households in Faridabad District, Haryana State, India. Respondents were asked about the number, duration, and setting of social interactions during the previous 24 hours. Responses were compared by age and gender. Among the 3083 residents who were approached, 2943 (96%) participated, of whom 51% were male and the median age was 22 years (interquartile range (IQR) 9–37). Respondents reported contact (defined as having had a face-to-face conversation within 3 feet, which may or may not have included physical contact) with a median of 17 (IQR 12–25) people during the preceding 24 hours. Median total contact time per person was 36 person-hours (IQR 26–52). Female older children and adults had significantly fewer contacts than males of similar age (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 226.59, p<0.001), but spent a longer duration in contact with young children (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 27.26, p<0.001), suggesting a potentially complex pattern of differential risk of infection between genders. After controlling for household size and day of the week, respondent age was significantly associated with number and duration of contacts. These findings can be used to model the impact of interventions to reduce lower respiratory tract infections in India."
https://openalex.org/W2905899743,"A high quality modern diet is associated with reduced risk of metabolic disease and diabetes. However, it remains unclear whether the quality of predominantly traditional ethnic diets is associated with such conditions. Moreover, the relationship between dietary quality and microbiota, a potential mediator of metabolic disease, has not been studied.We investigated the relationship of dietary quality of traditional ethnic diets in Indonesia with fasting blood glucose (FBG), HbA1c, and the number of fecal Bifidobacterium.A cross-sectional study was conducted in selected districts with predominantly animal- or plant-based traditional diets of West Sumatera and West Java provinces, respectively. A total of 240 apparently healthy women aged 19-50 years were randomly selected from 360 women screened by a cluster sampling design. Dietary quality was assessed by 2-day repeated 24-hour food recall, and scored using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010. FBG was quantified with the enzymatic colorimetric method, and HbA1c by using hexokinase and high-performance liquid chromatography, and total fecal Bifidobacterium by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.The HEI scores of 99% of women were <51, indicating a low-quality diet. In adjusted multivariate regression, HEI was inversely associated with FBG (ß = -0.403; 95% CI = -0.789 to -0.016; p = 0.041) and HbA1c (ß = -0.018; 95% CI = -0.036 to 0.000; p = 0.048) but was not significantly associated with total levels of Bifidobacterium (ß = -0.007, p = 0.275). Bifidobacterium count was not significantly associated with either FBG or HbA1c levels.Low dietary quality is clearly associated with risk of increased markers of blood glucose. However, any mediating role of Bifidobacterium between dietary quality and glucose outcomes was not apparent. Innovative interventions for healthy eating should be implemented to increase dietary quality of populations transitioning from predominantly traditional to modern diets, to reduce the risk of diabetes, especially in women."
https://openalex.org/W2906086508,"Obesity is a major risk for patients with chronic metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a morphogen that regulates the pancreas and adipose tissue formation during embryonic development. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and one of the most important regulators of insulin action. Here, we evaluated the role and mechanism of Shh signaling in obesity-associated insulin resistance and characterized its effect on PPARγ. We showed that Shh expression was up-regulated in subcutaneous fat from obese mice. In differentiated 3T3-L1 and primary cultured adipocytes from rats, recombinant Shh protein and SAG (an agonist of Shh signaling) activated an extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent noncanonical pathway and induced PPARγ phosphorylation at serine 112, which decreased PPARγ activity. Meanwhile, Shh signaling degraded PPARγ protein via binding of PPARγ to neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-1 (NEDD4-1). Furthermore, vismodegib, an inhibitor of Shh signaling, attenuated ERK phosphorylation induced by a high fat diet (HFD) and restored PPARγ protein level, thus ameliorating glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in obese mice. Our finding suggests that Shh in subcutaneous fat decreases PPARγ activity and stability via activation of an ERK-dependent noncanonical pathway, resulting in impaired insulin action. Inhibition of Shh may serve as a potential therapeutic approach to treat obesity-related diabetes. Obesity is a major risk for patients with chronic metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a morphogen that regulates the pancreas and adipose tissue formation during embryonic development. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and one of the most important regulators of insulin action. Here, we evaluated the role and mechanism of Shh signaling in obesity-associated insulin resistance and characterized its effect on PPARγ. We showed that Shh expression was up-regulated in subcutaneous fat from obese mice. In differentiated 3T3-L1 and primary cultured adipocytes from rats, recombinant Shh protein and SAG (an agonist of Shh signaling) activated an extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent noncanonical pathway and induced PPARγ phosphorylation at serine 112, which decreased PPARγ activity. Meanwhile, Shh signaling degraded PPARγ protein via binding of PPARγ to neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-1 (NEDD4-1). Furthermore, vismodegib, an inhibitor of Shh signaling, attenuated ERK phosphorylation induced by a high fat diet (HFD) and restored PPARγ protein level, thus ameliorating glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in obese mice. Our finding suggests that Shh in subcutaneous fat decreases PPARγ activity and stability via activation of an ERK-dependent noncanonical pathway, resulting in impaired insulin action.

This study presents the laterality distribution of, correlations between and test-retest reliability of behavioral lateralized language tasks (speech production, reading and speech perception), face recognition tasks, handedness measures and language performance tests based on data from 98 left-handers. The results show that a behavioral test battery leads to percentages of (a)typical dominance that are similar to those found in neuropsychological studies even though the incidence of clear atypical lateralization (about 20%) may be overestimated at the group level. Significant correlations were found between the language tasks for both reaction time and accuracy lateralization indices. The degree of language laterality could however not be linked to face laterality, handedness or language performance. Finally, individuals were classified less consistently than expected as being typical, bilateral or atypical across all tasks. This may be due to the often good (speech production and perception tasks) but sometimes weak (reading and face tasks) test-retest reliabilities. The lack of highly reliable and valid test protocols for functions unrelated to speech remains one of the largest impediments for individual analysis and cross-task investigations in laterality research."
https://openalex.org/W2905905461,"Butterfly monitoring and Red List programs in Switzerland rely on a combination of observations and collection records to document changes in species distributions through time. While most butterflies can be identified using morphology, some taxa remain challenging, making it difficult to accurately map their distributions and develop appropriate conservation measures. In this paper, we explore the use of the DNA barcode (a fragment of the mitochondrial gene COI) as a tool for the identification of Swiss butterflies and forester moths (Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae). We present a national DNA barcode reference library including 868 sequences representing 217 out of 224 resident species, or 96.9% of Swiss fauna. DNA barcodes were diagnostic for nearly 90% of Swiss species. The remaining 10% represent cases of para- and polyphyly likely involving introgression or incomplete lineage sorting among closely related taxa. We demonstrate that integrative taxonomic methods incorporating a combination of morphological and genetic techniques result in a rate of species identification of over 96% in females and over 98% in males, higher than either morphology or DNA barcodes alone. We explore the use of the DNA barcode for exploring boundaries among taxa, understanding the geographical distribution of cryptic diversity and evaluating the status of purportedly endemic taxa. Finally, we discuss how DNA barcodes may be used to improve field practices and ultimately enhance conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2906006318,"Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is a rare disorder caused by the deficient production, secretion, or action of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Prokineticin (PROK) receptor 2 ( PROKR2), a causative gene for IHH, encodes a GPCR PROKR2. When PROKR2 binds to its ligands PROKs, it may activate several signaling pathways, including IP3/Ca2+, MAPK, and cAMP pathways. However, the mutational spectrum of PROKR2 in Chinese patients with IHH has not been established. In the present study, we found that up to 13.3% (18/135) of patients with IHH in China carried mutations in PROKR2. Most of the variants in this study were private; however, a PROKR2 (c.533G > C; p.W178S) mutation was identified in 10 independent patients, implying a possible founder mutation. Functional studies indicated that 6 novel PROKR2 mutations led to decreased signaling to various extents. Two IHH-associated mutations (L218P and R270H) disrupted Gαq-dependent signaling but maintained normal Gαs and ERK1/2 signaling. A glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiment demonstrated that R270H mutation disrupted the interaction of intracellular loop 3 of PROKR2 to Gαq protein but not Gαs protein. Our results indicated that selective disruption of the interaction with a specific Gα-protein might underlie the biased signaling for certain IHH-associated PROKR2 mutations.-Zhao, Y., Wu, J., Jia, H., Wang, X., Zheng, R., Jiang, F., Chen, D.-N., Chen, Z., Li, J.-D.

In order to allow separation (time and location) between subject encounter and sample analysis, we developed a research-specific RBC cryopreservation protocol and assessed its impact on data fidelity for key biochemical and physiological assays. RBCs drawn from healthy volunteers were aliquotted for immediate analysis or following glycerol-based cryopreservation, thawing, and deglycerolization. RBC phenotype was assessed by (1) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and standard morphometric RBC indices, (2) osmotic fragility, (3) deformability, (4) endothelial adhesion, (5) oxygen (O2) affinity, (6) ability to regulate hypoxic vasodilation, (7) nitric oxide (NO) content, (8) metabolomic phenotyping (at steady state, tracing with [1,2,3-13C3]glucose ± oxidative challenge with superoxide thermal source; SOTS-1), as well as in vivo quantification (following human to mouse RBC xenotransfusion) of (9) blood oxygenation content mapping and flow dynamics (velocity and adhesion). Our revised glycerolization protocol (40% v/v final) resulted in >98.5% RBC recovery following freezing (-80°C) and thawing (37°C), with no difference compared to the standard reported method (40% w/v final). Full deglycerolization (>99.9% glycerol removal) of 40% v/v final samples resulted in total cumulative lysis of ~8%, compared to ~12–15% with the standard method. The post cryopreservation/deglycerolization RBC phenotype was indistinguishable from that for fresh RBCs with regard to physical RBC parameters (morphology, volume, and density), osmotic fragility, deformability, endothelial adhesivity, O2 affinity, vasoregulation, metabolomics, and flow dynamics. These results indicate that RBC cryopreservation/deglycerolization in 40% v/v glycerol final does not significantly impact RBC phenotype (compared to fresh cells)."
https://openalex.org/W2901476332,"Certain nonlinear systems can switch between dynamical attractors occupying different regions of phase space, under variation of parameters or initial states. In this work we exploit this feature to obtain reliable logic operations. With logic output 0/1 mapped to dynamical attractors bounded in distinct regions of phase space, and logic inputs encoded by a very small bias parameter, we explicitly demonstrate that the system hops consistently in response to an external input stream, operating effectively as a reliable logic gate. This system offers the advantage that very low-amplitude inputs yield highly amplified outputs. Additionally, different dynamical variables in the system yield complementary logic operations in parallel. Further, we show that in certain parameter regions noise aids the reliability of logic operations, and is actually necessary for obtaining consistent outputs. This leads us to a generalization of the concept of Logical Stochastic Resonance to attractors more complex than fixed point states, such as periodic or chaotic attractors. Lastly, the results are verified in electronic circuit experiments, demonstrating the robustness of the phenomena. So we have combined the research directions of Chaos Computing and Logical Stochastic Resonance here, and this approach has potential to be realized in wide-ranging systems."

The treatment of this breast cancer subtype with endocrine therapies is effective in the adjuvant and recurrent settings. However, their effectiveness is compromised by the emergence of intrinsic or acquired resistance. Thus, identification of new molecular targets can significantly contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In recent years, many studies have implicated aberrant levels of translation initiation factors in cancer etiology and provided evidence that identifies these factors as promising therapeutic targets. Accordingly, we observed reduced levels of the eIF3 subunit eIF3f in ER-positive breast cancer cells compared with ER-negative cells, and determined that low eIF3f levels are required for proper proliferation and survival of ER-positive MCF7 cells. The expression of eIF3f is tightly controlled by ERα at the transcriptional (genomic pathway) and translational (nongenomic pathway) level. Specifically, estrogen-bound ERα represses transcription of the EIF3F gene, while promoting eIF3f mRNA translation. To regulate translation, estrogen activates the mTORC1 pathway, which enhances the binding of eIF3 to the eIF4F complex and, consequently, the assembly of the 48S preinitiation complexes and protein synthesis. We observed preferential translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5′-UTRs that usually encode factors involved in cell proliferation and survival (e.g. cyclin D1 and survivin).

By acting through these signaling pathways, increased levels of estrogen-ERα complex promote cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and migration in cancer cells. Regulation of mRNA translation is critical to define the proteome, maintain homeostasis, and control cell proliferation, growth, and development. Protein synthesis occurs in four steps: initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling, with initiation being the rate-limiting phase (8Hershey J.W. Sonenberg N. Mathews M.B.

The translation initiation comprises: (a) the assembly of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F complex (eIF4F) composed of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A, and the scaffolding protein eIF4G on the 5′ cap-structure of cellular mRNAs; (b) the formation of the 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) that consists of the 40S ribosomal subunit, translation initiation factors eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5, and the ternary complex that includes eIF2, initiator Met-tRNAiMet, and GTP; (c) the recruitment of the 43S PIC to the mRNA via the interaction of eIF3 with eIF4G to form the 48S PIC; (d) the scanning of the 5′-UTR; and (e) the assembly of the 80S ribosome-initiation complex at the AUG start codon (9Hinnebusch A.G.

They involve (a) phosphorylation of translational inhibitor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which prevents its interaction with eIF4E and facilitates eIF4E binding to eIF4G to form the eIF4F cap-binding complex, and (b) eIF3-mediated activation of mTOR effector, the 40S ribosomal kinase 1 (S6K1), which results in enhanced assembly of the 48S PIC and, therefore, increased protein synthesis (10Gao B.

However, ineffectiveness or resistance in monotherapy setting and/or toxicity in combination limited their clinical utility. Here we focus on expanding our understanding of the role of the translation initiation factor eIF3 in tumor biology. eIF3 is a large complex composed of 13 nonidentical subunits (eIF3a-m) in human cells. Current model proposes that the assembly of eIF3 starts with the interaction of eIF3a and eIF3b to form the eIF3 nucleation core. The association of eIF3g and eIF3i to eIF3b gives rise to the subcomplex known as yeast-like core (YLC). Then, the sequential interaction of the seven subunits eIF3c, eIF3e, eIF3f, eIF3h, eIF3k, eIF3l, and eIF3m with eIF3a forms the eIF3 octamer. The nonoctameric eIF3d subunit joins eIF3 complex through its binding to eIF3e (20Valášek L.S. Zeman J. Wagner S. Beznosková P. Pavlíková Z. Mohammad M.P. Hronová V. Herrmannová A. Hashem Y.

Overexpression of eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3h, eIF3i, and eIF3m, or underexpression of eIF3e and eIF3f have been reported in several cancers, including breast tumors (12Chu J. Cargnello M.

First evidence supporting a role for eIF3 in cancer biology was obtained by ectopic overexpression of individual subunits in NIH3T3 cells. Ectopic expression of eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3h, and eIF3i stimulates global protein synthesis and translation of mRNAs that encode growth-regulating proteins, and leads to malignant transformation. In contrast, ectopic expression of eIF3e and eIF3f inhibits protein synthesis and decreases cell growth and proliferation (22Zhang L. Pan X. Hershey J.W. Individual overexpression of five subunits of human translation initiation factor eIF3 promotes malignant transformation of immortal fibroblast cells.J. Biol.

Recent studies have demonstrated that changes in the levels of a single eIF3 subunit can affect the expression of other subunits and result in the formation of eIF3 subcomplexes responsible for the translation of specific set of mRNAs (23Wagner S.

These results indicate that altered levels of individual eIF3 subunits and, therefore, the formation of the eIF3 complex and/or subcomplexes significantly define the translational landscape of cancer cells. To investigate the role of eIF3 in breast cancer biology, we have determined the levels of eIF3a, eIF3b, and eIF3f in a panel of breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we observed lower levels of eIF3f in ER-positive cells compared with ER-negative cells. Our studies demonstrate that genomic and nongenomic estrogen-ERα pathways coordinately fine-tune the expression of eIF3f in ER-positive MCF7 cells. This tight regulation buffers the levels of eIF3f to ensure the synthesis of factors required for estrogen-dependent cell proliferation and survival.

Particularly, elevated levels of eIF3a and eIF3b and reduced levels of eIF3f are observed in breast cancers (21Hershey J.W. The role of eIF3 and its individual subunits in cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1849 (25450521): 792-80010.1016/j.bbagrm.2014.10.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). eIF3a and eIF3b subunits serve as the nucleation core around which other subunits assemble to form the eIF3 complex, and eIF3f plays a critical role in stabilizing the complex (23Wagner S. Herrmannová A. Šikrová D. Valášek L.S. Human eIF3b and eIF3a serve as the nucleation core for the assembly of eIF3 into two interconnected modules: The yeast-like core and the octamer.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27924037): 10772-1078810.1093/nar/gkw972Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of these proteins in breast cancer biology, we first evaluated their expression in a panel of ER-positive (MCF7, T47D, ZR75.1, and MDA-MB-361) and ER-negative (BT-474, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-436) breast cancer cells (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we observed a notably reduced expression of eIF3f in ER-positive cells compared with ER-negative cells. However, the expression levels of eIF3a were quite similar among cell lines, and eIF3b levels were significantly higher in BT-474 cells compared with the ER-positive and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Our results suggested that eIF3f expression in ER-positive breast cancer cells may be a function of the estrogen-ER pathway. We first asked whether EIF3F gene is a direct target of the genomic estrogen-ER pathway. We measured the levels of the eIF3f mRNA in response to vehicle or estrogen stimulation in MCF7 cells by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2A, right plot). We found a significant reduction in the amount of the eIF3f mRNA starting at 12 h of estrogen treatment. As expected, the levels of the TFF1 mRNA, a well-characterized ER target gene, significantly increased at earlier time points (6 h) (Fig. 2A, left plot). In contrast, the amount of the eIF3a mRNA did not change and the levels of the eIF3b mRNA only showed a significant increase at the 6-h time point (Fig. S1). To rule out the possibility that estrogen affects the stability of the eIF3f mRNA, we determined its half-life. In vehicle- and estrogen-stimulated MCF7 cells, the half-life of the eIF3f mRNA was ∼12 h (Fig. 2B, right plot). Interestingly, we found that estrogen treatment significantly stabilized the TFF1 mRNA, in addition to positively regulating TFF1 transcription (Fig. 2B, left plot). Next, we investigated the effect of tamoxifen on EIF3F transcription. As expected, tamoxifen antagonized estrogen-mediated activation of TFF1 transcription, but, like estrogen, it repressed EIF3F transcription (Fig. 2C). Additionally, we confirmed that neither estrogen nor tamoxifen affects the amount of the eIF3f mRNA in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, estrogen induces transcriptional repression of the EIF3F gene. To confirm that ERα directly affects the observed response to estrogen, we performed specific silencing of ERα and determined the levels of the eIF3f mRNA in control or ERα-silenced MCF7 cells treated with vehicle or estrogen for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3A, suppression of ERα expression prevented ligand-induced repression of EIF3F transcription. As expected, we detected reduced levels of the TFF1 mRNA in estrogen-stimulated ERα-silenced cells compared with control cells. In addition, we confirmed ERα silencing by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the amount of the eIF3f protein did not significantly change under any experimental condition, although mRNA levels did (Fig. 3 and Fig. S2). These results suggest that the decrease in eIF3f mRNA levels by the estrogen-ERα complex is buffered by an increase in estrogen-stimulated mRNA translation, as demonstrated below. In contrast, we did not observe any effect of estrogen on the translation of the eIF3a and eIF3b mRNAs (Fig. 3B and Figs. S1 and S2). The mechanisms by which estrogen-bound ERα represses transcription are poorly understood. It has been proposed that early gene inhibition involves transient binding of ERα to the promoter and sequestration of limiting factors away from the repressed gene, a mechanism known as physiologic squelching. However, late gene inhibition (after 6 h of treatment) requires the binding of ERα and repressors or corepressors at sites adjacent to the repressed gene. Some reports indicate that the expression of specific repressors is induced by estrogen, which explains the lag (5Carroll J.S. Meyer C.A. Song J. Li W. Geistlinger T.R. Eeckhoute J. Brodsky A.S.

Endocrinol. 2014; 28 (25051172): 1522-153310.1210/me.2014-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2A suggested that estrogen-mediated repression of EIF3F transcription might occur according to the late inhibition model. However, we did not observe any change in the amount of eIF3f transcripts when estrogen-stimulated cells were pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 4A). These results indicated that estrogen-induced expression of a repressor was not required for EIF3F repression, and suggested regulation by physiologic squelching. To test this hypothesis, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using nuclear extracts from MCF7 cells treated with vehicle or estrogen for 30 min (Fig. 4B). For these studies, we used three pairs of primers to amplify different regions of the EIF3F promoter, and another pair that amplified an upstream region containing an experimentally identified ER-binding site (ERE). Distal EREs are involved in late gene inhibition (5Carroll J.S. Meyer C.A. Song J. Li W. Geistlinger T.R. Eeckhoute J. Brodsky A.S. Keeton E.K. Fertuck K.C. Hall G.F. Wang Q. Bekiranov S. Sementchenko V. Fox E.A. Silver P.A. Gingeras T.R. Liu X.S. Brown M. Genome-wide analysis of estrogen receptor binding sites.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38 (17013392): 1289-129710.1038/ng1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). As expected, we did not detect increased binding of ERα to this distal ERE upon estrogen stimulation. In contrast, we observed elevated binding of ERα to the EIF3F promoter in response to estrogen treatment, particularly to the region proximal to the transcription start site, which correlated with reduced loading of RNA polymerase II (Fig. 4B). However, these changes were much less pronounced compared with the differential binding observed at the TFF1 promoter, which contains a canonical ERE (Fig. 4C). These results indicated a transient and labile interaction of ERα with the EIF3F promoter and supported a physiologic squelching mechanism for estrogen-ERα repression of EIF3F transcription. Although transcription inhibition may occur as early as 30 min upon estrogen stimulation, changes in eIF3f mRNA levels were detectable at later times because of its ∼12-h half-life (Fig. 2B). We observed that estrogen-induced reduction of the eIF3f mRNA levels was not associated with a decrease in the eIF3f protein amount (Figs. 2A and 3, A and B). This result suggested that eIF3f expression is buffered by up-regulation of eIF3f mRNA translation in response to estrogen. This effect may be mediated by the mTORC1 pathway, which is activated in estrogen-treated MCF7 cells as indicated by the increased phosphorylation of its downstream targets S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3B). mTORC1 is activated by the nongenomic estrogen-ER pathway and, as previously described, is a key regulator of cap-dependent translation (7Levin E.R. Hammes S.R. Nuclear receptors outside the nucleus: Extranuclear signalling by steroid receptors.Nat. Rev. Mol.

To test this hypothesis, we evaluated protein synthesis using a Dual-Luciferase reporter system that monitors the ratio between cap-dependent and cap-independent translation initiation (Fig. 5A). We observed that estrogen stimulation increased cap-dependent translation by ∼ 2-fold, which was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with either mTORC1 (rapamycin) or ERα (fulvestrant) inhibitors (Fig. 5A). Additionally, we found that, unlike estrogen, tamoxifen failed to activate mRNA translation (Fig. 5A). These results support a role of estrogen-ERα signaling in the control of mRNA translation through the activation of mTORC1. mTORC1 regulates the formation of the cap-binding complex eIF4F and its interaction with eIF3 to form the 48S preinitiation complex (10Gao B.

Accordingly, we postulated that estrogen may enhance translation by promoting the assembly of the 48S PIC. To test this hypothesis, we isolated translation initiation complexes using m7GTP-agarose beads from MCF7 cells grown in DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS and supplemented with vehicle or estrogen. As shown in Fig. 5B, the binding of eIF4G and the eIF3 subunits eIF3a, eIF3b, and eIF3f to eIF4E increased in response to estrogen stimulation, whereas 4E-BP1 interaction with eIF4E decreased. As expected, inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin promoted the binding of dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 to eIF4E and, consequently, the dissociation of eIF4G and the eIF3 subunits from eIF4E. Additionally, we observed that inhibition of ER"

We showed recently that myocardial fibrosis and the loss of cardiac function in mice with transverse aortic constriction (TAC) could be averted by treatment with the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) peptide. Here, we used angiotensin II (AngII) infusion (2.1 mg/kg/day for 2 wk) in mice as a second model to confirm and extend our observations on the beneficial effects of CSD on heart and kidney disease. AngII caused cardiac hypertrophy (increased heart weight to body weight ratio (HW/BW) and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area); fibrosis in heart and kidney (increased levels of collagen I and heat shock protein-47 (HSP47)); and vascular leakage (increased levels of IgG in heart and kidney). Echocardiograms of AngII-infused mice showed increased left ventricular posterior wall thickness (pWTh) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), and decreased ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO). CSD treatment (i.p. injections, 50 μg/mouse/day) of AngII-infused mice significantly suppressed all of these pathological changes in fibrosis, hypertrophy, vascular leakage, and ventricular function. AngII infusion increased β1 and β3 integrin levels and activated Pyk2 in both heart and kidney. These changes were also suppressed by CSD. Finally, bone marrow cell (BMC) isolated from AngII-infused mice showed hyper-migration toward SDF1. When AngII-infused mice were treated with CSD, BMC migration was reduced to the basal level observed in cells from control mice. Importantly, CSD did not affect the AngII-induced increase in blood pressure (BP), indicating that the beneficial effects of CSD were not mediated via normalization of BP. These results strongly indicate that CSD suppresses AngII-induced pathological changes in mice, suggesting that CSD can be developed as a treatment for patients with hypertension and pressure overload-induced heart failure."

It is thus the mission of researchers to understand how humans process information to reach decisions. In order to facilitate this task, this work proposes LASSO regularization as a statistical tool to extract decisive words from textual content in order to study the reception of granular expressions in natural language. This differs from the usual use of the LASSO as a predictive model and, instead, yields highly interpretable statistical inferences between the occurrences of words and an outcome variable. Accordingly, the method suggests direct implications for the social sciences: it serves as a statistical procedure for generating domain-specific dictionaries as opposed to frequently employed heuristics. In addition, researchers can now identify text segments and word choices that are statistically decisive to authors or readers and, based on this knowledge, test hypotheses from behavioral research."

The Fourier theoretical model which is traditionally used to model such enclosures is not capable of considering several factors that affect a prediction that is often incorrect. These results motivate us to try to obtain a better thermal model of the enclosure. For this reason, a connexionist model is provided capable of modelling the behaviour of the enclosure from actual observed temperature data. For the training of this model, several measurements have been obtained over the course of more than one year in a specific enclosure, distributing the readings among the different layers of it. In this work, the predictions of both the theoretical model and the connexionist model have been tested, contrasting them with the measurements obtained previously. It has been observed that the connexionist model substantially improves the theoretical predictions of the Fourier method, thus allowing better approximations to be made regarding the real energy consumption of the building and, in general, the prediction of the energy behaviour of the enclosure."
https://openalex.org/W2906039748,"Soil respiration plays a crucial role in global carbon cycling. While the response of soil respiration to abiotic drivers like soil temperature and moisture is fairly well understood, less is known about the effects of biotic drivers, such as plant above- and belowground productivity or plant diversity, and their interactions with abiotic drivers on soil respiration. Thus, current predictions of soil respiration to summer droughts might miss relevant biological drivers and their interactions with abiotic drivers. Since drought events are expected to increase in Central Europe in the future, we simulated early summer drought using rainout shelters at 19 grassland sites, which differed in plant productivity and species richness in central Germany in 2002 and 2003. We tested the potentially interacting effects of drought with biotic drivers, i.e. annual above-ground productivity, species richness and root biomass, on the drought response of soil respiration in temperate grasslands. In both years, drought led to a significant reduction in soil respiration. The drought-induced reduction in soil respiration was largely driven by the reduction in above-ground productivity in response to drought. The extent of the drought response of soil respiration was dependent on the species richness level of the site and this interacting effect was explainable by the variation in root biomass (root biomass and species richness were positively correlated). Our findings highlight the importance of biotic drivers for the quantification of the drought response of soil respiration in grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2905762595,"Soil is one of the most complex systems on Earth, functioning at the interface between the lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere and generating a multitude of functions. Moreover, soil constitutes the belowground environment from which plants capture water and nutrients. Despite their great importance, soil properties are often not sufficiently considered in other disciplines, especially in spatial studies of plant distributions. Most soil properties are available as point data and, to be used in spatial analyses, need to be generalised over entire regions (i.e. digital soil mapping). Three categories of statistical approaches can be used for such purpose: geostatistical approaches (GSA), predictive-statistical approaches (PSA), and hybrid approaches (HA) that combine the two previous ones. How then to choose the best approach in a given soil study context? Does it depend on the soil properties to be spatialized, the study area's characteristics, and/or the availability of soil data? The main aims of this study was to review the use of these three approaches to derive maps of soil properties in relation to the soil parameters, the study area characteristics, and the number of soil samples. We evidenced that the approaches that tend to show the best performance for spatializing soil properties were not necessarily the ones most used in practice. Although PSA was the most widely used, it tended to be outperformed by HA in many cases, but the latter was far less used. However, as the study settings were not always properly described and not all situations were represented in the set of papers analysed, more comparative studies would be needed across a wider range of regions, soil properties, and spatial scales to provide robust conclusions on the best spatialization methods in a specific context."

Methods A total of 273 chronic HCV-1 patients receiving 8, 12, or 24 weeks of SOF/LDV with or without RBV were enrolled. The sustained virologic response rate at week 12 off-therapy (SVR12) by evaluable population (EP) and per-protocol population (PP) were assessed for effectiveness. The treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events (AEs) and serious AE rate were assessed for safety. Baseline patient characteristics and on-treatment HCV viral kinetics associated with SVR12 were analyzed. Results The SVR12 rates by EP and PP analyses were 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 93.9%-98.3%) and 97.5% (95% CI: 94.8%-98.8%), respectively. The rates of treatment discontinuation due to AE and serious AE were 0.4% and 4.4%, respectively. Seven patients with true virologic failure were relapsers. In 2 patients who were lost-to follow-up, one expired at treatment week 3 due to pneumonia which was considered not related to treatment, and one declined follow-up at off-therapy week 4. The SVR12 rates were comparable in terms of baseline patient characteristics and viral decline at week 4 of treatment. Conclusions SOF/LDV with or without RBV for 8–24 weeks is well tolerated and achieves a high SVR12 rate in patients with HCV-1 infection in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W2951581518,"Cell populations across nearly all forms of life generally maintain a characteristic cell type-dependent size, but how size control is achieved has been a long-standing question. The G1/S boundary of the cell cycle serves as a major point of size control, and mechanisms operating here restrict passage of cells to Start if they are too small. In contrast, it is less clear how size is regulated post-Start, during S/G2/M. To gain further insight into post-Start size control, we prepared budding yeast that can be reversibly blocked from bud initiation. While blocked, cells continue to grow isotropically, increasing their volume by more than an order of magnitude over unperturbed cells. Upon release from their block, giant mothers reenter the cell cycle and their progeny rapidly return to the original unperturbed size. We found this behavior to be consistent with a size-invariant 'timer' specifying the duration of S/G2/M. These results indicate that yeast use at least two distinct mechanisms at different cell cycle phases to ensure size homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2902928317,"Objective Empirical research that cannot be reproduced using the original dataset and software code (replication files) creates a credibility challenge, as it means those published findings are not verifiable. This study reports the results of a research audit exercise, known as the push button replication project, that tested a sample of studies that use similar empirical methods but span a variety of academic fields. Methods We developed and piloted a detailed protocol for conducting push button replication and determining the level of comparability of these replication findings to original findings. We drew a sample of articles from the ten journals that published the most impact evaluations from low- and middle-income countries from 2010 through 2012. This set includes health, economics, and development journals. We then selected all articles in these journals published in 2014 that meet the same inclusion criteria and implemented the protocol on the sample. Results Of the 109 articles in our sample, only 27 are push button replicable, meaning the provided code run on the provided dataset produces comparable findings for the key results in the published article. The authors of 59 of the articles refused to provide replication files. Thirty of these 59 articles were published in journals that had replication file requirements in 2014, meaning these articles are non-compliant with their journal requirements. For the remaining 23 of the 109 articles, we confirmed that three had proprietary data, we received incomplete replication files for 15, and we found minor differences in the replication results for five. Conclusion The findings presented here reveal that many economics, development, and public health researchers are a long way from adopting the norm of open research. Journals do not appear to be playing a strong role in ensuring the availability of replication files."

Twenty-one healthy subjects participated in the single-blinded, cross-over study. Each subject received anodal transcranial patterned direct current stimulation over the foot area of the right motor cortex during gait, sham stimulation during gait, and anodal transcranial patterned direct current stimulation during rest in a random order. Six subjects were excluded due to a failure in the experimental recording procedure. Complete-case analysis was performed using the data from the remaining 15 subjects. Self-paced gait speed and left leg stride length were significantly increased after the stimulation during gait, but not after the sham stimulation during gait or the stimulation during rest. In addition, a significant increase was found in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway of the left tibialis anterior muscle 30 min after stimulation during gait. Anodal transcranial patterned direct current stimulation during gait entrained the gait cycle to enhance motor cortical activity in some subjects. These findings suggest that the stimulation during gait induced neuroplasticity in corticospinal pathways driving flexor muscles during gait."
https://openalex.org/W2906632037,"The role of protein structural disorder in biological functions has gained increasing attention in the past decade. The bacterial acid-resistant chaperone HdeA belongs to a group of conditionally proteins, because it is inactive in its well-structured state and becomes activated via an order-to-disorder transition under acid stress. However, the mechanism for unfolding-induced activation remains unclear because of a lack of experimental information on the unfolded state conformation and the chaperone-client interactions. Herein, we used advanced solution NMR methods to characterize the activated-state conformation of HdeA under acidic conditions and identify its client-binding sites. We observed that the structure of activated HdeA becomes largely disordered and exposes two hydrophobic patches essential for client interactions. Furthermore, using the pH-dependent chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR method, we identified three acid-sensitive regions that act as structural locks in regulating the exposure of the two client-binding sites during the activation process, revealing a multistep activation mechanism of HdeA's chaperone function at the atomic level. Our results highlight the role of intrinsic protein disorder in chaperone function and the self-inhibitory role of ordered structures under nonstress conditions, offering new insights for improving our understanding of protein structure-function paradigms."

Methods Of the 1413 girls born in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, 846 had age at menarche recorded. Subsequently 557 underwent metabolic assessment at 17 years and 541 at 20 years. Associations between age at menarche and cardiovascular risk factors, and being in a high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 and 20 years, or having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years, were investigated by linear mixed effects and logistic regressions, respectively. Results Each year later of onset of menarche was associated with a 0.75 kg/m2 reduction in BMI (coefficient -0.75 [95%CI -1.06, -0.44]), and an approximate 30% reduction in the odds of being in the high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 years (OR = 0.73 [95%CI 0.57, 0.94]) and 20 years of age (OR = 0.68 [95%CI 0.52, 0.87]), and a 40% reduction in the odds of having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years (OR = 0.60 [95% CI 0.41, 0.88]). These data show earlier age at menarche was associated with increased BMI and odds of being in the high-risk metabolic cluster at 17 and 20 years, and increased odds of having the metabolic syndrome at 20 years. However, these associations were no longer statistically significant after adjustment for BMI at age 8 years. Current smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, socio-economic status, or hormonal contraceptives use did not affect these associations. Conclusions Earlier age at menarche may be indicative of a higher risk profile for CVD in young adulthood. Our findings suggest that targeted interventions to reduce BMI in girls who experience menarche at younger age may reduce CVD risk in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2905951791,"Neural tube closure requires apical constriction during which contraction of the apical F-actin network forces the cell into a wedged shape, facilitating the folding of the neural plate into a tube. However, how F-actin assembly at the apical surface is regulated in mammalian neurulation remains largely unknown. We report here that formin homology 2 domain-containing 3 (Fhod3), a formin protein that mediates F-actin assembly, is essential for cranial neural tube closure in mouse embryos. We found that Fhod3 is expressed in the lateral neural plate but not in the floor region of the closing neural plate at the hindbrain. Consistently, in Fhod3-null embryos, neural plate bending at the midline occurred normally, but lateral plates seemed floppy and failed to flex dorsomedially. Because the apical accumulation of F-actin and constriction were impaired specifically at the lateral plates in Fhod3-null embryos, we concluded that Fhod3-mediated actin assembly contributes to lateral plate-specific apical constriction to advance closure. Intriguingly, Fhod3 expression at the hindbrain was restricted to neuromeric segments called rhombomeres. The rhombomere-specific accumulation of apical F-actin induced by the rhombomere-restricted expression of Fhod3 was responsible for the outward bulging of rhombomeres involving apical constriction along the anteroposterior axis, as rhombomeric bulging was less prominent in Fhod3-null embryos than in the wild type. Fhod3 thus plays a crucial role in the morphological changes associated with neural tube closure at the hindbrain by mediating apical constriction not only in the mediolateral but also in the anteroposterior direction, thereby contributing to tube closure and rhombomere segmentation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2906213981,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) is an aggressive mesenchymal tumor of the bone that affects children and occurs spontaneously in dogs. Human and canine OSA share similar clinical, biological and genetic features, which make dogs an excellent comparative model to investigate the etiology and pathogenesis of OSA. Mitochondrial (mt) defects have been reported in many different cancers including OSA, although it is not known whether these defects contribute to OSA progression and metastasis. Taking a comparative approach using canine OSA cell lines and tumor tissues we investigated the effects of mtDNA content and dysfunction on OSA biology. OSA tumor tissues had low mtDNA contents compared to the matched non-tumor tissues. We observed mitochondrial heterogeneity among the OSA cell lines and the most invasive cells expressing increased levels of OSA metastasis genes contained the highest amount of mitochondrial defects (reduced mtDNA copies, mt respiration, and expression of electron transport chain proteins). While mitochondria maintain a filamentous network in healthy cells, the mitochondrial morphology in OSA cells were mostly ""donut shaped"", typical of ""stressed"" mitochondria. Moreover the expression levels of mitochondrial retrograde signaling proteins Akt1, IGF1R, hnRNPA2 and NFkB correlated with the invasiveness of the OSA cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the causal role of mitochondrial defects in inducing the invasive phenotype by Ethidium Bromide induced-mtDNA depletion in OSA cells. Our data suggest that defects in mitochondrial genome and function are prevalent in OSA and that lower mtDNA content is associated with higher tumor cell invasiveness. We propose that mt defects in OSA might serve as a prognostic biomarker and a target for therapeutic intervention in OSA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2906479524,"Previous studies have shown that a cytosine (C) to thymine (T) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) gene is associated with positive emotional processing. C allele carriers are more sensitive to positive emotional stimuli including happiness. The effects of several gene polymorphisms related to sensitivity to emotional stimuli, such as that in the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5HTTLPR), on emotional processing have been reported to differ among cultures–e.g., between those that are independent and interdependent. Thus, we postulated that the effects of the CNR1 genotype on happiness might differ among different cultures because the concept of happiness varies by culture. We recruited healthy male and female young adults in Japan, where favorable external circumstances determine the concept of happiness, and Canada, where the concept of happiness centers on positive inner feelings, and compared the effects of the CNR1 genotype on both subjective happiness levels (self-evaluation as being a happy person) and situation-specific happiness (happy feelings accompanying various positive events) by using a questionnaire. We found that the effect of CNR1 on subjective happiness was different between the Japanese and Canadian groups. The subjective happiness level was the highest in Japanese individuals with the CC genotype, whereas in Canadian participants, it was the highest in individuals with the TT genotype. Furthermore, the effects of CNR1 genotype on situation-specific happiness were also different between the groups. Happiness accompanied with being surrounded by happy people was the highest among Japanese individuals with the CC genotype, whereas among Canadian individuals, it was the highest in TT genotype carriers. These findings suggest that culture and CNR1 polymorphism interact to influence the perception of happiness."

We recently identified a novel type of monocytic cell termed follicular dendritic cell-induced monocytic cells (FDMCs), whose differentiation depended on CSF-1R signaling through the IL-34 produced from a follicular dendritic cell line, FL-Y. Here, we report the functional mechanisms of the IL-34–mediated CSF-1R signaling underlying FDMC differentiation. CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the Il34 gene confirmed that the ability of FL-Y cells to induce FDMCs completely depends on the IL-34 expressed by FL-Y cells. Transwell culture experiments revealed that FDMC differentiation requires a signal from a membrane-anchored form of IL-34 on the FL-Y cell surface, but not from a secreted form, in a direct interaction between FDMC precursor cells and FL-Y cells. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis using an anti–IL-34 antibody indicated that IL-34 was also expressed on the FL-Y cell surface. Thus, we explored proteins interacting with IL-34 in FL-Y cells. Mass spectrometry analysis and pulldown assay identified that IL-34 was associated with the molecular chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) in the plasma membrane fraction of FL-Y cells. Consistent with this finding, GRP78-heterozygous FL-Y cells expressed a lower level of IL-34 protein on their cell surface and exhibited a reduced competency to induce FDMC differentiation compared with the original FL-Y cells. These results indicated a novel GRP78-dependent localization and specific function of IL-34 in FL-Y cells related to monocytic cell differentiation.

Moreover, Il34 gene expression driven by the Csf1 promoter was shown to rescue the bone, osteoclast, tissue macrophage, and fertility defects of CSF1op/op mice; thus, IL-34 is considered to have redundant function with CSF-1 (2Wei S.

In these reports, disruption of IL-34 resulted in a selective defect of maintenance and differentiation of Langerhans cells and microglia. These studies therefore concluded that the IL-34 dependence of Langerhans and microglial cell differentiation was a result of the spatiotemporal difference between IL-34 and CSF-1 expression in the microenvironments during development of these cell lineages. However, it remains controversial whether IL-34 and CSF-1 exhibit identical activity with regard to CSF-1R signaling, because the binding affinity of IL-34 for CSF-1R is higher than that of CSF-1 (11Ma X.

Germinal centers (GCs) comprise transiently formed microenvironments in secondary lymphoid tissues after immunization, which are mainly composed of antigen (Ag)-activated B cells, follicular helper T cells, and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). In GCs, Ag-activated B cells introduce somatic hypermutation in their Ig variable gene, and subsequently high-affinity B cells for a given antigen are clonally selected by the interaction with FDC and/or follicular helper T cells (16Liu M. Schatz D.G.

Toward this end, we previously established a mouse FDC line, FL-Y, from the lymph nodes of Ag-primed mice (22Nishikawa Y. Hikida M. Magari M. Kanayama N. Mori M. Kitamura H. Kurosaki T. Ohmori H. Establishment of lymphotoxin β receptor signaling-dependent cell lines with follicular dendritic cell phenotypes from mouse lymph nodes.J.

FL-Y cells express major FDC markers, including FDC-M1, FcγRIIβ, and complement receptor, and proliferate in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and an agonistic anti-lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) antibody. FL-Y cells are also capable of supporting the viability of GC B cells, thereby constituting a useful tool for analyzing GC reactions in vitro (23Aungier S.R. Ohmori H. Clinton M. Mabbott N.A. MicroRNA-100–5p indirectly modulates the expression of Il6, Ptgs1/2 and Tlr4 mRNA in the mouse follicular dendritic cell-like cell line, FL-Y.Immunology. 2015; 144 (24944008): 34-4410.1111/imm.12342Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we established a manipulated FL-Y line, termed FL-YB, which was transfected with an expression vector for B cell–activating factor belonging to the TNF family (BAFF), and exhibits enhanced activity for supporting GC-phenotype B cell viability (24Magari M. Nishikawa Y. Fujii Y. Nishio Y. Watanabe K. Fujiwara M. Kanayama N. Ohmori H. IL-21-dependent B cell death driven by prostaglandin E2, a product secreted from follicular dendritic cells.J.

Previously, we also found that FL-Y cells induced the differentiation of a novel class of monocytic cells, termed FDC-induced monocytic cells (FDMCs), from the population of T cell– and B cell–depleted c-kit+CD11b− splenocytes in vitro (26Yamane F.

Notably, FDMCs accelerated the proliferation of GC-phenotype B cells in anti-CD40 mAb-stimulated B cells. Furthermore, using RNAi-mediated knockdown of Il34 mRNA expression and Ab-mediated blockage of IL-34 and CSF-1R functions, we identified that IL-34, but not CSF-1, was a critical cytokine for stimulating FDMC differentiation, although FL-Y produced both IL-34 and CSF-1 (26Yamane F.

Therefore, in the present study we explored the functional mechanisms of the IL-34 produced by FL-Y cells for FDMC differentiation. To further confirm the IL-34–dependent differentiation of FDMCs, we first established IL-34 KO FL-Y cells by using the CRISPER/Cas9 system to eliminate IL-34 expression. A small transacting guide RNA (gRNA) and a targeting vector for disrupting the Il34 gene were designed against exon 3 of the Il34 gene, in which the LacZ gene was inserted for generating IL-34 KO mice as in the previous reports (Fig. 1A) (12Greter M. Lelios I. Pelczar P. Hoeffel G. Price J. Leboeuf M. Kündig T.M. Frei K. Ginhoux F. Merad M. Becher B. Stroma-derived interleukin-34 controls the development and maintenance of Langerhans cells and the maintenance of microglia.Immunity. 2012; 37 (23177320): 1050-106010.1016/j.immuni.2012.11.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 13Wang Y.

FL-Y cells were transfected simultaneously with expression vectors for the gRNA and Cas9, along with IL-34–targeting vectors, and the successful replacement of exon 3 with the targeting vector was determined using genomic PCR. We established three independent clones in which a puromycin-resistance (clone 1) or blasticidin S–resistance gene (clone 2), respectively, was inserted into a single Il34 allele by a single transfection and wherein these two drug-resistance marker genes were inserted in both Il34 alleles by sequential transfection (clone 3). As shown in Fig. 1B, genomic PCR products indicated successful knockout of the Il34 allele by drug-resistance genes in IL-34 KO FL-Y cells. Sequencing analysis of genomic PCR products (F/R) in clones 1 and 2 showed that another allele was also inactivated by a 197- or 57-bp deletion in the vicinity of the gRNA-binding site, respectively (Fig. S1A). RT-PCR analysis using a primer pair (F/R) for amplifying the coding region of Il34 showed that expression of functional Il34 mRNA was undetectable in IL-34 KO FL-Y lines, whereas smaller DNA fragments were amplified in all clones (clones 1–3) (Fig. 1C). Sequencing analysis of smaller fragments amplified from clones 1, 2, and 3 cDNAs showed that Il34 mRNA in clones 1, 2, and 3 did not include exon 3, resulting in an encoded nonfunctional protein (Fig. S1B). Consistent with this, no PCR products were amplified by using the exon 3–specific primer (ex3F) in IL-34 KO clones (clones 1–3). In contrast, Csf1 mRNA expression levels in IL-34 KO FL-Y lines were comparable with that in the original FL-Y cells (Fig. 1C). To explore the ability of IL-34 KO FL-Y cell lines to induce FDMCs, we cultured T cell–depleted splenocytes on an IL-34 KO FL-Y cell layer. After 9 days, the number of CD11b+ cells induced on the IL-34 KO FL-Y cell lines was significantly decreased compared with that on the original FL-Y cell line (Fig. 1, D and E). Furthermore, because receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ and syndecan-1 were found to function as additional IL-34 receptors (27Nandi S. Cioce M. Yeung Y.G. Nieves E. Tesfa L. Lin H.

Nishikawa Y. Matsui K. Asakura M. Iwasaki E. Watanabe K. Tanimoto H. Sano H. Fujiwara Y. Stanley E.R. Kanayama N. Mabbott N.A. Magari M. Ohmori H. CSF-1 receptor-mediated differentiation of a new type of monocytic cell with B cell-stimulating activity: its selective dependence on IL-34.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2014; 95 (24052571): 19-3110.1189/jlb.0613311Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Notably, when GW2580 was added to the culture for FDMC induction, the generation of CD11b+ cells was completely suppressed (Fig. 1F). These data strongly supported that CSF-1R signaling through the IL-34 expressed by FL-Y plays a critical role in FDMC differentiation and that IL-34 KO FL-Y lines represent useful tools to study the functional mechanisms of IL-34 underlying FDMC differentiation. In addition, the IL-34–dependent differentiation and immunological significance of FDMCs in vivo were confirmed by immunizing IL-34 KO mice with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl-conjugated chicken γ globulin plus alum, and the number of CD11b+CD115+ cells in the CD3e−B220−I-Ad−CD11c− population was examined because this population contained the in vivo counterpart of FDMCs in the spleen of immunized mice as previously described (26Yamane F.

Biol. 2014; 95 (24052571): 19-3110.1189/jlb.0613311Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the number of CD11b+CD115+ cells among the splenocytes of IL-34 KO mice was significantly decreased compared with that in WT mice (Fig. S2, A and B). Furthermore, anti-NP IgG titer in the sera of IL-34 KO mice was lower than that of WT mice, although IgM titer was comparable between WT and IL-34 KO mice (Fig. S2C). These results suggested that IL-34 might be involved in the antibody response associated with the class switch recombination. To explore the IL-34–dependent mechanisms underlying FDMC differentiation on the FL-Y cell layer, we first used a Transwell culture system to block the cell–cell contact of FDMC precursor cells with FL-Y cells. When FL-Y cells were physically separated from the FDMC precursor cells by a Transwell membrane, the number of CD11b+ cells generated was significantly reduced to a level comparable with that on IL-34 KO FL-Y cells (Fig. 2A). We next treated FL-Y and IL-34 KO FL-Y cells with 0.1% paraformaldehyde (PFA). PFA treatment of living cells can block the transport of newly translated intracellular proteins to extracellular compartments by cross-linking the molecules expressed on the cell surface (29Zhang M. Tang H. Guo Z. An H. Zhu X. Song W. Guo J. Huang X. Chen T. Wang J. Cao X. Splenic stroma drives mature dendritic cells to differentiate into regulatory dendritic cells.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5 (15475957): 1124-113310.1038/ni1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Notably, CD11b+ cells were still generated on the PFA-treated FL-Y cell line, indicating that the ability of FL-Y to induce FDMCs was maintained in the absence of secreted IL-34 molecules produced from FL-Y cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover, culture supernatants of PFA-treated FL-Y cells exhibited no stimulating activity for the M-NFS 60 cell line, whose cell growth depended on CSF-1R signaling (Fig. S3A). To further ascertain the potential role of soluble IL-34 secreted from FL-Y cells in FDMC differentiation, secreted IL-34 protein purified from the culture supernatant of FL-Y cells overexpressing IL-34 was added to the culture for FDMC induction. However, generation of CD11b+ cells cultured on the original FL-Y cells was not increased by the addition of purified IL-34, suggesting no additive effects of soluble IL-34 on FDMC differentiation (Fig. S3B). These results indicated that there is little or no contribution of secreted IL-34 to FDMC differentiation and that another form of IL-34 in FL-Y cells might function in this regard. Next, we analyzed IL-34 localization on the FL-Y cell surface because FDMC differentiation was observed on PFA-treated FL-Y cells that were deficient in IL-34 secretion. When FL-Y cells were stained with an anti-mouse IL-34 Ab, an IL-34 signal was slightly detected on the cell surface of FL-Y cells, whereas signal was completely abolished on IL-34 KO FL-Y cells (Fig. 2C). It has been reported that the differentiation and growth of mononuclear phagocytes are stimulated by the soluble form of IL-34 because of the absence of the membrane-spanning domain in the IL-34 amino acid sequence (10Lin H. Lee E. Hestir K. Leo C. Huang M. Bosch E. Halenbeck R. Wu G. Zhou A. Behrens D. Hollenbaugh D. Linnemann T. Qin M. Wong J. Chu K. Doberstein S.K. et al.Discovery of a cytokine and its receptor by functional screening of the extracellular proteome.Science. 2008; 320 (18467591): 807-81110.1126/science.1154370Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In contrast, flow cytometric analysis of FL-Y cells showed a detectable level of cell-surface localization of IL-34, although it is difficult to analyze how IL-34 is anchored on the cell surface because only an extremely small amount of IL-34 is expressed in FL-Y cells. Therefore, we generated an FL-Y cell line expressing twin-Strep-tagged IL-34 to identify the molecule(s) regulating IL-34 expression on the FL-Y cell surface. The twin-Strep-tag, composed of two Strep-tag peptides (WSHPQFEK) connected by a short linker (GGGSGGGSGGSA), is useful for detecting and purifying target molecules by using anti–Strep-tag mAb and Strep-Tactin–conjugated resin, respectively (30Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Use of the Strep-Tag and streptavidin for detection and purification of recombinant proteins.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326 (11036648): 271-30410.1016/S0076-6879(00)26060-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The twin-Strep-tag sequence was inserted between the signal sequence and the mature protein sequence of IL-34, and the N-terminal twin-Strep-tagged IL-34 was introduced to FL-Y cells by retroviral transduction (FL-Y–IL-34–Nst). Western blotting analyses using an anti–IL-34 Ab and an anti–Strep-tag mAb showed that Strep-tagged IL-34 protein was detectable in the cell lysate of FL-Y–IL-34–Nst cells but not in the lysates of the original FL-Y and IL-34 KO FL-Y cells (Fig. 3A). In comparison, the endogenous IL-34 signal was not detected by Western blotting with the anti–IL-34 Ab, likely because FL-Y cells express intracellular and cell surface IL-34 at extremely low levels (Fig. 3A). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the IL-34–Nst protein was detectable on the cell surface of FL-Y–IL-34–Nst cells using either the anti–IL-34 Ab or anti–Strep-tag mAb and that the expression level of IL-34 on FL-Y–IL-34–Nst cells was significantly higher than that on the original FL-Y cells (Fig. 3B). To determine the biological activity of IL-34–Nst protein, IL-34–Nst in the conditioned medium collected from FL-Y–IL-34–Nst culture was purified by using Strep-Tactin–conjugated Sepharose and applied for stimulation of the M-NFS60 cell line (Fig. S4A). Purified IL-34–Nst protein prepared from the FL-Y–IL-34–Nst culture exhibited a biological activity for stimulating CSF-1R signaling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S4B). Furthermore, soluble IL-34–Nst protein was highly glycosylated at levels comparable with those of the commercially available rIL-34 protein (Fig. S4, C and D). Next, to examine whether FL-Y–IL-34–Nst cells exhibited an enhanced activity to induce FDMCs, we performed culture for FDMC induction under PFA-treated conditions. As shown in Fig. 3C, the FDMC-inducing activity of"

Trimmed Iterative Closest Point algorithm is a prevalent method for registration of two partially overlapping clouds. However, it relies heavily on the initial value and is liable to be trapped in to local optimum. In this paper, we adapt the Differential Evolution algorithm to obtain global optimal solution. By design appropriate evolutionary operations, the algorithm can make the populations distributed more widely, and keep the individuals from concentrating to a local optimum. In the experiment, the proposed algorithm is compared with existing methods which are based on global optimization algorithm such as Genetic Algorithm and particle filters. And the results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is more robust and can converge to a good result in fewer generations."
https://openalex.org/W2906597928,"Background The prevalence of heart failure (HF) and its economic burden are increasing with age of the South Korean population. This study aimed to assess the economic impact of HF from the societal perspective. Methods A prevalence-based, incremental cost-of-patient study was performed to estimate the cost ratio between patients with HF and those without HF based on the claims database of the national health insurance in South Korea. We defined adult HF patients as those aged ≥19 years who had at least one insurance claim record with a primary or secondary diagnosis of HF. Age- and gender-matched controls were defined using a 1:4 greedy matching method. Costs were estimated by including medical costs for insurance-covered and non-covered services, transportation costs, caregiver’s cost, and time costs of patients. The ratio of costs between patients with HF and those without HF was adjusted for age, gender, and type of universal health security program in the multivariate regression model. Results The average annual per-capita cost was estimated to be $6,601 for patients with HF (n = 14,252), which is about 3.38 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.31–3.46) times higher than that for patients without HF (n = 1,116,882) and 1.64 (95% CI: 1.59–1.70) times higher than that for the age- and gender-matched patients without HF (n = 57,008). In the multivariate regression model, the annual per-capita total costs were 1.98-fold (95% CI: 1.94–2.02) statistically higher for patients with HF than for patients without HF after adjustment for age, gender, and type of universal health security program. Conclusions This study demonstrates a significant incremental burden of HF. Given that the prevalence of HF is expected to increase with an increase in the aging population, the national economic burden is expected to be substantial in the future. Thus, greater emphasis on the prevention and treatment of HF is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2904757677,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare and progressive systemic disease affecting mainly young women of childbearing age. A deterioration in lung function is driven by neoplastic growth of atypical smooth muscle-like LAM cells in the pulmonary interstitial space that leads to cystic lung destruction and spontaneous pneumothoraces. Therapeutic options for preventing disease progression are limited and often end with lung transplantation temporarily delaying an inevitable decline. To identify new therapeutic strategies for this crippling orphan disease, we have performed array based and metabolic molecular analysis on patient-derived cell lines. Our results point to the conclusion that mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction in LAM cells provide a novel target for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2905661340,"Habitats with alkaline edaphic substrates are often associated with plant speciation and diversification. The tribe Alysseae, in the family Brassicaceae, epitomizes this evolutionary trend. In this lineage, some genera, like Hormathophylla, can serve as a good case for testing the evolutionary framework. This genus is centered in the western Mediterranean. It grows on different substrates, but mostly on alkaline soils. It has been suggested that diversification in many lineages of the tribe Alysseae and in the genus Hormathophylla is linked to a tolerance for high levels of Mg+2 in xeric environments. In this study, we investigated the controversial phylogenetic placement of Hormathophylla in the tribe, the generic limits and the evolutionary relationships between the species using ribosomal and plastid DNA sequences. We also examined the putative association between the evolution of different ploidy levels, trichome morphology and the type of substrates. Our analyses demonstrated the monophyly of the genus Hormathophylla including all previously described species. Nuclear sequences revealed two lineages that differ in basic chromosome numbers (x = 7 and x = 8 or derived 11, 15) and in their trichome morphology. Contrasting results with plastid genes indicates more complex relationships between these two lineages involving recent hybridization processes. We also found an association between chloroplast haplotypes and substrate, especially in populations growing on dolomites. Finally, our dated phylogeny demonstrates that the origin of the genus took place in the mid-Miocene, during the establishment of temporal land bridges between the Tethys and Paratethys seas, with a later diversification during the upper Pliocene."
https://openalex.org/W2906590179,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) exerts dual effects, anabolic or catabolic, on bone when administrated intermittently or continuously, via mechanisms that remain largely unknown. PTH binding to cells induces PTH-responsive genes including primary response genes (PRGs). PRGs are rapidly induced without the need for de novo protein synthesis, thereby playing pivotal roles in directing subsequent molecular responses. In this study, to understand the role of PRGs in mediating osteoblastic cellular responses to PTH, we investigated whether various durations of PTH differentially induce PRGs in primary osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1. Nurr1 and RANKL, PRGs known for their anabolic and catabolic roles in bone metabolism respectively, presented distinctive transient vs. sustained induction kinetics. Corroborating their roles, maximum induction of Nurr1 was sufficiently achieved by brief PTH in as little as 30 minutes and continued beyond that, while maximum induction of RANKL was achieved only by prolonged PTH over 4 hours. Our data suggested distinctive regulatory mechanisms for Nurr1 and RANKL: PKA-mediated chromatin rearrangement for transcriptional regulation of both PRGs and ERK-mediated transcriptional regulation for RANKL but not Nurr1. Lastly, we classified PRGs into two groups based on the induction kinetics: The group that required brief PTH for maximum induction included Nur77, cox-2, and Nurr1, all of which are reported to play roles in bone formation. The other group that required prolonged PTH for maximum induction included IL-6 and RANKL, which play roles in bone resorption. Together, our data suggested the crucial role of PRG groups in mediating differential osteoblastic cellular responses to intermittent vs. continuous PTH. Continued research into the regulatory mechanisms of PKA and ERK for PRGs will help us better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the dual effects of PTH, thereby optimizing the current therapeutic use of PTH for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2905863600,"Classically, in the bouba-kiki association task, a subject is asked to find the best association between one of two shapes–a round one and a spiky one–and one of two pseudowords–bouba and kiki. Numerous studies report that spiky shapes are associated with kiki, and round shapes with bouba. This task is likely the most prevalent in the study of non-conventional relationships between linguistic forms and meanings, also known as sound symbolism. However, associative tasks are explicit in the sense that they highlight phonetic and visual contrasts and require subjects to establish a crossmodal link between stimuli of different natures. Additionally, recent studies have raised the question whether visual resemblances between the target shapes and the letters explain the pattern of association, at least in literate subjects. In this paper, we report a more implicit testing paradigm of the bouba-kiki effect with the use of a lexical decision task with character strings presented in round or spiky frames. Pseudowords and words are, furthermore, displayed with either an angular or a curvy font to investigate possible graphemic bias. Innovative analyses of response times are performed with GAMLSS models, which offer a large range of possible distributions of error terms, and a generalized Gama distribution is found to be the most appropriate. No sound symbolic effect appears to be significant, but an interaction effect is in particular observed between spiky shapes and angular letters leading to faster response times. We discuss these results with respect to the visual saliency of angular shapes, priming, brain activation, synaesthesia and ideasthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2906315401,"The purpose of this descriptive study was to assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in participants who voluntarily participated in a fitness assessment, and to examine associations with routine nutrition intake and overall body composition. One hundred and six participants were recruited. Anthropometric measurements were taken with blood analyses completed for fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipid panel. A 24-hour diet recall and a dietary screening survey was used to assess nutrient intake, in a sub-set of 36 participants. Statistical analyses utilized partial Spearmans' rank correlations, risk ratios, and Kendall's Tau correlations, with significance level at p < 0.05. Twenty five percent of this sample had ≥ three risk factors for MetS, with elevated fasting glucose and blood pressure being the most prevalent. Twenty percent of the participants had HbA1c levels elevated at the prediabetes range, with no previous diagnosis. Four percent of participants had HbA1c levels elevated at the T2DM range. Two nutrients of interest were correlated to BMI status. Percent kcal from carbohydrate (τ -0.207, p<0.05) had a negative correlation with BMI status and percent kcal from fat intake had a positive correlation (τ 0.217, p<0.05). Findings from this small sample of adults indicate the need for routine assessment of: clustering of MetS risk factors, risk of prediabetes and T2DM and treatment of same. Many participants would benefit from increasing their participation in physical activity, weight loss in regard to overall health improvement, and education to improve diet quality."

Starting from this observation, we develop a statistical factor model, the random factor model, in which factors are chosen at random based on the random projection method. Randomness of factors has the consequence that covariance matrix is well preserved in a linear factor representation. It also enables derivation of probabilistic bounds for the accuracy of the random factor representation of time-series, their cross-correlations and covariances. As an application, we analyze reproduction of time-series and their cross-correlation coefficients in the well-diversified Russell 3,000 equity index."
https://openalex.org/W2906016187,"We introduce a mathematical model of an absorbing leaky epithelium to reconsider the problem formulated by Diamond and Bossert in 1967: whether ""… some distinctive physiological properties of epithelia might arise as geometrical consequences of epithelial ultrastructure"". A standing gradient model of the intercellular cleft (IC) is presented that includes tight junctions (TJ) and ion channels uniformly distributed along the whole cleft. This nonlinear system has an intrinsic homogeneous concentration and the spatial scale necessary to establish it along the cleft. These parameters have not been elucidated so far. We further provide non-perturbative analytical approximations for a broad range of parameters. We found that narrowing of the IC increases ion concentration dramatically and can therefore prevent outflow through tight junctions (TJs) and the lateral membrane, as long as extremely high luminal osmolarities are not reached. Our model predicts that the system is to some extent self-regulating and thereby prevents fluxes into the lumen. Recent experimental evidence has shown that liver-intestine (LI) cadherin can control the up/down flux in intestines via regulation of the cleft width. This finding is in full agreement with predictions of our model. We suggest that LI-cadherin may increase water transport through epithelia via sequential narrowing of the cleft, starting from the highest concentration area at the beginning of the cleft and triggering a propagating squeezing motion."
