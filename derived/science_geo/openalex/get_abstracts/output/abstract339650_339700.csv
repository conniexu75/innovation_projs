The physicochemical and biological properties of this virus-inhibitor are similar to those of interferon induced by Newcastle disease virus, except for an instability at pH 2 and 10 and at 56 degrees C."

No thymine dimers were observed, but three other thymine photoproducts were found. The unknown products of radiation were produced in vitro by irradiation of DNA that had been dried in the, presence of various salts."
https://openalex.org/W1990151245,American goldfinch females recognize individual males by their individually distinctive flight calls. Goldfinches and other cardueline finch species are also capable of learning new flight calls by imitation during pair and flock formation. Vocal imitation can occur between members of different species as well as between members of the same species. Learning of new flight calls differs in several respects from typical passerine song learning.
https://openalex.org/W2003041596,"In four epithelial cell systems (salivary gland, renal, urinary bladder, and sensory cells) cells are interconnected as far as much of their ion content is concerned. In the salivary gland and renal epithelia, all cells of the epithelium are interconnected; and communication between a given cell and any of its nearest neighbors is equally good. In the bladder and sensory epithelia, communication appears to be more restricted, manifesting itself in chains of connected cells in the former, and in small groups of connected cells in the latter. The permeability of the cell membrane at the junction between connected cells is several orders of magnitude greater than it is at the cell surface bordering the exterior of the cells. Each connected cell ensemble functions as a system with a fairly continuous cytoplasmic core bounded by a diffusion barrier which is continuous along the entire outer surface of the system. As a result, ions move rather freely from cell to cell, but not from cell interior to exterior. Intercellular communication in at least three epithelia is associated with the presence of certain close-junctional membrane complexes."

Pronounced water quenching of superoxide-sensitized luminescence is indicative of the preferential generation of the 1σg+ state. Recent identification of O2- in the xanthine oxidase system suggests that the generation of singlet oxygen may also occur in enzymatic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2012013128,A method for the selection of auxotrophic mutants from somatic cell cultures of Nicotiana tabacum depends upon the incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine into the DNA of wild-type cells and upon its lack of incorporation into the DNA of auxotrophic cells. There may be more than one functional copy of essential genes in the haploid genome of Nicotiana tabacum.
https://openalex.org/W2091871334,Clinical reports of alleviation of pain with positive brain stimulation were investigated experimnentally. Rats in a two-compartment testing chamber sought out hypothalamic stimulation and escaped from aversive foot shock delivered through a grid-scrambling device. Animals also sought out paired hypothalamic stimulation and foot shock. Control experiments demonstrating that animals did not discriminate between hypothalamic stimulcation and paired hypothalamic stimulation and foot shock supported the view that hypothalamic stimulation attenuates the aversive properties of foot shock.

https://openalex.org/W1977667309,"Sounds are an important part of the communication behavior, the so-called dances, of the honey bee. Stingless bees, which do not use dances for communication, use sound signals to indicate the existence and, in some cases, the distance of a feeding place. The social organization of communities of stingless bees is more primitive than that of honey bees, yet certain commonfeatures of communication behavior in these two groups lead to a new hypothesis of the evolution of dancing behavior of the honey bee."
https://openalex.org/W2035754162,"At Bikini Atoll, radioactivity from strontium-90 deposited in the growing shell of a giant clam, presumably during the testing of nuclear weapons in 1956 and 1958, produced unmistakable lines on radioautographs made from transverse sections of the shell. The regular banding seen in the sections is interpreted as annular in nature. One annulus precedes the 1956 layer of radioactivity, two intervene in 1958, and six follow to the time of collection, so that this clam (length, 52 centimeters) was in its 9th year of life."
https://openalex.org/W2093616518,"Growth of Digitaria decumbens is severely reduced by night temperatures of 10°C or below. Ultrastructure of leaves and chemical analyses show a high starch content in chloroplasts of plants illuminated and kept at a temperature of 30°C. This starch disappears after a period in the dark at 30°C, but it remains if the temperature during the dark period is 10°C. The inhibition or slowing of starch translocation out of chloroplasts appears to account for reduced photosynthesis and growth at low night temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2052233475,"Uranium: helium ages are compared with Th(230): U(234) ages and stratigraphic ages for selected Pleistocene and Tertiary shells and corals. Agreement is good except for those fossils for which independent criteria (for example, aragonite: calcite, Ra(226): Th(230), or U(234): U(238) ratios) indicate a chemically open system. Certain of the Tertiary samples yield erroneously low ages which probably result from secondary addition of uranium. The helium geochronometer appears to yield reliable minimum ages and may be applicable to direct dating of aragonitic fossils-especially those of Pleistocene age-when used in conjunction with other isotopic and geologic information."
https://openalex.org/W2067434744,"Combustion analyses of total carbon in chondritic meteorites indicate a fractionation of this element between the various types of chondrites. The median values for the percentage of carbon by weight are 0.40 for enstatite chondrites, 0.09 for olivine-bronzite chondrites, and 0.08 for olivine-hypersthene chondrites. Olivine-pigeonite chondrites show great variations in their carbon contents."

https://openalex.org/W2048265293,"A β-lipoprotein variant, in which two bands appear after electrophoresis, has been found in three generations of a family. The variant, immunologically also a β-lipoprotein, differs in molecular size, density, and charge from normal β-lipoprotein. Individuals showing the variant appear to be heterozygous for an uncommon mutant gene."

https://openalex.org/W1964766551,The nature of crystalline water in frozen pastes made from representative clay minerals and water was studied by x-ray diffraction. Only the diffraction peaks corresponding to the normal hexagonal ice structure were detected. The relative intensities of the diffraction peaks revealed evidence of epitaxy in that the ice crystals appeared to be preferentially oriented with their c-axes perpendicular to the c-axes of the individuial clay crystallites.

By means of thin-layer chromatography, the repellent substances can be separated from nonrepellent material also present in skin lipids."

The function, which is U-shaped, has a minimum which occurs near the point of equal luminance as judged by the psychophysical method of flicker photometry."
https://openalex.org/W2116141019,"Maximum winds in Hurricane Debbie, August 1969, decreased after modification experiments by Project Stormfury. Clouds surrounding the center of Debbie were seeded with silver iodide particles five times at approximately 2-hour intervals on both 18 and 20 August. Before the first seeding on 18 August, the maximum speed of winds at 3600 meters was 182 kilometers per hour, but, 5 hours after the fifth seeding, these winds decreased to 126 kilometers per hour. On 20 August, the corresponding change was from 183 to 156 kilometers per hour. Analyses of the data suggest that the storm was modified."

https://openalex.org/W1982576385,The Doppler residuals from the Apollo 12 lunar module radio tracking data indicate large negative accelerations over the craters Ptolemaeus and Albategnius. The mass deficienicies required to produce these accelerations are approximately equivalent to the removal of the surface material to a depth of 1 kilometer over the entire area of these craters. Several other features of the gravity fine structure can also be correlated with topography.
