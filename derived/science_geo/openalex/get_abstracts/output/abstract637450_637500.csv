https://openalex.org/W2966437379,"Non-line-of-sight imaging allows objects to be observed when partially or fully occluded from direct view, by analysing indirect diffuse reflections off a secondary relay surface. Despite many potential applications1–9, existing methods lack practical usability because of limitations including the assumption of single scattering only, ideal diffuse reflectance and lack of occlusions within the hidden scene. By contrast, line-of-sight imaging systems do not impose any assumptions about the imaged scene, despite relying on the mathematically simple processes of linear diffractive wave propagation. Here we show that the problem of non-line-of-sight imaging can also be formulated as one of diffractive wave propagation, by introducing a virtual wave field that we term the phasor field. Non-line-of-sight scenes can be imaged from raw time-of-flight data by applying the mathematical operators that model wave propagation in a conventional line-of-sight imaging system. Our method yields a new class of imaging algorithms that mimic the capabilities of line-of-sight cameras. To demonstrate our technique, we derive three imaging algorithms, modelled after three different line-of-sight systems. These algorithms rely on solving a wave diffraction integral, namely the Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction integral. Fast solutions to Rayleigh–Sommerfeld diffraction and its approximations are readily available, benefiting our method. We demonstrate non-line-of-sight imaging of complex scenes with strong multiple scattering and ambient light, arbitrary materials, large depth range and occlusions. Our method handles these challenging cases without explicitly inverting a light-transport model. We believe that our approach will help to unlock the potential of non-line-of-sight imaging and promote the development of relevant applications not restricted to laboratory conditions. Algorithms based on diffractive wave propagation of light offer effective imaging of complex scenes hidden from direct view."
https://openalex.org/W2966097303,"RNA modification in the form of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulates nearly all the post-transcriptional processes. The asymmetric m6A deposition suggests that regional methylation may have distinct functional consequences. However, current RNA biology tools do not distinguish the contribution of individual m6A modifications. Here we report the development of 'm6A editing', a powerful approach that enables m6A installation and erasure from cellular RNAs without changing the primary sequence. We engineered fusions of CRISPR-Cas9 and a single-chain m6A methyltransferase that can be programmed with a guide RNA. The resultant m6A 'writers' allow functional comparison of single site methylation in different messenger RNA regions. We further engineered m6A 'erasers' by fusing CRISPR-Cas9 with ALKBH5 or FTO to achieve site-specific demethylation of RNAs. The development of programmable m6A editing not only expands the scope of RNA engineering, but also facilitates mechanistic understanding of epitranscriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2966806609,"We present a method for calculating the Acute Insecticide Toxicity Loading (AITL) on US agricultural lands and surrounding areas and an assessment of the changes in AITL from 1992 through 2014. The AITL method accounts for the total mass of insecticides used in the US, acute toxicity to insects using honey bee contact and oral LD50 as reference values for arthropod toxicity, and the environmental persistence of the pesticides. This screening analysis shows that the types of synthetic insecticides applied to agricultural lands have fundamentally shifted over the last two decades from predominantly organophosphorus and N-methyl carbamate pesticides to a mix dominated by neonicotinoids and pyrethroids. The neonicotinoids are generally applied to US agricultural land at lower application rates per acre; however, they are considerably more toxic to insects and generally persist longer in the environment. We found a 48- and 4-fold increase in AITL from 1992 to 2014 for oral and contact toxicity, respectively. Neonicotinoids are primarily responsible for this increase, representing between 61 to nearly 99 percent of the total toxicity loading in 2014. The crops most responsible for the increase in AITL are corn and soybeans, with particularly large increases in relative soybean contributions to AITL between 2010 and 2014. Oral exposures are of potentially greater concern because of the relatively higher toxicity (low LD50s) and greater likelihood of exposure from residues in pollen, nectar, guttation water, and other environmental media. Using AITL to assess oral toxicity by class of pesticide, the neonicotinoids accounted for nearly 92 percent of total AITL from 1992 to 2014. Chlorpyrifos, the fifth most widely used insecticide during this time contributed just 1.4 percent of total AITL based on oral LD50s. Although we use some simplifying assumptions, our screening analysis demonstrates an increase in pesticide toxicity loading over the past 26 years, which potentially threatens the health of honey bees and other pollinators and may contribute to declines in beneficial insect populations as well as insectivorous birds and other insect consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2966307432,"Here we present a miniaturized analog of a blinking human eye to reverse engineer the complexity of the interface between the ocular system and the external environment. Our model comprises human cells and provides unique capabilities to replicate multiscale structural organization, biological phenotypes and dynamically regulated environmental homeostasis of the human ocular surface. Using this biomimetic system, we discovered new biological effects of blink-induced mechanical forces. Furthermore, we developed a specialized in vitro model of evaporative dry-eye disease for high-content drug screening. This work advances our ability to emulate how human physiological systems interface with the external world, and may contribute to the future development of novel screening platforms for biopharmaceutical and environmental applications."
https://openalex.org/W2965135644,"Everyday decisions frequently require choosing among multiple alternatives. Yet the optimal policy for such decisions is unknown. Here we derive the normative policy for general multi-alternative decisions. This strategy requires evidence accumulation to nonlinear, time-dependent bounds that trigger choices. A geometric symmetry in those boundaries allows the optimal strategy to be implemented by a simple neural circuit involving normalization with fixed decision bounds and an urgency signal. The model captures several key features of the response of decision-making neurons as well as the increase in reaction time as a function of the number of alternatives, known as Hick's law. In addition, we show that in the presence of divisive normalization and internal variability, our model can account for several so-called 'irrational' behaviors, such as the similarity effect as well as the violation of both the independence of irrelevant alternatives principle and the regularity principle."

https://openalex.org/W2965873727,"Most of the studies focused on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) performed in wildlife describe Escherichia coli as the principal indicator of the selective pressure. In the present study, several species of Enterobacterales with a large panel of cephalosporin resistant (CR) genes have been isolated from wildlife in Catalonia. A total of 307 wild animals were examined to determine the prevalence of CR enterobacteria, AMR phenotypes and the presence of common carbapenem and CR genes. The overall prevalence of CR-phenotype was 13% (40/307): 17.3% in wild mammals (18/104) and 11.5% in wild birds (22/191) (p<0.01). Hedgehogs showed the highest prevalence (13.5% of 104) of the mammal specimens, and raptors the highest in bird specimen (7.3% of 191). Although CR E. coli was the most frequently isolated (45%), other CR- Enterobacterales like Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%), Citrobacter freundii (15%), Enterobacter cloacae (5%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), Providencia spp (5%) and Serratia marcescens (2.5%) were also isolated. A high diversity of CR genes was identified among the isolates, with 50% yielding blaCMY-2, 23% blaSHV-12, 20% blaCMY-1 and 18% blaCTX-M-15. Additionally, resistance to carbapenems associated to OXA-48 gene was found. Most of the CR isolates, principally K. pneumoniae and C. freundii, were multi-resistant with co-resistance to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, sulphonamides and aminoglycosides. This study reports high prevalence of Enterobacterales harbouring a variety of CR genes and OXA-48 mediated-carbapenem resistance, all of them frequently associated to nosocomial human infections, for the first time in wild mammals and wild birds. Implementation of control measures to reduce the impact of anthropogenic pressure in the environment is urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2966641440,"Background Gambling behavior presents substantial individual variability regarding its severity, manifestations, and psychological correlates. Specifically, differences in emotion regulation, impulsivity, and cognitive distortions have been identified as crucial to describe individual profiles with implications for the prevention, prognosis, and treatment of gambling disorder (GD). Aims and method The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations of gambling-related cognitions (measured according to the GRCS model) with impulsivity (UPPS-P model) and emotion regulation (CERQ model), in a sample of 246 gamblers with different levels of gambling involvement, using mixed-effects modelling to isolate theoretically relevant associations while controlling for the potentially confounding effects of sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Results Affective/motivational dimensions of UPPS-P impulsivity positive urgency and sensation seeking, on the one hand, and CERQ emotion regulation strategies reappraisal, rumination and blaming others, on the other, independently and significantly predicted distorted gambling-related cognitions. Conclusions These results (a) reinforce the ones of previous studies stressing the relevance of emotional and motivational processes in the emergence of gambling-related cognitive distortions; and (b) replicate the seemingly paradoxical finding that gamblers use emotion regulation strategies customarily considered as adaptive (i.e. reappraisal) to strengthen and justify their biased beliefs about gambling outcomes and controllability."
https://openalex.org/W2965216961,"Attention is vital for optimal behavioural performance in every-day life. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to enhance attention. However, the components of attention altered by meditation and the related neural activities are underexplored. In particular, the contributions of inhibitory processes and sustained attention are not well understood. To address these points, 34 meditators were compared to 28 age and gender matched controls during electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of neural activity during a Go/Nogo response inhibition task. This task generates a P3 event related potential, which is related to response inhibition processes in Nogo trials, and attention processes across both trial types. Compared with controls, meditators were more accurate at responding to Go and Nogo trials. Meditators showed a more frontally distributed P3 to both Go and Nogo trials, suggesting more frontal involvement in sustained attention rather than activity specific to response inhibition. Unexpectedly, meditators also showed increased positivity over the right parietal cortex prior to visual information reaching the occipital cortex (during the pre-C1 window). Both results were positively related to increased accuracy across both groups. The results suggest that meditators show altered engagement of neural regions related to attention, including both higher order processes generated by frontal regions, and sensory anticipation processes generated by poster regions. This activity may reflect an increased capacity to modulate a range of neural processes in order to meet task requirements. This increased capacity may underlie the improved attentional function observed in mindfulness meditators."
https://openalex.org/W2965475789,"In order to establish effective conservation strategy, drivers of local and regional patterns of biodiversity need to be understood. The composition of local biodiversity is dependent on a number of factors including evolution and redistribution of lineages through dispersal and environmental heterogeneity. Brazilian canga is characterised by a ferrugineous substrate, found both in the Iron Quadrangle of Minas Gerais and in the Carajás mountains in Amazonia. Canga is one of several specialised habitat types comprising Brazilian campo rupestre, a montane vegetation found within or adjacent to several major Brazilian bioregions, including the Atlantic Forest and Amazonia, with exceptionally high levels of diversity and endemism arising from both history of dispersal and environmental variation. In order to inform biodiversity conservation for canga, and more broadly for campo rupestre, we performed floristic and phylogenetic analyses investigating affinities between 28 sites on different substrates (canga and quartzite) and geographic locations (Carajás, Pará [Amazonia]; Cadeia do Espinhaço, Minas Gerais; Chapada Diamantina, Bahia). Through analysis of 11204 occurrences of 4705 species of angiosperms, we found that Amazonian Carajás canga plant communities formed a cohesive group, distinct from species assemblages found in Eastern Brazil (Minas Gerais, Bahia), either on canga or quartzite. The phylogenetic megatree of species across all sites investigated shows associations between certain clades and Amazonian canga, with few shared species between the Amazonian Carajás and Eastern Brazil sites, while the floristic comparison shows high levels of heterogeneity between sites. The need for reserves for Amazonian Carajás canga has been recognized and addressed by the creation of a national park. However, current sampling does not provide sufficient reassurance that the canga areas now benefitting from full legal protection adequately represent the regional canga flora."
https://openalex.org/W2965280634,"Using abandoned gas wells as geothermal resources for energy production is an effective way to extract geothermal energy from geological formations. These abandoned wells have the potential to significantly contribute in the rising global demand for energy without requiring the land disruption resulting from deep drilling or digging, processes necessary for energy extraction from geological formations via more traditional methods. In this paper, a method to extract geothermal energy from abandoned gas wells is proposed. The method offers an efficient, economical, and environmentally-conscious way to generate electricity. A mathematical model of a thermal and hydraulic coupling process is constructed, and a 3D numerical model is generated to study the process of geothermal energy extraction by retrofitting an abandoned gas reservoir into a geothermal reservoir. Using the model, heat extraction and fluid flow are analyzed over a period of 50 years. The heat production, electricity generation, and thermal recovery over the lifetime of the reservoir indicate that a commercially viable geothermal dual well system can produce geothermal energy effectively. Dual-well systems contain at least one injection well and one production well. They are composed of a two-way flow system in which the fluid flows into the reservoir via an injection well and returns from the production well having absorbed thermal energy from the surrounding rocks. Sensitivity analysis of the main parameters controlling the average outlet temperature of the fluid from the sedimentary geothermal system reveals that abandoned gas wells are a suitable source of geothermal energy. This energy can be harvested via a method whose use of reservoir fluids differs from that of the traditional method of closed-loop circulation via a borehole heat exchanger. Here, it is demonstrated that abandoned oil and gas fields can be repurposed to be geothermal energy sources that provide low-cost electricity and are economically sustainable."
https://openalex.org/W2964967377,"Excessive use of antibiotics, especially watch group antibiotics such as ceftriaxone leads to emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), antibiotics are overused but data on consumption is scarcely available. We aimed at determining the extent and predictors of ceftriaxone use in a tertiary care university teaching hospital in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2013 through August 2015. Patients admitted in the medical, surgical wards and their respective intensive care units, receiving antimicrobials and other medications for various ailments were enrolled. Socio-demographic and clinical data were recorded in a structured questionnaire from patients’ files and logistic regression was performed to determine the predictors for ceftriaxone use. Out of the 630 patients included in this study, 322 (51.1%) patients were on ceftriaxone during their time of hospitalization. Twenty-two patients out of 320 (6.9%) had been on ceftriaxone treatment without evidence of infection. Ceftriaxone use for surgical prophylaxis was 44 (40.7%), of which 32 (72.7%) and 9 (20.5%) received ceftriaxone prophylaxis before and after surgery, respectively. Three (6.8%) received ceftriaxone prophylaxis during surgery. Predicting factors for that the health facility administered ceftriaxone were identified as history of any medication use before referral to hospital [OR = 3.4, 95% CI (1.0–11.4), p = 0.047], bacterial infection [OR = 18.0, 95% CI (1.4–225.7, p = 0.025)], surgical ward [OR = 2.9, 95% CI (0.9–9.4), p = 0.078] and medical wards [OR = 5.0, 95% CI (0.9–28.3), p = 0.070]. Overall, a high ceftriaxone use at KCMC hospital was observed. Antimicrobial stewardship programs are highly needed to monitor and regulate hospital antimicrobial consumption, which in turn could help in halting the rising crisis of antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2964852185,"Background Previous studies of relations between parenting self-concepts, parental adjustment and child temperament have been ambiguous regarding the direction of influence; and have rarely followed families from pregnancy through the first year of life. The current study examines change and stability in maternal depressive symptoms, parenting competences and child temperament through the perinatal period until nine months postpartum. Methods Czech mothers (N = 282) participated at three time points: the third trimester of pregnancy (Time 1), six weeks (Time 2) and nine months postpartum (Time 3). Questionnaire data concerned depressive symptoms (T1, T2, T3), maternal parenting self-esteem (T1, T2) and sense of competence (T3), and child temperament (T2, T3). A path model was used to examine concurrent and longitudinal relations between these variables. Results The analyses indicated longitudinal stability of all constructs, as well as concurrent relations between them. Longitudinal relations supported child-to-parent, rather than parent-to-child, effects: child difficult temperament predicted decreases in perceived maternal parenting competences, but maternal variables did not predict change in infant temperament. In addition, we observed weak mutual relations between maternal depression levels and parenting competences, such that maternal depression diminished perceived parenting competences that in turn contributed to higher levels of depression. Conclusion Mothers’ confidence in their ability to parent is influenced by their experience with a difficult infant and by their depressive symptoms during the child’s first year of life. Depressive symptoms are, in turn, aggravated by mothers’ low perceived competences in the parenting role."
https://openalex.org/W2965352290,"Background The associations of individual antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with pregnancy duration and size at birth, and potential dose relations, are not well characterized. Methods This cohort study used nationwide Swedish register data (1996–2013). Adjusting for smoking, epilepsy and other AED indications, we used linear and quantile regression to explore associations with pregnancy duration, and birth weight, length, and head circumference (the last three operationalized as z-scores). We used logistic regression for preterm delivery, small for gestational age, and microcephaly. Lamotrigine was the reference drug. Results 6,720 infants were exposed to AEDs in utero; AED exposure increased over the study period. Relative to lamotrigine-exposed infants, carbamazepine-exposed infants were born, on average, 1.3 days earlier (mean [95% confidence interval]: -1.3 [-2.3 to -0.3]); were 0.1 standard deviations (SDs) lighter (-0.1 [-0.2 to 0.0]); and had a head circumference that was 0.2 SDs smaller (-0.2 [-0.3 to -0.1]). Pregabalin-exposed infants were born, on average, 1.1 days earlier (-1.1 [-3.0 to 0.8]); were 0.1 SDs lighter (-0.1 [-0.3 to 0.0]); and had the same head circumference as lamotrigine-exposed infants. Levetiracetam-exposed infants were born, on average, 0.5 days earlier (-0.5 [-2.6 to 1.6]); were 0.1 SDs lighter (-0.1 [-0.3 to 0.0]); and had a head circumference 0.1 SDs smaller (-0.1 [-0.3 to 0.1]). Valproic acid–exposed infants had, on average, the same duration of gestation and birth weight z-score as lamotrigine-exposed infants, but had a head circumference 0.2 SDs smaller (-0.2 [-0.2 to -0.1]). Associations between carbamazepine exposure and pregnancy duration and between valproic acid exposure and pregnancy duration and birth weight z-score were more negative at the left than at the right tails of the outcome distributions. Effect-measure modification and dose-response relations were noted for some of the associations. Conclusions Relative to lamotrigine, valproic acid and carbamazepine were associated with smaller head circumference."
https://openalex.org/W2965658958,"Background We investigated the correlation between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patient prognosis and the presence of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes and expression of 521 immune system genes. Methods Intratumoural CD3+, CD8+, and CD20+ lymphocytes were examined by immunohistochemistry in 12 PDAC patients with different outcomes who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. The results were correlated with gene expression profile using the digital multiplexed NanoString nCounter analysis system (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA). Results Twenty immune system genes were significantly differentially expressed in patients with a good prognosis relative to patients with a worse prognosis: TLR2 and TLR7 (Toll-like receptor superfamily); CD4, CD37, FOXP3, PTPRC (B cell and T cell signalling); IRF5, IRF8, STAT1, TFE3 (transcription factors); ANP32B, CCND3 (cell cycle); BTK (B cell development); TNF, TNFRF1A (TNF superfamily); HCK (leukocyte function); C1QA (complement system); BAX, PNMA1 (apoptosis); IKBKE (NFκB pathway). Differential expression was more than twice log 2 for TLR7, TNF, C1QA, FOXP3, and CD37. Discussion Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were present at higher levels in samples from patients with better prognosis. Our findings indicate that tumour infiltrating lymphocyte levels and expression level of the immune system genes listed above influence pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma prognosis. This information could be used to improve selection of best responders to immune inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2965973746,"Decellularization of blood vessels is a promising approach to generate native biomaterials for replacement of diseased vessels. The decellularization process affects the mechanical properties of the vascular graft and thus can have a negative impact for in vivo functionality. The aim of this study was to determine how detergents under different fluid dynamics affects decellularization efficacy and mechanical properties of the vascular graft. We applied a protocol utilizing 1% TritonX, 1% Tributyl phosphate (TnBP) and DNase on porcine vena cava. The detergents were applied to the vessels under different conditions; static, agitation and perfusion with 3 different perfusion rates (25, 100 and 400 mL/min). The decellularized grafts were analyzed with histological, immunohistochemical and mechanical tests. We found that decellularization efficacy was equal in all groups, however the luminal ultrastructure of the static group showed remnant cell debris and the 400 mL/min perfusion group showed local damage and tearing of the luminal surface. The mechanical stiffness and maximum tensile strength were not influenced by the detergent application method. In conclusion, our results indicate that agitation or low-velocity perfusion with detergents are preferable methods for blood vessel decellularization."
https://openalex.org/W2966486356,"Background Serum uric acid (SUA) has long been associated with cardiovascular disease. Variability of serum uric acid (SUA) has seldom been examined in association with long-term morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between SUA variability and long-term all-cause and specific-cause mortality. Methods Among 10,059 men, aged 40–65, tenured civil servants and municipal employees in Israel, 8822 participants who were examined in 1963, 1965 and 1968 had assessment of diabetic and coronary morbidity status and SUA levels. We conducted analysis examining whether the standard deviations (SD) of Z-scores of SUA across study visits predicted coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. Hazard ratios (HR) associated with the SD of SUA-Z were calculated for stroke, CHD mortality and all-cause mortality associated with quartiles of the above variability. Results Multivariate analysis of 18-year CHD mortality yielded a significant association with the 1963–1968 SD of SUA-Z with age adjusted HR of CHD mortality of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.8–1.19), 1.05 (95% CI, 0.87–1.28) and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.15–1.65) for quartiles 2 to 4 respectively). The results of all-cause mortality similarly and strongly indicated increasing age-adjusted mortality risk with increasing SD of SUA-Z: HR = 1.08 (95% CI, 0.97–1.21), 1.15 (1.03–1.28) and 1.37 (1.23–1.51). No association was observed between the SD of SUA-Z and stroke mortality. Conclusion In this cohort of tenured male workers, with diverse occupations, higher variability of SUA measurement taken over 5 years was clearly predictive of 18-year CHD and all-cause mortality, above and beyond the SUA levels proper."
https://openalex.org/W2965179108,"Meprin β is a membrane-bound metalloprotease involved in extracellular matrix assembly and inflammatory processes in health and disease. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)10 and ADAM17 are physiologic relevant sheddases of inactive promeprin β, which influences its substrate repertoire and subsequent biologic functions. Proteomic analysis also revealed several ADAMs as putative meprin β substrates. Here, we demonstrate specific N-terminal processing of ADAM9, 10, and 17 by meprin β and identify cleavage sites within their prodomains. Because ADAM prodomains can act as specific inhibitors, we postulate a role for meprin β in the regulation of ADAM activities. Indeed, prodomain cleavage by meprin β caused increased ADAM protease activities, as observed by peptide-based cleavage assays and demonstrated by increased ectodomain shedding activity. Direct interaction of meprin β and ADAM proteases could be shown by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation experiments. As demonstrated by a bacterial activator of meprin β and additional measurement of TNF-α shedding on bone marrow-derived macrophages, meprin β/ADAM protease interactions likely influence inflammatory conditions. Thus, we identified a novel proteolytic pathway of meprin β with ADAM proteases to control protease activities at the cell surface as part of the protease web.-Wichert, R., Scharfenberg, F., Colmorgen, C., Koudelka, T., Schwarz, J., Wetzel, S., Potempa, B., Potempa, J., Bartsch, J.

https://openalex.org/W2965492387,"The recent development of plants that overexpress antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) provides opportunities for controlling plant diseases. Because plants employ a broad-spectrum antimicrobial defense, including those based on AMPs, transgenic modification for AMP overexpression represents a potential way to utilize a defense system already present in plants. Herein, using an array of techniques and approaches, we report on VG16KRKP and KYE28, two antimicrobial peptides, which in combination exhibit synergistic antimicrobial effects against plant pathogens and are resistant against plant proteases. Investigating the structural origin of these synergistic antimicrobial effects with NMR spectroscopy of the complex formed between these two peptides and their mutated analogs, we demonstrate the formation of an unusual peptide complex, characterized by the formation of a bulky hydrophobic hub, stabilized by aromatic zippers. Using three-dimensional structure analyses of the complex in bacterial outer and inner membrane components and when bound to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or bacterial membrane mimics, we found that this structure is key for elevating antimicrobial potency of the peptide combination. We conclude that the synergistic antimicrobial effects of VG16KRKP and KYE28 arise from the formation of a well-defined amphiphilic dimer in the presence of LPS and also in the cytoplasmic bacterial membrane environment. Together, these findings highlight a new application of solution NMR spectroscopy to solve complex structures to study peptide–peptide interactions, and they underscore the importance of structural insights for elucidating the antimicrobial effects of AMP mixtures."
https://openalex.org/W2966223044,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this prospective 5-year follow up of patients with RA, we analysed several biomarkers, known to be associated with atherosclerosis and/or inflammation in the general population. The aim of this study was to find out whether the RA-disease per se affect these biomarkers and if those could be associated with the progression of atherosclerosis, as measured by intima media thickness (IMT) among patients with early RA.Patients from northern Sweden diagnosed with early RA, are consecutively recruited into an ongoing prospective study on CVD comorbidity. A subgroup of patients, aged ≤60 years (n = 71) was included for ultrasound measurements of IMT at inclusion (T0) and after 5 years (T5) together with age-sex-matched controls (n = 40). The patients were clinically assessed. Blood was analysed for lipids, ESR and CRP and several biomarkers known to be associated with atherosclerosis in the general population.At T0, the patients with RA had significantly lower levels of MIF and significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-18 and MIC-1 compared with controls. At T5, the patients with RA had significantly higher levels of pentraxin3, MIC-1, TNF-R2, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and endostatin compared with controls. At T0 the levels of MPO correlated with DAS28, sCD40L with CRP and IL-18 with systolic blood pressure and Reynolds risk score. Using PLSR on a CVD-panel analysed with multiplex immunoassay, the patients with RA could be correctly classified into those who had a worsening in their IMT over the five years or not. Here, MMP3 was identified as influential.This study indicates that the RA disease itself could affect several of the biomarkers in this study, and possibly also the processes involved in the development of atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2964982401,"A time series of satellite data on Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) that used ocean color was studied to determine mechanisms of phytoplankton variation in recent decade in the Yellow Sea, China during 2003–2015. The variability patterns on seasonal and inter-annual oscillation periods were confirmed using the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), and Morlet wavelet transform analyses, respectively. The first EOF mode for Chl-a was dominated by obvious spring and fall blooms in a spatial pattern that was related to the strong mixing of the water masses from the Yellow Sea Cold Warm Mass (YSCWM) and the Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) in winter. The second EOF mode for Chl-a showed an opposite spatial pattern between the northern and southern regions. The temporal coefficient showed differences in the timing of blooms. On an inter-annual scale, Chl-a indicated variation at periods of 2–4 years during 2003–2015. Chl-a showed a significantly negative correlation with the sea surface temperature (r = -0.21, p<0.01), with time lags of 4 months (Chl-a ahead). Chl-a was coupled with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, with a positive correlation (r = 0.46, p<0.01) at a lag of 3–5 months (ENSO ahead). The present study demonstrated that the variation in phytoplankton biomass was controlled primarily by water mass seasonally, and it was influenced by ENSO events on an inter-annual scale."
https://openalex.org/W2965034294,"Autophagy is a conserved cellular process involving intracellular membrane trafficking and degradation. Pathogens, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), often exploit this process to promote their own survival. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism by which HCV increases steady-state autophagosome numbers while simultaneously inhibiting flux through the autophagic pathway. Using the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1, we showed that HCV-induced alterations in autophagy result from a blockage of autophagosome degradation rather than an increase in autophagosome generation. In HCV-infected cells, lysosome function was normal, but a tandem RFP–GFP–LC3 failed to reach the lysosome even under conditions that activate autophagy. Autophagosomes and lysosomes isolated from HCV-infected cells were able to fuse with each other normally in vitro, suggesting that the cellular fusion defect resulted from trafficking rather than an inability of vesicles to fuse. Arl8b is an Arf-like GTPase that specifically localizes to lysosomes and plays a role in autophagic flux through its effect on lysosomal positioning. At basal levels, Arl8b was primarily found in a perinuclear localization and co-localized with LC3-positive autophagosomes. HCV infection increased the level of Arl8b 3-fold and redistributed Arl8b to a more diffuse, peripheral pattern that failed to co-localize with LC3. Knockdown of Arl8b in HCV-infected cells restored autophagosome–lysosome fusion and autophagic flux to levels seen in control cells. Thus, HCV suppresses autophagic flux and increases the steady-state levels of autophagosomes by increasing the expression of Arl8b, which repositions lysosomes and prevents their fusion with autophagosomes. Autophagy is a conserved cellular process involving intracellular membrane trafficking and degradation. Pathogens, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), often exploit this process to promote their own survival. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism by which HCV increases steady-state autophagosome numbers while simultaneously inhibiting flux through the autophagic pathway.

In HCV-infected cells, lysosome function was normal, but a tandem RFP–GFP–LC3 failed to reach the lysosome even under conditions that activate autophagy. Autophagosomes and lysosomes isolated from HCV-infected cells were able to fuse with each other normally in vitro, suggesting that the cellular fusion defect resulted from trafficking rather than an inability of vesicles to fuse. Arl8b is an Arf-like GTPase that specifically localizes to lysosomes and plays a role in autophagic flux through its effect on lysosomal positioning. At basal levels, Arl8b was primarily found in a perinuclear localization and co-localized with LC3-positive autophagosomes. HCV infection increased the level of Arl8b 3-fold and redistributed Arl8b to a more diffuse, peripheral pattern that failed to co-localize with LC3. Knockdown of Arl8b in HCV-infected cells restored autophagosome–lysosome fusion and autophagic flux to levels seen in control cells. Thus, HCV suppresses autophagic flux and increases the steady-state levels of autophagosomes by increasing the expression of Arl8b, which repositions lysosomes and prevents their fusion with autophagosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2965551671,"Despite significant improvement in prevention and control over the past decades malaria remains a significant public health concern in Tanzania with 93% of the population being at risk. To prevent malaria infection and promote malaria free zones, understanding the community's knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward malaria control are essential. This study therefore aimed at determining the levels of understanding, and attitudes, as well as socio-cultural aspects of malaria prevention and treatment-seeking behaviours among suspected malaria patients.This study was a hospital based cross-sectional study, in which patients attending Tumbi Referral Hospital with symptoms and signs that warrant inclusion of suspicion of malaria, were recruited. We used a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire to collect participants' demographic characteristics, as well as information on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards malaria infection. Data were analysed using Stata Version 12.1.We enrolled a total of 295 respondents of which 179 (60.68%) were females. Participants' ages ranged from 1-91 years, with a mean of 31.4 years. Seventy-nine (26.8%) patients reported having malaria in the previous 28 days, with 57 (72.2%) being laboratory confirmed. Only 52 (65.8%) individuals reported taking prescribed medications for malaria. A total of 277 (93.90%) were aware of malaria, and 264 (95.31%) knew that it is transmitted by mosquito. Nearly all participants (263, 94.95%), identified sleeping under bed nets to be protective against malaria. About half of the respondents either agreed 63 (22.74%) or strongly agreed 62 (22.38%) that malaria can be transmitted like the common cold. Self-reported mosquito net use was 88.09% (244).Despite the endemicity of malaria in our study site, patients had adequate knowledge, encouraging attitudes, and good practices related to malaria prevention and control."
https://openalex.org/W2966098928,"Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are common in cancers and environmental pollutant exposed subjects. Up to date, few studies have examined the aberrant DNA methylation patterns in benzene exposed workers. We recruited 141 benzene-exposed workers, including 83 benzene-exposed workers from a shoe factory in Wenzhou and 58 workers from a painting workshop in Wuhu, 35 workers in Wuhu were followed from 2009 to 2013, and 48 indoor workers as controls from Wenzhou. We used high-resolution melting (HRM) to quantitate human samples of DNA methylation in long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1), (6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and DNA mismatch repair gene human mutator L homologue 1 (hMLH1). AML-5 cells were treated with benzoquinone (BQ) and hydroquinone (HQ), and the promoter methylation of MGMT and hMLH1 was detected using the bisulfite sequencing PCR method. The degree of LINE-1 methylation in benzene-exposed workers was significantly lower than that of the controls (p<0.001), and the degree of MGMT (p<0.001) and hMLH1 (p = 0.01) methylation was significantly higher than that of the controls. The in vitro study validated the aberrant hypermethylation of hMLH1 after treatment with BQ. Among the cohort workers who were followed from 2009 to 2013, the LINE1 methylation elevated in 2013 than 2009 (p = 0.004), and premotor methylation in hMLH1 reduced in 2013 than 2009 (p = 0.045) with the reduction of the benzene exposure. This study provides evidence that benzene exposure can induce LINE-1 hypomethylation and DNA repair gene hypermethylation."
https://openalex.org/W2965934141,"In this study, we evaluated the modulation effect of long-chain Acyl-CoA synthetase during early embryo development. Bovine embryos were cultured in four groups: positive modulation (ACS+) with GW3965 hydrochloride, negative modulation (ACS-) with Triacsin C, association of both modulators (ACS±), and control. Embryo development rates were not altered (P>0.05) by treatments. Embryonic cytoplasmic lipid content increased in ACS+ but reduced in ACS- compared to the control (P < 0.05), whereas the membrane phospholipids profile was not altered by treatments. The total number of blastomeres did not differ (P > 0.05) between groups; however, an increased apoptotic cells percentage was found in ACS- compared to control. Twenty-four hours after warming, ACS+ and control grade I embryos presented the best hatching rates, whereas the ACS+ group equaled the hatching rates between their embryos of grades I, II and III 48 hours after warming. The relative abundance of transcripts for genes associated with lipid metabolism (ACSL3, ACSL6, ACAT1, SCD, and AUH), heatshock (HSP90AA1 and HSF1), oxidative stress (GPX4), and angiogenesis (VEGF), among other important genes for embryo development were affected by at least one of the treatments. The treatments were effective in modulating the level of transcripts for ACSL3 and the cytoplasmic lipid content. The ACS- was not effective in increasing embryonic cryosurvival, whereas ACS+ restored survival rates after vitrification of embryos with low quality, making them equivalent to embryos of excellent quality."
https://openalex.org/W2965021389,"Fabrication of a spherical multi-compartment MRI phantom is demonstrated that can be used to validate magnetic resonance (MR)-based susceptibility imaging reconstruction. The phantom consists of a 10 cm diameter gelatin sphere that encloses multiple smaller gelatin spheres doped with different concentrations of paramagnetic contrast agents. Compared to previous multi-compartment phantoms with cylindrical geometry, the phantom provides the following benefits: (1) no compartmental barrier materials are used that can introduce signal voids and spurious phase; (2) compartmental geometry is reproducible; (3) spherical susceptibility boundaries possess a ground-truth analytical phase solution for easy experimental validation; (4) spherical geometry of the overall phantom eliminates background phase due to air-phantom boundary in any scan orientation. The susceptibility of individual compartments can be controlled independently by doping. During fabrication, formalin cross-linking and water-proof surface coating effectively blocked water diffusion between the compartments to preserve the phantom's integrity. The spherical shapes were realized by molding the inner gel compartments in acrylic spherical shells, 3 cm in diameter, and constructing the whole phantom inside a larger acrylic shell. From gradient echo images obtained at 3T, we verified that the phantom produced phase images in agreement with the theoretical prediction. Factors that limit the agreement include: air bubbles trapped at the gel interfaces, imperfect magnet shimming, and the susceptibility of external materials such as the phantom support hardware. The phantom images were used to validate publicly available codes for quantitative susceptibility mapping. We believe that the proposed phantom can provide a useful testbed for validation of MR phase imaging and MR-based magnetic susceptibility reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W2966345902,"Personality traits are suggested to influence adults' cognitive performance, but little is known about their association with visuo-spatial competence, in terms of those visuo-spatial abilities and inclinations crucial to remaining autonomous, especially with aging. This study newly investigated whether, and to what extent, major traits and narrower facets of personality influence young and older adults' performance in the so-called objective visuo-spatial abilities (mental rotation and visuo-spatial working memory [VSWM]), and self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations (pleasure and anxiety in exploring places).Seventy young adults (18-35 years old) and 70 older adults (65-75 years old) completed the Big-Five questionnaire, objective rotation and VSWM tasks, and spatial self-assessments on pleasure and anxiety in exploring places.Hierarchical regression models confirmed that age negatively predicted the variance in objective visuo-spatial tasks, but not in self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations, while only the latter were slightly influenced by gender (in favor of men). Further, both objective visuo-spatial abilities (albeit modestly) and self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations were predicted by higher Conscientiousness. The latter were also predicted by higher Emotional Stability. Finally, a better objective visuo-spatial performance was explained (again modestly) by lower Dynamism and Politeness, and higher Emotion Control, while higher Perseverance, Emotion Control and Cooperativeness explained a moderate part of the variance in the positive self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations.Our findings indicate that, beyond age and gender, some personality traits and facets predict self-assessed visuo-spatial inclinations to a larger extent than objective visuo-spatial performance. These results are discussed within the spatial cognition and aging framework."
https://openalex.org/W2965092318,"To assess the influence of food type on biomarkers, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were maintained under laboratory conditions and fed using 4 different microalgae diets ad libitum for 1 week: (a) Isochrysis galbana; (b) Tetraselmis chuii; (c) a mixture of I. galbana and T. chuii; and (d) a commercial food (Microalgae Composed Diet, Acuinuga). Different microalgae were shown to present different distribution and fate in the midgut. I. galbana (≈4 μm Ø) readily reached digestive cells to be intracellularly digested. T. chuii (≈10 μm Ø and hardly digestible) was retained in stomach and digestive ducts for long times and extracellularly digested. Based on these findings, it appeared likely that the presence of large amounts of microalgal enzymes and metabolites might interfere with biochemical determinations of mussel’s biomarkers and/or that the diet-induced alterations of mussels’ digestion could modulate lysosomal and tissue-level biomarkers. To test these hypotheses, a battery of common biochemical, cytological and tissue-level biomarkers were determined in the gills (including activities of pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and cytochrome c oxidase) and the digestive gland of the mussels (including protein, lipid, free glucose and glycogen total content, lysosomal structural changes and membrane stability, intracellular accumulation of neutral lipids and lipofuscins, changes in cell type composition and epithelial thinning, as well as altered tissue integrity). The type of food was concluded to be a major factor influencing biomarkers in short-term experiments though not all the microalgae affected biomarkers and their responsiveness in the same way. T. chuii seemed to alter the nutritional status, oxidative stress and digestion processes, thus interfering with a variety of biomarkers. On the other hand, the massive presence of I. galbana within digestive cells hampered the measurement of cytochemical biomarkers and rendered less reliable the results of biochemical biomarkers (as these could be attributed to both the mussel and the microalgae). Research to optimize dietary food type, composition, regime and rations for toxicological experimentation is urgently needed. Meanwhile, a detailed description of the food type and feeding conditions should be always provided when reporting aquatic toxicological experiments with mussels, as a necessary prerequisite to compare and interpret the biological responses elicited by pollutants."

Endogenous TOC1 promoter and CCA1 gene from rice were isolated, cloned and mobilized into pCAMBIA1300 vectors and RNAi constructs A, B and C. Embryogenic calli of varying ages derived from mature seeds of Taipei 309 were employed for Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation generating T0, T1 and T2 independent transgenic lines were analyzed for over-expression and repression of CCA1 gene along with various morphological traits. Six hundred and thirty two T0 transgenic plants were generated from rice calli using constructs A, B and C. T0 progeny plants derived from constructs A, B and C did not show any considerable difference in morphological traits. T1and T2 progeny plants derived from construct A exhibited over-expression of CCA1 gene, on the contrary, progeny plants derived from RNAi constructs B and C exhibited repression of CCA1 gene in qRT-PCR analysis at different time points and showed rhythmicity peaking at dawn (6:00 AM) and lowest expression at 12:00 Noon. T1 and T2 progeny plants derived from construct A, namely, A-17 and A-45 exhibited reduced number of tillers/panicles (6-8), reduced thousand seed weight (10.1-16.6g), decreased seed length (4.98 to 6.58mm), decreased seed width (1.1-1.8mm) as compared to wild type plants. T1 and T2 progeny plants of construct B and C showed increased number of tillers/panicles (8-19), better seed yield (4.98-28.9g), increased thousand seed weight (15.6-29.03g), slightly increased seed length (5.7-7.43mm) and slightly increased seed width (1.7-2.98mm) as compared to wild type plants. Chlorophyll content in T1 and T2 progeny plants did not show any significant difference among the three constructs, however, rhythmicity was observed over the period of time in conjunction to CCA1 gene expression. Evidence has been presented which demonstrates that endogenous repression of CCA1 gene resulted in improved morphological traits: increased number of tillers/panicle, thousand seed weight, seed size; whereas, over-expression leads to diminution in morphological traits: decreased number of tillers/panicle, thousand seed weight, seed size as compared to the wild type in T1 and T2 progeny plants. This is first report of successful regulation of endogenous CCA1 gene under control of TOC1 promoter and its effect on improved growth vigor in Japonica rice."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial use pattern in infants from birth until 18 months of age in Indonesia.A post-hoc analysis was conducted in 1621 participants from the RV3BB Phase IIb trial conducted in Indonesia from January 2013 through July 2016. Any health events were documented in the trial as adverse events. Concomitant medication surveillance recorded all medications, including antibiotics during the 18 months of follow-up. Information included the frequency, duration of usage, formulation, classes, and their indications, including prophylactic antibiotic and perinatal use.Of 1621 participants, 551 (33.99%) received at least one antibiotic for treatment of infections during the 18 months observation period. Additionally, during the perinatal period, prophylactic antibiotics were used in 1244 (76.74%) participants and antibiotics consumed in 235 mothers of participants (14.50%). A total of 956 antibiotic consumptions were recorded for 18 months follow up, 67 (7.01%) as part of antimicrobial combinations. The average duration of antibiotic course was 4.92 days. Penicillin and sulfonamides were the most common antibiotic classes consumed (38.81% and 24.48%, respectively).Despite the low community consumption rate, the overuse of antibiotic in URTIs and non-bloody diarrhea in our setting represents a major opportunity for antimicrobial stewardship, particularly in early life."
https://openalex.org/W2965010799,"Background Studies have described different recovery profiles of sevoflurane and desflurane typically early after surgery. Methods We conducted a randomized superiority trial to determine whether Overall Recovery 3 days after knee arthroscopy would be superior with desflurane. Adult participants undergoing knee arthroscopic surgery with general anesthesia were randomized to either desflurane or sevoflurane general anesthesia. Intraoperative and postoperative drugs and analgesics were administered at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Postoperative quality of recovery was assessed using the “Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale”. The primary outcome was Overall Recovery 3 days after surgery and secondary outcomes were individual recovery domains at 15 minutes, 40 minutes, 1 day, 3 days, 1 month, and 3 months. Patients and researchers were blinded. Results 300 patients were randomized to sevoflurane or desflurane (age 51.7±14.1 vs. 47.3±13.5 years; duration of anesthesia 24.9±11.1 vs. 23.3±8.3 minutes). The proportion achieving baseline or better scores in all domains increased over the follow-up period in both groups but was not different at day 3 (sevoflurane 43% vs. desflurane 37%, p = 0.314). Similarly, rates of recovery increased over time in the five subdomains, with no differences between groups for physiological, p = 0.222; nociceptive, p = 0.391; emotive, p = 0.30; Activities-of-daily-living, p = 0.593; and cognitive recovery, p = 0.877. Conclusion No significant difference in the quality of recovery scale could be shown using sevoflurane or desflurane general anesthesia after knee arthroscopy in adult participants."
https://openalex.org/W2965191244,"Coccolith mass is an important parameter for estimating coccolithophore contribution to carbonate sedimentation, organic carbon ballasting and coccolithophore calcification. Single coccolith mass is often estimated based on the ks model, which assumes that length and thickness increase proportionally. To evaluate this assumption, this study compared coccolith length, thickness, and mass of seven Emiliania huxleyi strains and one Gephyrocapsa oceanica strain grown in 25, 34, and 44 salinity artificial seawater. While coccolith length increased with salinity in four E. huxleyi strains, thickness did not increase significantly with salinity in three of these strains. Only G. oceanica showed a consistent increase in length with salinity that was accompanied by an increase in thickness. Coccolith length and thickness was also not correlated in 14 of 24 individual experiments, and in the experiments in which there was a positive relationship r2 was low (<0.4). Because thickness did not increase with length in E. huxleyi, the increase in mass was less than expected from the ks model, and thus, mass can not be accurately estimated from coccolith length alone."
https://openalex.org/W2964901817,"Purpose To describe the occurrence of potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in prescribed drugs, dispensed to pediatric outpatients in Sweden. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted based on data from a national register of prescribed drugs, dispensed at pharmacies, to children 0–17 years old. The study period was January 1 to April 30, 2010. Drug dispensing data was linked to the DDI database SFINX. Prevalence and frequencies of potential interactions were investigated, and drugs commonly involved in interactions were identified. The study focused on clinically relevant potential interactions, class D (should be avoided), and class C (can be handled, e.g. by dose adjustment). Results In the Swedish pediatric population, 0 to 17 years of age, 12% (n = 231 078) of children had at least two dispensed drugs. In this group of patients, 0.14% had potential D-interactions and 1,3% had potential C-interactions. The number of D- and C-interactions that may lead to reduced effects were 181 (52%), and 1224 (32%) respectively. The ten most frequent drugs were involved in 78% and 65% of all potential D-, and C-interactions respectively. Furthermore, 80%, and 58% of the D-, and C-interactions respectively occurred in patients aged 12 to 17. Conclusions We identified a limited number of drugs that were represented in the majority of potential interactions. Interactions that can lead to a reduced treatment effect constituted approximately half of D-interactions, and a third of C-interactions. The frequency of potential interactions was higher in older children. The results may contribute to increased prescriber awareness of important potential drug interactions among pediatric outpatients."
https://openalex.org/W2964929903,"Not much is known about the fleet level total seabird bycatch from pelagic longlines of United States vessels in the western North Atlantic or other fleets of the Atlantic or other oceans. Onboard observers generally only record seabird bycatch during line hauling. Seabirds are predominantly caught during the line setting stage, and, due to predation or mechanical action, those caught prior to the haul can drop off the hook and be lost to the onboard observer. We developed a model to gauge the size of this bycatch loss problem and provide a first approximation of its impact on estimates of total fleet bycatch. We started with a traditional loss-free bycatch model, which assumes that birds recorded were the only birds captured, and integrated into it two crucial components of the bycatch process: capture origin (set or haul) and bycatch loss of set-captures. We extracted count data on seabird bycatch loss and bycatch mortality from the literature on other longline fisheries and used these data to simulate potential total seabird bycatch in the western North Atlantic. Simulations revealed the shortcomings of both the traditional bycatch model and the current haul-only observer protocol, each of which contributed to biologically significant underestimation of total bycatch and estimation uncertainty. Based on our results, we recommend a loss-corrected modeling approach to provide a more accurate estimate of seabird mortalities in pelagic longline fisheries. Where possible, fishery-specific seabird bycatch loss rates need to be ascertained via specific set and haul observing protocols. But, even where fishery-specific estimates for a region are not available, the methodology developed here is applicable to other pelagic longline fisheries to approximate fleet-level loss-corrected bycatch."
https://openalex.org/W2965660959,"Background Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with marked immune reconstitution. Although a long term viral suppression is achievable, not all children however, attain complete immunological recovery due to persistent immune activation. We use CD4/CD8 ratio like a marker of immune reconstitution. Methods Perinatal HIV-infected children who underwent a first-line cART, achieved viral suppression in the first year and maintained it for more than 5 years, with no viral rebound were included. Logistic models were applied to estimate the prognostic factors, clinical characteristics at cART start, of a lower CD4/CD8 ratio at the last visit. Results 146 HIV-infected children were included: 77% Caucasian, 45% male and 28% CDC C. Median age at cART initiation was 2.3 years (IQR: 0.5–6.2). 42 (30%) children received mono-dual therapy previously to cART. Time of undetectable viral load was 9.5 years (IQR: 7.8, 12.5). 33% of the children not achieved CD4/CD8 ratio >1. Univariate analysis showed an association between CD4/CD8 <1 with lower CD4 nadir and baseline CD4; older age at diagnosis and at cART initiation; and a previous exposure to mono-dual therapy. Multivariate analysis also revealed relationship between CD4/CD8 <1 and lower CD4 nadir (OR: 1.002, CI 95% 1.000–1.004) as well as previous exposure to mono-dual therapy (OR: 0.16, CI 95% 0.003–0.720). Conclusions CD4/CD8 >1 was not achieved in 33% of the children. Lower CD4 nadir and previous exposure to suboptimal therapy, before initiating cART, are factors showing independently association with a worse immune recovery (CD4/CD8 < 1)."

UC patients who were treated with budesonide foam in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials and achieved both clinical remission and mucosal healing were enrolled.Among 84 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 60 participated in the study. Eighteen of the 60 patients (30.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.9-43.2) experienced no relapse (i.e., maintenance of remission) during the 2-year follow-up period. The median relapse-free survival time was 0.82 years (95% CI: 0.51-1.52). Of 37 patients with a Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 after inducing remission with budesonide foam, 25 (67.6%) relapsed within 2 years. Patients with a disease duration of <1 year experienced a worse clinical outcome than patients with a disease duration of >5 years, and the hazard ratio was 2.38 (95% CI: 1.04-5.45).This is the first study to evaluate the short- to middle-term prognosis in UC patients who achieved mucosal healing with topical preparations. After inducing remission by budesonide foam, treatment for maintaining remissions and strict follow-up may be needed for patients with shorter disease duration."
https://openalex.org/W2964656636,"Background Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) has been proposed as a new phenotype of heart failure. We therefore investigated the pulsatile hemodynamic characteristics and outcomes in patients with HFmrEF, in comparison with those with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction. Methods The study was composed of two cohorts of patients hospitalized due to acute heart failure. Pulsatile hemodynamic measures, including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), carotid pulse pressure (cPP), amplitude of the backward pressure wave (Pb) and carotid augmentation index (cAIx), were recorded on admission and before discharge in Cohort A (n = 230, mean age 69.9 ±15.4 years), and long-term follow-up was performed in Cohort B (n = 2677, mean age 76.3 ± 33.4 years). Results In Cohort A, patients with HFmrEF had persistently greater cf-PWV, cPP, Pb, and cAI than those with HFrEF, both on admission and before discharge. In contrast, patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF had similar pulsatile hemodynamic characteristics. In cohort B, patients with HFmrEF and HFrEF had similar three-year mortality rates and both were significantly higher than that in patients with HFpEF (both P values < 0.05). Conclusions Patients with HFmrEF were characterized by a worse left ventricular systolic function than patients with HFpEF and excessive wave reflections than patients with HFrEF. Future studies are required to confirm that the unfavorable ventriculo-arterial coupling in HFmrEF might play a role in the pathogenesis of high long-term mortality in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2965024920,"Dinoflagellates from the Symbiodiniaceae family and corals have an ecologically important endosymbiotic relationship. Scleractinian corals cannot survive for long periods without their symbionts. These algae, also known as zooxanthellae, on the other hand, thrives outside the coral cells. The free-living populations of zooxanthellae are essential for the resilience of the coral to environmental stressors such as temperature anomalies and ocean acidification. Yet, little is known about how ocean acidification may affect the free-living zooxanthellae. In this study we aimed to test morphological, physiological and biochemical responses of zooxanthellae from the Symbiodinium genus isolated from the coral Mussismilia braziliensis, endemic to the Brazilian coast, to acidification led by increased atmospheric CO2. We tested whether photosynthetic yield, cell ultrastructure, cell density and lipid profile would change after up to 16 days of exposure to pH 7.5 in an atmospheric pCO2 of 1633 μatm. Photosynthetic yield and cell density were negatively affected and chloroplasts showed vesiculated thylakoids, indicating morphological damage. Moreover, Symbiodinium fatty acid profile drastically changed in acidified condition, showing lower polyunsaturated fatty acids and higher saturated fatty acids contents, when compared to the control, non-acidified condition. These results show that seawater acidification as an only stressor causes significant changes in the physiology, biochemistry and ultrastructure of free-living Symbiodinium."

We performed a cohort study including declared cases in Monastir from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2017. We reported 997 cases of TB. The predominant site was pulmonarylocalization (n = 486). The age standardized incidence of pulmonary and lymph node TB per 100,000 inh were 5.71 and 2.57 respectively. Trends were negative for pulmonary TB (PTB) (b = - 0.82; r = -0.67; p<10−3) and positive for lymph node localization (b = 1.31; r = 0.63; p<10−3). We had not notified cases of HIV associated with TB. Crude incidence rate (CIR) of PTB per 100,000 inh was 8.17 in Non-Vaccinated Cohort (NVC) and 2.85 in Vaccinated Cohort (VC) (p < 0.0001). Relative risk reduction (RRR) of BCG vaccination was 65.1% (95%CI:57.5;71.4) for pulmonary localization and 65% (95%CI:55; 73) for other localizations. We have not established a significant RRR of BCG vaccination on lymph node TB. Protocol 3 (at birth) had the highest effectiveness with a RRR of 96.7% (95%CI: 86.6%; 99.2%) and 86% (95%CI:71%;91%) in patients with PTB and other localizations TB respectively. In Cox regression model the HR was 0.061 (95% CI 0.015–0.247) for PTB and 0.395 (95% CI 0.185–0.844) for other localizations TB in patients receiving protocol 3 compared to NVC. For lymph-node TB, HR was 1.390 (95% CI 1.043–1.851) for protocol 1 and 1.849 (95% CI 1.232–2.774) for protocol 2 compared to NVC.

https://openalex.org/W2964971142,"Background Human papillomavirus 68 (HPV68) is a probable carcinogenic HPV genotype which is included in almost all HPV screening assays and exists as two genetically variable subtypes (HPV68a and HPV68b). Routine HPV sample testing has shown that the cobas 4800 HPV Test (Roche) provides higher false-negative rates for HPV68 status than PapilloCheck HPV-Screening (Greiner Bio-One). The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of cobas 4800 in HPV68 detection. Methods A total of 2,145 cervical/cervicovaginal samples from women aged 17–88 were tested for HPV68 status using the cobas 4800 and PapilloCheck HPV tests. Viral load was assessed by quantitative PCR in all of the HPV68-positive cases. HPV68a/b subtyping was performed with real-time PCR followed by high resolution melting curve analysis, and was subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Results Cobas 4800 detected HPV positivity in only 13/33 HPV68 single-genotype infection cases. Viral load was comparable across both tested subgroups. HRM analysis and Sanger sequencing identified the HPV68a subtype in all of the 20 instances of cobas 4800 false negatives. HPV68a and HPV68b were detected in 3/13 and 10/13 cases identified as other HPV-positive by cobas 4800. Conclusion The HPV68a subtype was missed by cobas 4800 in more than 85% of all HPV68a-positive cases. Therefore, commercially available assays may underestimate HPV68 prevalence."

Several researchers have proposed that (but not tested whether) firmly committed individuals also engage in more attentional suppression of anomalies, likely mediated by prestimulus alpha power. We expected participants with strong (vs. moderate) political attitudes to display increased pre-stimulus alpha power when processing perceptual anomalies. We recorded electrophysiological activity during the presentation of normal cards (control group) or both normal and anomalous playing cards (experimental group; total N = 191). In line with our predictions, the presence of anomalous playing cards in the stimulus set increased prestimulus alpha power only among individuals with strong but not moderate political attitudes. As potential markers of phasic reactivity, we also analyzed the late positive potential (LPP) and earlier components of the event-related potential, namely P1, N1, and P300. The moderating effect of extreme attitudes on ERP amplitudes remained inconclusive. Altogether, our findings support the idea that ideological conviction is related to increased tonic responses to perceptual anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W2965247147,"Little is known about the gender and age differences associated with the effects of economic fluctuations on hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases. This paper investigates the impact of economic fluctuations on hospitalization for ischemic heart disease (IHD), stroke, and hypertension by age and gender between January 1996 and December 2012 in Taiwan.We adopted a multiple-input time series analysis to examine the strength of the immediate and latent effects of the 17-year quarterly unemployment rates (UR), air pollution exposure (APE), gross domestic product (GDP), per capita consumption expenditure in cigarette and alcohol (ECA), and per capita healthcare expenditure (HE) on the adjusted quarterly incidence rate of hospitalization. The data used in this paper were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database and the website of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), Executive Yuan.Our findings indicate that higher UR increased IHD hospitalization in young men and women and middle-aged women but reduced stroke hospitalization in young men. Higher APE increased IHD hospitalization in young men but reduced it for young women, increased stroke hospitalization in old men and middle-aged women but reduced it for young men, and increased hypertension hospitalization in middle-aged men and young women. Higher ECA reduced IHD hospitalization in middle-aged men, increased stoke hospitalization in middle-aged and old men and middle-aged women. Higher HE reduced IHD hospitalization in old men, young and old women, reduced stroke hospitalization in old women, and reduced hypertension hospitalization in young and middle-aged women.Overall, we found that the economic fluctuations caused increased harmful effects in certain population subgroups but also brought some soothing effects to some groups."
https://openalex.org/W2965317771,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a lyophilized and gamma-sterilized allogeneic freeze-dried bone wedge as a spacer for advancement of a modified tibial tuberosity (mTTA) in 16 knees that were clinically diagnosed with cranial cruciate ligament disease. Patients underwent radiography before the surgical procedure as well as immediately after surgery and at 30, 60, 90 and 120 days post-surgery, and their locomotion was evaluated at the same time points except for the immediate postoperative period. The surgical wounds were evaluated for signs of infection and rejection of the bone implant. Locomotion was graded on a scale of 0-5, with 0 indicating no limping and 5 indicating limb functional impotence. The ""tibial-tibial bone-tibial implant"" interfaces were evaluated radiographically, and each interface was assigned scores of 0-3, with 0 indicating no contact between the implant and adjacent bone and 3 indicating a bone bridge throughout the interface. The patients showed good clinical and radiographic recovery. The lyophilized bone spacer allowed for easy storage and transport and rapid and satisfactory execution of mTTA while showing resistance to drilling and fixation with screws in 87.5% of cases and a mean surgical time of 45.9 minutes. No immunogenic reactions were observed in 93.7% of the cases. One patient presented infection of the surgical focus, which showed remission after antimicrobial therapy. All patients showed functional recovery of the operated limb, with the number of clinically healthy patients being higher than those with claudication at 120 days (p ≤ 0.05). In all patients, it was possible to verify the incorporation of the bone implant into the tibia. Bone union occurred progressively, and the degrees of bone union observed on radiographs at postoperative days 60, 90, and 120 were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than those observed in the immediate postoperative period and at 30 days."
https://openalex.org/W2966266744,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of storage temperature, duration, and storage vessel seal on 24 h urinary hydration markers. Twenty-one males (n = 8) and females (n = 13) (mean±SD; age, 24±5 y; body mass, 68.9±24.2 kg; height, 160.2±32.1 cm) without a history of renal disease or currently taking any medications or supplements known to affect the accuracy of urinary hydration markers were enrolled in this study. Participants provided a 24 h urine sample in a clean container with each urine sample being separate into four separate containers, two in each of the following temperatures: 7°C and 22°C. One specimen container at each temperature was either sealed using the manufacturers cap (single sealed) or the manufacturers cap plus laboratory wrapping film (double sealed). Each sample was analyzed after 1, 2, 3, 7 and 10 days. Urine samples were assessed for urine osmolality (UOSMO), urine specific gravity (USG) and urine color (UCOL). UOSMO was stable at 7°C for two days (mean difference [95% CI]; +1 mmol·kg-1 [0+3], p>0.05) and three days (+1 mmol·kg-1 [0, +3], p>0.05) for single sealed and double sealed containers, respectively. USG measures were stable for singled sealed and double sealed for up to ten days when stored at 22°C. UCOL measures were maintained for up to three days in all storage methods (p>0.05). In conclusion, if immediate analysis is unavailable, such as in the case of field based or longitudinal research, it is recommended that 24 h urine samples are stored in a refrigerated environment and hydration markers (UOSMO and UCOL) be assessed within 48 h."
https://openalex.org/W2965803737,"Kin-biased behavior (that is responding differentially to kin and non-kin) is thought to be adaptive in many social interactions. One example of this kin bias is behaving less aggressively toward a relative than a non-relative, a behavior which yields inclusive fitness benefits. However, data are lacking about the ability of animals to weigh their preference for kinship and the density of conspecifics simultaneously and to respond accordingly. Fire salamanders (Salamandra infraimmaculata) larviposit in high densities in ponds. Thus, larvae of different females confront competition and predation by other larvae. We studied whether larvae prefer their kin over particular density or vice versa. We experimentally used a transparent glass aquarium with inner chambers to test the responses of a focal larva toward its siblings and non-siblings. Specifically, we quantified the time a focal larva spent near its siblings or non-siblings, presented in varying densities, and the aggression level it demonstrated. We found that focal larvae spent more time near non-siblings if non-sibling and sibling groups were of equal density. The focal larvae were also more aggressive toward non-siblings. The results may be explained by the cannibalistic nature of these larvae: high density may provide more opportunities for food, especially when non-siblings are present. Further explanations for these findings may include other advantages of staying in a larger group and/or the stronger olfactory and visual stimulation offered by groups compared to a single individual. These findings suggest that larvae make differential responses toward conspecifics depending simultaneously on the level of relatedness and the density of the group. Such responses have important implications for social-aggregation decisions and may especially affect the fitness of cannibalistic species."
https://openalex.org/W2964835420,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have the potential to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells, indicating that these cells may be the new target cell of interest to produce biopharmaceuticals. Our group recently established a hMSC-derived immortalized hepatocyte-like cell line (imHC) that demonstrates several liver-specific phenotypes. However, the ability of imHC to produce coagulation factors has not been characterized. Here, we examined the potential for imHC as a source of coagulation protein production by investigating the ability of imHC to produce human factor VII (FVII) using a lentiviral transduction system. Our results showed that imHC secreted a low amount of FVII (~22 ng/mL) into culture supernatant. Moreover, FVII from the transduced imHC (0.11 ± 0.005 IU/mL) demonstrated a similar coagulant activity compared with FVII from transduced HEK293T cells (0.12 ± 0.004 IU/mL) as determined by chromogenic assay. We demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that imHC produced FVII, albeit at a low level, indicating the unique characteristic of hepatocytes. Our study suggests the possibility of using imHC for the production of coagulation proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2966518136,"Finding optimal blood pressure (BP) target and BP treatment after acute ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes is an area of controversy and a significant unmet need in the critical care of stroke victims. Numerous large prospective clinical trials have been done to address this question but have generated neutral or conflicting results. One major limitation that may have contributed to so many neutral or conflicting clinical trial results is the “one-size fit all” approach to BP targets, while the optimal BP target likely varies between individuals. We address this problem with the Acute Intervention Model of Blood Pressure (AIM-BP) framework: an individualized, human interpretable model of BP and its control in the acute care setting. The framework consists of two components: one, a model of BP homeostasis and the various effects that perturb it; and two, a parameter estimator that can learn clinically important model parameters on a patient by patient basis. By estimating the parameters of the AIM-BP model for a given patient, the effectiveness of antihypertensive medication can be quantified separately from the patient’s spontaneous BP trends. We hypothesize that the AIM-BP is a sufficient framework for estimating parameters of a homeostasis perturbation model of a stroke patient’s BP time course and the AIM-BP parameter estimator can do so as accurately and consistently as a state-of-the-art maximum likelihood estimation method. We demonstrate that this is the case in a proof of concept of the AIM-BP framework, using simulated clinical scenarios modeled on stroke patients from real world intensive care datasets."
