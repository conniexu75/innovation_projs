https://openalex.org/W2612990169,"Which facial features allow human observers to successfully recognize expressions of emotion? While the eyes and mouth have been frequently shown to be of high importance, research on facial action units has made more precise predictions about the areas involved in displaying each emotion. The present research investigated on a fine-grained level, which physical features are most relied on when decoding facial expressions. In the experiment, individual faces expressing the basic emotions according to Ekman were hidden behind a mask of 48 tiles, which was sequentially uncovered. Participants were instructed to stop the sequence as soon as they recognized the facial expression and assign it the correct label. For each part of the face, its contribution to successful recognition was computed, allowing to visualize the importance of different face areas for each expression. Overall, observers were mostly relying on the eye and mouth regions when successfully recognizing an emotion. Furthermore, the difference in the importance of eyes and mouth allowed to group the expressions in a continuous space, ranging from sadness and fear (reliance on the eyes) to disgust and happiness (mouth). The face parts with highest diagnostic value for expression identification were typically located in areas corresponding to action units from the facial action coding system. A similarity analysis of the usefulness of different face parts for expression recognition demonstrated that faces cluster according to the emotion they express, rather than by low-level physical features. Also, expressions relying more on the eyes or mouth region were in close proximity in the constructed similarity space. These analyses help to better understand how human observers process expressions of emotion, by delineating the mapping from facial features to psychological representation."
https://openalex.org/W2612249406,"Transcriptomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, and other various next-generation sequencing (-omics) fields are known for their production of large datasets, especially across single-cell sequencing studies. Visualizing such big data has posed technical challenges in biology, both in terms of available computational resources as well as programming acumen. Since heatmaps are used to depict high-dimensional numerical data as a colored grid of cells, efficiency and speed have often proven to be critical considerations in the process of successfully converting data into graphics. For example, rendering interactive heatmaps from large input datasets (e.g., 100k+ rows) has been computationally infeasible on both desktop computers and web browsers. In addition to memory requirements, programming skills and knowledge have frequently been barriers-to-entry for creating highly customizable heatmaps.We propose shinyheatmap: an advanced user-friendly heatmap software suite capable of efficiently creating highly customizable static and interactive biological heatmaps in a web browser. shinyheatmap is a low memory footprint program, making it particularly well-suited for the interactive visualization of extremely large datasets that cannot typically be computed in-memory due to size restrictions. Also, shinyheatmap features a built-in high performance web plug-in, fastheatmap, for rapidly plotting interactive heatmaps of datasets as large as 105-107 rows within seconds, effectively shattering previous performance benchmarks of heatmap rendering speed.shinyheatmap is hosted online as a freely available web server with an intuitive graphical user interface: http://shinyheatmap.com. The methods are implemented in R, and are available as part of the shinyheatmap project at: https://github.com/Bohdan-Khomtchouk/shinyheatmap. Users can access fastheatmap directly from within the shinyheatmap web interface, and all source code has been made publicly available on Github: https://github.com/Bohdan-Khomtchouk/fastheatmap."
https://openalex.org/W2614084593,"Bile acids are established signaling molecules next to their role in the intestinal emulsification and uptake of lipids. We here aimed to identify a potential interaction between bile acids and CD4+ Th cells, which are central in adaptive immune responses. We screened distinct bile acid species for their potency to affect T cell function. Primary human and mouse CD4+ Th cells as well as Jurkat T cells were used to gain insight into the mechanism underlying these effects. We found that unconjugated lithocholic acid (LCA) impedes Th1 activation as measured by i) decreased production of the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and TNFαα, ii) decreased expression of the Th1 genes T-box protein expressed in T cells (T-bet), Stat-1 and Stat4, and iii) decreased STAT1α/β phosphorylation. Importantly, we observed that LCA impairs Th1 activation at physiological relevant concentrations. Profiling of MAPK signaling pathways in Jurkat T cells uncovered an inhibition of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation upon LCA exposure, which could provide an explanation for the impaired Th1 activation. LCA induces these effects via Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling since VDR RNA silencing abrogated these effects. These data reveal for the first time that LCA controls adaptive immunity via inhibition of Th1 activation. Many factors influence LCA levels, including bile acid-based drugs and gut microbiota. Our data may suggest that these factors also impact on adaptive immunity via a yet unrecognized LCA-Th cell axis."
https://openalex.org/W2949122710,"Although microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature, relatively little is known about the structural and functional roles of their constituent organisms’ underlying interactions. A common approach to study such questions begins with extracting a network of statistically significant pairwise co-occurrences from a matrix of observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances across sites. The structure of this network is assumed to encode information about ecological interactions and processes, resistance to perturbation, and the identity of keystone species. However, common methods for identifying these pairwise interactions can contaminate the network with spurious patterns that obscure true ecological signals. Here, we describe this problem in detail and develop a solution that incorporates null models to distinguish ecological signals from statistical noise. We apply these methods to the initial OTU abundance matrix and to the extracted network. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to a large soil microbiome data set and show that many previously reported patterns for these data are statistical artifacts. In contrast, we find the frequency of three-way interactions among microbial OTUs to be highly statistically significant. These results demonstrate the importance of using appropriate null models when studying observational microbiome data, and suggest that extracting and characterizing three-way interactions among OTUs is a promising direction for unraveling the structure and function of microbial ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2612735173,"Background Candidemia is a life-threatening fungal infection and it can affect patients of all ages. Characterization of candidemia in the elderly is lacking. Methods We performed a retrospective study of adults (≥ 18 years) with candidemia diagnosed in our center in 2010–2015. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical and microbiologic characteristics, antifungal treatment and outcome were compared between older (≤65 years) and younger (>65 years) patients. Results Among 302 patients with candidemia identified during the study period, 188 (62%) belonged to the elderly group. Comorbidities were significantly more frequent in older patients and included chronic pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure (p ranging from <0.0001 to 0.017). A significantly higher proportion of older patients had septic shock (p = 0.040) at the time of candidemia. Candida albicans accounted for 53% of isolates and there were no significant differences between patients’ age and Candida species. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in older (45%) than in younger (28%) patients (p = 0.003). Factors associated with a significant higher proportion of death in the elderly included older age (i.e.: old-old), being hospitalized in ICU rather than in other wards, suffering from chronic pulmonary diseases, the presence of septic shock, multiple organ failure, dialysis and being infected with C. glabrata (p ranging from <0.0001 to 0.034). On multivariate analysis septic shock (HR 1.744 [CI95% 1.049–2.898], p = 0.032) and multiple organ failure (HR 2.242 [CI95% 1.070–4.698], p = 0.032) were independently associated with a higher risk of death. The probability of 30-days survival of older patients was significantly reduced when compared to that of younger patients (p = 0.005) who did not receive any treatment. In the elderly, there was a trend toward higher MICs for fluconazole/C. albicans, fluconazole/C. glabrata, amphotericin B/C. albicans, and caspofungin/C. glabrata. Conclusions In our study, we found that elderly patients with Candida bloodstream infections are characterized by a high mortality rate. In particular, the lack of any antifungal therapy as well as the occurrence of septic shock increased significantly the overall mortality. Additionally, we found that there was a trend of higher MIC for specific drug/Candida combination."
https://openalex.org/W2612768098,"The known derivatives from hydroquinone, α and β-arbutin, are used as depigmenting agents. In this work, we demonstrate that the oxy form of tyrosinase (oxytyrosinase) hydroxylates α and β-arbutin in ortho position of the phenolic hydroxyl group, giving rise to a complex formed by met-tyrosinase with the hydroxylated α or β-arbutin. This complex could evolve in two ways: by oxidizing the originated o-diphenol to o-quinone and deoxy-tyrosinase, or by delivering the o-diphenol and met-tyrosinase to the medium, which would produce the self-activation of the system. Note that the quinones generated in both cases are unstable, so the catalysis cannot be studied quantitatively. However, if 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride hydrate is used, the o-quinone is attacked, so that it becomes an adduct, which can be oxidized by another molecule of o-quinone, generating o-diphenol in the medium. In this way, the system reaches the steady state and originates a chromophore, which, in turn, has a high absorptivity in the visible spectrum. This reaction allowed us to characterize α and β-arbutin kinetically as substrates of tyrosinase for the first time, obtaining a Michaelis constant values of 6.5 ± 0.58 mM and 3 ± 0.19 mM, respectively. The data agree with those from docking studies that showed that the enzyme has a higher affinity for β-arbutin. Moreover, the catalytic constants obtained by the kinetic studies (catalytic constant = 4.43 ± 0.33 s-1 and 3.7 ± 0.29 s-1 for α and β-arbutin respectively) agree with our forecast based on 13 C NMR considerations. This kinetic characterization of α and β-arbutin as substrates of tyrosinase should be taken into account to explain possible adverse effects of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2612413224,"Objective To determine the prevalence of apathy and depression in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), and the relationships between both apathy and depression with cognition. To examine whether apathy is specifically related to impairment in executive functioning and processing speed. Methods 196 patients with a clinical lacunar stroke and an anatomically corresponding lacunar infarct on MRI were compared to 300 stroke-free controls. Apathy and depression were measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale, and cognitive functioning was assessed using an SVD cognitive screening tool, the Brief Memory and Executive Test, which measures executive functioning/processing speed and memory/orientation. Path analysis and binary logistic regression were used to assess the relation between apathy, depression and cognitive impairment. Results 31 participants with SVD (15.8%) met criteria for apathy only, 23 (11.8%) for both apathy and depression, and 2 (1.0%) for depression only. In the SVD group the presence of apathy was related to global cognition, and specifically to impaired executive functioning/processing speed, but not memory/orientation. The presence of depression was not related to global cognition, impaired executive functioning/processing speed or memory/orientation. Conclusions Apathy is a common feature of SVD and is associated with impaired executive functioning/processing speed suggesting the two may share biological mechanisms. Screening for apathy should be considered in SVD, and further work is required to develop and evaluate effective apathy treatment or management in SVD."
https://openalex.org/W2612641650,"Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 (LG2055) is one of the probiotic lactic acid bacteria. Recently, we demonstrated that feeding with LG2055 extended the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans and that the prolongevity effect was dependent upon the regulation of oxidative stress response. In this study, we assessed whether LG2055 regulated the oxidative stress response of mammalian cells. In NIH-3T3 cells and primary mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, low cell proliferation rates and high reactive oxygen species levels were observed following paraquat treatment. LG2055 treatment suppressed these responses in paraquat-treated cells, indicating that LG2055 protected against oxidative stress in mammalian cells. The mRNA expression of oxidative stress-related genes, total nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein levels, and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 were increased by LG2055 treatment. These results suggested that the Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway was activated by LG2055. Furthermore, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated by LG2055 treatment and the inhibition of JNK suppressed the activation of the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway in LG2055-treated cells. Together, these findings suggest that LG2055 activated the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway by JNK activation, thus strengthening the defense system against oxidative stress in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2612498226,"Water transport across cell membranes can be measured non-invasively with diffusion NMR. We present a method to quantify the intracellular lifetime of water in cell suspensions with short transverse relaxation times, T2, and also circumvent the confounding effect of different T2 values in the intra- and extracellular compartments. Filter exchange spectroscopy (FEXSY) is specifically sensitive to exchange between compartments with different apparent diffusivities. Our investigation shows that FEXSY could yield significantly biased results if differences in T2 are not accounted for. To mitigate this problem, we propose combining FEXSY with diffusion-relaxation correlation experiment, which can quantify differences in T2 values in compartments with different diffusivities. Our analysis uses a joint constrained fitting of the two datasets and considers the effects of diffusion, relaxation and exchange in both experiments. The method is demonstrated on yeast cells with and without human aquaporins."
https://openalex.org/W2612637216,"Mounting evidence indicates that a disturbed Wnt-β-catenin signaling may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone and mineral disorder (CKD-MBD). Data on the impact of CKD on circulating levels of the Wnt antagonists sclerostin and Dickkopf related protein 1 (DKK1) and the relationship with laboratory parameters of CKD-MBD are incomplete.We analyzed serum sclerostin and DKK1 in 308 patients across the stages of chronic kidney disease (kDOQI stage 1-2 n = 41; CKD stage 3 n = 54; CKD stage 4-5 n = 54; hemodialysis n = 100; peritoneal dialysis n = 59) as well as in 49 healthy controls. We investigated associations with demographics, renal function, parameters of mineral metabolism including 25(OH) vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, biointact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and parathyroid hormone (PTH), and bone turnover markers.Serum sclerostin, but not DKK1, increases in more advanced stages of CKD and associates with PTH, phosphate, and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D concentrations. Bone turnover markers are highest in hemodialysis patients presenting the combination of high PTH with low sclerostin level. Serum DKK1 levels are lower in CKD patients than in controls and are not associated with laboratory parameters of mineral metabolism. Interestingly, a direct association between DKK1 and platelet count was observed.In CKD, serum levels of the Wnt inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin are unrelated, indicating different sites of origin and/ or different regulatory mechanisms. Sclerostin, as opposed to DKK1, may qualify as a biomarker of CKD-MBD, particularly in dialysis patients. DKK1 serum levels, remarkably, correlate almost uniquely with blood platelet counts."
https://openalex.org/W2612774359,"Background Obesity has been linked to poor access to medical care. Although scientific evidence suggest that kidney transplantation improves survival and quality of life in obese patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), few data exist on the impact of obesity on access to kidney transplantation in this population. Objectives We aimed to characterize the relationships between body mass index (BMI) at the start of dialysis, changes in BMI after the start of dialysis, and either access to kidney transplantation or overall mortality in dialysis or transplantation among ESRD patients. Methods Between 2002 and 2011, 19524 dialysis patients with ESRD were included in the study via the French nationwide Renal Epidemiology and Information Network. Data on sociodemographic factors, comorbidities and laboratory test results were recorded upon entry into the registry. BMI were obtained at the start of dialysis and then yearly. Cubic spline regression analyses provided a graphic evaluation of the relationships between BMI at the start of dialysis and outcomes. Joint models were used to evaluate the association between the change over time in BMI and outcomes. Results During a median follow-up of 20.3 months, 6634 patients underwent kidney transplantation. A BMI >31 kg/m2 at the start of the dialysis was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving a kidney transplant, and the likelihood decreased even further with higher BMI values. For patients with BMI ≥30kg/m2 at the start of the dialysis, a 1 kg/m2 decrease in BMI during follow-up was associated with a 9% to 11% increase in the likelihood of receiving a transplant. There was an L-shaped relationship between BMI at the start of dialysis and overall mortality. We showed that obese patients with ESRD face barriers to the receipt of a kidney transplant without valid reasons. Conclusion Greater attention to this issue would improve the fairness of the organ allocation process and might improve outcomes for obese patients with ESRD."
https://openalex.org/W2613931315,"Aim To determine the separate effects of exercise amount and intensity on the rate of response for glucose and insulin variables, where rate of response was defined as the number of individuals with improvement in glucose and insulin values that was beyond the day-to-day variability of measurement. Methods Participants were 171 sedentary, middle-aged abdominally obese adults who completed a 24-week intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to (1) no-exercise control (n = 51), (2) low-amount, low-intensity exercise (LALI, n = 38), (3) high-amount, low-intensity exercise (HALI, n = 52), or (4) high-amount, high-intensity exercise (HAHI, n = 30). Two-hour glucose, insulin area under the curve (AUC), and fasting insulin were measured during a 2-hour, 75g oral glucose challenge. The day-to-day variability for these measures was calculated to be ±2.2 mmol/L, ±940.2 pmol/L, and ±38.9 pmol/L, respectively. Results At 24 weeks, the number of nonresponders for 2-hr glucose was 98.0%, 86.8%, 94.2%, 86.7% in the control, LALI, HALI, and HAHI groups, respectively. The number of nonresponders for insulin AUC was 88.0%, 75.7%, 75.0%, 80.0% in the control, LALI, HALI, and HAHI groups, respectively. The number of nonresponders for fasting insulin was 88.2%, 84.2%, 84.6%, 93.3% in the control, LALI, HALI, and HAHI groups, respectively. The rate of response was not different between control and any of the exercise groups for any measure (p>0.05). Conclusion The improvement in glucose and insulin measures did not exceed the day-to-day variability of measurement for approximately 80% of the participants independent of exercise amount or intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2613734415,"Cardiac glycosides such as digoxin are Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors that are widely used for the treatment of chronic heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias; however, recent epidemiological studies have suggested a relationship between digoxin treatment and increased mortality. We previously showed that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, which regulate caspase-1-dependent interleukin (IL)-1β release, mediate the sterile cardiovascular inflammation. Because the Na+/K+-ATPase is involved in inflammatory responses, we investigated the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the pathophysiology of cardiac glycoside-induced cardiac inflammation and dysfunction. The cardiac glycoside ouabain induced cardiac dysfunction and injury in wild-type mice primed with a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), although no cardiac dysfunction was observed in mice treated with either ouabain or LPS alone. Ouabain also induced cardiac inflammatory responses, such as macrophage infiltration and IL-1β release, when mice were primed with LPS. These cardiac manifestations were all significantly attenuated in mice deficient in IL-1β. Furthermore, deficiency of NLRP3 inflammasome components, NLRP3 and caspase-1, also attenuated ouabain-induced cardiac dysfunction and inflammation. In vitro experiments revealed that ouabain induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation as well as subsequent IL-1β release from macrophages, and this activation was mediated by K+ efflux. Our findings demonstrate that cardiac glycosides promote cardiac inflammation and dysfunction through NLRP3 inflammasomes and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of cardiac glycosides."
https://openalex.org/W2612683892,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Folate helps to maintain DNA integrity and to regulate gene expression. Serum folate levels may affect the risk of several cancers, including lung cancer. In this study we evaluated the association between serum folate concentration and variations in genes involved in folate metabolism with lung cancer incidence in Poland.The study included 366 lung cancer patients and 366 control subjects. We measured serum folate concentration and genotyped six variants in MTHFR, MTR and MTRR genes. The odds ratios of being diagnosed with lung cancer were calculated using conditional univariable and multivariable logistic regression with respect to folate level and genotypes.The mean serum folate level was lower in lung cancer cases than in control group (20.07 nmol/l vs. 22.52 nmol/l, p = 0.002). The odds ratio for lung cancer declined with increasing serum content of the folate. The folate concentration of >25.71 nmol/l (IVth quartile) in comparison to <15.92 nmol/l (Ist quartile) was associated with an odds ratio of 0.61 (95%CI 0.40-0.95, p = 0.03). The analysis of variations in MTHFR, MTR and MTRR genes did not reveal any significant difference between lung cancer cases and controls in univariable and multivariable analyses.In this case-control study, lower serum folate concentrations were associated with a higher risk of lung cancer diagnosis. Although previous findings have been somewhat mixed, our results add to the evidence that circulating folate levels may be an indicator of lung cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2614051104,"Background Although Plasmodium vivax contributes to almost half of all malaria cases outside Africa, it has been relatively neglected compared to the more deadly P. falciparum. It is known that P. vivax populations possess high genetic diversity, differing geographically potentially due to different vector species, host genetics and environmental factors. Results We analysed the high-quality genomic data for 46 P. vivax isolates spanning 10 countries across 4 continents. Using population genetic methods we identified hotspots of selection pressure, including the previously reported MRP1 and DHPS genes, both putative drug resistance loci. Extra copies and deletions in the promoter region of another drug resistance candidate, MDR1 gene, and duplications in the Duffy binding protein gene (PvDBP) potentially involved in erythrocyte invasion, were also identified. For surveillance applications, continental-informative markers were found in putative drug resistance loci, and we show that organellar polymorphisms could classify P. vivax populations across continents and differentiate between Plasmodia spp. Conclusions This study has shown that genomic diversity that lies within and between P. vivax populations can be used to elucidate potential drug resistance and invasion mechanisms, as well as facilitate the molecular barcoding of the parasite for surveillance applications."
https://openalex.org/W2612110587,"We compared the results of a long-term (65 years) experiment in a South African grassland with the world's longest-running ecological experiment, the Park Grass study at Rothamsted, U.K. The climate is warm and humid in South Africa and cool and temperate in England. The African grassland has been fertilized with two forms of nitrogen applied at four levels, phosphorus and lime in a crossed design in 96 plots. In 1951, about 84% of plant cover consisted of Themeda triandra, Tristachya leucothrix and Setaria nigrirostris. Currently, the dominant species are Panicum maximum, Setaria sphacelata and Eragrostis curvula, making up 71% of total biomass. As in the Park Grass experiment, we found a significant (additive) interaction effect on ANPP of nitrogen and phosphorus, and a (marginally significant) negative correlation between ANPP and species richness. Unlike the Park Grass experiment, there was no correlation between ANPP and species richness when pH was included as a covariate. There was also a significant negative effect of nitrogen amount and nitrogen form and a positive effect of lime on species richness and species diversity. Soil pH had an important effect on species richness. Liming was insufficient to balance the negative effects on species richness of nitrogen fertilization. There was a significant effect of pH on biomass of three abundant species. There were also significant effects of light on the biomass of four species, with only Panicum maximum having a negative response to light. In all of the abundant species, adding total species richness and ANPP to the model increased the amount of variance explained. The biomass of Eragrostis curvula and P. maximum were negatively correlated with species richness while three other abundant species increased with species richness, suggesting that competition and facilitation were active. Consistent with the results from the Park Grass and other long-term fertilization experiments of grasslands, we found a positive effect of soil pH and a negative effect of nitrogen amount on species richness, a more acutely negative effect on species richness of acidic ammonium sulphate fertilizer than limestone ammonium nitrate, a negative relationship between species richness and biomass, and a positive effect on species richness of lime interacting with nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2612730730,"Multiple human diseases including cancer have been associated with a dysregulation in RNA splicing patterns. In the current study, modifications to the global RNA splicing landscape of cellular genes were investigated in the context of Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer. Global alterations to the RNA splicing landscape of cellular genes was examined in a large-scale screen from 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas using high-throughput RNA sequencing data. RT-PCR analysis, mass spectrometry, and co-immunoprecipitation studies were also used to experimentally validate and investigate the differential alternative splicing (AS) events that were observed through RNA-seq studies. Our study identifies alterations in the AS patterns of approximately 900 genes such as tumor suppressor genes, transcription factors, splicing factors, and kinases. These findings allowed the identification of unique gene signatures for which AS is misregulated in both Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer and EBV-negative gastric cancer. Moreover, we show that the expression of Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) leads to modifications in the AS profile of cellular genes and that the EBNA1 protein interacts with cellular splicing factors. These findings provide insights into the molecular differences between various types of gastric cancer and suggest a role for the EBNA1 protein in the dysregulation of cellular AS."
https://openalex.org/W2613476183,"Background Biodegradable fixation systems could reduce or eliminate problems associated with titanium removal of implants in a second operation. Aim The aim of this study was to compare the long-term (i.e. >5 years postoperatively) clinical performance of a titanium and a biodegradable system in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Materials and methods The present multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was performed in four hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients treated with a bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) and/or a Le Fort-I osteotomy, and those treated for fractures of the mandible, maxilla, or zygoma were included from December 2006 to July 2009. The patients were randomly assigned to either a titanium (KLS Martin) or a biodegradable group (Inion CPS). Results After >5 years postoperatively, plate removal was performed in 22 of the 134 (16.4%) patients treated with titanium and in 23 of the 87 (26.4%) patients treated with the biodegradable system (P = 0.036, hazard ratio (HR) biodegradable (95% CI) = 2.0 (1.05–3.8), HR titanium = 1). Occlusion, VAS pain scores, and MFIQ showed good and (almost) pain free mandibular function in both groups. Conclusion In conclusion, the performance of the Inion CPS biodegradable system was inferior compared to the KLS Martin titanium system regarding plate/screws removal in the abovementioned surgical procedures.

https://openalex.org/W2613029388,"Candida albicans biofilms play a key role in denture stomatitis, one of the most common oral pathologies in elderly people. Because biofilms are highly resistant to antifungals, new pharmacological strategies are needed. Aspirin and nitric oxide-donor molecules have both shown antibiofilm effects on C. albicans, making them promising candidates for treatment. In this study, we evaluated the antifungal/antibiofilm effect of a nitric-oxide releasing aspirin (NO-ASA) on C. albicans isolates from denture stomatitis patients in vitro. Disk diffusion assays showed that while NO-ASA had no antifungal effect, the drug potentiated fluconazole inhibition zone diameters, increasing the effect of fluconazole by 20–30% (p<0.05). The effect of NO-ASA on the morphogenesis of C. albicans was evaluated using light microscopy after inducing hyphae formation. For all clinical strains assayed, 125 μM NO-ASA significantly decreased the number of filamentous cells present (p<0.01). Adhesion to abiotic surfaces, a critical event for biofilm formation, was evaluated in 96-well polystyrene plates using crystal violet assay; 125 μM NO-ASA significantly inhibited adhesion. Biofilms were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantified using XTT reduction assay. NO-ASA decreased biofilm formation (IC50 ranging from 300 μM to 700 μM), consistent with SEM findings of altered biofilm microarchitecture. PGE2 and carboxy-PTIO (an NO scavenger) both blocked the antibiofilm effects of NO-ASA, suggesting that the efficacy of NO-ASA may be associated with both inhibition of PGE2 synthesis and release of NO. NO-ASA is a promising novel antibiofilm agent for treating fluconazole-resistant strains of C. albicans."
https://openalex.org/W2611450907,"The oxidative cost of reproduction has been a matter of debate in recent years presumably because of the lack of proper experimental studies. Based on the hypothesis that different brood sizes produce differential reproductive costs, an experimental manipulation during breeding of Adélie penguins was conducted at Hope Bay, Antarctica, to study oxidative status and stress. We predict that a lower reproductive effort should be positively related to low oxidative and physiological stress. We randomly assigned nests with two chicks to a control reproductive effort group (CRE), and by removing one chick from some nests with two chicks, formed a second, low reproductive effort group (LRE). We examined how oxidative status in blood plasma (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROMs, and total antioxidant capacity, OXY) and stress (heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, H/L) responded to a lower production of offspring total biomass. Our nest manipulation showed significant differences in offspring total biomass, which was lower in the LRE group. As predicted, the LRE group had higher antioxidant capacity than individuals in the CRE group. We have also found, although marginally significant, interactions between sex and treatment in the three variables analysed. Females had higher OXY, lower ROMs and lower H/L ratio when rearing one chick, whereas males did so when rearing two except for OXY which was high regardless of treatment. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between the H/L ratio and OXY in females. Finally, we have found a negative and significant relationship between the duration of the experiment and OXY and ROMs and positive with H/L ratio which suggests that indeed breeding penguins are paying an effort in physiological terms in relation to the duration of the chick rearing. In conclusion, a reduction of the reproductive effort decreased oxidative stress in this long-lived bird meaning that a link exists between breeding effort and oxidative stress. However, our findings suggest different sex strategies which results in opposite physiological responses presumably depending on different life-history strategies in males and females."
https://openalex.org/W2613583934,"The natural variation of fish presence in high-velocity tidal channels is not well understood. A better understanding of fish use of these areas would aid in predicting fish interactions with marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices, the effects of which are uncertain but of high concern. To characterize the patterns in fish presence at a tidal energy site in Cobscook Bay, Maine, we examined two years of hydroacoustic data continuously collected at the proposed depth of an MHK turbine with a bottom-mounted, side-looking echosounder. The maximum number of fish counted per hour ranged from hundreds in the early spring to over 1,000 in the fall. Counts varied greatly with tidal and diel cycles in a seasonally changing relationship, likely linked to the seasonally changing fish community of the bay. In the winter and spring, higher hourly counts were generally confined to ebb tides and low slack tides near sunrise and sunset. In summer and fall of each year, the highest fish counts shifted to night and occurred during ebb, low slack, and flood tides. Fish counts were not linked to current speed, and did not decrease as current speed increased, contrary to observations at other tidal power sites. As fish counts may be proportional to the encounter rate of fish with an MHK turbine at the same depth, highly variable counts indicate that the risk to fish is similarly variable. The links between fish presence and environmental cycles at this site will likely be present at other locations with similar environmental forcing, making these observations useful in predicting potential fish interactions at tidal energy sites worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2613244153,"The studies in this PLOS ONE collection investigated the feasibility of community participation in Measuring, Reporting and Verifying (Participatory MRV-PMRV) initiatives in the context of national programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). While such participation is desirable, its feasibility has been uncertain. This collection builds the empirical foundations for putting PMRV into practice. The authors of this article identified five crucial considerations: (1) clarify the stakeholders, (2) understand their motivation to participate, (3) integrate knowledge and information from multiple disciplines and sources, (4) convey knowledge and information across multiple levels of governance, and (5) clarify and enable the links to REDD+ safeguards. We conclude that local communities and other local actors can play a major role in achieving REDD+ MRV, however, this requires attention to their needs and motivations. Future activities should include assessment of past PMRV experiences, costs and benefits, operationalization of reporting and verification, formalization of PMRV and full scale testing on the ground."
https://openalex.org/W2612553044,"Samples submitted for HIV PCR testing that fail to yield a positive or negative result represent missed diagnostic opportunities. We describe HIV PCR test rejections and indeterminate results, and the associated delay in diagnosis, within South Africa's early infant diagnosis (EID) program from 2010 to 2015.HIV PCR test data from January 2010 to December 2015 were extracted from the National Health Laboratory Service Corporate Data Warehouse, a central data repository of all registered test-sets within the public health sector in South Africa, by laboratory number, result, date, facility, and testing laboratory. Samples that failed to yield either a positive or negative result were categorized according to the rejection code on the laboratory information system, and descriptive analysis performed using Microsoft Excel. Delay in diagnosis was calculated for patients who had a missed diagnostic opportunity registered between January 2013 and December 2015 by means of a patient linking-algorithm employing demographic details.Between 2010 and 2015, 2 178 582 samples were registered for HIV PCR testing of which 6.2% (n = 134 339) failed to yield either a positive or negative result, decreasing proportionally from 7.0% (n = 20 556) in 2010 to 4.4% (n = 21 388) in 2015 (p<0.001). Amongst 76 972 coded missed diagnostic opportunities, 49 585 (64.4%) were a result of pre-analytical error and 27 387 (35.6%) analytical error. Amongst 49 694 patients searched for follow-up results, 16 895 (34.0%) had at least one subsequent HIV PCR test registered after a median of 29 days (IQR: 13-57), of which 8.4% tested positive compared with 3.6% of all samples submitted for the same period.Routine laboratory data provides the opportunity for near real-time surveillance and quality improvement within the EID program. Delay in diagnosis and wastage of resources associated with missed diagnostic opportunities must be addressed and infants actively followed-up as South Africa works towards elimination of mother-to-child transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2612242257,"Placement in prestigious research institutions for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) PhD recipients is generally considered to be optimal. Yet some doctoral recipients are not interested in intensive research careers and instead seek alternative careers, outside but also within academe (for example teaching positions in Liberal Arts Schools). Recent attention to non-academic pathways has expanded our understanding of alternative PhD careers. However, career preferences and placements are also nuanced along the academic pathway. Existing research on academic careers (mostly research-centric) has found that certain factors have a significant impact on the prestige of both the institutional placement and the salary of PhD recipients. We understand less, however, about the functioning of career preferences and related placements outside of the top academic research institutions. Our work builds on prior studies of academic career placement to explore the impact that prestige of PhD-granting institution, advisor involvement, and cultural capital have on the extent to which STEM PhDs are placed in their preferred academic institution types. What determines whether an individual with a preference for research oriented institutions works at a Research Extensive university? Or whether an individual with a preference for teaching works at a Liberal Arts college? Using survey data from a nationally representative sample of faculty in biology, biochemistry, civil engineering and mathematics at four different Carnegie Classified institution types (Research Extensive, Research Intensive, Master’s I & II, and Liberal Arts Colleges), we examine the relative weight of different individual and institutional characteristics on institutional type placement. We find that doctoral institutional prestige plays a significant role in matching individuals with their preferred institutional type, but that advisor involvement only has an impact on those with a preference for research oriented institutions. Gender effects are also observed, particularly in the role of the advisor in affecting preferred career placement."
https://openalex.org/W2613350194,"Background Preterm birth is a major risk factor for neurodevelopmental delays and disorders. This study aimed to identify genomic biomarkers of intrauterine inflammation in umbilical cord tissue in preterm neonates that predict cognitive impairment at 10 years of age. Study design Genome-wide messenger RNA (mRNA) levels from umbilical cord tissue were obtained from 43 neonates born before 28 weeks of gestation. Genes that were differentially expressed across four indicators of intrauterine inflammation were identified and their functions examined. Exact logistic regression was used to test whether expression levels in umbilical cord tissue predicted neurocognitive function at 10 years of age. Results Placental indicators of inflammation were associated with changes in the mRNA expression of 445 genes in umbilical cord tissue. Transcripts with decreased expression showed significant enrichment for biological signaling processes related to neuronal development and growth. The altered expression of six genes was found to predict neurocognitive impairment when children were 10 years old These genes include two that encode for proteins involved in neuronal development. Conclusion Prenatal intrauterine inflammation is associated with altered gene expression in umbilical cord tissue. A set of six of the differentially expressed genes predict cognitive impairment later in life, suggesting that the fetal environment is associated with significant adverse effects on neurodevelopment that persist into later childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2592456710,"Communication between different sub regions of the hippocampus is fundamental to learning and memory. However accurate knowledge about information transfer between sub regions from access to the activity in individual axons is lacking. MEMS devices with microtunnels connecting two sub networks have begun to approach this problem but the commonly used 10 μm wide tunnels frequently measure signals from multiple axons. To reduce this complexity, we compared polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microtunnel devices each with a separate tunnel width of 2.5, 5 or 10 μm bridging two wells aligned over a multi electrode array (MEA). Primary rat neurons were grown in the chambers with neurons from the dentate gyrus on one side and hippocampal CA3 on the other. After 2–3 weeks of culture, spontaneous activity in the axons inside the tunnels was recorded. We report electrophysiological, exploratory data analysis for feature clustering and visual evidence to support the expectation that 2.5 μm wide tunnels have fewer axons per tunnel and therefore more clearly delineated signals than 10 or 5 μm wide tunnels. Several measures indicated that fewer axons per electrode enabled more accurate detection of spikes. A clustering analysis comparing the variations of spike height and width for different tunnel widths revealed tighter clusters representing unique spikes with less height and width variation when measured in narrow tunnels. Wider tunnels tended toward more diffuse clusters from a continuum of spike heights and widths. Standard deviations for multiple cluster measures, such as Average Dissimilarity, Silhouette Value (S) and Separation Factor (average dissimilarity/S value), support a conclusion that 2.5 μm wide tunnels containing fewer axons enable more precise determination of individual action potential peaks, their propagation direction, timing, and information transfer between sub networks."
https://openalex.org/W2613862882,"Past research indicates that whitebark pine seeds are a critical food source for Threatened grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). In recent decades, whitebark pine forests have declined markedly due to pine beetle infestation, invasive blister rust, and landscape-level fires. To date, no study has reliably estimated the contribution of whitebark pine seeds to the diets of grizzlies through time. We used stable isotope ratios (expressed as δ13C, δ15N, and δ34S values) measured in grizzly bear hair and their major food sources to estimate the diets of grizzlies sampled in Cooke City Basin, Montana. We found that stable isotope mixing models that included different combinations of stable isotope values for bears and their foods generated similar proportional dietary contributions. Estimates generated by our top model suggest that whitebark pine seeds (35±10%) and other plant foods (56±10%) were more important than meat (9±8%) to grizzly bears sampled in the study area. Stable isotope values measured in bear hair collected elsewhere in the GYE and North America support our conclusions about plant-based foraging. We recommend that researchers consider model selection when estimating the diets of animals using stable isotope mixing models. We also urge researchers to use the new statistical framework described here to estimate the dietary responses of grizzlies to declines in whitebark pine seeds and other important food sources through time in the GYE (e.g., cutthroat trout), as such information could be useful in predicting how the population will adapt to future environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W2613876370,"Tree ferns are an important structural component of forests in many countries. However, because their regeneration is often unrelated to major disturbances, their age is often difficult to determine. In addition, rates of growth may not be uniform, which further complicates attempts to determine their age. In this study, we measured 5 years of growth of Cyathea australis and Dicksonia antarctica after a large wildfire in 2009 in south-eastern Australia. We found growth rates of these two species were unaffected by aspect and elevation but slope had a minor effect with D. antarctica growing 0.3mm faster for each additional degree of slope. Geographic location influenced growth in both species by up to 12 - 14mm/yr. The most consistent factor influencing growth rate, however, was initial height at the time of the 2009 fire; a finding consistent in both species and all geographic locations. For both tree fern species, individuals that were taller at the commencement of the study had greater overall growth for the duration of the study. This effect did not decrease even among the tallest tree ferns in our study (up to 6 metres tall). Overall, Cyathea australis averaged 73 (± 22)mm/year of growth (± 1SD), with the rate increasing 5mm/yr per metre of additional height. Dicksonia antarctica averaged 33 (± 13)mm/year, increasing by 6mm/yr/m. Growth rates dependent on initial height were unexpected and we discuss possible reasons for this finding. Variable growth rates also suggest that common age estimation methods of dividing height by average growth rate are likely to underestimate the age of short tree ferns, while overestimating the age of tall tree ferns, particularly if they have been subject to a fire."

The bivalent AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine contains two gp120 envelope glycoproteins, one from the subtype B HIV-1 MN isolate and one from the subtype CRF01_AE A244 isolate. Each envelope glycoprotein harbors a highly conserved 27-amino acid HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) tag sequence that shares 93% sequence identity with the HSV-2 gD sequence. We assessed whether vaccine-induced anti-gD antibodies protected females against HSV-2 acquisition in RV144.Of the women enrolled in RV144, 777 vaccine and 807 placebo recipients were eligible and randomly selected according to their pre-vaccination HSV-1 and HSV-2 serostatus for analysis. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA responses to gD were determined by a binding antibody multiplex assay and HSV-2 serostatus was determined by Western blot analysis. Ninety-three percent and 75% of the vaccine recipients had anti-gD IgG and IgA responses two weeks post last vaccination, respectively. There was no evidence of reduction in HSV-2 infection by vaccination compared to placebo recipients over 78 weeks of follow-up. The annual incidence of HSV-2 infection in individuals who were HSV-2 negative at baseline or HSV-1 positive and HSV-2 indeterminate at baseline were 4.38/100 person-years (py) and 3.28/100 py in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively. Baseline HSV-1 status did not affect subsequent HSV-2 acquisition. Specifically, the estimated odds ratio of HSV-2 infection by Week 78 for female placebo recipients who were baseline HSV-1 positive (n = 422) vs. negative (n = 1120) was 1.14 [95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.94, p = 0.64)]. No evidence of reduction in the incidence of HSV-2 infection by vaccination was detected.AIDSVAX® B/E containing gD did not confer protection from HSV-2 acquisition in HSV-2 seronegative women, despite eliciting anti-gD serum antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2613246746,"No prior systematic study on the extent of vasogenic edema (VE) in patients with brain metastases (BM) exists. Here, we aim to determine 1) the general volumetric relationship between BM and VE, 2) a threshold diameter above which a BM shows VE, and 3) the influence of the primary tumor and location of the BM in order to improve diagnostic processes and understanding of edema formation. This single center, retrospective study includes 173 untreated patients with histologically proven BM. Semi-manual segmentation of 1416 BM on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and of 865 VE on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery/T2-weighted images was conducted. Statistical analyses were performed using a paired-samples t-test, linear regression/generalized mixed-effects model, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve controlling for the possible effect of non-uniformly distributed metastases among patients. For BM with non-confluent edema (n = 545), there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the volumes of the BM and the VE (P < 0.001). The optimal threshold for edema formation was a diameter of 9.4 mm for all BM. The primary tumors as interaction term in multivariate analysis had a significant influence on VE formation whereas location had not. Hence VE development is dependent on the volume of the underlying BM and the site of the primary neoplasm, but not from the location of the BM."
https://openalex.org/W2612185793,"Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1α) defects cause Mature Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3 (MODY3), characterized by defects in beta-cell insulin secretion. However, HNF1α is involved in many other metabolic pathways with relevance for monogenic or polygenic type 2 diabetes. We aimed to investigate gut hormones, lipids, and insulin regulation in response to a meal test in HNF1α defect carriers (MODY3) compared to non-diabetic subjects (controls) and type 2 diabetes (T2D).We administered a standardized liquid meal to each participant. Over 6 hours, we measured post-meal responses of insulin regulation (blood glucose, c-peptide, insulin), gut hormones (ghrelin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide-1) and lipids (non-esterified fatty acids [NEFA] and triglycerides).We found that MODY3 participants had lower insulin secretion indices than controls and T2D participants, showing the expected β-cell defect. MODY3 had similar glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c median [IQR]: 6.5 [5.6-7.6]%) compared to T2D (median: 6.6 [6.2-6.9]%; P<0.05). MODY3 had greater insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index: 71.9 [29.6; 125.5]) than T2D (3.2 [4.0; 6.0]; P<0.05). MODY3 experienced a larger decrease in the ratio of NEFA to insulin (NEFA 30-0 / insulin 30-0: -39 [-78; -30] x104) in the early post-prandial period (0-30 minutes) compared to controls and to T2D (-2.0 [-0.6; -6.4] x104; P<0.05). MODY3 had lower fasting (0.66 [0.46; 1.2] mM) and post-meal triglycerides levels compared to T2D (fasting: 2.3 [1.7; 2.7] mM; P<0.05). We did not detect significant post-meal differences in ghrelin and incretins between MODY3 and other groups.In response to a standard meal test, MODY3 showed greater early post-prandial NEFA diminution in response to relatively low early insulin secretion, and they maintained very low post-prandial triglycerides levels."
https://openalex.org/W2612431547,"Investigating the effects of a multifunctional microbial peptide possessing strong anti-inflammatory activity against pathogenic bacteria. The antimicrobial activity of the purified peptide (CSP32) against various multidrug-resistant as well as anaerobic pathogens was determined. Anti-inflammatory activity was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, and RT-PCR in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Molecular weight and structural elucidation were performed by several analytical methods such as mass spectrometry and chemoinformatic analysis. CSP32, purified from newly isolated Bacillus sp. CS32, was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and anaerobic pathogens Propionibacterium acne and Clostridium difficile. Furthermore, CSP32 showed strong inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. At concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 μg/mL, CSP32 treatment attenuated LPS-induced expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as well as other proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-1β. CSP32 potently inhibited translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus by suppressing degradation of IκB kinase (IκBα) and its phosphorylation, thereby causing NF-κB to remain inactive. CSP32 may be the first oligomer of bacitracin with anti-inflammatory properties. Conclusion CSP32 has stable characteristics and may find bio-industrial and therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2613132227,"BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP) encodes a class-I KNOTTED1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factor that plays a critical role in conditioning a replication competent state in the apical meristem, and it also governs growth and cellular differentiation in internodes and pedicels. To search for factors that modify BP signaling, we conducted a suppressor screen on bp er (erecta) plants and identified a mutant that ameliorates many of the pleiotropic defects of the parent line. Map based cloning and complementation studies revealed that the defect lies in the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL) gene, a member of the YABBY family of transcriptional regulators that contribute to meristem organization and function, phyllotaxy, leaf and floral organ growth and polarity, and are also known to repress KNOX gene expression. Genetic and cytological analyses of the fil-10 suppressor line indicate that the role of FIL in promoting growth is independent of its previously characterized influences on meristem identity and lateral organ polarity, and likely occurs non-cell-autonomously from superior floral organs. Transcription profiling of inflorescences revealed that FIL downregulates numerous transcription factors which in turn may subordinately regulate inflorescence architecture. In addition, FIL, directly or indirectly, activates over a dozen genes involved in glucosinolate production in part by activating MYB28, a known activator of many aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes. In the bp er fil-10 suppressor mutant background, enhanced expression of CYP71A13, AMIDASE1 (AMI) and NITRILASE genes suggest that auxin levels can be modulated by shunting glucosinolate metabolites into the IAA biosynthetic pathway, and increased IAA levels in the bp er fil-10 suppressor accompany enhanced internode and pedicel elongation. We propose that FIL acts to oppose KNOX1 gene function through a complex regulatory network that involves changes in secondary metabolites and auxin."
https://openalex.org/W2613548576,"The role of glutamate in the regulation of neurogenesis is well-established, but the role of vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) and excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in controlling adult neurogenesis is unknown. Here we investigated the implication of VGLUTs in the differentiation of subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs). Our results show that NPCs express VGLUT1-3 and EAAT1-3 both at the mRNA and protein level. Their expression increases during differentiation closely associated with the expression of marker genes. In expression analyses we show that VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are preferentially expressed by cultured SVZ-derived doublecortin+ neuroblasts, while VGLUT3 is found on GFAP+ glial cells. In cultured NPCs, inhibition of VGLUT by Evans Blue increased the mRNA level of neuronal markers doublecortin, B3T and MAP2, elevated the number of NPCs expressing doublecortin protein and promoted the number of cells with morphological appearance of branched neurons, suggesting that VGLUT function prevents neuronal differentiation of NPCs. This survival- and differentiation-promoting effect of Evans blue was corroborated by increased AKT phosphorylation and reduced MAPK phosphorylation. Thus, under physiological conditions, VGLUT1-3 inhibition, and thus decreased glutamate exocytosis, may promote neuronal differentiation of NPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2612400889,"Background Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) coinfection is a major global health problem especially among people who inject drugs (PWID), with significant clinical implications. Mathematical models have been used to great effect to shape HIV care, but few have been proposed for HIV/HCV. Methods We constructed a deterministic compartmental ODE model that incorporated layers for HIV disease progression, HCV disease progression and PWID demography. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) scale-ups were modeled as from 2016 and projected forward 10 years. HCV treatment roll-out was modeled beginning in 2026, after a variety of MMT scale-up scenarios, and projected forward 10 years. Results Our results indicate that scale-up of ART has a major impact on HIV though not on HCV burden. MMT scale-up has an impact on incidence of both infections. HCV treatment roll-out has a measurable impact on reductions of deaths, increasing multifold the mortality reductions afforded by just ART/MMT scale-ups. Conclusion HCV treatment roll-out can have major and long-lasting effects on averting PWID deaths on top of those averted by ART/MMT scale-up. Efficient intervention scale-up of HCV alongside HIV interventions is critical in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W2612524748,"Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation, are aspects common to most forms of mindfulness training. There is now an abundance of research demonstrating that mindfulness training has beneficial effects across a wide range of clinical conditions, making it an important tool for clinical intervention. One area of extensive research is on the beneficial effects of mindfulness on experiences of pain. However, the mechanisms of these effects are still not well understood. One hypothesis is that the relaxation components of mindfulness training, through alterations in breathing and muscle tension, leads to changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system functioning which influences pain circuits. The current study seeks to examine how two of the relaxation subcomponents of mindfulness training, deep breathing and muscle relaxation, influence experiences of pain in healthy individuals. Participants were randomized to either a 10 minute deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or control condition after which they were exposed to a cold pain task. Throughout the experiment, measures of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity were collected to assess how deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation alter physiological responses, and if these changes moderate any effects of these interventions on responses to pain. There were no differences in participants' pain tolerances or self-reported pain ratings during the cold pain task or in participants' physiological responses to the task. Additionally, individual differences in physiological functioning were not related to differences in pain tolerance or pain ratings. Overall this study suggests that the mechanisms through which mindfulness exerts its effects on pain are more complex than merely through physiological changes brought about by altering breathing or muscle tension. This indicates a need for more research examining the specific subcomponents of mindfulness, and how these subcomponents might be acting, to better understand their utility as a clinical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2613284515,"Tropical rainforests are frequently limited by soil nutrient availability. However, the response of the metabolic phenotypic plasticity of trees to an increase of soil nutrient availabilities is poorly understood. We expected that increases in the ability of a nutrient that limits some plant processes should be detected by corresponding changes in plant metabolome profile related to such processes.We studied the foliar metabolome of saplings of three abundant tree species in a 15 year field NPK fertilization experiment in a Panamanian rainforest. The largest differences were among species and explained 75% of overall metabolome variation. The saplings of the large canopy species, Tetragastris panamensis, had the lowest concentrations of all identified amino acids and the highest concentrations of most identified secondary compounds. The saplings of the ""mid canopy"" species, Alseis blackiana, had the highest concentrations of amino acids coming from the biosynthesis pathways of glycerate-3P, oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate, and the saplings of the low canopy species, Heisteria concinna, had the highest concentrations of amino acids coming from the pyruvate synthesis pathways.The changes in metabolome provided strong evidence that different nutrients limit different species in different ways. With increasing P availability, the two canopy species shifted their metabolome towards larger investment in protection mechanisms, whereas with increasing N availability, the sub-canopy species increased its primary metabolism. The results highlighted the proportional distinct use of different nutrients by different species and the resulting different metabolome profiles in this high diversity community are consistent with the ecological niche theory."

It is widely being used at increasingly higher doses for the treatment of acute or chronic pancreatitis, severe infection, and acute organ failure. We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of high-dose ulinastatin in healthy volunteers in our single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation study. Fifty-one healthy Chinese subjects were enrolled in 9 dose cohorts (3×105 U, 6×105 U, 12×105 U, 20×105 U, 30×105 U, 45×105 U, 60×105 U, 70×105 U, or 80×105 U of ulinastatin) and randomized to UTI or matching placebo (n = 1). Each dose cohort was composed of 3-7 subjects. All subjects were required to have 2 h of intravenous infusion. Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout the study via monitoring of vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and interviews with the subjects about adverse events. Fifty-one subjects (35 men and 16 women) completed the study. A total of 13 AEs were reported by 10 subjects: 11 adverse events in the ulinastatin groups and 2 adverse events in the placebo group. Twelve of the adverse events were possibly related to the study drug. The most common drug-related adverse events included dizziness, pain at injection site, and a decrease in white blood cell count. All adverse events were of mild severity; none were serious. In conclusion, 2 hours of intravenous infusion of ulinastatin (3×105 to 80×105 U) was well tolerated by healthy Chinese subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2612426754,"A hallmark of the immune response to influenza is repeated encounters with proteins containing both genetically conserved and variable components. Therefore, the B and T cell repertoire is continually being remodeled, with competition between memory and naïve lymphocytes. Our previous work using a mouse model of secondary heterosubtypic influenza infection has shown that this competition results in a focusing of CD4 T cell response specificity towards internal virion proteins with a selective decrease in CD4 T cell reactivity to the novel HA epitopes. Strikingly, this shift in CD4 T cell specificity was associated with a diminished anti-HA antibody response. Here, we sought to determine whether the loss in HA-specific reactivity that occurs as a consequence of immunological memory could be reversed by selectively priming HA-specific CD4 T cells prior to secondary infection. Using a peptide-based priming strategy, we found that selective expansion of the anti-HA CD4 T cell memory repertoire enhanced HA-specific antibody production upon heterosubtypic infection. These results suggest that the potentially deleterious consequences of repeated exposure to conserved influenza internal virion proteins could be reversed by vaccination strategies that selectively arm the HA-specific CD4 T cell compartment. This could be a potentially useful pre-pandemic vaccination strategy to promote accelerated neutralizing antibody production on challenge with a pandemic influenza strain that contains few conserved HA epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2612582212,"The modified multiple platform method (MMPM) is a classical sleep deprivation model. It has been widely used in behavioral and brain research, due to its effects on physical and mental functions. However, different MMPM protocols can promote distinct effects in rats. Although the MMPM has been proved to induce central fatigue, the effects of different durations of subjection to the MMPM remain undetermined. This study aims to investigate the changes in behavior, N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptor 1 (NR1) and 2A (NR2A), as well as the ultrastructural alteration in the hippocampus after different MMPM modelling, to compare the central fatigue effect induced by dynamic MMPM. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: 5-, 14- and 21- day MMPM groups, and a control group. Each MMPM group underwent a 14-hour daily MMPM modelling. After each training session, open field and elevated plus maze tests were performed. Corticosterone levels were detected by ELISA, and the hippocampal NR1 and NR2A were measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. In addition, ultrastructural changes in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1(CA1) region were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The findings showed that the 5 and 14 days of MMPM induced a high-stress state, while the 21 days of MMPM induced anxiety and degenerative alteration in the hippocampal morphology. Additionally, hippocampal NR1 and NR2A gene expression decreased in all MMPM groups, whereas the protein expression only decreased in the 21-day group. Overall, different durations of MMPM caused distinct behavioral and brain changes, and the 21 days of MMPM could induce central fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2613494812,"Background Podoconiosis, non-filarial elephantiasis, is a non-infectious disease found in tropical regions such as Ethiopia, localized in highland areas with volcanic soils cultivated by barefoot subsistence farmers. It is thought that soil particles can pass through the soles of the feet and taken up by the lymphatic system, leading to the characteristic chronic oedema of the lower legs that becomes disfiguring and disabling over time. Methods The close association of the disease with volcanic soils led us to investigate the characteristics of soil samples in an endemic area in Ethiopia to identify the potential causal constituents. We used the in vitro haemolysis assay and compared haemolytic activity (HA) with soil samples collected in a non-endemic region of the same area in Ethiopia. We included soil samples that had been previously characterized, in addition we present other data describing the characteristics of the soil and include pure phase mineral standards as comparisons. Results The bulk chemical composition of the soils were statistically significantly different between the podoconiosis-endemic and non-endemic areas, with the exception of CaO and Cr. Likewise, the soil mineralogy was statistically significant for iron oxide, feldspars, mica and chlorite. Smectite and kaolinite clays were widely present and elicited a strong HA, as did quartz, in comparison to other mineral phases tested, although no strong difference was found in HA between soils from the two areas. The relationship was further investigated with principle component analysis (PCA), which showed that a combination of an increase in Y, Zr and Al2O3, and a concurrent increase Fe2O3, TiO2, MnO and Ba in the soils increased HA. Conclusion The mineralogy and chemistry of the soils influenced the HA, although the interplay between the components is complex. Further research should consider the variable biopersistance, hygroscopicity and hardness of the minerals and further characterize the nano-scale particles."
https://openalex.org/W2613290036,"Accurate and efficient detection of sleep spindles is a methodological challenge. The present study describes a method of using non-experts for manual detection of sleep spindles. We recruited five experts and 168 non-experts to manually identify spindles in stage N2 and stage N3 sleep data using a MATLAB interface. Scorers classified each spindle into definite and indefinite spindle (with weights of 1 and 0.5, respectively). First, a method of optimizing the thresholds of the expert/non-expert group consensus according to the results of experts and non-experts themselves is described. Using this method, we established expert and non-expert group standards from expert and non-expert scorers, respectively, and evaluated the performance of the non-expert group standards by compared with the expert group standard (termed EGS). The results indicated that the highest performance was the non-expert group standard when definite spindles were only considered (termed nEGS-1; F1 score = 0.78 for N2; 0.68 for N3). Second, four automatic spindle detection methods were compared with the EGS. We found that the performance of nEGS-1 versus EGS was higher than that of the four automated methods. Our results also showed positive correlation between the mean F1 score of individual expert in EGS and the F1 score of nEGS-1 versus EGS across 30 segments of stage N2 data (r = 0.61, P < 0.001). Further, we found that six and nine non-experts were needed to manually identify spindles in stages N2 and N3, respectively, while maintaining acceptable performance of nEGS-1 versus EGS (F1 score = 0.79 for N2; 0.64 for N3). In conclusion, this study establishes a detailed process for detection of sleep spindles by non-experts in a crowdsourcing scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2612591822,"Background To determine the safety and clinical efficacy of an innovative integrated airway system (AnapnoGuard™ 100 system) that continuously monitors and controls the cuff pressure (Pcuff), while facilitating the aspiration of subglottic secretions (SS). Methods This was a prospective, single centre, open-label, randomized, controlled feasibility and safety trial. The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of device related adverse events (AE) and serious AE (SAE) as a result of using AnapnoGuard (AG) 100 during mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints were: (1) mechanical complications rate (2) ICU staff satisfaction; (3) VAP occurrence; (4) length of mechanical ventilation; (5) length of Intensive Care Unit stay and mortality; (6) volume of evacuated subglottic secretions. Sixty patients were randomized to be intubated with the AG endotracheal-tube (ETT) and connected to the AG 100 system allowing Pcuff adjustment and SS aspiration; or with an ETT combined with SS drainage and Pcuff controlled manually. Results No difference in adverse events rate was identified between the groups. The use of AG system was associated with a significantly higher incidence of Pcuff determinations in the safety range (97.3% vs. 71%; p<0.01) and a trend to a greater volume of aspirated SS secretions: (192.0[64–413] ml vs. 150[50–200], p = 0.19 (total)); (57.8[20–88.7] ml vs. 50[18.7–62] ml, p = 0.11 (daily)). No inter-group difference was detected using AG system vs. controls in terms of post-extubation throat pain level (0 [0–2] vs. 0 [0–3]; p = 0.7), hoarseness (42.9% vs. 75%; p = 0.55) and tracheal mucosa oedema (16.7% vs. 10%; p = 0.65). Patients enrolled in the AG group had a trend to reduced VAP risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia(VAP) (14.8% vs. 40%; p = 0.06), which were more frequently monomicrobial (25% vs. 70%; p = 0.03). No statistically significant difference was observed in duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and mortality. Conclusions The use AG 100 system and AG tube in critically ill intubated patients is safe and effective in Pcuff control and SS drainage. Its protective role against VAP needs to be confirmed in a larger randomized trial. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01550978. Date of registration: February 21, 2012."
https://openalex.org/W2612792083,"Aim Increased levels of circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) have been reported in ulcerative colitis. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of S1P on colonic smooth muscle contractility and how is it affected by colitis. Methods Colonic inflammation was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Five days later colon segments were isolated and used for contractility experiments and immunoblotting. Results S1P contracted control and inflamed colon segments and the contraction was significantly greater in inflamed colon segments. S1P-induced contraction was mediated by S1PR1 and S1PR2 in control and S1PR2 in inflamed colon segments. S1PR3 did not play a significant role in S1P-induced contractions in control or inflamed colon. S1PR1, S1PR2 and S1PR3 proteins were expressed in colon segments from both groups. The expression of S1PR1 and S1PR2 was significantly enhanced in control and inflamed colon segments, respectively. S1PR3 levels however were not significantly different between the two groups. Nifedipine significantly reduced S1P-induced contraction in control but not inflamed colon segments. Thapsigargin significantly reduced S1P-induced contraction of the inflamed colon. GF 109203X and Y-27632, alone abolished S1P-induced contraction of the control but not inflamed colon segments. Combination of GF 109203X, Y-27632 and thapsigargin abolished S1P-induced contraction of inflamed colon segments. Conclusion S1P contracted control colon via S1PR1 and S1PR2 and inflamed colon exclusively via S1PR2. Calcium influx (control) or release (inflamed) and calcium sensitization are involved in S1P-induced contraction. Exacerbated response to S1P in colitic colon segments may explain altered colonic motility reported in patients and experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2612899361,"TiO2-SiO2 composites were synthesized using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as the structure directing template. Self-assembly hexadecyltrimethyl- ammonium bromide TiO2-SiO2/(CTAB) were soaked into silver nitrate (AgNO3) aqueous solution. The Ag-TiO2-SiO2(Ag-TS) composite were prepared via a precipitation of AgBr in soaking process and its decomposition at calcination stage. Structural characterization of the materials was carried out by various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption and ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). Characterization results revealed that Ag particles were incorporated into hierarchical TiO2-SiO2 without significantly affecting the structures of the supports. Further heating-treatment at 723 K was more favorable for enhancing the stability of the Ag-TS composite. The cyclohexene oxide was the major product in the epoxidation using H2O2 as the oxidant over the Ag-TS catalysts. Besides, the optimum catalytic activity and stability of Ag-TS catalysts were obtained under operational conditions of calcined at 723 K for 2 h, reaction time of 120 min, reaction temperature of 353 K, catalyst amount of 80 mg, aqueous H2O2 (30 wt.%) as oxidant and chloroform as solvent. High catalytic activity with conversion rate up to 99.2% of cyclohexene oxide could be obtainable in water-bathing. The catalyst was found to be stable and could be reused three times without significant loss of catalytic activity under the optimized reaction conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2613517509,"Background The contribution of 5α-reductase 1 and 5α-reductase 2 to prostate cancer development and progression is not clearly understood. TRAMP mice are a common prostate cancer model, in which 5α-reductase 1 and 5α-reductase 2 expression levels, along with prostate lesions scores, have not been investigated at different time points to further understand prostate carcinogenesis. Method/Principal findings To this end, 8-, 12-, 16-, and 20-week-old male C57BL/6TRAMP x FVB mice prostate most severe and most common lesion scores, 5α-reductase 1 and 5α-reductase 2 in situ hybridization expression, and Ki-67, androgen receptor, and apoptosis immunohistochemistry levels were measured. Levels of these markers were quantified in prostate epithelium, hyperplasia, and tumors sections. Mice developed low- to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia at 8 weeks as the most severe and most common lesions, and moderate- and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia at 12 and 16 weeks as the most severe lesion in all lobes. Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was observed at 20 weeks in all lobes. Poorly differentiated carcinoma was not observed in any lobe until 12-weeks-old. 5α-reductase 1 and 5α-reductase 2 were not significantly decreased in tumors compared to prostate epithelium and hyperplasia in all groups, while proliferation, apoptosis, and androgen receptor were either notably or significantly decreased in tumors compared with prostate epithelium and hyperplasia in most or all groups. Prostate 5αR1 levels were positively correlated with adjusted prostate most severe lesion scores. Conclusion Downregulation of androgen receptor and 5α-reductase 2, along with upregulation of 5α-reductase 1 in tumors may promote prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer development in TRAMP mice."
https://openalex.org/W2614095241,"Previous studies have found the association between rs10865331 in 2p15 area and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). This study aimed to identify additional functional genetic variants in 2p15 region associated with AS susceptibility.We used next generation sequencing (NGS) in 100 AS cases and 100 healthy controls to screen AS susceptible genetic variants, and validated these variants in 620 cases and 620 controls by using imLDRTM technique for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping.Totally, we identified 12 SNPs that might confer susceptibility to AS. Of those SNPs, three (rs14170, rs2123111 and rs1729674) were nominally associated (P<0.05) with AS, but were no longer statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. After stratified by gender, another two SNPs (rs11428092 and rs10208769 in USP34) were associated with AS in males but not females, though this was not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. In addition, rs1729674, rs14170, rs2123111 and rs10208769 were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and were further enrolled in haplotype analysis. A novel haplotype TAGA was found to be associated with a decreased risk of AS (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 0.832 (0.705-0.982)). Beyond that, we also demonstrated a strong relationship between rs10865331 and AS susceptibility (OR (95% CI) = 1.303(1.111-1.526)).rs14170 and rs2123111 inUSP34 and rs1729674 in C2orf74 may be associated with AS susceptibility in Han Chinese population. USP34 and C2orf74 in 2p15 region may be AS novel susceptibility genes."
https://openalex.org/W2613715501,"The whooping cough agent Bordetella pertussis controls the expression of its large virulence regulon in a coordinated manner through the two-component signal transduction system BvgAS. In addition to the genes coding for bona fide virulence factors, the Bvg regulon comprises genes of unknown function. In this work, we characterized a new Bvg-activated gene called BP2936. Homologs of BP2936 are found in other pathogenic Bordetellae and in several other species, including plant pathogens and environmental bacteria. We showed that the gene product of BP2936 is a membrane-associated methyl-transferase of free fatty acids. We thus propose to name it FmtB, for fatty acid methyl-transferase of Bordetella. The role of this protein was tested in cellular and animal models of infection, but the loss of BP2936 did not appear to affect host-pathogen interactions in those assays. The high level of conservation of BP2936 among B. pertussis isolates nevertheless argues that it probably plays a role in the life cycle of this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2613827585,"With the increasing availability of high-throughput data, various computational methods have recently been developed for understanding the cell through protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks at a systems level. However, due to the incompleteness of the original PPI networks those efforts have been significantly hindered. In this paper, we propose a two stage method to predict underlying links between two originally unlinked protein pairs. First, we measure gene expression and gene functional similarly between unlinked protein pairs on Saccharomyces cerevisiae benchmark network and obtain new constructed networks. Then, we select the significant part of the new predicted links by analyzing the difference between essential proteins that have been identified based on the new constructed networks and the original network. Furthermore, we validate the performance of the new method by using the reliable and comprehensive PPI dataset obtained from the STRING database and compare the new proposed method with four other random walk-based methods. Comparing the results indicates that the new proposed strategy performs well in predicting underlying links. This study provides a general paradigm for predicting new interactions between protein pairs and offers new insights into identifying essential proteins."
