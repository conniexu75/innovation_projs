https://openalex.org/W2066245164,"Univalent fragments of γ-globulin preparations from four individual rabbits were fractionated and the amino acid compositions of end fractions were compared. For amino acids with uncharged side chains, differences were consistently less than one residue per fragment of molecular weight 50,000. There were differences in the content of amino acids, other than glutamic acid, with charged side chains; these were in the direction expected on the basis of relative strength of adherence to carboxymethyl cellulose and electrophoretic mobility. Exclusive of any possible differences in amide, the total difference in charged groups was three to four residues per fragment. Since the net charge of univalent fragments reflects that of the γ-globulin molecule from which the fragments are derived, corresponding differences in composition may also exist among whole γ-globulin molecules."

The resultant organization, which involves relationships between diversity, power and efficiency, and stability, is nearly optimal for maximizing profit on the original energy investment."
https://openalex.org/W2093599411,"The recent geologic history of small streams in east-central Sicily and southern Etruria has been dated archeologically. In Sicily a period of deposition began post 8th century B.C. and had ended by 325 B.C. After a period of erosion, another, less extensive, alluviation took place, probably in medieval time. North of Rome in southern Etruria an alluviation that began no earlier than the late Roman empire probably continued into medieval time."
https://openalex.org/W4248265775,"The incomplete hydrolysis of XeF(6) has been used to prepare a xenon oxyfluoride, XeOF(4). The latter is a clear, colorless liquid, freezing at -41 degrees C. The infrared and Raman spectra show that the XeOF(4) molecule has a fourfold symmetry axis. The large Xe-O stretching force constant indicates the Xe-O bond has appreciable double bond character."
https://openalex.org/W2018452114,"Experiments with C(14)-labeled bicarbonate demonstrate that organic products of photosynthesis are transported through the stipe tissue of Macrocystis. Depending upon conditions, not all of which have been fully ascertained, the direction of transport may be either predominantly apical or toward the base of the plant."

https://openalex.org/W2022540145,"(1) Spirocyclohexane-1,1-indanone (VI) has been found among the oxidation products of the hydrocarbon mixture which results when 1-beta-phenylethylcyclohexanol-1 is dehydrated, or when 1-beta-phenylethylcyclohexene is cyclized by aluminum trichloride, and its constitution has been proved by synthesis (2) Its oxime melts at 137-137.8 degrees (corr.). The oxime of m.p. 187.5 degrees , reported by Cook et al. therefore must be derived from some other ketone, perhaps the trans-ketoöctahydrophenanthrene, since we were unable to isolate any oxime of m.p. 177 degrees , the figure which they reported for this compound."
