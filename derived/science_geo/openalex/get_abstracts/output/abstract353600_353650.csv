https://openalex.org/W2016323760,"Background Alterations in gene expression in the suicide brain have been reported and for several genes DNA methylation as an epigenetic regulator is thought to play a role. rRNA genes, that encode ribosomal RNA, are the backbone of the protein synthesis machinery and levels of rRNA gene promoter methylation determine rRNA transcription. Methodology/Principal Findings We test here by sodium bisulfite mapping of the rRNA promoter and quantitative real-time PCR of rRNA expression the hypothesis that epigenetic differences in critical loci in the brain are involved in the pathophysiology of suicide. Suicide subjects in this study were selected for a history of early childhood neglect/abuse, which is associated with decreased hippocampal volume and cognitive impairments. rRNA was significantly hypermethylated throughout the promoter and 5′ regulatory region in the brain of suicide subjects, consistent with reduced rRNA expression in the hippocampus. This difference in rRNA methylation was not evident in the cerebellum and occurred in the absence of genome-wide changes in methylation, as assessed by nearest neighbor. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to show aberrant regulation of the protein synthesis machinery in the suicide brain. The data implicate the epigenetic modulation of rRNA in the pathophysiology of suicide."
https://openalex.org/W1995735206,"Animals are evolutionarily related to fungi and to the predominantly unicellular protozoan phylum Choanozoa, together known as opisthokonts. To establish the sequence of events when animals evolved from unicellular ancestors, and understand those key evolutionary transitions, we need to establish which choanozoans are most closely related to animals and also the evolutionary position of each choanozoan group within the opisthokont phylogenetic tree. Here we focus on Ministeria vibrans, a minute bacteria-eating cell with slender radiating tentacles. Single-gene trees suggested that it is either the closest unicellular relative of animals or else sister to choanoflagellates, traditionally considered likely animal ancestors. Sequencing thousands of Ministeria protein genes now reveals about 14 with domains of key significance for animal cell biology, including several previously unknown from deeply diverging Choanozoa, e.g. domains involved in hedgehog, Notch and tyrosine kinase signaling or cell adhesion (cadherin). Phylogenetic trees using 78 proteins show that Ministeria is not sister to animals or choanoflagellates (themselves sisters to animals), but to Capsaspora, another protozoan with thread-like (filose) tentacles. The Ministeria/Capsaspora clade (new class Filasterea) is sister to animals and choanoflagellates, these three groups forming a novel clade (filozoa) whose ancestor presumably evolved filose tentacles well before they aggregated as a periciliary collar in the choanoflagellate/sponge common ancestor. Our trees show ichthyosporean choanozoans as sisters to filozoa; a fusion between ubiquitin and ribosomal small subunit S30 protein genes unifies all holozoa (filozoa plus Ichthyosporea), being absent in earlier branching eukaryotes. Thus, several successive evolutionary innovations occurred among their unicellular closest relatives prior to the origin of the multicellular body-plan of animals."
https://openalex.org/W2000712684,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA stability and translation through the action of the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). Our current understanding of miRNA function is inferred largely from studies of the effects of miRNAs on steady-state mRNA levels and from seed match conservation and context in putative targets. Here we have taken a more direct approach to these issues by comprehensively assessing the miRNAs and mRNAs that are physically associated with Argonaute 2 (Ago2), which is a core RISC component. We transfected HEK293T cells with epitope-tagged Ago2, immunopurified Ago2 together with any associated miRNAs and mRNAs, and quantitatively determined the levels of these RNAs by microarray analyses. We found that Ago2 immunopurified samples contained a representative repertoire of the cell's miRNAs and a select subset of the cell's total mRNAs. Transfection of the miRNAs miR-1 and miR-124 caused significant changes in the association of scores of mRNAs with Ago2. The mRNAs whose association with Ago2 increased upon miRNA expression were much more likely to contain specific miRNA seed matches and to have their overall mRNA levels decrease in response to the miRNA transfection than expected by chance. Hundreds of mRNAs were recruited to Ago2 by each miRNA via seed sequences in 3'-untranslated regions and coding sequences and a few mRNAs appear to be targeted via seed sequences in 5'-untranslated regions. Microarray analysis of Ago2 immunopurified samples provides a simple, direct method for experimentally identifying the targets of miRNAs and for elucidating roles of miRNAs in cellular regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2005194803,"Many animals both display and assess multiple signals. Two prominently studied traits are symmetry and sexual dimorphism, which, for many animals, are proposed cues to heritable fitness benefits. These traits are associated with other potential benefits, such as fertility. In humans, the face has been extensively studied in terms of attractiveness. Faces have the potential to be advertisements of mate quality and both symmetry and sexual dimorphism have been linked to the attractiveness of human face shape.Here we show that measurements of symmetry and sexual dimorphism from faces are related in humans, both in Europeans and African hunter-gatherers, and in a non-human primate. Using human judges, symmetry measurements were also related to perceived sexual dimorphism. In all samples, symmetric males had more masculine facial proportions and symmetric females had more feminine facial proportions.Our findings support the claim that sexual dimorphism and symmetry in faces are signals advertising quality by providing evidence that there must be a biological mechanism linking the two traits during development. Such data also suggests that the signalling properties of faces are universal across human populations and are potentially phylogenetically old in primates."
https://openalex.org/W2067737685,"Background Intravascular hemolysis in sickle cell anemia could contribute to complications associated with nitric oxide deficiency, advancing age, and increased mortality. We have previously reported that intense hemolysis is associated with increased risk of vascular complications in a small cohort of adults with sickle cell disease. These observations have not been validated in other populations. Methods The distribution of serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) values was used as a surrogate measure of intravascular hemolysis in a contemporaneous patient group and an historical adult population from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), all with sickle cell anemia. Chronic hyper-hemolysis was defined by the top LDH quartile and was compared to the lowest LDH quartile. Results Hyper-hemolysis subjects had higher systolic blood pressure, higher prevalence of leg ulcers (OR 3.27, 95% CI 1.92-5.53, P<0.0001), priapism (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.13-6.90, P = 0.03) and pulmonary hypertension (OR 4.32, 95% CI 2.12-8.60, P<0.0001), while osteonecrosis (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19-0.54, P<0.0001) and pain (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.55, P = 0.0004) were less prevalent. Hyper-hemolysis was influenced by fetal hemoglobin and α thalassemia, and was a risk factor for early death in the CSSCD population (Hazard Ratio = 1.97, P = 0.02). Conclusions Steady state LDH measurements can identify a chronic hyper-hemolysis phenotype which includes less frequent vasooclusive pain and earlier mortality. Clinicians should consider sickle cell specific therapies for these patients, as is done for those with more frequent acute pain. The findings also suggest that an important class of disease modifiers in sickle cell anemia affect the rate of hemolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2127738936,"Background Recently, several Genome Wide Association (GWA) studies in populations of European descent have identified and validated novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), highly associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Our aims were to validate these markers in other European and non-European populations, then to assess their combined effect in a large French study comparing T2D and normal glucose tolerant (NGT) individuals. Methodology/Principal Findings In the same French population analyzed in our previous GWA study (3,295 T2D and 3,595 NGT), strong associations with T2D were found for CDKAL1 (ORrs7756992 = 1.30[1.19–1.42], P = 2.3×10−9), CDKN2A/2B (ORrs10811661 = 0.74[0.66–0.82], P = 3.5×10−8) and more modestly for IGFBP2 (ORrs1470579 = 1.17[1.07–1.27], P = 0.0003) SNPs. These results were replicated in both Israeli Ashkenazi (577 T2D and 552 NGT) and Austrian (504 T2D and 753 NGT) populations (except for CDKAL1) but not in the Moroccan population (521 T2D and 423 NGT). In the overall group of French subjects (4,232 T2D and 4,595 NGT), IGFBP2 and CXCR4 synergistically interacted with (LOC38776, SLC30A8, HHEX) and (NGN3, CDKN2A/2B), respectively, encoding for proteins presumably regulating pancreatic endocrine cell development and function. The T2D risk increased strongly when risk alleles, including the previously discovered T2D-associated TCF7L2 rs7903146 SNP, were combined (8.68-fold for the 14% of French individuals carrying 18 to 30 risk alleles with an allelic OR of 1.24). With an area under the ROC curve of 0.86, only 15 novel loci were necessary to discriminate French individuals susceptible to develop T2D. Conclusions/Significance In addition to TCF7L2, SLC30A8 and HHEX, initially identified by the French GWA scan, CDKAL1, IGFBP2 and CDKN2A/2B strongly associate with T2D in French individuals, and mostly in populations of Central European descent but not in Moroccan subjects. Genes expressed in the pancreas interact together and their combined effect dramatically increases the risk for T2D, opening avenues for the development of genetic prediction tests."
https://openalex.org/W3122758023,"A range of antimalarial drugs were procured from private pharmacies in urban and peri-urban areas in the major cities of six African countries, situated in the part of that continent and the world that is most highly endemic for malaria. Semi-quantitative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and dissolution testing were used to measure active pharmaceutical ingredient content against internationally acceptable standards. 35% of all samples tested failed either or both tests, and were substandard. Further, 33% of treatments collected were artemisinin monotherapies, most of which (78%) were manufactured in disobservance of an appeal by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to withdraw these clinically inappropriate medicines from the market. The high persistence of substandard drugs and clinically inappropriate artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector risks patient safety and, through drug resistance, places the future of malaria treatment at risk globally."
https://openalex.org/W2169421594,"Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans strain 2CP-C is a versaphilic delta-Proteobacterium distributed throughout many diverse soil and sediment environments. 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis groups A. dehalogenans together with the myxobacteria, which have distinguishing characteristics including strictly aerobic metabolism, sporulation, fruiting body formation, and surface motility. Analysis of the 5.01 Mb strain 2CP-C genome substantiated that this organism is a myxobacterium but shares genotypic traits with the anaerobic majority of the delta-Proteobacteria (i.e., the Desulfuromonadales). Reflective of its respiratory versatility, strain 2CP-C possesses 68 genes coding for putative c-type cytochromes, including one gene with 40 heme binding motifs. Consistent with its relatedness to the myxobacteria, surface motility was observed in strain 2CP-C and multiple types of motility genes are present, including 28 genes for gliding, adventurous (A-) motility and 17 genes for type IV pilus-based motility (i.e., social (S-) motility) that all have homologs in Myxococcus xanthus. Although A. dehalogenans shares many metabolic traits with the anaerobic majority of the delta-Proteobacteria, strain 2CP-C grows under microaerophilic conditions and possesses detoxification systems for reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, two gene clusters coding for NADH dehydrogenase subunits and two cytochrome oxidase gene clusters in strain 2CP-C are similar to those in M. xanthus. Remarkably, strain 2CP-C possesses a third NADH dehydrogenase gene cluster and a cytochrome cbb3 oxidase gene cluster, apparently acquired through ancient horizontal gene transfer from a strictly anaerobic green sulfur bacterium. The mosaic nature of the A. dehalogenans strain 2CP-C genome suggests that the metabolically versatile, anaerobic members of the delta-Proteobacteria may have descended from aerobic ancestors with complex lifestyles."
https://openalex.org/W2015560964,"Wolbachia are obligate intracellular bacteria which commonly infect arthropods. They are maternally inherited and capable of altering host development, sex determination, and reproduction. Reproductive manipulations include feminization, male-killing, parthenogenesis, and cytoplasmic incompatibility. The mechanism by which Wolbachia avoid destruction by the host immune response is unknown. Generation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the host are among the first lines of traditional antimicrobial defense. Previous work shows no link between a Wolbachia infection and the induction of AMPs. Here we compare the expression of protein in a cell line naturally infected with Wolbachia and an identical cell line cured of the infection through the use of antibiotics. Protein extracts of each cell line were analyzed by two dimensional gel electrophoresis and LC/MS/MS. Our results show the upregulation of host antioxidant proteins, which are active against ROS generated by aerobic cell metabolism and during an immune response. Furthermore, flow cytometric and microscopic analysis demonstrates that ROS production is significantly greater in Wolbachia-infected mosquito cells and is associated with endosymbiont-containing vacuoles located in the host cell cytoplasm. This is the first empirical data supporting an association between Wolbachia and the insect antioxidant system."
https://openalex.org/W2068839583,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels mediate key aspects of taste, smell, pain, temperature sensation, and pheromone detection. To deepen our understanding of TRP channel physiology, we require more diverse pharmacological tools. Citral, a bioactive component of lemongrass, is commonly used as a taste enhancer, as an odorant in perfumes, and as an insect repellent. Here we report that citral activates TRP channels found in sensory neurons (TRPV1 and TRPV3, TRPM8, and TRPA1), and produces long-lasting inhibition of TRPV1-3 and TRPM8, while transiently blocking TRPV4 and TRPA1. Sustained citral inhibition is independent of internal calcium concentration, but is state-dependent, developing only after TRP channel opening. Citral's actions as a partial agonist are not due to cysteine modification of the channels nor are they a consequence of citral's stereoisoforms. The isolated aldehyde and alcohol cis and trans enantiomers (neral, nerol, geranial, and geraniol) each reproduce citral's actions. In juvenile rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, prolonged citral inhibition of native TRPV1 channels enabled the separation of TRPV2 and TRPV3 currents. We find that TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels are present in a high proportion of these neurons (94% respond to 2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate), consistent with our immunolabeling experiments and previous in situ hybridization studies. The TRPV1 activation requires residues in transmembrane segments two through four of the voltage-sensor domain, a region previously implicated in capsaicin activation of TRPV1 and analogous menthol activation of TRPM8. Citral's broad spectrum and prolonged sensory inhibition may prove more useful than capsaicin for allodynia, itch, or other types of pain involving superficial sensory nerves and skin."
https://openalex.org/W1974827046,"Background Mast cells trigger inflammation that is associated with local pain, but the mechanisms mediating pain are unclear. Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a bladder disease that causes debilitating pelvic pain of unknown origin and without consistent inflammation, but IC symptoms correlate with elevated bladder lamina propria mast cell counts. We hypothesized that mast cells mediate pelvic pain directly and examined pain behavior using a murine model that recapitulates key aspects of IC. Methods and Findings Infection of mice with pseudorabies virus (PRV) induces a neurogenic cystitis associated with lamina propria mast cell accumulation dependent upon tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), TNF-mediated bladder barrier dysfunction, and pelvic pain behavior, but the molecular basis for pelvic pain is unknown. In this study, both PRV-induced pelvic pain and bladder pathophysiology were abrogated in mast cell-deficient mice but were restored by reconstitution with wild type bone marrow. Pelvic pain developed normally in TNF- and TNF receptor-deficient mice, while bladder pathophysiology was abrogated. Conversely, genetic or pharmacologic disruption of histamine receptor H1R or H2R attenuated pelvic pain without altering pathophysiology. Conclusions These data demonstrate that mast cells promote cystitis pain and bladder pathophysiology through the separable actions of histamine and TNF, respectively. Therefore, pain is independent of pathology and inflammation, and histamine receptors represent direct therapeutic targets for pain in IC and other chronic pain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1976102972,"The objective of this study was to determine if MTND2*LHON4917G (4917G), a specific non-synonymous polymorphism in the mitochondrial genome previously associated with neurodegenerative phenotypes, is associated with increased risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A preliminary study of 393 individuals (293 cases and 100 controls) ascertained at Vanderbilt revealed an increased occurrence of 4917G in cases compared to controls (15.4% vs.9.0%, p = 0.11). Since there was a significant age difference between cases and controls in this initial analysis, we extended the study by selecting Caucasian pairs matched at the exact age at examination. From the 1547 individuals in the Vanderbilt/Duke AMD population association study (including 157 in the preliminary study), we were able to match 560 (280 cases and 280 unaffected) on exact age at examination. This study population was genotyped for 4917G plus specific AMD-associated nuclear genome polymorphisms in CFH, LOC387715 and ApoE. Following adjustment for the listed nuclear genome polymorphisms, 4917G independently predicts the presence of AMD (OR = 2.16, 95%CI 1.20–3.91, p = 0.01). In conclusion, a specific mitochondrial polymorphism previously implicated in other neurodegenerative phenotypes (4917G) appears to convey risk for AMD independent of recently discovered nuclear DNA polymorphisms."
https://openalex.org/W2068633735,"The precise temporal control of neuronal action potentials is essential for regulating many brain functions. From the viewpoint of a neuron, the specific timings of afferent input from the action potentials of its synaptic partners determines whether or not and when that neuron will fire its own action potential. Tuning such input would provide a powerful mechanism to adjust neuron function and in turn, that of the brain. However, axonal plasticity of action potential timing is counter to conventional notions of stable propagation and to the dominant theories of activity-dependent plasticity focusing on synaptic efficacies.Here we show the occurrence of activity-dependent plasticity of action potential propagation delays (up to 4 ms or 40% after minutes and 13 ms or 74% after hours) and amplitudes (up to 87%). We used a multi-electrode array to induce, detect, and track changes in propagation in multiple neurons while they adapted to different patterned stimuli in controlled neocortical networks in vitro. The changes did not occur when the same stimulation was repeated while blocking ionotropic gabaergic and glutamatergic receptors. Even though induction of changes in action potential timing and amplitude depended on synaptic transmission, the expression of these changes persisted in the presence of the synaptic receptor blockers.We conclude that, along with changes in synaptic efficacy, propagation plasticity provides a cellular mechanism to tune neuronal network function in vitro and potentially learning and memory in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1988152221,"Background AMPK is a promising pharmacological target in relation to metabolic disorders partly due to its non-insulin dependent glucose uptake promoting role in skeletal muscle. Of the 2 catalytic α-AMPK isoforms, α2 AMPK is clearly required for stimulation of glucose transport into muscle by certain stimuli. In contrast, no clear function has yet been determined for α1 AMPK in skeletal muscle, possibly due to α-AMPK isoform signaling redundancy. By applying low-intensity twitch-contraction and H2O2 stimulation to activate α1 AMPK, but not α2 AMPK, in wildtype and α-AMPK transgenic mouse muscles, this study aimed to define conditions where α1 AMPK is required to increase muscle glucose uptake. Methodology/Principal Findings Following stimulation with H2O2 (3 mM, 20 min) or twitch-contraction (0.1 ms pulse, 2 Hz, 2 min), signaling and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were measured in incubated soleus muscles from wildtype and muscle-specific kinase-dead AMPK (KD), α1 AMPK knockout or α2 AMPK knockout mice. H2O2 increased the activity of both α1 and α2 AMPK in addition to Akt phosphorylation, and H2O2-stimulated glucose uptake was not reduced in any of the AMPK transgenic mouse models compared with wild type. In contrast, twitch-contraction increased the activity of α1 AMPK, but not α2 AMPK activity nor Akt or AS160 phosphorylation. Glucose uptake was markedly lower in α1 AMPK knockout and KD AMPK muscles, but not in α2 AMPK knockout muscles, following twitch stimulation. Conclusions/Significance These results provide strong genetic evidence that α1 AMPK, but not α2 AMPK, Akt or AS160, is necessary for regulation of twitch-contraction stimulated glucose uptake. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show a major and essential role of α1 AMPK in regulating a physiological endpoint in skeletal muscle. In contrast, AMPK is not essential for H2O2-stimulated muscle glucose uptake, as proposed by recent studies."
https://openalex.org/W1983054508,"The molecular mechanisms underlying migraine pain remain unclear and probably require sustained facilitation in pain-sensing P2X3 receptors gated by extracellular ATP in nociceptive sensory neurons. The major migraine mediator calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP) is known to sensitize P2X3 receptors to increase impulse flow to brainstem trigeminal nuclei. This process is mediated via changes in the expression and function of P2X3 receptors initially through enhanced trafficking and, later, perhaps through augmented synthesis of P2X3 receptors. To clarify the mechanisms responsible for CGRP-evoked long lasting alterations in P2X3 receptors, we used as a model mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons in culture. CGRP activated Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II, which became localized to the perimembrane region and neuronal processes, a phenomenon already apparent after 30 min and accompanied by a parallel increase in cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. These effects triggered increased P2X3 receptor transcription and were prevented by expressing a dominant negative form of CREB. Increased P2X3 receptor synthesis was partly mediated by endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) because of its block by anti-BDNF antibodies and mimicry by exogenous BDNF. Immunocytochemistry experiments indicated distinct subpopulations of BDNF- or CGRP-sensitive trigeminal neurons with only partial overlap. The present data indicate a novel mechanism for enhancing P2X3 receptor expression and function in trigeminal sensory neurons by CGRP via CREB phosphorylation. BDNF was an intermediate to extend the sensitizing effect of CGRP also to CGRP-insensitive neurons. This combinatorial action could serve as a powerful process to amplify and prolong pain mediated by P2X3 receptors.

Sensitization of sensory neurons represents the key phenomenon for generating chronic pain that remains relatively refractory to standard treatment (1Woolf C.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 2004; 140: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Current theories predict that chronic pain is brought about by a gain in the expression and function of sensory nociceptors that enhance their signal flow to the brain to ensure the long lasting nature of this process (2Zimmermann M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 429: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Clarification of the novel gene expression profiles associated to pain should, therefore, be useful to target emerging molecules (and mechanisms) and for designing new analgesics.

CGRP-mediated signals are transduced at the cell membrane by activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor complex (composed by calcitonin receptor-like receptor, RAMP1 (receptor activity-modifying protein-1), and receptor component protein) that activates cAMP-dependent and Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways (10Zhang Z.

On such sensory neurons, CGRP persistently and selectively up-regulates the membrane expression and activity of P2X3 receptors (7Fabbretti E. D'Arco M. Fabbro A. Simonetti M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that are gated by extracellular ATP to transmit nociceptive stimuli to brainstem trigeminal nuclei (12Cockayne D.A.

This effect leads to long term sensitization of P2X3 receptor function through increased receptor trafficking and neosynthesis (7Fabbretti E. D'Arco M. Fabbro A. Simonetti M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is, however, unclear what intracellular mechanisms regulate the delivery and new supply of receptors to the plasma membrane and their time course. This is an important issue for the use of CGRP antagonists to treat migraine pain (14Goadsby P.J. Drugs. 2005; 65: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), because the administration time of these agents should take into account the dynamics of the intracellular events triggered by the peptide and their dependence on CGRP receptor activation. Additionally, it is clear that effective anti-migraine treatment should be initiated at the beginning of an attack (14Goadsby P.J. Drugs. 2005; 65: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting the need to clarify the earliest changes in nociceptive mechanisms. Because CGRP can elicit kinase-dependent gene transcription in a variety of cell systems (4Arulmani U. Maassenvandenbrink A. Villalón C.M. Saxena P.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), if a similar process occurs with P2X3 receptors in trigeminal neurons, it might contribute to persistent pain. The present study sought to identify the early molecular mechanisms linking CGRP receptor activation to P2X3 gene transcription in cultured trigeminal neurons; the present data suggest that CGRP activated calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) at least in part via release of the neurotrophin BDNF. Animals and Cell Cultures—Primary cultures of C57Black/c mouse trigeminal ganglion (TG) sensory neurons were prepared and maintained in culture as previously described (16Simonetti M. Fabbro A.

The following substances (all from Sigma) were added to the culture medium as required: CGRP (1 μm), CGRP-(8–37) (2 μm), KN-93 (3 μm), its inactive analog KN-92 (5 μm), AIP (autocamtide 2-related inhibitor peptide myristoylated) (1 μm), chelerythrine chloride (5 μm), H-89 (1 μm), forskolin (10 μm), mouse anti-BDNF neutralizing antibody (1 μg/ml), and BDNF (10 ng/ml) (20Ulmann L. Rodeau J.L. Danoux L. Contet-Audonneau J.L. Pauly G. Schlichter R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2007; 26: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ability by the anti-BDNF antibody to block the action of BDNF was validated with Western blot experiments, in which BDNF-mediated CREB phosphorylation was fully prevented by anti-BDNF antibodies (supplemental Fig. 2). Furthermore, the same antibody blocked the increased P2X3 mRNA evoked by BDNF in real time RT-PCR experiments (run in duplicate). The CGRP peptide antagonist or kinase inhibitors were preapplied for 30 min and then co-applied with CGRP for the indicated time. Experimental protocols involving animals were approved by the local ethical committee and local authority veterinary service and run in accordance with the Italian Animal Welfare Act. For in vivo experiments, C57Black/c mice (6 animals, post-natal day 20) were subcutaneously injected (30 μl) in the neck with 1 μm CGRP. Five h later, animals were sacrificed, and their TG was explanted. This protocol was based on the reported clearance of CGRP calculated as 63.9 ± 4.5 min (21Rubinstein C. Fletcher D.R. Shulkes A. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1993; 20: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total mRNA extraction from TG cultures or ganglia and reverse transcription reactions was performed as previously reported (22D'Arco M. Giniatullin R. Simonetti M.

Fabbro A. D'Arco M. Zweyer M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. Fabbretti E. Mol. Pain. 2006; 28: 2-11Google Scholar). The following polyclonal antibodies were used: anti-P2X3 (1:300; Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel), β-tubulin III (1:3000; Sigma), anti-α CaMKII (1:500; Invitrogen), anti-phosphorylated Ser133 CREB (1:1000; Upstate and Millipore), anti-phospho-Thr286 CaMKII (1:1000; Promega (Madison, WI) and Upstate), and anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; made in house). Western signals were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Western blot signals were quantified measuring band density using Cyon Image and CorelDraw Photopaint software (Corel, Ottawa, Canada). Values of phosphorylated CaMKII or CREB signals were normalized versus the level of total CaMKII or β-tubulin III, used as loading control. BDNF Release Assays—A dot blot immunoassay was used to detect the BDNF release in the medium of TG culture in control condition or after treatment with CGRP (1 μm, 30 min). Briefly, 50 μl of culture medium were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated overnight with anti-BDNF antibody (1:250; Sigma). Signals were detected with anti-mouse horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000; Sigma) and ECL. A quantitative measure of BDNF concentration in the bulk medium was obtained with the Emax BDNF immunoassay system (Promega). TG culture medium was collected 30 min after CGRP application and immediately processed for the ELISA assay. Results were corrected for blank and normalized with respect to the genomic DNA content. The nonpeptide CGRP receptor antagonist BIBN4096BS (100 ng/ml; gift from Roche Applied Science) was also used for certain experiments. Immunofluorescence Experiments—Immunofluorescence experiments (16Simonetti M. Fabbro A. D'Arco M. Zweyer M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. Fabbretti E. Mol. Pain. 2006; 28: 2-11Google Scholar) were performed with the following primary antibodies: anti-P2X3 (1:200; Alomone), anti-phosphorylated Thr286 CaMKII (α type; 1:500; Promega), anti-phosphorylated Ser133 CREB (1:300; Upstate), β-tubulin III (1:1000, Sigma), anti-TrkB (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and the secondary antibody AlexaFluor488 or Alexa-Fluor594 (1:500; Invitrogen). To visualize neurons sensitive to CGRP, CGRP binding experiments were performed on live cells with rhodamine-conjugated CGRP (1 h at 4 °C; Phoenix-peptide, Belmont, CA) (23Cottrell G.S. Roosterman D. Marvizon J.C. Song B. Wick E. Pikios S. Wong H. Berthelier C. Tang Y. Sternini C. Bunnett N.W. Grady E.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 490: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), as previously described (7Fabbretti E. D'Arco M. Fabbro A. Simonetti M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-conjugated-CGRP-labeled neurons were then processed for immunofluorescence using the anti-TrkB receptor antibody. Control CaMKII immunofluorescence experiments performed on CGRP-treated neurons treated with CaMK inhibitors or incubated for 1 h in Ca2+-free medium (24Cohen J.E. Fields R.D. Cell Calcium. 2006; 39: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) produced no signal (supplemental Fig. 1, A and C). For each experiment, an average of 500 cells were analyzed; data are the mean of at least three independent experiments. Results were quantified with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices Corp., Downingtown, PA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, cultures obtained from six pairs of TGs were used for each condition in each experiment. Initial quantification of total genomic extracts was done with real time amplification analysis of genomic GAPDH content. ChIP experiments were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, TG neurons, cross-linked with paraformaldehyde (1% in physiologic solution, 10 min, 37 °C), were sonicated (three pulses of 30 s each) to generate small genomic DNA fragments (<500 bp in length). Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked chromatin/protein extracts was performed using anti-phosphorylated Ser133 CREB antibody (active form, 5 μg; Upstate) overnight at 4 °C. The immunopurified genomic DNA fragments were amplified with real time PCR using specific primers (Table 1) spanning the Ca2+/cAMP-response element (CRE) region of the p2rx3 promoter (ENSMUSG00000027071) (25Souslova V. Ravenall S. Fox M. Wells D. Wood J.N. Akopian A.N. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 195: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As a positive control, cells treated with forskolin (10 μm, 10 min) and immunopurified with anti-phospho-CREB antibody showed an significant binding to the NK1 tachykinin-1 receptor promoter region (n = 3; tacr1; ENSMUSG00000030043) detected with real time PCR and using specific primers (9Seybold V.S. McCarson K.E. Mermelstein P.G. Groth R.D. Abrahams L.G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1816-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No PCR signal was obtained when genomic fragments where immunoprecipitated with unrelated anti-Egr1 antibody (n = 2; anti-Zif268; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). As ChIP negative controls, we amplified anti-CREB immunopurified fragments with additional primers (Table 1) spanning two different regions of the p2rx3 promoter that lack the putative CRE sequence. Note that genomic region 1 contains a specific Erg-1 consensus sequence that was used as internal control. End point PCR amplicons were analyzed on agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. Genomic analysis of p2rx3 gene promoter regions was performed using the TFSEARCH data base (available on the World Wide Web) or the CREB Target Gene Data base (available on the World Wide Web). Patch Clamp Recording—TG neurons were continuously superfused with physiological solution as previously reported (7Fabbretti E. D'Arco M. Fabbro A. Simonetti M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were voltage-clamped (whole cell configuration) at -60 mV (70% series resistance compensation). The highly selective P2X3 receptor agonist α,β-methylene ATP (10 μm, 2 s) was applied with a fast superfusion system (Rapid Solution Changer RSC-200; BioLogic Science Instruments). Inward current responses were measured in terms of peak amplitude. Electrophysiological data were always compared with responses from control sister dishes maintained in vitro for an equivalent time. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of the mean (n = number of experiments). The statistical significance was assessed with the Mann-Whitney rank sum test and the Wilcoxon test for nonparametric data and with Student's t test for parametric data (KyPlot, version 2.0; Qualest Co.). A p value of <0.05 was accepted as indicative of a statistically significant difference. Active CaMKII Is Necessary to Up-regulate P2X3 mRNA Expression Induced by CGRP—Although previous experiments have indicated the time course of the CGRP-mediated increase in P2X3 receptor expression and function (7Fabbretti E. D'Arco M. Fabbro A. Simonetti M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the identification of the early biochemical mechanisms involved in this effect has remained elusive and is a necessary step to formulate novel approaches to modulate trigeminal pain sensation. For this purpose, the present study sought to identify the transduction processes linking CGRP receptor activation to P2X3 gene transcription in cultured trigeminal neurons. We started by examining what kinase activity might mediate the action of CGRP. Because the action of CGRP is often mediated by kinase activity (4Arulmani U. Maassenvandenbrink A. Villalón C.M. Saxena P.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we performed real time reverse transcription-PCR experiments on extracts from cultured TG neurons treated with CGRP (1 μm, 1 h) alone or co-applied together with kinases inhibitors to explore the signaling elements involved in CGRP-evoked P2X3 receptor up-regulation. The PKA blocker H-89 (1 μm) or the PKC blocker chelerythrine (5 μm) partially prevented the potentiating effect of CGRP on P2X3 mRNA transcription (n = 4, p = 0.03; Fig. 1A). Stronger inhibition of the action of CGRP could not be observed even when both blockers were co-applied (Fig. 1A). The specific inhibitor for CaMKII, AIP (1 μm, 1 h), or the CaMKII/IV inhibitor KN-93 (3 μm, 1 h) fully prevented CGRP-induced P2X3 mRNA up-regulation (n = 3; #, p = 0.02; Fig. 1A). Conversely, application of KN-92 (5 μm, 1 h), an inactive congener of KN-93, was ineffective (n = 3, p > 0.05; Fig. 1A). Globally, the present results suggest a major role of CaMKII in CGRP-dependent P2X3 mRNA neosynthesis. This notion was confirmed with immunocytochemical experiments using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes only the active form of CaMKII (anti-phospho-Thr286 CaMKII antibody; see also supplemental Fig. 1). The example of Fig. 1B shows that, on a TG neuron, treatment with CGRP (1 μm, 1 h) not only led to stronger phosphorylated CaMKII kinase immunoreactivity but also to a different topographical distribution of this enzyme that acquired a mainly perimembrane location (Fig. 1B, middle). This effect was fully prevented by KN-93 (3 μm, 1 h; Fig. 1B, right) or AIP (1 μm, 1 h; not shown). Furthermore, although in control conditions the phosphorylated form of CaMKII was present in about 50% neurons (i.e. β-tubulin III-immunoreactive cells; n = 5 experiments; Fig. 1C) predominantly of small/medium somatic size (<25 μm), after CGRP treatment, their number rose to more than two-thirds (Fig. 1C). A significant increase in co-localization of P2X3 and phosphorylated CaMKII immunoreactivity was also found (n = 5 experiments; Fig. 1D); this result shows that not only the distribution of the phosphorylated form of CaMKII (and number of neurons positive to it) was changed but that it was more often co-localized with the ATP-gated P2X3 receptors. This observation is interesting, because, despite the limited number (35%) of trigeminal neurons responsive to CGRP in vitro (7Fabbretti E. D'Arco M. Fabbro A. Simonetti M. Nistri A. Giniatullin R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6163-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), it outlines a potential mechanism for obtaining stronger nociception. Furthermore, the cell expression of the phosphorylated form of CaMKII was also enhanced (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Time course of CaMKII activation in TG neurons. A, example of immunofluorescence microphotographs of cultured TG neurons stained with anti-CaMKII antibody (recognizing the activated form only) at different time points from CGRP application (1 μm). Pseudocolors quantify the different levels of phosphorylated CaMKII in TG neurons under different conditions. Note that the localization of active CaMKII to the perimembrane region is completely prevented by co-application with KN-93. B, the histograms show the quantification of activated CaMKII signal that increases significantly after 30 min (n = 3; *, p = 0.03), and it is prevented by KN-93. C, Western immunoblot experiments of total TG culture with anti-active CaMKII antibody (52 kDa; top) after various times of exposure to CGRP. Total levels of CaMKII (52 kDa; α subunit) and neuronal β-tubulin III (55 kDa) gel loading quantification is also shown. The histograms quantify anti-CaMKII antibody signals (bottom), showing a significant increase after 30 and 60 min from CGRP application (lanes 4 and 5; n = 3; *, p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively), prevented by co-application of KN-93 (1 h, 3 μm; lane 6, n = 3; p > 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In vivo experiments are necessary to validate data obtained with cell cultures; we, therefore, tested if CGRP could promote P2X3 mRNA transcription also in mouse trigeminal ganglia in situ. To this aim, after injecting mice with saline or CGRP (subcutaneously into the neck, 1 μm, 10 μl), TG ganglia were explanted 5 h later and processed for real time PCR analysis or immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2). In vivo CGRP administration induced a significant up-regulation of P2X3 mRNA neosynthesis in TG ganglia (n = 3, p = 0.04; Fig. 2A) and increased immunoreactivity for active CaMKII (n = 3, Fig. 2B). Globally, these data indicated that CGRP induced phosphorylation and redistribution of CaMKII necessary for P2X3 gene transcription in in vivo as well as in culture conditions. Time Course of CGRP-dependent Activation of CaMKII—Short application of CGRP (1 μm; <30 min) was not sufficient to induce a significant up-regulation of P2X3 mRNA transcription (1.3 ± 0.1-fold increase, n = 3, p > 0.05; Fig. 1A) by TG neurons in culture. To better resolve the time scale of CaMKII activation in the presence of CGRP, TG neurons were incubated with CGRP (1 μm) for 5, 15, 30, or 60 min and then processed for immunofluorescence or Western immunoblotting. Quantitative immunoreactivity analysis demonstrated that active CaMKII showed a stronger signal (see red and white pseudocolors in Fig. 3A) already after 15 min from CGRP application (Fig. 3, A and B), becoming significantly larger after 30 min (n = 3, p = 0.03), and fully prevented by KN-93 (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, phosphorylated CaMKII immunoreactivity displayed predominant perimembrane localization and distribution throughout the neuronal processes (Fig. 3A, 60 min). Western immunoblot experiments performed with total protein extracts of trigeminal ganglion cultures at different times from CGRP application confirmed the time-dependent increase of the band corresponding to active CaMKII (52 kDa; Fig. 3C, top). Even with total cell lysates, the phospho-CaMKII expression was significantly up-regulated already after 30 min of CGRP application (n = 3, p = 0.02; lane 4) and was maintained up to 1 h later (n = 3, p = 0.04; Fig. 3C, lane 5). This effect was not accompanied by a concomitant change in total CaMKII levels (52 kDa; Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 1). The increased CaMKII activation was not detected when KN-93 (3 μm, 1 h) or AIP (1 μm, 1 h) was co-applied with CGRP (n = 3, p > 0.05; Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 1, A and B), whereas KN-92 was ineffective (supplemental Fig. 1). Despite the low number of neurons responsive to CGRP and the presence of nonneuronal cells, the CaMKII response after CGRP treatment was fully prevented by co-application of CGRP with the CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP-(8–37) (1.06 ± 0.1-fold increase, n = 3, p > 0.05; not shown). CGRP Activates CREB in TG Neurons—Because of the lack of data about the transcriptional mechanisms involved in P2X3 gene expression, targeted experiments are required to identify novel regulatory elements controlling pain receptor expression in sensory neurons. Thus, we investigated whether P2X3 gene expression changes induced by CGRP might be mediated by the transcription factor CREB (8Anderson L.E. Seybold V.S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1417-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Seybold V.S. McCarson K.E. Mermelstein P.G. Groth R.D. Abrahams L.G. J.

https://openalex.org/W2064905859,"Acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferases play an important role in attaining the appropriate molecular species of phospholipids. A number of genes encoding these activities were recently identified. It has become clear that multiple genes can encode one enzymatic activity and that a given gene may encode multiple activities. Here we report the identification of a gene encoding a mammalian acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase with prominent activity toward ethanolamine-containing lysophospholipids, which we termed acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase 2, LPEAT2 (previously annotated as AYTL3 or AGPAT7). LPEAT2 is predominantly expressed in brain, coinciding with an enrichment of phosphatidylethanolamine in this tissue. Ectopic expression of LPEAT2 in mammalian HEK293T cells led to a dramatic increase (up to 9-fold) in LPEAT activity when compared with cells transfected with empty vector or an unrelated acyltransferase. LPEAT2 also exhibited significant acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase activity toward 1-O-alkenyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, 1-O-alkyl-lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylserine, and lysophosphatidylcholine but lacked appreciable acylating activity toward glycerol 3-phosphate, lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylinositol, and diacylglycerol, demonstrating multiple but selective functions of LPEAT2 as an enzyme involved in phospholipid remodeling. LPEAT2 recognizes a broad range of medium and long chain fatty acyl-CoA, and its activity was not affected by Ca2+. When overexpressed in mammalian cells, LPEAT2 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. siRNA-mediated knockdown of LPEAT2 in HEK293T cells significantly decreased LPEAT and 1-alkenyl-LPEAT activities but did not affect other lysophospholipid acylating activities. These findings identify LPEAT2 as an important enzyme in the biosynthesis of ethanolamine-containing phospholipids, especially in brain.

Phospholipids are the major constituents of biological membranes, playing important roles in multiple cellular processes including maintenance of the cellular permeability barrier, regulation of the activities of proteins associated with the membrane, and regulation of intracellular signaling by serving as precursors of signaling molecules (1Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 2Yamashita A. Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathways for the major phospholipids have been well established (1Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 3Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Starting with phosphatidic acid, there are two major pathways for de novo formation of phospholipids: the CDP-choline/CDP-ethanolamine pathway, in which phosphatidic acid is dephosphorylated to form diacylglycerol (DAG) 3The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; PtdEtn, phosphatidylethanolamine; 1-alkenyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, 1-alkenyl-PtdEtn; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PtdGly, phosphatidylglycerol; PAF, platelet-activating factor; GPAT, acyl-CoA:glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPCAT, acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase; LysoPAFAT, lysoplatelet-activating factor acyltransferase; AGPAT, acyl-CoA:1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAAT, acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; LPEAT, acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase; DGAT, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; LPLAT, acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase; MBOAT, membrane bound O-acyltransferase; LysoPtdGly, lysophosphatidylglycerol; LysoPAF, 1-O-alkyl-lysophosphatidylcholine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PtdSer, phosphatidylserine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LysoPtdEtn, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; LPGAT, LysoPtdGly acyltransferase; LysoPtdCho, lysophosphatidylcholine. followed by transfer of choline or ethanolamine from their CDP conjugates to DAG, and the CDP-DAG pathway, in which phosphatidic acid is activated to form CDP-DAG followed by formation of the phospholipids (Fig. 1). Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) are mainly formed through the former pathway, whereas the latter one leads to formation of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGly), and cardiolipin. PtdSer is synthesized by head group exchange between PtdCho or PtdEtn and serine. A hepatocyte-specific PtdEtn N-methyltransferase converting PtdEtn to PtdCho was reported to play a critical role in maintaining a correct ratio of PtdCho to PtdEtn as well as in lipoprotein homeostasis (4Vance D.E. Li Z. Jacobs R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33237-33241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to the common diacylglycerophospholipids, significant amounts of two other classes of glycerophospholipids exist in eukaryotic membranes: 1-alkyl-glycerophospholipids and 1-alkenyl-glycerophospholipids (or plasmalogens). These ether-containing phospholipids are usually present in a tissue- or cell-specific manner in vivo to exert specific functions; for instance, high levels of 1-alkyl-phospholipids in inflammatory cells are important for the formation of PAF, and 1-alkenyl-phospholipids (plasmalogens) are enriched in the nervous system, where they are major lipid components of the myelin sheath (2Yamashita A. Sugiura T. Waku K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). After de novo formation, phospholipids undergo rapid remodeling, catalyzed by phospholipase (e.g. phospholipase A2) and lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs; Fig. 1) (5Lands W.E. Merkl I. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 898-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Merkl I. Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 905-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This remodeling process serves to maintain and adjust the appropriate distribution of acyl groups in particular membranes and also generates many bioactive lipids in particular tissues or cells, for example PAF in inflammatory cells as above-mentioned and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in alveolar type II cells in lung. Although the pathways and enzymatic activities responsible for remodeling of different phospholipids have been extensively studied, genes encoding these activities remained unidentified until recently, when large amounts of gene sequences from a variety of organisms became available for bioinformatics analysis. A conserved acyltransferase domain revealed both bioinformatically and experimentally by analyzing several acyl-CoA-dependent glycerolipid acyltransferase from different organisms was found to be shared by members of a superfamily of glycerolipid acyltransferases (8Lewin T.M.

Functional characterization of orphan members of this family led to the discovery of several genes encoding acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferases (11Cao J. Liu Y. Lockwood J. Burn P.

We recently performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the glycerolipid acyltransferase family as part of our search for an ER-associated glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) 3 (16Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our analysis also identified a subfamily of acyltransferases, which included the recently identified lysophospholipid acyltransferases LPCAT1 and LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 (12Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L.

In the present study, we show that one of these orphan genes, previously named 1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase 7 (AGPAT7) or lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase η (LPAATη) (17Ye G.M. Chen C. Huang S. Han D.D. Guo J.H. Wan B. Yu L. DNA Seq. 2005; 16: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), encodes a new lysophospholipid acyltransferase that most prominently utilizes 1-acyllysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPtdEtn) and 1-alkenyl-LysoPtdEtn as substrates. We therefore propose to rename this gene acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase 2 (LPEAT2). Interestingly, LPEAT2 is most highly expressed in brain and may therefore be involved in maintaining the high levels of PtdEtn (so-called cephalin) in the brain. Materials—Unless stated otherwise, all lipids and acyl-CoAs were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) or Sigma. Origins or species of lysophospholipids are as follows: lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma, from bovine brain, contains primarily palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids); lysophosphatidylethanolamine (Sigma, from egg yolk, contains primarily palmitic or stearic acids); lysophosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen (Avanti Polar Lipids, from porcine brain, mainly contains 1-alkenyl-LPE with stearic acyl); 1-O-palmityl-sn-3-phosphocholine (LysoPAF, Sigma); lysophosphatidylserine (Sigma, 1-palmitoyl); lysophosphatidylglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, 1-stearoyl); lysophosphatidylinositol (Sigma, form soybean, contains primarily palmitic and stearic acids); and lysophosphatidic acids (Sigma, 1-oleoyl). [14C]acetyl-CoA (C2:0), [14C]ma-lonyl-CoA (C3:0), [14C]octanoyl-CoA (C8:0), [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0), [14C]stearoyl-CoA (C18:0), [14C]oleoyl-CoA (C18:1), and [14C]arachidonoyl-CoA (C20:4) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Silica TLC plates (60 A) were from Whatman (Florham Park, NJ). All other materials or chemicals were obtained from either Sigma or Invitrogen. Bioinformatic Analysis—The bioinformatic analysis to retrieve a list of sequences containing the glycerophosphate acyltransferase domain (PF01553) was performed as described elsewhere (16Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments among the members of the acyltransferase family were constructed using Vector NTI. Sequence analysis on transmembrane domain was performed by TMHMM algorithm. Cloning and Expression of LPEAT2—The full-length human LPEAT2 cDNA was cloned by PCR amplification using primer pairs carrying the FLAG sequence fused in-frame at N terminus: forward 5′-CCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGAGCCAGGGAAGTCCGGGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGAGTGCCTCAGCCTCTCA-3′, with an Image clone 30520144 ordered from Open Biosystems as template. The PCR fragment was first cloned into the Srf1 site of a pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced. A mammalian expression vector for full-length human LPEAT2 was engineered by subcloning the insert into EcoRV/NotI sites of the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the LPEAT2 cDNA-containing vector or empty vector by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets were either used immediately or stored at -70 °C. To express LPEAT2 in a bacterial system, N-terminally FLAG-tagged LPEAT2 cDNA in pcDNA3.1/V5-His was sub-cloned into EcoRI and NotI sites of the pET21a vector (Novagen) to ensure an in-frame translation of full-length protein. The plasmid was transformed into bacterial strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen). The cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6, followed by a 12-h incubation in the presence of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were stored at -70 °C. Mammalian and bacterial cells were disrupted by probe sonication with predetermined settings. The resulting cell lysate was used for Western analysis or activity assay after determination of total protein with a Bio-Rad protein assay. In Vitro Acyltransferase Activity Assays—LPLAT activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [14C]-labeled acyl moieties of acyl-CoA or acetyl group from acetyl-CoA (acyl donor) into phospholipids in the presence of corresponding lysophospholipids (acyl acceptor) as previously described (11Cao J. Liu Y. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31727-31734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 80 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 or 200 μm each lysophospholipid, 50 μm [14C]acyl-CoA (50 mCi/mmol) or [14C]acetyl-CoA (50 mCi/mmol), and cell lysate (containing 50 μg of total protein) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was terminated by adding 375 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) after incubation at room temperature for 15 min. The lipids were extracted by vigorously vortexing for 10 min after the addition of 0.1 ml of 0.9% KCl. Phase separation was achieved by a brief spin. The organic phase (bottom) was then transferred to a fresh glass tube, dried under N2 steam, separated by TLC with chloroform:methanol:water (65:25:4, v/v), and visualized by exposure to a PhosphorImager screen. The enzymatic products were identified with authentic standards by exposure to I2 vapor. Under some circumstances, quantification of radiolabeled lipids in TLC plates was achieved by scraping silica gel into scintillation vials followed by scintillation counting with a Beckman LS 6500 System (Fullerton, CA). GPAT, AGPAT, and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activities were similarly determined as described elsewhere (16Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol.

In some experiments, divalent cations or chelators such as EDTA or 0.5% Triton X-100 were included into reactions to determine the effects of these reagents on enzymatic activities of LPEAT2. Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed in HEK293T cells or Neural 2A cells transfected with FLAG-tagged LPEAT essentially as described (16Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—TaqMan real time quantitative PCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detector (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 18 S as internal control, as described (16Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Gene-specific primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Mm01336600_g1 and Hs00405723_m1 for mouse and human LPEAT2, respectively). Relative expression was determined by the Ct method (Applied Biosystems). siRNA-mediated Knockdown of Gene Expression—HEK293T cells cultured in 6-well plate with 2 ml of medium were transfected with 50 pmol (final concentration, 25 μm) of control siRNA (Ambion catalog number 4613) or two LPEAT2-specific siRNA duplexes purchased from Ambion (siLPEAT2-1, identification number 217054; siLPEAT2-2, identification number 217053). 48 h after transfection, LPEAT2 mRNA was measured by quantitative PCR, and lysophospholipid acyltransferase activities were determined as described above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Identification and Cloning of the Human LPEAT2 Gene—Using a seed alignment sequence derived from the previously described glycerolipid acyltransferase motif (PF01553) (19Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar), we have previously generated a comprehensive list of human, mouse, and rat genes containing the glycerolipid acyltransferase motif (PF01553) (16Cao J. Li J.L. Li D. Tobin J.F. Gimeno R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19695-19700Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our list contained a subfamily of several orphan acyltransferases, two of which were recently deorphaned and shown to encode enzymes mediating the formation of PtdCho, 1-O-alkyl-PtdCho, and PAF in lung alveolar type II cells and inflammatory cells via the remodeling pathway, respectively (12Chen X.

The same subfamily contained a third gene, previously named AGPAT7 or LPAATη (17Ye G.M. Chen C. Huang S. Han D.D. Guo J.H. Wan B. Yu L. DNA Seq. 2005; 16: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and renamed LPEAT2 in the present study after functional characterization. This gene shares a high degree of homology with LPCAT1 and LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 (34 and 43% identity, respectively), and analysis of transcriptional profiling data suggested that it was highly expressed in brain and inflammatory cells, suggesting that it might function as a lysophospholipid acyltransferase in these tissues. A full-length cDNA was obtained and shown to encode a 524-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of ∼57.2 kDa. The four signature motifs important for acyltransferase catalytic activity are present at N-terminal acyltransferase domain (Fig. 2, boxed letters). Although we found no Ca2+-binding EF hand motif in contrast to LPCAT1 and LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2, several residues important for Ca2+ binding within an EF hand motif were conserved (Fig. 2, red letters). The protein is predicted to contain one transmembrane domain (Fig. 2, amino acids 40-62, indicated with red bars above the sequence). A mouse ortholog of LPEAT2 was identified based on genomic data base searching, sharing 93% amino acid identity with the human gene (data not shown). Tissue Distribution of LPEAT2 Transcripts in Mouse and Human—As queried using several transcriptional profiling databases, transcripts of human LPEAT2 were predominantly detected in whole brain and different brain regions; significant levels were also noticed in inflammatory tissues and cells (data not shown). Reassessment of tissue distribution of human and mouse LPEAT2 mRNA by TaqMan real time reverse transcription-PCR confirmed abundant expression in brain in both species (Fig. 3). Human and mouse LPEAT2 transcripts were also expressed in many other tissues, albeit at much lower levels when compared with brain. Notably, LPEAT2 mRNA expression levels were very low in liver and lung in both species, suggesting that LPEAT2 does not play a major role in phospholipid formation in these tissues with active phospholipid remodeling. Lysophospholipid Acyltransferase Activity of LPEAT2—To determine the enzymatic activities of LPEAT2, we overexpressed N-terminally FLAG-tagged hLPEAT2 in HEK293 cells. Western blot analysis showed an apparent molecular mass of ∼60 kDa for FLAG-hLPEAT2 (Fig. 4A), consistent with a predicted value of 58.3 kDa, suggesting an absence of major post-translational modifications. Lysates from cells overexpressing LPEAT2 were tested for acyl-CoA-dependent acyltransferase activities toward a variety of lysophospholipids. Considering the predominant expression of LPEAT2 in brain, a tissue where PtdEtn is enriched, we hypothesized that LPEAT2 might encode a protein with LPEAT activity. Indeed, lysates from cells overexpressing LPEAT2 showed a dramatic ∼9-fold increase in the formation of radiolabeled PtdEtn compared with cells transfected with empty vector or hDGAT1 (Fig. 4B, lane 3 versus lanes 1 and 2). No appreciable PtdEtn formation was observed in samples lacking exogenously added LysoPtdEtn, demonstrating that the PtdEtn formed was derived from LysoPtdEtn (Fig. 4B, lane 4). As expected, overexpression of DGAT1 led to a significant (∼30-fold) increase in DGAT but not LPEAT activity, and no increase in DGAT activity was detected from the cells overexpressing recombinant LPEAT2 (Fig. 4C). In addition to PtdEtn, overexpression of LPEAT2 also greatly (4-7-fold) enhanced formation of PtdGly (Fig. 4D) and alkyl-PtdCho (Fig. 4E) from LysoPtdGly and LysoPAF (1-O-alkyl-LysoPtdCho), respectively. Formation of PtdCho and PtdSer was also moderately (∼2-3-fold) increased (Fig. 4F). In contrast, no significant increase in lysophosphatidylinositol or lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity was found in LPEAT2-overexpressing cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 4G). Specific activities calculated from Fig. 4 (B-G) are shown in Fig. 4H. During our studies, we noticed that LysoPt-dEtn appears to be less soluble than other lysophospholipid substrates, which may contribute to a lower apparent specific activity for LysoPtdEtn compared with other substrates. Although the background levels of acyltransferase activities in our experiments are in line with those observed by Chen et al. (12Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), our values are lower than the ones reported by Nakanishi et al. (13Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D.

Chem. 2007; 282: 6532-6539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting differences in the cell lines used, protein expression levels, and assay conditions. In separate experiments, overexpression of LPEAT2 resulted in no increase in GPAT or LysoPAF acetyltransferase activity (data not shown). These data show that LPEAT2 encodes a lysophospholipid acyltransferase that can utilize a subset of lysophospholipids as substrates and, importantly, can catalyze the formation of PtdEtn. The high levels of endogenous lysophospholipid acyltransferase activities observed in mammalian cells (Fig. 4H; see also Refs. 11Cao J. Liu Y. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol.

Recently, Soupene et al. (22Soupene E. Fyrst H. Kuypers F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that murine lysophospholipid acyltransferases expressed in Escherichia coli show significant enzymatic activity above a much lower background. We expressed LPEAT2 in E. coli and assessed enzymatic activities. Similar to our findings in mammalian cells, we detected a significant increase in acyltransferase activities toward LysoPtdEtn, 1-alkenyl-LysoPtdEtn, LysoPAF, and LysoPtdCho but not LysoPtdGly and lysophosphatidylinositol in E. coli lysates heterogeneously overexpressing LPEAT2 (supplemental Fig. S1B). However, although the expression levels of recombinant LPEAT2 in E. coli were much higher than in mammalian HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S1A), the specific activities measured (expressed as nmol product formed per min per mg of protein) were at least 10-fold lower than those observed in mammalian cells (Fig. 4H and supplemental Fig. S1B), suggesting a unique advantage of the mammalian expression system in preserving the functional activity of recombinant LPEAT2. Another approach to overcome the high levels of endogenous background activities is to purify the recombinant protein in an active form from its crude preparation. We found that the activities of LPEAT2 were very sensitive to inactivation by detergent (see, for example, supplemental Fig. S2), making purification of this membrane-associated protein challenging"

However, the molecular mechanisms mediating survival of VSMCs in atherosclerotic plaques remain unknown. Although plaque VSMCs exhibit increased susceptibility to apoptosis and reduced expression of the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) when compared with normal VSMCs, a causative effect has not been established. Here we show that increased expression of the IGF1R can rescue plaque VSMCs from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that IGF-1 signaling is a critical regulator of VSMC survival. Akt mediates the majority of the IGF1R survival signaling, and ectopic activation of Akt was sufficient to protect VSMCs in vitro. Both IGF1R and phospho-Akt expression were reduced in human plaque (intimal) VSMCs when compared with medial VSMCs, suggesting that Akt mediates survival signaling in atherosclerosis. Importantly, downstream targets of Akt were identified that mediate its protective effect as inhibition of FoxO3a or GSK3 by Akt-dependent phosphorylation protected VSMCs in vitro. We conclude that Akt and its downstream targets FoxO3a and GSK3 regulate a survival pathway in VSMCs and that their deregulation due to a reduction of IGF1R signaling may promote apoptosis in atherosclerosis.

IGF1R-dependent signaling is crucial for the survival of many cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMCs are the principle source of collagen and extracellular matrix that maintain the tensile strength of atherosclerotic plaques, and VSMC loss induces multiple features of plaque instability (1Clarke M.C.

Reduced IGF1R expression is also seen within plaques, suggesting that IGF1R-dependent survival regulates apoptosis in vivo (11Okura Y. Brink M. Zahid A.A. Anwar A. Delafontaine P. J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2004; 24: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, plaque VSMCs also show increased sensitivity to multiple proapoptotic stimuli, including the tumor suppressor gene P53 and death receptor ligation (13Bennett M.R. Littlewood T.D.

Res. 2000; 86: 1038-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is therefore not known whether defective IGF1R expression alone is an important cause of reduced survival of pVSMCs.A major downstream effector of IGF1R signaling is the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as Protein Kinase B (PKB)). Akt phosphorylates a large number of targets involved in glucose metabolism and cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (reviewed in Ref. 15Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that pVSMCs also exhibit reduced activation of Akt in response to IGF1 treatment (4Patel V.A. Zhang Q.J. Siddle K. Soos M.A. Goddard M. Weissberg P.L. Bennett M.R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that Akt mediates IGF1R-dependent signaling in these cells. However, it is not known whether activation of Akt is necessary and/or sufficient for VSMC survival in response to apoptotic stimuli. Similarly, although Akt targets involved in survival have been identified in many cell types, Akt targets are frequently cell type-specific, and those important for VSMC survival have not been determined. Here we show that activation of Akt alone is sufficient to protect VSMCs from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that Akt-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of FoxO3a and GSK3 is important for VSMC survival.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Human VSMCs were isolated from aortas of cardiac transplant patients or from atherosclerotic plaques following carotid endarterectomy with informed consent and approval of the Local Ethics Committee. Rat VSMCs were isolated from aortas of Wistar rats. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were treated with 100 ng/ml recombinant human IGF1 (Peprotech), 100 nm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (HT, Sigma), and 50 μm SB415286 (Sigma), as indicated.

Expression plasmids were transfected into rat VSMCs using SuperFect (Qiagen). Alternatively, infectious replication-deficient retrovirus was harvested from Bosc23 packaging cells and used to infect rat VSMCs in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide, Sigma). Rat VSMCs were selected and maintained in 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) or 400 μg/ml G418 as appropriate.

Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare).Cell Viability and Apoptosis—Cells were plated at the same density 16 h prior to each experiment. Proliferation and apoptosis were determined by time-lapse digital microscopy using an Olympus IX71 microscope controlled with Openlab software (Improvision). Apoptotic and dividing cells in two or more fields each containing 100 cells at the start of the experiment were counted. Apoptosis was verified by morphological changes, including nuclear condensation in the presence of Hoechst 33258 and membrane blebbing.Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin-embedded sections of human carotid arteries were sectioned at 5-μm intervals. Specimens were dewaxed and microwaved in 120 mm sodium citrate buffer, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and then with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin using the ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Peroxidase activity was detected with diaminobenzidene. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Cells expressing Akt, FoxO3a, GSK3α, or their phosphorylated species were counted in three or more random fields, each from three different plaque donors. Only cells whose staining exceeded a 125-pixel density were counted.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance or Student's t test as appropriate. Significance was established when p < 0.05.RESULTSIGF1R Mediates Survival of VSMCs—Previously, we demonstrated that VSMCs derived from human plaques (pVSMCs) express lower levels of IGF1R when compared with VSMCs derived from normal human aortas (4Patel V.A.

Khachigian L.M. Littlewood T.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). pVSMCs also show reduced proliferation and increased sensitivity to apoptosis (3Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 4Patel V.A. Zhang Q.J. Siddle K. Soos M.A. Goddard M. Weissberg P.L. Bennett M.R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of IGF1R in VSMCs increases the rate of proliferation and markedly reduces apoptosis (7Kavurma M.M. Figg N. Bennett M.R. Mercer J. Khachigian L.M. Littlewood T.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Li Y. Higashi Y. Itabe H. Song Y.H. Du J. Delafontaine P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 2178-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although there is a good correlation between reduced IGF1R expression and reduction in proliferation and survival in pVSMCs, a causative effect has not been established. To determine whether increased IGF1R expression could rescue the increased sensitivity of pVSMCs to apoptosis, we co-microinjected expression plasmids for either the wild-type IGF1R or the YF mutant along with EGFP into human pVSMCs. Co-injection with EGFP-expressing plasmids allowed tracking of injected cells within the population. When compared with plaque VSMCs microinjected with empty vector or IGF1R-YF, those injected with wild-type IGF1R showed increased protection against H2O2-induced apoptosis in response to IGF1 (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the level of IGF1R expression regulates the survival of VSMCs in response to oxidative stress.IGF1R-dependent Survival of VSMCs Is Mediated by Akt—The serine/threonine kinase Akt is a major downstream effector of IGF1R signaling. Consistent with this, human pVSMCs demonstrated a transient increase in Akt phosphorylation (Ser-473) peaking at 15 min after IGF1 stimulation when compared with normal human VSMCs that demonstrated a more robust and persistent response (Fig. 1B). The reduction in the active phosphorylated form (Ser-473) of Akt was not due to reduced total Akt expression since this was not affected by IGF1 stimulation. Similar results were obtained from an additional two normal and two plaque-derived primary isolates of human VSMCs, indicating that reduced phospho-Akt was a common feature of plaque-derived cultures when compared with normal VSMCs (data not shown).To examine whether the reduced phospho-Akt expression seen in pVSMCs in vitro was a valid representation of that seen in plaques in vivo, we examined expression of Akt and phospho-Akt in atherosclerotic plaques from three different patients where both the fibrous cap intimal cells and a relatively normal media could be examined in the same section. VSMCs (α-smooth muscle actin-positive, Fig. 1C) within the fibrous cap of the atherosclerotic plaque exhibited reduced phospho-Akt (Ser-473) expression in vivo when compared with medial cells (Fig. 1C). Again, this appeared to be due to a reduction in Akt activation (phosphorylation at Ser-473) rather than a reduction in total Akt expression.To demonstrate directly that Akt mediates the effects of IGF1R activation in VSMCs, we expressed a dominant negative mutant of Akt (DN-Akt, T308A, S473A) (19Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) in rat VSMCs (Fig. 2A). DN-Akt markedly inhibited IGF1-stimulated survival (Fig. 2A), strongly suggesting that the major downstream effector of IGF1R-mediated survival in VSMCs is Akt. To examine whether Akt was sufficient to protect VSMCs from H2O2-induced apoptosis, we employed an ectopically inducible allele of Akt. Rat VSMCs were infected with retroviruses that express either a constitutively active Akt (myristoylated Akt, mAkt) or an allele containing an inactivating mutation in the myristoylation domain (A2Akt) fused to the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (mAktER and A2AktER, respectively; Fig. 2B (16Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar)). These proteins are inactive in the absence of ligand (4-hydroxytamoxifen, HT), and the kinase activity of mAktER is only stimulated by the addition of HT to the culture medium (16Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, phosphorylation of mAktER (Ser-473) was only observed following the addition of HT (Fig. 3A). In contrast, A2AktER was not phosphorylated at Ser-473 following the addition of HT and exhibited no kinase activity (see below). Note that a low level of endogenous phospho-Akt is observed in these cells even after 24 h in the absence of serum and that this was markedly increased by IGF1 treatment (Fig. 3A). Rat VSMCs cultured in the absence of IGF1 for 24 h (to suppress endogenous IGF1R signaling) showed ∼35-60% apoptosis 24 h after the addition of 50 μm H2O2 (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, ectopic activation of mAktER elicited a protective effect against H2O2-induced apoptosis in these cells and reduced the level of apoptosis to ∼12%, similar to that seen following treatment with IGF1 (Fig. 2, A and B). No protection was seen in HT-treated A2AktER-expressing cells, nor in mAktER-expressing cells treated with vehicle (ethanol). These results demonstrate that IGF1R-dependent survival signaling in rat VSMCs is mediated primarily by Akt and that activation of Akt alone is sufficient to mimic the protective effects of IGF1R treatment.FIGURE 2IGF1-dependent survival of VSMCs is mediated by Akt.

For example, Bad, caspase 9, and members of the FoxO family are proapoptotic proteins that have been identified as Akt targets in some cells. Since we have shown that Akt is an important regulator of cell death in VSMCs, we sought to identify which targets of Akt mediate survival in these cells. We compared phosphorylation of putative Akt substrates after activation of mAktER or A2AktER by HT or by the addition of IGF1 to cells deprived of serum for 24 h (Fig. 3). Although phosphorylation of Bad by Akt confers survival in BALB/c 3T3 cells (23Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar), we were unable to demonstrate phosphorylation of Bad following activation of Akt in vitro (Fig. 3D). In contrast, ectopic activation of Akt with HT resulted in rapid phosphorylation of FoxO3a and both α and β isoforms of GSK3 (Fig. 3, B and C). This was not observed in A2AktER-expressing control cells. Phosphorylation of FoxO3a and GSK3 α/β was also seen after stimulation with IGF1, consistent with the idea that Akt mediates signaling downstream of IGF1R. Although FoxO3a is phosphorylated by Akt in VSMCs, other members of the FoxO family are not. For example, FoxO1 is also expressed in these cells but was not phosphorylated in response to HT or IGF1 (Fig. 3, C and D).FoxO3a is a transcription factor that activates many genes involved in cell death, including fasL, bim, and puma (reviewed in Ref. 24Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of FoxO3a by Akt is important in the survival of VSMCs, we expressed a mutant FoxO3a allele (A3) in which all three potential Akt phosphorylation sites (Thr-32, Ser-253, and Ser-315) are changed to alanines (Fig. 4A) and which, therefore, cannot be phosphorylated and inhibited by Akt (20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5366) Google Scholar). The protection afforded by activation of Akt in H2O2-treated control rat VSMCs or those expressing wild-type FoxO3a was severely comprised by expression of FoxO3a-A3 (Fig. 4A). This indicates that inhibition of FoxO3a activity by Akt-dependent phosphorylation is required for survival of these cells.FIGURE 4Akt-dependent inhibition of apoptosis is mediated by phosphorylation of FoxO3a.

Expression of Bim was reduced following activation of Akt in rat VSMCs expressing wild-type FoxO3a but not in cells expressing FoxO3a A3 (Fig. 4B).To determine whether FoxO3a is a physiological target of Akt in human VSMCs as well as rat cells, we examined the expression of p-FoxO3a in lysates derived from normal human aorta or atherosclerotic plaque primary cultures (Fig. 4C). Reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt and FoxO3a were observed in the plaque-derived cultures when compared with normal aorta. Moreover, VSMCs within the fibrous cap of the atherosclerotic plaque exhibited reduced phospho-FoxO1/3a expression in vivo when compared with medial cells despite the presence of FoxO3a in these cells (Fig. 4D). The antibody used recognizes phosphorylated forms of both FoxO1 and FoxO3a, and we cannot be sure which protein is detected. However, we had not previously detected Akt-dependent phosphorylation of FoxO1 in rat VSMCs (Fig. 3), suggesting that the antibody is primarily detecting phosphorylated FoxO3a.It is likely that Akt-dependent survival of VSMCs is mediated by more than one downstream effector. Indeed, GSK3 was also phosphorylated by Akt in VSMCs (Fig. 3), and recent data indicate that GSK3 may have a role in apoptosis regulation as well as glucose metabolism (25Maurer U. Charvet C. Wagman A.S. Dejardin E. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). To determine whether Akt-dependent inhibition of GSK3 is important for survival of VSMCs, we expressed either the wild-type allele or a mutant allele of GSK3β (S9A) in which the primary phosphorylation site targeted by Akt is mutated (Fig. 5A). In cells expressing GSK3β S9A, the ability of Akt to suppress apoptosis in response to H2O2 was delayed and partially impaired (Fig. 5A).FIGURE 5Akt-dependent inhibition of apoptosis is mediated by phosphorylation of GSK3.

https://openalex.org/W1995780647,"Background Little is known about the effect of physical exercise on influenza-associated mortality. Methods and Findings We collected information about exercise habits and other lifestyles, and socioeconomic and demographic status, the underlying cause of death of 24,656 adults (21% aged 30–64, 79% aged 65 or above) who died in 1998 in Hong Kong, and the weekly proportion of specimens positive for influenza A (H3N1 and H1N1) and B isolations during the same period. We assessed the excess risks (ER) of influenza-associated mortality due to all-natural causes, cardiovascular diseases, or respiratory disease among different levels of exercise: never/seldom (less than once per month), low/moderate (once per month to three times per week), and frequent (four times or more per week) by Poisson regression. We also assessed the differences in ER between exercise groups by case-only logistic regression. For all the mortality outcomes under study in relation to each 10% increase in weekly proportion of specimens positive for influenza A+B, never/seldom exercise (as reference) was associated with 5.8% to 8.5% excess risks (ER) of mortality (P<0.0001), while low/moderate exercise was associated with ER which were 4.2% to 6.4% lower than those of the reference (P<0.001 for all-natural causes; P = 0.001 for cardiovascular; and P = 0.07 for respiratory mortality). Frequent exercise was not different from the reference (change in ER −0.8% to 1.7%, P = 0.30 to 0.73). Conclusion When compared with never or seldom exercise, exercising at low to moderate frequency is beneficial with lower influenza-associated mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2069871388,"Chromosome segregation in mitosis is orchestrated by dynamic interaction between spindle microtubules and the kinetochore. Septin (SEPT) belongs to a conserved family of polymerizing GTPases localized to the metaphase spindle during mitosis. Previous study showed that SEPT2 depletion results in chromosome mis-segregation correlated with a loss of centromere-associated protein E (CENP-E) from the kinetochores of congressing chromosomes (1). However, it has remained elusive as to whether CENP-E physically interacts with SEPT and how this interaction orchestrates chromosome segregation in mitosis. Here we show that SEPT7 is required for a stable kinetochore localization of CENP-E in HeLa and MDCK cells. SEPT7 stabilizes the kinetochore association of CENP-E by directly interacting with its C-terminal domain. The region of SEPT7 binding to CENP-E was mapped to its C-terminal domain by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays. Immunofluorescence study shows that SEPT7 filaments distribute along the mitotic spindle and terminate at the kinetochore marked by CENP-E. Remarkably, suppression of synthesis of SEPT7 by small interfering RNA abrogated the localization of CENP-E to the kinetochore and caused aberrant chromosome segregation. These mitotic defects and kinetochore localization of CENP-E can be successfully rescued by introducing exogenous GFP-SEPT7 into the SEPT7-depleted cells. These SEPT7-suppressed cells display reduced tension at kinetochores of bi-orientated chromosomes and activated mitotic spindle checkpoint marked by Mad2 and BubR1 labelings on these misaligned chromosomes. These findings reveal a key role for the SEPT7-CENP-E interaction in the distribution of CENP-E to the kinetochore and achieving chromosome alignment. We propose that SEPT7 forms a link between kinetochore distribution of CENP-E and the mitotic spindle checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2037980099,"Photochemically active photosystem (PS) I complexes were purified from the chlorophyll (Chl) d-dominated cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017, and several of their properties were characterized. PS I complexes consist of 11 subunits, including PsaK1 and PsaK2; a new small subunit was identified and named Psa27. The new subunit might replace the function of PsaI that is absent in A. marina. The amounts of pigments per one molecule of Chl d′ were 97.0 ± 11.0 Chl d, 1.9 ± 0.5 Chl a, 25.2 ± 2.4 α-carotene, and two phylloquinone molecules. The light-induced Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy and light-induced difference absorption spectra reconfirmed that the primary electron donor of PS I (P740) was the Chl d dimer. In addition to P740, the difference spectrum contained an additional band at 728 nm. The redox potentials of P740 were estimated to be 439 mV by spectroelectrochemistry; this value was comparable with the potential of P700 in other cyanobacteria and higher plants. This suggests that the overall energetics of the PS I reaction were adjusted to the electron acceptor side to utilize the lower light energy gained by P740. The distribution of charge in P740 was estimated by a density functional theory calculation, and a partial localization of charge was predicted to P1 Chl (special pair Chl on PsaA). Based on differences in the protein matrix and optical properties of P740, construction of the PS I core in A. marina was discussed.

PS I catalyzes the light-driven electron transfer from the plastocyanin in the lumenal side of the thylakoid membranes to ferredoxin in the stromal side (for review, see Ref. 3Brettel K. Leibl W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 100-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The PS I complex has been isolated from cyanobacteria as a trimer with three identical monomers. The crystal structure of the PS I isolated from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus has been determined, with a resolution of 2.5 Å (4Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). The results revealed the presence of 12 protein subunits and 127 cofactors, including 96 chlorophylls (Chls), 2 phylloquinones, 3 Fe4S4 clusters, 22 carotenoids, and 4 lipids. The PsaA and PsaB bind Chl a/Chl a′ as the primary electron donor (P700), and A0, A1, and Fx as the electron acceptors (5Golbeck J.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The type strain Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017 has been well characterized, and its complete genome sequences were determined recently (15Swingley W.D. Chen M. Cheung P.C. Conrad A.L. Dejesa L.C.

Chl a is always present as a minor component, but its content varies according to the light conditions (16Mimuro M. Akimoto S. Gotoh T. Yokono M. Akiyama M. Tsuchiya T. Miyashita H. Kobayashi M. Yamazaki I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The absorption maximum of Chl d in organic solvents is located at a wavelength ∼30 nm longer than that of Chl a (17Manning W.M. Strain H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 151: 1-19Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18Tomo T. Suzuki T. Hirano E. Tsuchiya T. Miyashita H. Dohmae N. Mimuro M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2006; 423: 282-287Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In vivo, the absorption maximum of A. marina cells is found at ∼715 nm, significantly longer than that of Chl a. According to Miyachi et al. (19Miyachi S. Strassdat K. Miyashita H. Senger H. Z. Naturforsch. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 636-638Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), Chl d functions as an efficient antenna for both PSs; thus the energy transfer to the individual reaction centers should be very efficient. In photosynthetic organisms, pigments function in two roles as follows: as light-harvesting components and as electron transfer components. Changes in pigment composition affect pigment function, the reaction environment, and the modified proteins that accommodate the pigments. Electron transfer reactions are organized as a sequence of absolute redox potentials. In contrast, energy transfer processes are governed by the energy levels, orientations, and distances between donors and acceptors. An absolute excitation energy of a pigment is not significant, but the energy levels relative to that of the reaction center are important. For this reason, it is of particular interest to understand the effects of pigment changes on the electrochemical properties of the system and not to rely solely on changes in the light-harvesting properties. PS I complexes of A. marina have been isolated by many groups, and many aspects of their structure and function have been characterized, but inconsistencies in these data remain. Hu et al. (20Hu Q. Miyashita H. Iwasaki I. Kurano N. Miyachi S. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13319-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) isolated PS I particles and detected a flash-induced difference maximum at ∼740 nm (P740). Sivakumar et al. (21Sivakumar V. Wang R. Hastings G. Biophys.

Theses data indicate that the primary electron donor of PS I in A. marina is a Chl d dimer. Hu et al. (20Hu Q. Miyashita H. Iwasaki I. Kurano N. Miyachi S. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13319-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported that the redox potential of P740 was 335 mV. This is significantly lower than that of the T. elongatus PS I (+423 mV) (22Nakamura A. Suzawa T. Kato Y. Watanabe T. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2273-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Kato Y. Nakamura A. Suzawa T. Watanabe T. Allen J. Gantt E. Golbeck J. Osmond B. Photosynthesis Energy from the Sun. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York2008Google Scholar) and of PS I from other species (24Ke B. Photosynthesis Photobiochemistry and Photobiophysics. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 463-478Google Scholar), and it is inconsistent with recent studies of P740 in A. marina (25Benjamin B. Finazzi G. Benson S. Barber J. Rappaport F. Telfer A. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 91: 155Google Scholar, 26Telfer A. Pascal A. Barber J. Schenderlein M. Schlodder E. Cetin M. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 91: 143Google Scholar). With regard to the protein composition of PS I, Hu et al. (20Hu Q. Miyashita H. Iwasaki I. Kurano N. Miyachi S. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13319-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) reported the presence of PsaA, PsaB, PsaC, PsaD, PsaE, PsaF, PsaL, PsaK, and two unidentified polypeptides with apparent molecular masses below 6 kDa. One of these two might be PsaI, a common cyanobacterial PS I. However, the complete genome sequence of A. marina MBIC 11017 indicates that psaI is absent (15Swingley W.D. Chen M. Cheung P.C. Conrad A.L. Dejesa L.C. Hao J. Honchak B.M. Karbach L.E. Kurdoglu A. Lahiri S. Mastrian S.D. Miyashita H. Page L. Ramakrishna P. Satoh S. Sattley W.M. Shimada Y. Taylor H.L. Tomo T. Tsuchiya T.

The crystal structure of the T. elongatus PS I shows that PsaI localizes to the attaching site of individual monomers (4Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). However, almost all particles of PS I isolated from A. marina were trimers. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the A. marina protein that leads to stabilization of the trimer structure. The major pigment in A. marina is Chl d. Chl a is a minor component but is not absent (16Mimuro M. Akimoto S. Gotoh T. Yokono M. Akiyama M. Tsuchiya T. Miyashita H. Kobayashi M. Yamazaki I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Miyashita H. Adachi K. Kurano N. Ikemoto H. Chihara M. Miyachi S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 274-281Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In PS II, at least three Chl a molecules are present in the core complex (28Tomo T. Okubo T. Akimoto S. Yokono M. Miyashita H. Tsuchiya T. Noguchi T. Mimuro M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7283-7288Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the case of PS I, it has been reported that nearly one Chl a is present per unit of PS I (20Hu Q. Miyashita H. Iwasaki I. Kurano N. Miyachi S. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13319-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, Chl d′, a constituent of P740, was not detected in that study, and the Chl number was higher than that observed in other cyanobacteria (4Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 24Ke B. Photosynthesis Photobiochemistry and Photobiophysics. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2002: 463-478Google Scholar). Kumazaki et al. (29Kumazaki S. Abiko K. Ikegami I. Iwaki M. Itoh S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggested that the role of Chl a in PS I was as the primary electron acceptor. However, the role and localization of Chl a in PS I remain controversial. To facilitate further analysis, highly purified and chemically stable samples are required. In this study, we obtained highly purified PS I complexes from A. marina by a combination of detergent treatment, column chromatography, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The PS I activity of the resulting sample was comparable with that of other cyanobacteria, and the sample was further characterized by absorption, steady-state fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, FTIR spectroscopy, redox chemistry, and computational chemistry. We found several essential differences from those properties reported earlier. Based on our new findings, we discuss the overall energetics in PS I of A. marina and the general features of PS I, including other oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Isolation of PS I Complexes—A. marina MBIC 11017 was cultured in a 20-liter culture bottle of IMK medium under continuous illumination from an incandescent light (15 μmol photons m-2 s-1) at 298 K. Air was continuously supplied through a filter (Millipore Millex FG-50). On each occasion, two separate bottles were used for the preparation of samples. Isolation was conducted at 277 K unless otherwise indicated. Cells were harvested by a membrane filter method with a Millipore Pelicon2 and washed once with growth medium and then with a buffer solution (50 mm MES, pH 6.5) containing 25% (w/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm CaCl2. Cells were broken twice with a French press at a pressure of 150 MPa, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (2,000 × g, 5 min). Thylakoid membranes were recovered by centrifugation (37,000 × g, 20 min) and stored at 193 K until use. PS I complexes were solubilized from thylakoid membranes by 1% dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM) in the dark. The sample solution was gently stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 20 min and then centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were purified by column chromatography. The first step was purification on a DEAE-Toyopearl 650S column. Fractions containing PS I complexes were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation to remove contaminating PS II and the small amount of monomeric PS I. Finally, the PS I sample was purified by passage over a UnoQ column. A trimer form of the PS I complex was obtained, and its subunit composition was analyzed using SDS-PAGE according to the method of Ikeuchi and Inoue (30Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 1233-1239Google Scholar). The stacking gel was 4.5%, and the running gel was 16–22% acrylamide. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Determination of N-terminal Amino Acid Sequences—The low molecular weight subunits were separated by electrophoresis, and the proteins on the gel were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore MA), stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and de-stained with a solution containing 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid. Individual bands on the membrane were cut out, and their N-terminal sequences were determined by the Edman degradation method, using a Procise HT protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The de-blocking reaction of N-formyl groups was carried out as described previously (31Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Pigment Composition—Pigment compositions were estimated by HPLC analysis with a JASCO GULLIVER series instrument (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). Pigments were extracted with acetone, and the solvent was replaced with chloroform. Samples were injected onto an Inertsil SIL100 column (100 × 4.6 mm, GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) after filtration (0.2 μm). The mobile phase was hexane/2-propanol/methanol (100: 0.8:0.4) with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (32Akiyama M. Miyashita H. Kise H. Watanabe T. Miyachi S. Kobayashi M. Anal. Sci. 2001; 17: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Tomo T. Hirano E. Nagata J. Nakazato K. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 84: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Pigments were detected by a photodiode-array detector (JASCO, MD-915, Tokyo, Japan). A standard solution containing known amounts of authentic α-carotene, Chl a, Chl d, and pheophytin (Pheo) a was used for quantitative calibration. We used published molar extinction coefficients for individual pigments (34Watanabe T. Hongu A. Honda K. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 251-256Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 35French C.S.

Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1995: 13-62Google Scholar). The secondary electron acceptor was determined by HPLC analysis. Quinones were extracted from lyophilized samples with an acetone/methanol mixture, dried in vacuo, and analyzed by HPLC using a polyetherether ketone column packed with ODS (Senshupak, Senshu Science, Tokyo, Japan) (37Patzlaff J.S. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7802-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An authentic sample of quinone purchased from Wako Chemicals Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) was used as a control. Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra—Absorption spectra were measured at 283 K and 80 K using a Cary 500 spectrophotometer with a cryostat for liquid nitrogen temperature (OptistatDN, Oxford Institute, Oxford, UK) and an Oxford ITC-601PT controller. Fluorescence spectra at 77 K were measured using a Hitachi 850 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi, Japan) with a custom-made Dewar system (38Mimuro M. Akimoto S. Yamazaki I. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight 3350, final concentration 15% (w/v)) was added to obtain homogeneous ice at 77 K. The spectral sensitivity of the fluorometer was corrected by using a substandard lamp with a known radiation profile (Hitachi, Japan). Second derivative spectra were obtained by the method of Savitzky and Golay (39Savitzky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (15323) Google Scholar). Measurement of Photosynthetic Electron Transport Activity— PS I-mediated electron transport rates were measured as oxygen uptake by the Mehler reaction, using 1 mm ascorbate, 2 mm diaminodurene, and 2 mm methyl viologen and a Teflon-coated oxygen electrode (Rank Brothers, UK) (40Sun J. Ke A. Jin P. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Light (intensity of 1,800 μmol photons m-2 s-1) from a halogen lamp was guided via a glass fiber (Moritex, Japan). The reaction mixture contained 10% glycerol, 20 mm NaCl, 40 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) and ∼15 μg of Chl d. Measurements of FTIR Spectra—FTIR spectra of the P740+/P740 and P700+/P700 were recorded on a Brucker IFS-66/S spectrophotometer equipped with an MCT detector (D313-L) as described previously (41Okubo T. Tomo T. Sugiura M. Noguchi T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4390-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An aliquot (5.5 μl) of a suspension of the PS I core complexes (∼5.7 mg Chl/ml) in a Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm Tris and 0.05% DM, pH 7.0), mixed with 4 μl of 100 mm sodium ascorbate (adjusted to pH 7.0 by NaOH) and 0.7 μl of benzylviologen, was loaded onto a BaF2 plate (13 mm in diameter). The sample was then lightly dried under N2 gas flow and sandwiched with another BaF2 plate and 0.7 μl of water. The sample temperature was adjusted to 275 K in a liquid N2 cryostat (Oxford DN1704) using an Oxford ITC-5 controller. Spectral measurements were taken for 5 s under both dark and illuminated conditions and were repeated 1000 times. The spectra were averaged to calculate light-minus-dark difference spectra. Light illumination was performed with continuous red light (∼700 μmol photons m-2 s-1 at the sample point) from a halogen lamp (Hoya-Schott HL150) equipped with a red cutoff filter (>600 nm, Toshiba, Japan). The spectral resolution was 4 cm-1. Measurements of the Redox Potential and Light-induced Absorption Change—The P740 redox potential was determined spectroelectrochemically using an optically transparent thin layer electrode (OTTLE) cell by monitoring redox-induced absorbance changes at several wavelengths (22Nakamura A. Suzawa T. Kato Y. Watanabe T. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2273-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Kato Y. Nakamura A. Suzawa T. Watanabe T. Allen J. Gantt E. Golbeck J. Osmond B.

The assembly of the OTTLE cell (optical path length, ∼180 μm), comprised of a gold mesh working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag-AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode, has been described previously (42Nakamura A. Suzawa T. Watanabe T. Chem. Lett. 2004; 33: 688-689Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The electrode potential is hereafter reported against the standard hydrogen electrode (+199 mV versus Ag-AgCl in saturated KCl). For measurement of the light-minus-dark spectra, samples were suspended in 0.03% DM, 1 mm ascorbate, 200 μm methyl viologen, 25 μm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and were illuminated with white light. Light-induced absorbance changes were saturated under our measuring conditions, and the actinic effect of the measuring light and interference of fluorescence was not observed (43Nakamura A. Akai M. Yoshida E. Taki T. Watanabe T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2446-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Time-resolved Fluorescence Spectra (TRFS) and Decay Curves—TRFS were measured by the time-correlated single photon counting method at 77 K (38Mimuro M. Akimoto S. Yamazaki I. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 44Akimoto S. Yokono M. Ohmae M. Yamazaki I. Nagata N. Tanaka R. Tanaka A. Mimuro M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2005; 409: 167-171Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using a custom-made Dewar bottle. The light source was the second harmonic of a titanium:sapphire laser with an excitation wavelength of 425 nm, which gave preferential excitation of the Soret bands of Chl d and Chl a. The time interval of data acquisition was set to 24.4 ps/channel, using a time-to-amplitude converter. Excitation pulses were detected as a pulse with a certain time width, typically 30 ps. Time zero was set as the time when the amplitude of the excitation beam was highest on the time-to-amplitude converter. TRFS was measured in a given wavelength region, and decay curves were measured at several discrete wavelengths. Fluorescence lifetimes were estimated using a convolution calculation (45O'Connor D.V. Phillips D. Time-correlated Single Photon Counting. Academic Press, London1984Google Scholar). Estimation of Charge Distribution by the Density Functional Theory Calculation—All calculations were performed in GAUSSIAN 03 (46Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E.

The coordinates of P700 were adopted from the PS I of T. elongatus (Protein Data Bank 1JB0), and those of the P740 were estimated with replacement of a vinyl group at the C-3 position of Chl a to a formyl group. The phytyl groups of Chl a and Chl d were replaced with hydrogen atoms. The positions of the hydrogen atoms were optimized at HF/6–31G(d) level. Final electronic energies with natural population analysis were calculated at the B3LYP/6–31G(d) level for the optimized structures. These calculations were performed in solvents approximated with IEF-PCM (PCM calculation using the integrated equation formalism model) (47Cancès E. Mennucci B. Tomasi J. J. Chem.

Subunit, Pigment, and Co-factor Composition—PS I complexes of A. marina consist of 11 subunits as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Based on the molecular weight sizes on PAGE, the high molecular weight bands were identified as PsaA, PsaB, PsaD, PsaF, and PsaL, respectively. PsaA/B were also identified by the Western blot analysis (data not shown). Using N-terminal sequence analysis, two subunits (PsaE and PsaC) were identified (Table 1), co-migrating to the same position. PsaJ (band 9), PsaM (band 11), and a newly identified subunit (band 10) were formylated at their N termini. As predicted by the genome analysis (15Swingley W.D. Chen M. Cheung P.C. Conrad A.L.

However, a new subunit with a sequence of MISDILPAIMTPLVV (Table 1) was detected in a low molecular mass region (band 10 in Fig. 1). The new subunit was only poorly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, but an equimolar amount of amino acids was detected by sequence analysis, indicating that this subunit is a real constituent. In conjunction with the genome information, a novel open reading frame encoding a polypeptide with the sequence MISDILPAIMTPLVVLIGGGAAMTAFFYYVEREG was identified. The calculated molecular mass of this formylated subunit was 3675.34. The new subunit was designated Psa27. It is known to PsbW, which stains poorly with Coomassie Blue on PAGE (49Lorković Z.J.

Like PsbW, Psa27 lacks cysteine, histidine, and lysine residues, allowing it to be only poorly stained (49Lorković Z.J. Schröder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K.-D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Proc.

PsaJ and PsaM contain lysine residues, which might account for differences in the degree of stainability.TABLE 1Identification of subunits in purified PSI complexes from A. marina Proteins were identified on the basis of N-terminal sequence, molecular weight, and previous assignment (20Hu Q.

Plasma apolipoprotein (apo) M lacks an external amphipathic motif but, nevertheless, is exclusively associated with lipoproteins (mainly high density lipoprotein). Uniquely, however, apoM is secreted to plasma without cleavage of its hydrophobic NH2-terminal signal peptide. To test whether the signal peptide serves as a lipoprotein anchor for apoM in plasma, we generated mice expressing a mutated apoMQ22A cDNA in the liver (apoMQ22A-Tg mice (transgenic mice)) and compared them with mice expressing wild-type human apoM (apoM-Tg mice). The substitution of the amino acid glutamine 22 with alanine in apoMQ22A results in secretion of human apoM without a signal peptide. The human apoM mRNA level in liver and the amount of human apoM protein secretion from hepatocytes were similar in apoM-Tg and apoMQ22A-Tg mice. Nevertheless, human apoM was not detectable in plasma of apoMQ22A-Tg mice, whereas it was easily measured in the apoM-Tg mice. To examine the plasma metabolism, recombinant apoM lacking the signal peptide was produced in Escherichia coli and injected into wild-type mice. The apoM without signal peptide did not associate with lipoproteins and was rapidly cleared in the kidney. Accordingly, ligation of the kidney arteries in apoMQ22A-Tg mice resulted in rapid accumulation of human apoM in plasma. The data suggest that hydrophobic signal peptide sequences, if preserved upon secretion, can anchor plasma proteins in lipoproteins. In the case of apoM, this mechanism prevents rapid loss by filtration in the kidney. Lipoproteins consist of lipids solubilized by apolipoproteins.

In the case of apoM, this mechanism prevents rapid loss by filtration in the kidney. Lipoproteins consist of lipids (mainly cholesterol, phospholipids, and triglycerides) solubilized by apolipoproteins. The apolipoproteins play essential roles in controlling plasma and tissue lipid homeostasis by interacting with cellular lipoprotein receptors (the low density lipoprotein receptor, the scavenger receptor class B type-I, the ATP-binding cassette transporter AI, etc.) and enzymes (e.g. lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, hepatic lipase, and lipoprotein lipase) and lipid transfer protein (cholesteryl ester transfer protein and phospholipid transfer protein). However, several apolipoproteins have roles beyond lipid metabolism. Indeed, a recent shotgun proteomic approach revealed that HDL 3The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; HRP, haptoglobin-related protein; PON-1, paraoxonase 1; TC, tyramine cellobiose; Tg, transgenic; apo, apolipoprotein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 3The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; HRP, haptoglobin-related protein; PON-1, paraoxonase 1; TC, tyramine cellobiose; Tg, transgenic; apo, apolipoprotein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. on average contains >40 proteins, of which many affect complement activation or protease inhibition (1Vaisar T.

Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Also, several well known HDL apolipoproteins have roles in inflammation and host defense against microbial infections (1Vaisar T. Pennathur S. Green P.S. Gharib S.A. Hoofnagle A.N. Cheung M.C. Byun J. Vuletic S. Kassim S. Singh P. Chea H. Knopp R.H. Brunzell J. Geary R. Chait A. Zhao X.Q. Elkon K. Marcovina S. Ridker P. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). For instance, apoL is involved in fighting Trypanosoma infections (2Vanhamme L. Paturiaux-Hanocq F. Poelvoorde P. Nolan D.P. Lins L. Van Den A.J. Pays A. Tebabi P. Van X.H. Jacquet A. Moguilevsky N. Dieu M. Kane J.P. De B.P. Brasseur R. Pays E. Nature. 2003; 422: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and apoJ (clusterin) has even been proposed to play a significant role in tumorigenesis (3Trougakos I.P. Gonos E.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1430-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For apolipoproteins without any (known) effect on plasma lipid metabolism, it is conceivable that the host HDL particle mainly serves as a carrier that prevents rapid removal of its associated apolipoproteins (e.g. by filtration in the kidney) or perhaps aids in their assembly at sites of inflammation. The structural motifs conferring the lipid-binding capacity of apolipoproteins has been most intensively studied for apoB in low density lipoprotein (4Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De L.H. Dashti N. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1346-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and apoA-I in HDL (5Davidson W.S. Silva R.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Davidson W.S. Hazlett T. Mantulin W.W. Jonas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of apoA-I and several other HDL apolipoproteins (e.g. apoE and the apoCs), the non-covalent binding of the amphipathic α-helixes are rather weak, allowing exchange of the apolipoproteins between the triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein and chylomicron particles and HDL (8Atkinson D. Small D.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Indeed, some apolipoproteins are so loosely bound to HDL (e.g. apoJ (9Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), apoA-IV (10Christoffersen C.

J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 1135-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that they are often stripped from the lipoprotein particles during preparative ultracentrifugation. ApoM (188 amino acids) was discovered in 1999 by Xu and Dahlback (12Xu N. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31286-31290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In plasma, apoM is exclusively found in association with lipoproteins (mainly HDL). Recent studies of mice with genetically modified apoM expression showed that apoM affects plasma HDL metabolism and development of atherosclerosis (10Christoffersen C. Jauhiainen M. Moser M. Porse B.

Med. 2005; 11: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), but apoM also has antioxidant effects, and its physiological roles remain to be determined (10Christoffersen C. Jauhiainen M.

Analysis of the tertiary structure of apoM by in silico homology modeling has revealed that apoM belongs to the lipocalin protein superfamily (14Duan J. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Like in other lipocalins, the structure of apoM contains eight antiparallel β-sheets forming a small lipid-binding pocket. Recent experimental data confirmed the lipocalin structure of apoM and showed that it can bind retinoic acid and retinol (15Ahnstrom J. Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1754-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Human apoM can be glycosylated at amino acid Asn-135 surrounded by the glycosylation signal Asn-Glu-Thr (12Xu N. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31286-31290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Hence, Western blotting of SDS-PAGE gels with reduced human plasma samples typically reveals both glycosylated apoM and a non-glycosylated apoM of ∼25 and ∼20 kDa (9Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Xu N. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31286-31290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The predicted structure of apoM lacks external amphipathic motifs that would explain the lipoprotein association of apoM. NH2-sequencing of plasma apoM has shown that it is secreted to the blood with its NH2-terminal signal peptide (12Xu N. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31286-31290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This is unusual because intracellular cleavage of the NH2-terminal signal peptide by signal peptidases in the endoplasmic reticulum conventionally is seen as a prerequisite for cellular release of proteins to plasma. We are, however, aware of at least two other plasma proteins with preserved NH2-terminal signal peptides, i.e. paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) (16Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C. Billecke S. La Du B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and haptoglobin-related protein (HRP) (17Raper J. Fung R. Ghiso J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like apoM, PON-1 and HRP are mainly found in a subfraction of HDL (although not the same HDL subfraction as that with apoM (9Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)), and in vitro studies suggest that the signal peptide in PON-1 can mediate its association with lipoproteins (16Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C. Billecke S. La Du B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and the highly hydrophobic nature of the signal peptide, we hypothesized that the signal peptide serves as an anchor for apoM in plasma lipoprotein particles. To test this idea and explore the impact of the signal peptide on the metabolism of plasma apoM, we generated transgenic mice that express a mutated human apoMQ22A cDNA in the liver. The cDNA encodes a mutated human apoMQ22A protein where glutamine in position 22 is replaced by alanine. The Gln-22 → Ala substitution results in secretion of apoM without its hydrophobic signal peptide (15Ahnstrom J. Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1754-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mice expressing apoMQ22A were compared with transgenic mice expressing wild-type human apoM. ApoM-Tg and apoMQ22A-Tg Mice—Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing a truncated human apoM protein without the signal peptide were generated. Site-directed mutagenesis resulting in substitution of amino acid Gln-22 with Ala in human apoM (apoMQ22A) was done previously (15Ahnstrom J. Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1754-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Secretion of apoMQ22A cDNA from transfected HEK293 cells was assessed as described (15Ahnstrom J. Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1754-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) by Western blotting (9Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O.

Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1772-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A 774-bp fragment of the apoMQ22A-encoding cDNA was amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase system (Stratagene, AH Diagnostic) and primers (pcDNA3-apoMQ22A-51:5′-gcggccgcactggcggccgttactagtggat-3′ and pcDNA3-apoMQ22A-31:5′-gcggccgcgcagtaggtgtccaccatgttcc-3′) and cloned into a PCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen A/S). The ApoMQ22A encoding cDNA was subsequently cloned into a pGEMAlbSV40 vector (obtained from Ragnar Matsson, Lund University) between a murine albumin promotor/enhancer sequence and an SV40 intron/poly(A) sequence. The correctness of apoMQ22A encoding cDNA was verified by DNA sequencing (primers will be given by request). The 4446-bp albumin-apoMQ22A-SV40 fragment was purified from the plasmid by restriction digestion with Nsi and ApaI, agarose gel electrophoresis and the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen-Nordic) and used for pronuclear microinjections into fertilized mouse oocytes (C57/Bl X CBA) at the Transgenic Core Facility, University of Lund, Sweden. Human apoMQ22A transgenic founders were identified by real-time PCR amplification (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostic) of a 175-bp fragment of human APOM from tail DNA with primers h-apoM-51 and h-apoM-31 (10Christoffersen C.

The human apoM-transgenic mice expressing wild-type human apoM (apoM-Tg) were described recently elsewhere (as apoM-TgN mice (10Christoffersen C. Jauhiainen M. Moser M. Porse B. Ehnholm C. Boesl M.

Both apoM-Tg and apoMQ22A-Tg mice were backcrossed with C57Bl/6 mice for at least five generations before the present studies. The mice were housed at the Panum Institute (University of Copenhagen) and fed standard chow (Altromin 1314, Brogaarden). Blood samples were taken from the venous plexus in the orbital cavity into Na2EDTA- or heparin-containing tubes and kept on ice. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at -80 °C or -20 °C. All procedures were approved by the Animal Experiments Inspectorate, Ministry of Justice, Denmark. mRNA Quantification—RNA was isolated from frozen tissue (-80 °C) with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and examined on an RNA Nano LabChip (Agilent Technologies). First-strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR analysis with a LightCycler was performed as described (19Bartels E.D. Lauritsen M. Nielsen L.B.

Quantification of Human apoM—Human wild-type apoM and recombinant human apoM22–188 were measured with a sandwich ELISA employing two monoclonal antibodies against human apoM (18Axler O. Ahnstrom J.

Mouse apoM was detected with a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse apoM antiserum (1:500) (10Christoffersen C. Jauhiainen M. Moser M. Porse B. Ehnholm C. Boesl M. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. J. Biol.

Primary Hepatocyte Cell Culture—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from ApoM-TgN, ApoMQ22A-Tg, and wild-type mice (21Sabol S.L. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2151-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were perfused with 5 ml of liver perfusion medium (Invitrogen) followed by 5 ml of digestion medium containing 4 mg/ml collagenase type I (C2624, Sigma-Aldrich). The liver was then placed in a sterile tube with 5 ml of digestion medium at 37 °C for 20 min before being placed in ice-cold L-15 cell medium (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the tissue was homogenized with a Pasteur pipette, passed through a 70-μm nylon filter, and washed with hepatocyte washing medium (Invitrogen). Centrifugation between washes was done at 50 × g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 5 ml of F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10% bovine calf serum, and 2 mm l-glutamine (G6392, Sigma-Aldrich) and grown on 6-well collagen-coated plates (152034, Nunc). The concentration of human apoM in cell culture medium was measured after 48 h. Lipoproteins (d < 1.21 g/ml) were separated from non-lipoproteins in plasma or concentrated (×4) cell culture medium by adjusting 20 μl of sample to d = 1.21 g/ml with NaBr and ultracentrifugation in a TLA-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman) using 200-μl tubes at 15 °C for 4 h and 100,000 rpm. Plasma Turnover and Tissue Elimination of Human apoM22–188—To study the plasma turnover of apoM without the signal peptide, recombinant apoM22–188 or wild-type human apoM were injected intravenously into recipient wild-type mice, and the plasma turnover was assessed by measuring human apoM plasma concentrations with ELISA. Recombinant human apoM22–188 was produced as described (18Axler O. Ahnstrom J. Dahlback B. J.

For each recipient mouse, apoM22–188 (100 μg) in 148 μl of phosphate-buffered saline was mixed with 90 μl of plasma from a wild-type mouse and injected intravenously into a wild-type mouse (n = 3); control mice (n = 3) received 148 μl of phosphate-buffered saline mixed with 90 μl of plasma from human apoM-Tg mice that overexpress human apoM 10-fold (10Christoffersen C.

Blood samples were taken after 5, 30, 120, and 1400 min for measurement of human apoM. To assess the lipoprotein association of human apoM, lipoproteins (d < 1.21 g/ml) were separated from proteins in plasma samples taken after 30 min as described, above and the human apoM concentration was determined in the fractions by ELISA. To determine tissue uptake and degradation, we labeled apoM22–188 or albumin with 125I-TC and injected it into wild-type mice. The 125I-TC moiety is trapped inside cells upon lysosomal degradation of the labeled protein, enabling in vivo studies of degradation sites of plasma proteins (22Pittman R.C. Carew T.E. Glass C.K. Green S.R. Taylor Jr., C.A. Attie A.D. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). First, tyramine cellobiose (TC) (50 nmol) was labeled with 37 MBq 125I in tubes coated with 10 μg of Iodogen (Invitrogen) (23Juul K. Nielsen L.B. Munkholm K. Stender S. Nordestgaard B.G. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1698-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Then, the 125I-labeled TC was activated and coupled to 100–120 μg of apoM22–188 or albumin at pH 9–10. To separate the unbound 125I and 125I-TC from 125I-TC-albumin and 125I-TC-apoM22–188, the mixture was passed over a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The labeling efficiency was 34% for apoM22–188 and 22% for albumin, and 91 and 86% of the 125I in the doses were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid for apoM22–188 and albumin, respectively. The integrity of the labeled proteins was examined by 12% SDS-PAGE, and visualization of the radioactivity was done with a Fujix BAS 200 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). The concentration of 125I-TC-labeled proteins was determined by the BCA Pierce kit (Pierce), and 125I-TC-apoM22–188 or 125I-TC-albumin (10 μg, 3.2–5.3 × 106 cpm) was injected into a tail vein of wild-type mice (n = 2 × 3) in a total volume of 330 μl. Blood samples were taken 10 min and 6 h after injection before the mice were anesthetized and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline. Plasma samples and biopsies from liver, kidney, lung, spleen, eyes, heart, brain, gut, and gall bladder were placed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and counted in a 1470 automatic gamma counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min. To examine the cellular distribution of labeled apoM22–188, 1-μm Epon sections were obtained from kidneys fixed by immersion in 4% formalin 6 h after injection of labeled protein. The tissue was postfixed in OsO4, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812. The Epon sections were processed for autoradiography using Ilford K2 emulsion, exposed for 1–4 weeks, and developed in Kodak D19. The sections were examined in a Leica DMR microscope equipped with a Leica DFC320 camera. Images were transferred by a Leica TFC Twain 6.1.0 program and processed using Adobe PhotoShop 8.0. Exclusion of Kidney Elimination of Plasma Proteins—To exclude kidney elimination of plasma proteins, apoMQ22A-Tg (n = 6), apoM-TgN (n = 3), and wild-type mice (n = 3), animals were anesthetized, and the kidney was dissected free as described previously (24Bro S. Moeller F. Andersen C.B. Olgaard K. Nielsen L.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1495-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to enable bilateral ligation of the kidney artery. The musculofascial and skin incisions were then sutured, and the animals were given buprenorphine (0.001 mg/10 g of body, subcutaneously) for analgesia while kept anesthetized for another 4 h. Blood samples were taken before and 1 and 4 h after the kidney artery ligation. Expression of ApoMQ22A in Transgenic Mice—To examine the impact of the signal peptide sequences on the metabolism of apoM, we used a mutated human apoMQ22A cDNA driven by albumin enhancer-promoter sequences to make Tg mice. The Gln-22 → Ala substitution introduces a signal peptidase cleavage site and results in secretion of a truncated apoM without the signal peptide from HEK293 cells (Fig. 1a). Twelve founders were generated by pronuclear injection of the transgene into fertilized mouse eggs. One transgenic line with an estimated ∼32 copies of the transgene was bred for further studies and compared with Tg mice expressing wild-type human apoM (10Christoffersen C. Jauhiainen M. Moser M. Porse B. Ehnholm C. Boesl M. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 283: 1839-1847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The apoMQ22A-Tg mice thrived well, bred normally, and were indistinguishable from wild-type mice. The liver expression of human apoM mRNA in the apoMQ22A-Tg mice was ∼40% of that in apoM-Tg mice (Fig. 1b). However, on Western blotting of mouse plasma with a human apoM-specific polyclonal antibody, apoM was only detectable in the apoM-Tg and not in apoMQ22A-Tg mice (Fig. 1c). Of note, the polyclonal anti-human apoM antibody recognized recombinant apoM22–188 as well as wild-type human apoM (Fig. 1c). This implies that the lack of apoM in apoMQ22A-Tg mouse plasma does not reflect the lack of reactivity of the antibodies toward truncated apoM. In agreement with the Western blotting results, human apoM could not be detected in the plasma from apoMQ22A-Tg mice with a human apoM-specific sandwich ELISA when the plasma was diluted as little as 50 times. The ELISA uses two different monoclonal antibodies to human apoM and reacts well with both wild-type human apoM and recombinant apoM without the signal peptide sequences (Fig. 1e). The detection limit is ∼0.3 nm. Hence, the concentration of human apoM in apoMQ22A-Tg mice is <15 nm. In contrast, the concentration of human apoM is ∼2 μm in the human apoM-Tg mice. The absence of detectable apoMQ22A in plasma was also seen in analyses of eight additional apoMQ22A-Tg founders and thus was not dependent on the site of transgene integration in the mouse genome. Overexpression of human apoM had no discernable effect on the plasma levels of endogenous mouse apoM (Fig. 1d). Since apoMQ22A is secreted from transfected HEK293 cells, we reasoned that the absence of apoMQ22A in the apoMQ22A-Tg mouse plasma most likely did not reflect impaired secretion from the mouse liver. To test this assumption, primary hepatocytes from apoMQ22A-Tg, apoM-Tg, and wild-type mice were grown in tissue culture plates. Analysis of the medium by ELISA (Fig. 2) and Western blotting (not shown) showed that human apoM was secreted into the medium from both apoMQ22A-Tg and apoM-Tg hepatocytes. The concentration of apoMQ22A in the medium was ∼40% of that of wild-type human apoM. Hence, the relative rate of secretion of apoMQ22A and wild-type human apoM from the cultured hepatocytes was similar to the relative amount of apoMQ22A and wild-type human apoM mRNA expression in the liver. The virtual absence of apoMQ22A in plasma despite ample secretion from the liver suggested that the lack of the signal peptide might cause rapid clearance of apoMQ22A from plasma because apoMQ22A cannot associate with plasma lipoproteins. Impact of the Signal Peptide on Plasma Metabolism of apoM—To explore the impact of the signal peptide on the plasma metabolism of apoM, we produced a recombinant truncated human apoM22–188 without the signal peptide (corresponding to amino acids 22–188 of wild-type human apoM) in Escherichia coli and injected it (100 μg) into wild-type mice. ELISA measurements showed that apoM22–188 was rapidly cleared from plasma with only ∼5% of the injected dose remaining in plasma 2 h after the injection (Fig. 3a). We also examined the plasma metabolism of wild-type human apoM by injecting plasma from apoM-Tg mice into wild-type mice; the clearance of wild-type human apoM was much slower than that of apoM22–188 with ∼50 and ∼5% of the injected wild-type human apoM remaining in plasma after 2 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 3a). To analyze the lipoprotein association of apoM22–188, lipoproteins were separated from the remaining plasma proteins by ultracentrifugation at d = 1.21 g/ml using plasma collected 30 min after injection of apoM22–188 or wild-type human apoM particles. ApoM22–188 was recovered in the protein fraction, whereas wild-type human apoM predominantly was in the lipoprotein fraction (Fig. 3b). Due to the small size (∼20 kDa) and the lack of lipoprotein association of apoM22–188, we suspected that it would be rapidly removed by filtration in the kidney. We could, however, not detect any human apoM in the urine of apoMQ22A-Tg mice by ELISA or Western blotting, suggesting that if the kidney was a primary site for removal of apoM without the signal peptide, then the filtered apoM might be taken up in the proximal tubule rather than being excreted into the urine. Indeed, we previously showed that the endocytotic receptor megalin, which is highly expressed on the luminal side of the proximal tubule epithelium, can bind and internalize apoM (26Faber K. Hvidberg V. Moestrup S.K. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To explore the tissue sites for uptake and degradation of apoM22–188, we labeled apoM22–188 with 125I-TC and injected it into wild-type mice. Parallel studies were done with human albumin. 125I-TC labeling did not affect the integrity of apoM22–188 or albumin as both proteins migrated as one band with the expected size in SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 4a). Similar to non-labeled apoM22–188, 125I-TC-apoM22–188 was rapidly removed from plasma (Fig. 4b). Six hours after injection, the main portion of the 125I-TC-apoM22–188 was recovered in the kidney, whereas 125I-TC-albumin was recovered in the plasma, liver, and kidney (Fig. 4c). To examine which cells had taken up 125I-TC-apoM22–188, sections of the recipient mouse kidneys were subjected to autoradiography. The vast proportion of 125I in the kidney was seen in proximal tubule epithelial cells, whereas only a few grains were seen in glomerular cells or distal tubules (Fig. 4d). The rapid plasma elimination and uptake by kidney proximal tubule cells of human apoM22–188 were reiterated when using 125I-TC-labeled recombinant mouse apoM without its signal peptide sequences (data not shown). The turnover studies using recombinant apoM22–188 suggested that the absence of human apoM in the plasma of apoMQ22A-Tg mice reflects rapid removal of apoMQ22A in the kidney and that human apoM would accumulate in the plasma of the apoMQ22A-Tg mice if kidney elimination were prevented. To test this idea, we excluded kidney degradation of plasma proteins by bilateral ligation of the renal arteries in anesthetized apoMQ22A-Tg, apoM-Tg, and wild-type mice and measured human apoM in plasma with ELISA. Indeed, human apoM became detectable in plasma of the apoMQ22A-Tg mice already 1 h after eliminating kidney excretion (Fig. 5), which strongly supports the conclusion that apoM can be secreted from the liver without its signal peptide but that the lack of signal peptide results in rapid elimination of the truncated plasma protein by the kidney. The concentration of human apoM in apoM-Tg mice did not increase after bilateral ligation of the kidney arteries (Fig. 5). The NH2-terminal signal peptide plays important roles in the intracellular processing of proteins. It can determine protein folding (e.g. EspP (27Szabady R.L. Peterson J.H. Skillman K.M. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) and direct proteins into specific secretory pathways (e.g. pro-opiomelanocortin (28Cool D.R. Fenger M. Snell C.R. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8723-8729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) or cellular compartments (e.g. PB2 of the influenza virus is directed to the mitochondria (29Carr S.M. Carnero E. Garcia-Sastre A. Brownlee G.G. Fodor E. Virology. 2006; 344: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). Also, the hydrophobic nature of the signal peptide can anchor proteins in the cell membrane. Failure of cleavage of the signal peptide of proteins that are normally secreted can result in intracellular degradation (30Kostova Z. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, human wild-type apoM and human apoMQ22A appeared to be equally effectively secreted from primary mouse hepatocytes. The results suggest that the signal peptide is responsible for apoM's lipoprotein association and is crucial to prevent rapid clearance of apoM from plasma. The present in vivo findings are in accord with a recent in vitro observation by Axler et al. (25Axler O. Ahnstrom J. Dahlback B. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that apoMQ22A fails to associate with HDL in the culture medium when expressed in HEK293 cells. ApoM shares its preservation of the NH2-terminal signal peptide sequences with PON-1 and HRP (16Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C. Billecke S. La Du B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 17Raper J. Fung R. Ghiso J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In plasma, all three proteins are mainly in the HDL fraction. The apoM-containing HDL fraction is not enriched in PON-1 and HRP (9Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and HRP is mainly part of an HDL subfraction named the trypanosome lytic complex, which also contains apoA-I and apoL (17Raper J. Fung R. Ghiso J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Vanhollebeke B. Nielsen M.J. Watanabe Y. Truc P. Vanhamme L. Nakajima K. Moestrup S.K. Pays E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4118-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the signal peptides do not anchor the three proteins to the same HDL subfraction. Ovalbumin (32Palmiter R.D. Gagnon J. Walsh K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and PAI-2 (33Ye R.D. Wun T.C. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4869-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are also secreted without cleavage of their signal peptides. However, in those cases, the signal peptide sequences are not at the NH2 terminus of the proteins, and the hydrophobic residues are embedded in the three-dimensional structures of the proteins (34von H.G. Liljestrom P. Mikus P. Andersson H. Ny T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15240-15243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, neither ovalbumin nor PAI-2 is lipoprotein-bound. In silico sequence analyses using the signalP software predict that the preservation of the signal peptides in apoM and PON-1 results from the lack of a signal peptide cleavage site and, for both proteins, single amino acid substitutions can result in removal of the signal peptide prior to secretion (15Ahnstrom J. Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1754-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C. Billecke S. La Du B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In the case of HRP, however, the signalP software predicts that the signal peptide can be cleaved, and in vitro expression in 293 cells of an HRP encoding cDNA showed that the major fraction of HRP indeed is secreted from the cultured cells without the signal peptide (35Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Moller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, plasma HRP does contain the signal peptide. The present data provide a possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy; even if only a subfraction of HRP is secreted with the signal peptide sequences, the anchoring of HRP with the signal peptide in HDL may prevent clearance from plasma, whereas HRP without the signal peptide (∼35 kDa) predictably will be rapidly removed from plasma. The physiological role of apoM remains to be elucidated. Genetic elimination or overexpression of apoM in mice affects plasma lipid metabolism (10Christoffersen C. Jauhiainen M. Moser M. Porse B. Ehnholm C. Boesl M. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 283: 1839-1847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Wolfrum C. Poy M.N. Stoffel M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and in healthy humans, the plasma apoM concentration is positively associated with total cholesterol concentration (18Axler O. Ahnstrom J. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1772-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, apoM may have roles beyond lipid metabolism; HDL carries multiple proteins with roles in inflammation and innate immune responses, and HDL has pronounced anti-inflammatory effects in animal models (1Vaisar T. Pennathur S. Green P.S. Gharib S.A. Hoofnagle A.N. Cheung M.C. Byun J. Vuletic S. Kassim S. Singh P. Chea H. Knopp R.H. Brunzell J. Geary R. Chait A. Zhao X.Q. Elkon K. Marcovina S. Ridker P.

Res. 2004; 95: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that apoM, only being present in ∼5% of the plasma HDL particles (9Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), may also have effects unrelated to lipid metabolism. For instance, apoM protects against Cu2+-induced lipid oxidation (9Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 10Christoffersen C. Jauhiainen M. Moser M. Porse B. Ehnholm C. Boesl M. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. J.

Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1754-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The latter observation is explained by the lipocalin structure of apoM where a small hydrophobic binding pocket enables binding of small lipophilic molecules (14Duan J. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that apoM is also found in a highly conserved major histocompatibility complex class III cluster in primitive organisms such as fish, indicating conservation of the cluster for more than 450 million years (37Deakin J.E. Papenfuss A.T. Belov K. Cross J.G. Coggill P. Palmer S. Sims S. Speed T.P. Beck S. Graves J.A. BMC. Genomics. 2006; 7: 281Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), further suggesting that apoM may have essential biological functions. The present data document that the signal peptide in apoM serves an important function by anchoring the apolipoprotein to lipoproteins, thus inhibiting the elimination of apoM in the kidney and maintaining stable apoM concentrations in plasma.

We previously demonstrated that the β isoform of 14-3-3 proteins promotes tumorigenicity and angiogenesis of rat hepatoma K2 cells. In this study, to analyze the mechanism of 14-3-3β-induced malignant transformation, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed, and a novel 14-3-3β-binding factor, FBI1 (fourteen-three-three beta interactant 1), was identified. In vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation analyses verified specific interaction of 14-3-3β with FBI1. The strong expression of FBI1 was observed in several tumor cell lines but not in non-tumor cell lines. Forced expression of antisense FBI1 in K2 cells inhibited anchorage-independent growth but had no significant effect on cell proliferation in monolayer culture. Down-regulation of FBI1 also inhibited tumorigenicity and metastasis accompanying a decrease in MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) expression. In addition, the duration of ERK1/2 activation was curtailed in antisense FBI1-expressing K2 cells. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that the FBI1-14-3-3β complex could act as a transcriptional silencer, and MKP-1 (MAPK phosphatase-1) was one of the target genes of the FBI1-14-3-3β complex. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that FBI1 and 14-3-3β were presented on the MKP-1 promoter. These results indicate that FBI1 promotes sustained ERK1/2 activation through repression of MKP-1 transcription, resulting in promotion of tumorigenicity and metastasis.

The 14-3-3 family is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed protein family (1Aitken A.

In mammals, there are at least seven isoforms: β, γ, ϵ, σ, ζ, τ, and η. The 14-3-3 proteins form homo- and heterodimers that can interact with a variety of cellular proteins. The 14-3-3 proteins are phosphoserine/threonine-binding proteins. These interactions control the enzyme activities, subcellular localization, and protein-protein interactions of target proteins. 14-3-3 proteins regulate many cellular processes, including the cell cycle, metabolism, signal transduction, malignant transformation, and apoptosis. More than 100 binding partners have been identified. Although target proteins show a distinct preference for particular isoforms of 14-3-3 (4Aitken A. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 50: 993-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the functional specificity of 14-3-3 isoforms is still not completely understood. In contrast to 14-3-3σ, which is known as a tumor suppressor gene (5Hermeking H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 6Hermeking H. Benzinger A. Semin.

Carcinogenesis. 2001; 21: 2073-2077Crossref Google Scholar) also reported that overexpression of 14-3-3β in NIH3T3 cells confers tumorigenicity in nude mice via the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DBD, DNA binding domain; FCS, fetal calf serum; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; CM, conditioned medium. 2The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DBD, DNA binding domain; FCS, fetal calf serum; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; CM, conditioned medium. cascade. Thus, these data support the idea that 14-3-3β could function as an oncogene and has a unique function among the 14-3-3 families; however, the molecular mechanisms of 14-3-3β-induced carcinogenesis are poorly understood. The MAPK pathway plays an important role in diverse cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, metastasis, and survival (reviewed in Refs. 12Ebisuya M. Kondoh K. Nishida E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem.

In response to various extracellular stimuli, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are activated by sequential phosphorylation. Activated ERKs phosphorylate and activate down-stream kinases and transcriptional regulators. Activated ERKs induce rapid transcriptional activation of immediate early genes and control the cell cycle and cell survival. Recent studies have demonstrated that differences in the duration, strength, and subcellular localization of ERK activities determined signal specificity (12Ebisuya M. Kondoh K. Nishida E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In addition, many studies have identified factors that may regulate the duration, strength, and subcellular localization of ERK activities. These factors contain the cell surface receptor density, the expression of scaffold proteins, and the interplay between kinases and phosphatases. Mutations in key components that result in sustained ERK activation correlate with carcinogenesis (14Downward J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2496) Google Scholar). For example, human tumors frequently express Ras proteins that have been activated by point mutation (15Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, abnormal activation of ERKs is implicated in the malignant transformation. In this study, to further analyze the oncogenic function of 14-3-3β, we screened K2 cell and rat brain cDNA libraries using the yeast two-hybrid system with 14-3-3β as a bait. One of the novel cDNA clones we isolated was designated FBI1 (fourteen-three-three beta interactant 1). We established that K2 cells down-regulated the FBI1 transcript by the introduction of an antisense FBI1 cDNA expression vector. Tumors that were formed in the flanks of nude mice by these transfectants were much smaller, and lung metastasis was robustly reduced compared with those of the parental cells. In antisense FBI1 K2 transfectants, the expression level of MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) mRNA was reduced, whereas the expression of MKP-1 (MAPK phosphatase) was substantially up-regulated by serum stimulation. Analysis with a luciferase reporter assay using rat MKP-1 promoter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) implied that the FBI1-14-3-3β complex could act as a transcriptional repressor against the MKP-1 promoter in K2 cells. Thus, these results show that the FBI1-14-3-3β complex plays an important role in malignant transformation through its transcriptional regulation activity. Cell Culture—K2 cells established from aflatoxin B1-induced rat hepatoma were cultivated as described previously (9Morimura S. Tashiro F. Ueno Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1990; 38: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Rat hepatomas (AH60tc, AH70Btc, dRLa74, and dRLh84), rat glioblastoma C6, adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12, Balb, rat embryonic fibroblast REF52, and COS-7 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The open reading frame of rat 14-3-3β cDNA was inserted into pAS2-1 (Clontech) in-frame with the coding sequence of GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) and used for yeast two-hybrid screening as a bait vector. K2 cell and rat brain cDNA fragments were inserted into pACT2 (Clontech) in-frame with the coding sequence of the GAL4 activation domain. The FBI1 single and multiple point mutants were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene-Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (16Akiyama H. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Takanabe N. Sugiyama A. Tashiro F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10752-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assay—To prepare GST-FBI1 fusion protein, an FBI1 cDNA fragment was inserted into the expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the coding sequence of GST (pGEX-2T/FBI1). pGEX-2T/FBI1 was introduced into Escherichia coli JM109, and the fusion protein synthesized was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described by Kaelin et al. (17Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Proteins labeled with 35S were synthesized by the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). GST fusion protein (20 μg) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 35S-labeled protein (20 μl) in 0.4 ml of binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm NaF, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with the binding buffer, the retained proteins were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—Proteins were isolated from K2 cells using TNM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). For the immunoprecipitation study, protein extracts were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads charged with anti-FBI1 antibody or mouse normal serum at 4 °C for 3 h. After washing with TNM buffer containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40, proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (18Urano Y. Iiduka M. Sugiyama A. Akiyama H. Uzawa K. Matsumoto G. Kawasaki Y. Tashiro F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7498-7514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Anti-14-3-3β (1:800 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-FBI1 (1:100) antibodies were used. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNAs were prepared from various cell lines and Fisher 344 rat tissues by the acidic guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method. Northern blotting was performed as described previously (16Akiyama H. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Takanabe N. Sugiyama A. Tashiro F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10752-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Stable Transfections—Antisense FBI1 expression vector was constructed by the insertion of an FBI1 cDNA fragment into the pcDNA3 expression vector (pcDNA3-AS-FBI1). K2 cells were transfected with antisense FBI1 expression vector or empty vector using DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 2 weeks of selection with 1 mg/ml G418 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), resistant clones were expanded and analyzed for the expression level of antisense FBI1 RNA by Northern blotting. Growth and Colonization in Vitro—Cells (4 × 104) were plated in 24-well plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and cultivated for various times. The cell number was counted using a TATAI hematocytometer. Soft agar assay was performed as described previously (8Sugiyama A. Miyagi Y. Komiya Y. Kurabe N. Kitanaka C. Kato N. Nagashima Y. Kuchino Y. Tashiro F. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Tumorigenicity and Lung Metastasis—Cells (1 × 107/200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/flank) were inoculated subcutaneously into 5-week-old athymic mice (BALB/c Jcl nu/nu; Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan). After 24 days, tumor volumes were calculated as (short axis2 × long axis)/2. Thirty-one days after the injection, the lungs were removed to investigate metastatic foci. The metastatic ability was estimated by counting foci in whole mount samples. For the assay of lung metastasis, cells (1 × 106 cells/200 μl of serum-free medium) were injected into the tail vein of nude mice. After 7 weeks, metastatic foci formed in the lungs were investigated by measuring the lung weight. Mouse care and handling conformed to the National Institutes of Health guidelines for animal research. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNAs were prepared from K2 and its antisense FBI1 transfectants as described above. Reverse transcription (RT) reactions were performed using total RNAs and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The RT reaction mixtures were subjected to PCR amplification using the specific primers as follows: rat mmp-9, 5′-TGG CTC TAG GCT ACA GCT TTG CTG C-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-CGA AGG AGT CAT CGA TCA CGT CTC G-3′ (3′-primer) (GenBank™ accession number NM_031055); rat mkp-1, 5′-CCA TGG TGA TGG AGG TGG GCA TCC T-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-CCT TCA GCA GCT CGG AGA GGT TGT G-3′ (3′-primer) (GenBank™ accession number NM_053769); rat cyclin D1, 5′-TGG AGC CCC TGA AGA AGA G-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-AAG TGC GTT GTG CGG TAG C-3′ (3′-primer) (GenBank™ accession number NM_171992); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GGC AGT GAT GGC ATG GAC TGT-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-CCC ATC ACC ATC TTC CAG GAG-3′ (3′-primer) (GenBank™ accession number NM_017008). Gelatin Zymography—When cells were grown semiconfluently, the media were changed to serum-free medium and cultivated for an additional 18 h. The resulting conditioned media (CMs) were lyophilized, resuspended in the loading buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1 mg/ml gelatin without denaturation. The gels were then soaked in the washing buffer (2.5% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) to remove SDS and incubated in the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm CaCl2) at 37 °C for 18 h. The gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and destained with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid (v/v) to detect the gelatinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. Activation of ERK1/2 and Induction of MKP-1—Cells were starved of serum for 12 h prior to stimulation with 10% FCS-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Various times after serum stimulation, the cells were lysed in TNM buffer, and 2-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v). Western blotting was performed as described previously (16Akiyama H. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Takanabe N. Sugiyama A. Tashiro F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10752-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Anti-pERK1/2 (1:2000; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-ERK1/2 (1:2000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-MKP-1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-actin (1:500; Sigma) antibodies were used. Subcellular Localization of FBI1I—K2 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged FBI1 or enhanced green fluorescent protein-fused FBI1 expression vector. After 36 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with anti-FLAG (1:500; Sigma) or anti-14-3-3β (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies and visualized with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200; Sigma). The cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 to visualize the nuclei. Luciferase Reporter Assay—A luciferase reporter construct (pGAL4-TK-Luc) and GAL4DBD expression vector (pcDNA3GAL4DBD) were constructed as described previously (16Akiyama H. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Takanabe N. Sugiyama A. Tashiro F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10752-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The GAL4DBD-fused FBI1 expression vector was constructed by the insertion of the FBI1 open reading frame inframe downstream of the GAL4DBD-coding sequence in pcDNA3GAL4DBD and was designated as pGAL4DBD-FBI1. Antisense 14-3-3β RNA expression vector (pcDNA3-AS-14-3-3β) was constructed as described previously (8Sugiyama A. Miyagi Y. Komiya Y. Kurabe N. Kitanaka C. Kato N. Nagashima Y. Kuchino Y. Tashiro F. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For each transfection, 3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish were transfected with 0.25 μg of pGAL4-TK-Luc, 0.25 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His/lacZ (Invitrogen), and a total of 1.75 μg of pcDNA3GAL4DBD and pGAL4DBD-FBI1 in various combinations. pcDNA3-AS-14-3-3β was also cotransfected in various combinations with pGAL4DBD-FBI1. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were lysed with the lysis buffer of the luciferase assay kit (Promega), and luciferase activities were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Luminous CT9000D fluorescent photometer (Dia Iatron, Tokyo, Japan). Reporter gene activities were normalized using β-galactosidase activity as an internal control. Luciferase reporter gene plasmids driven by the rat MKP-1 promoter were constructed as follows. The rat MKP-1 promoters were amplified by PCR using K2 cell genomic DNA and introduced into pTRE-Luc vector (Clontech) and designated as -631Luc. The plasmids, -210Luc, -114Luc, and -90Luc, were generated by cloning the region of the MKP-1 gene extending from -210, -144, or -90 to +240. The primer sequences used were as follows: mkp-1 promoter, 5′-CTT CTC GAG CAA CCC TCC TCC CTT TG-3′ (5′-primer for -631Luc), 5′-GGA GGA TCC GAC AAT CCA GAA GCA G-3′ (5′-primer for -210Luc), 5′-ATA TAC TCG AGC CGG TCA CGT GTC CG-3′ (5′-primer for -114Luc), 5′-CCA CTC GAG CAA ACA AAC CGT TCC CC-3′ (5′-primer for -90Luc), and 5′-TTT CTC GAG CCA GCG CTC AAA GCC G-3′ (3′-primer) (GenBank™ accession number AF357203). Transfection and detection of luciferase activities were performed as described above. ChIP Analysis—K2 cells were starved of serum for 12 h prior to stimulation with 10% FCS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Various times after serum stimulation, the cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. The nuclear fraction was isolated and sonicated to shear genomic chromatin. Chromatin extracts were precleaned with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with 1 μg of anti-FBI1, anti-14-3-3β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added to the mixture for 1 h, and immunoprecipitated DNA-protein complexes were isolated from beads after several washing steps. Reversal of the cross-linking of chromatin was performed at 65 °C for 6 h, and proteinase K digestion was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 55 °C. DNA was extracted by the phenol/chloroform method. PCR was carried out on the purified DNA using primers corresponding to -102 to +50 of the MKP-1 promoter region (5′-primer, 5′-CCG CCA TTC AAA CAA ACA AAC CG-3′;3′-primer, 5′-CTG ATC CTA ATC TGG CTT CAC C-3′). Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as means ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Comparisons of data were carried out using analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post hoc test for multigroup comparisons or Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. The software package KaleidaGraph 3.6 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used for statistical analysis. Interaction of FBI1 with 14-3-3β in Vivo—In order to identify novel 14-3-3β-interacting proteins, K2 cell cDNA and rat brain cDNA libraries were subjected to yeast two-hybrid screening using 14-3-3β as a bait, and three novel cDNA clones (1-1, 2-3, and 2-6) were obtained. Preliminary Northern blotting showed that the expression level of clone 2-3 mRNA in K2 cells was 24.6-fold higher than that of the normal rat liver and was the highest among these genes. Thus, in this study, we decided to further analyze the oncogenic function of clone 2-3 and designated it as FBI1. The cDNA sequence was deposited in DDBJ/EMBI/GenBank™ under accession number AB234867. FBI1 has a sequence of 1502 nucleotides and encodes 201 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). FBI1 protein has two putative nuclear localization signals and five putative 14-3-3 recognition sites. A homology search revealed that rat FBI1 shows 99 and 94% identities to mouse and human FBI1s at the amino acid level, respectively, indicating that FBI1 is a highly conserved protein in mammals (Fig. 1B). To confirm the specific interaction between FBI1 and 14-3-3β in vitro, the GST pull-down assay was carried out. GST-fused FBI1 protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and then incubated with 35S-labeled 14-3-3β synthesized by an in vitro method. As shown in Fig. 2A, the 28.2-kDa 14-3-3β specifically bound to GST-FBI1 fusion protein. The band detected at 26.9-kDa was perhaps due to an immature product of 14-3-3β. To demonstrate that the interaction between these two proteins also occurs in vivo, K2 cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-FBI1 antibody and subjected to Western blotting with anti-14-3-3-β and anti-FBI1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2B, endogenous 14-3-3β was co-immunoprecipitated with FBI1. Furthermore, FBI1 expressed in K2 cells was detected as 31.6 and 30.2 kDa bands in the relatively high molecular weight region on SDS-PAGE, probably due to its strong basicity (isoelectric point: 9.12) and the difference in phosphorylation level. FBI1 protein has five putative 14-3-3 binding sites. To verify the 14-3-3β-binding sites in FBI1, we generated FBI1 point mutants in which Ser31, Thr103, Ser111, Ser119, or Ser131 in the putative 14-3-3-binding sites were converted to Ala and designated as S31A, T103A, S111A, S119A, and S131A, respectively. These mutants were inserted into pACT2, and the interaction with 14-3-3β was analyzed using the yeast two-hybrid system. All mutants did not bind to 14-3-3β (Fig. 2C), suggesting that multiple 14-3-3β-binding motifs of FBI1 are required for the interaction with 14-3-3β. Overexpression of FBI1 mRNA in Various Tumor Cell Lines—To examine the tissue specificity of FBI1 mRNA expression, total RNAs were extracted from various adult rat tissues and analyzed by Northern blotting with the 1.3-kb fragment of pACT2/FBI1 as a probe. The FBI1 gene was markedly expressed as a 1.8-kb mRNA in the testis, cerebrum, and cerebellum, whereas expression was negligible in the liver, heart, spleen, and muscle (Fig. 3A). The reason for this difference in the expression level of FBI1 transcript among rat tissues is unclear. The FBI1 gene was robustly expressed in rat hepatoma K2 cells compared with normal rat liver. Marked expression of FBI1 mRNA was also detected in other cancer cell lines, including rat hepatomas, glioblastoma cells, pheochromocytoma cells, and embryonic carcinoma cells, compared with the respective normal tissues (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the expression level of FBI1 in non-tumor cell lines, such as COS-7, Balb, and REF52 cells, was very low. These results suggest that overexpression of FBI1 is implicated in malignant transformation. Specific Inhibition of Colonization in Soft Agar by Forced Expression of Antisense FBI1—It is well known that anchorage-independent growth is one of the hallmarks of malignant cancer cells. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of forced expression of antisense FBI1 on the colony forming ability of K2 cells in semisolid medium. Antisense FBI1 cDNA expression vector was introduced into K2 cells, and two stable clones, K2A1 and K2A2, were selected by Northern blotting (Fig. 3C). The expression levels of endogenous FBI1 mRNA in K2A1 and K2A2 transfectants were decreased to 64 and 65% of the parental K2 cells, respectively. The FBI1 mRNA expression level in vacant vector-introduced K2V1 cells was unaffected. Expression of the neor gene inserted in the expression vector as a selection marker was clearly detected in all of the transfectants. Since we had previously reported that c-myc and 14-3-3β mRNA were over-expressed in K2 cells (8Sugiyama A. Miyagi Y. Komiya Y. Kurabe N. Kitanaka C. Kato N. Nagashima Y. Kuchino Y. Tashiro F. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the expression levels of these genes in the transfectants were analyzed by Northern blotting. No significant difference in the expression levels of c-myc and 14-3-3β mRNA was observed, suggesting that FBI1 does not affect the expression of these genes. To confirm expression level of FBI1 protein in transfectants, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FBI1 antibody. The expression levels of FBI1 protein in both K2A1 and K2A2 cells were reduced to 59 and 55% compared with that of the parental K2 cells, respectively (Fig. 3D) Next, these transfectants were cultured in soft agar medium containing 10% FCS for 2 weeks, and the number of colonies was counted. The colonization abilities of K2A1 and K2A2 cells were extremely reduced to 3.5 and 11.5% compared with that of the parental K2 cells, respectively (Fig. 3, F and G). The growth rate of these antisense FBI1 transfectants in monolayer culture was similar to that of K2 cells (Fig. 3E). These results imply that FBI1 selectively promotes the anchorage-independent growth of K2 cells. Suppression of Tumorigenicity and Lung Metastasis by Forced Expression of Antisense FBI1—The ability of anchorage-independent growth in vitro correlates with the tumorigenicity and metastatic ability of malignant cancer cells in vivo. To investigate the effects of expression of antisense FBI1 on the tumorigenicity of K2 cells, the transfectants were subcutaneously inoculated into the flank of nude mice, and the sizes of the tumors were estimated after 24 days. K2 cells and empty vector-transfected K2V1 cells formed progressively growing solid tumors in all mice (Figs. 4, A and B). Although solid tumors developed in all mice after inoculation with K2A1 and K2A2 cells, in both cases, the tumors were much smaller than those of K2 and K2V1 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Since angiogenesis is required for vigorous tumor growth and the expansion and metastasis of solid tumors (19Hanahan D. Folkman J.

https://openalex.org/W2029598281,"α-Tocopherol is a member of the vitamin E family that functions as the principal fat-soluble antioxidant in vertebrates. Body-wide distribution of tocopherol is regulated by the hepatic α-tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP), which stimulates secretion of the vitamin from hepatocytes to circulating lipoproteins. This biological activity of αTTP is thought to stem from its ability to facilitate the transfer of vitamin E between membranes, but the mechanism by which the protein exerts this activity remains poorly understood. Using a fluorescence energy transfer methodology, we found that the rate of tocopherol transfer from lipid vesicles to αTTP increases with increasing αTTP concentration. This concentration dependence indicates that ligand transfer by αTTP involves direct protein-membrane interaction. In support of this notion, equilibrium analyses employing filtration, dual polarization interferometry, and tryptophan fluorescence demonstrated the presence of a stable αTTP-bilayer complex. The physical association of αTTP with membranes is markedly sensitive to the presence of vitamin E in the bilayer. Some naturally occurring mutations in αTTP that cause the hereditary disorder ataxia with vitamin E deficiency diminish the effect of tocopherol on the protein-membrane association, suggesting a possible mechanism for the accompanying pathology. α-Tocopherol is a member of the vitamin E family that functions as the principal fat-soluble antioxidant in vertebrates.

Vitamin E is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in numerous species. By virtue of its radical-trapping activity, vitamin E is thought to alleviate oxidative damage in cells, and thus, to prevent various pathologies related to oxidative stress. Vertebrates selectively accumulate only one form of vitamin E from dietary mixtures, namely RRR-α-tocopherol (1Traber M.G. Kayden H.J. Am. J. Clin.

It is generally believed that in vivo αTTP is critical for the incorporation of dietary RRR-α-tocopherol into circulating lipoproteins, which deliver the vitamin to target cells.The role of αTTP in regulating whole-body levels of tocopherol is underscored by the fact that mutations in the ttpA gene cause hereditary vitamin E deficiency (ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, AVED (12Ouahchi K.

AVED patients present progressive neurodegeneration and low plasma tocopherol levels. Multiple mutations in the ttpA gene were identified in AVED patients, which are thought to impair the cellular activities of the protein. Substitution mutations such as R59W, E141K, and R221W cause an early onset, severe form of the AVED syndrome, whereas the H101Q, A120T, and R192H substitutions are associated with a later onset, milder form of the disorder (13Cavalier L.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8236-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), they represent useful tools with which to study the molecular mechanisms underlying αTTP function.The molecular mechanisms that underlie intermembrane tocopherol transfer by αTTP are not known. Sec14p, a related protein from the CRAL-TRIO family, was proposed to facilitate lipid transfer by interacting directly with membranes and actively “extracting” the ligand from the bilayer (22Sha B. Phillips S.E. Bankaitis V.A. Luo M. Nature. 1998; 391: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, no experimental evidence was put forward in support of this model. Other lipid transfer proteins are thought to employ multiple mechanisms to facilitate ligand transfer, such as bringing donor and acceptor particles to close proximity in the case of phospholipid transfer protein (23Ponsin G.

We report on our investigations into the mechanism by which αTTP facilitates the intermembrane transfer of tocopherol. Specifically, we address the role of physical association between the protein and the membrane during the ligand transfer reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDetails of the synthesis and fluorescent characteristics of NBD-tocopherol were previously reported (11Qian J.

Chem. 2006; 14: 3721-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant αTTP proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (20Morley S. Panagabko C. Shineman D. Mani B. Stocker A. Atkinson J. Manor D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Morley S. Cross V. Cecchini M. Nava P. Atkinson J. Manor D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein expression was induced with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 25 °C. All proteins were stored in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol at –20 °C.The affinity of αTTP for NBD-tocopherol was determined by fluorescence titrations as previously described (27Morley S. Cross V. Cecchini M. Nava P. Atkinson J. Manor D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1–1 μm αTTP was titrated with increasing concentrations of the fluorescent ligand NBD-tocopherol, and NBD fluorescence was monitored at 526 nm (excitation = 466 nm) with a Quanta-Master 4 fluorimeter (Photon Technologies International).Sonicated unilamellar vesicles were prepared from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, NBD-tocopherol, TRITC-DHPE (Molecular Probes), and butylated hydroxytoluene (molar ratio 98.2: 0.8:0.5:0.5) by sonication in SET buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and used at 25 μm in a stopped-flow apparatus (TGK Scientific). Tocopherol-containing lipid vesicles were prepared from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, RRR-α-tocopherol, and butylated hydroxytoluene (molar ratio 93.5:6: 0.5) by sonication in SET buffer. Sonicated vesicles were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h, and the resultant supernatant was purged with argon and stored at 4 °C in the dark for up to 2 weeks. Large unilamellar vesicles for dual polarization interferometry were prepared by 13 repeated extrusion steps through a 100-nm polycarbonate filter (LipoFast, Avestin, Ottawa, CA) in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4.Movement of NBD-tocopherol from membranes into the TTP binding pocket was examined by monitoring the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between NBD-tocopherol and the fluorescent lipid TRITC-DHPE as described earlier (27Morley S. Cross V. Cecchini M. Nava P. Atkinson J. Manor D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, small unilamellar vesicles containing NBD-tocopherol and TRITC-DHPE were prepared as described above and mixed with purified recombinant αTTP. Release of FRET between NBD-tocopherol and the fluorescent lipid was measured by monitoring the time-dependent change in TRITC-DHPE fluorescence (excitation = 466 nm, emission = 575 nm). Raw fluorescence data were fitted to the sum of a single exponential process and a linear term (representing chromophore bleaching), and the obtained pseudo first-order half-life values are reported. FRET experiments were done at protein concentrations > 5 μm, where more than 95% of the ligand was extracted, thus minimizing contribution from back-reactions (re-association of NBD-tocopherol with the bilayer).To evaluate the association of αTTP with membranes, the protein was incubated with sonicated vesicles for 30 min at room temperature and filtered through a centrifugal concentrator (Micro-con YM-100, Millipore, 11,000 × g for 30 min). Lipid vesicles and associated protein were retained above the filter, whereas buffer and free protein flow through the filter to the lower chamber (28Huang H. Ball J.M. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Vesicle-associated protein was recovered with SET buffer supplemented with 150 μm Triton X-100. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE, visualized by Coomassie staining, and quantitated by densitometry.Protein-membrane interactions were also measured using dual polarization interferometry (DPI) on an Analight Bio 200 with an unmodified sensor chip (Farfield Scientific Ltd.). Extruded vesicles were deposited onto the surface of the sensor chip at a flow rate of 25 μl/min for 8 min. The deposited phospholipids were allowed to equilibrate under flow conditions until a stable layer formed with a final thickness 3–10 nm before protein was injected. The association of αTTP to adsorbed phospholipids in the first 450 s was fit to a one-site exponential equation, which yielded the maximum specific mass of bound protein adsorbed at a given concentration of αTTP. After each injection of protein the sensor chip was regenerated with 80% ethanol.RESULTSThe defining biochemical activity of αTTP is catalysis of tocopherol transfer between lipid bilayers (7Mowri H. Nakagawa Y. Inoue K. Nojima S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Verdon C.P. Blumberg J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Sato Y. Hagiwara K. Arai H. Inoue K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms by which the protein exerts this activity, we examined the first step of the transfer reaction, namely, transfer of tocopherol from lipid bilayers into the TTP binding pocket. Two possible mechanisms could be envisioned to underlie ligand transfer process. One involves physical association of αTTP with the lipid bilayer followed by extraction of tocopherol into the protein binding pocket (Reaction 1). Tocopherolbilayer+αTTP⇆tocopherolbilayer·αTTP⇆bilayer+tocopherolαTTPREACTION 1 Alternatively, the protein may facilitate transfer by binding the vitamin following its passive diffusion from membranes, thereby shifting the equilibrium partitioning of tocopherol toward the aqueous milieu (Reaction 2), Tocopherolbilayer+αTTP⇆bilayer+tocopherolaqueous+αTTP⇆bilayer+tocopherolαTTPREACTION 2 To distinguish between these two mechanisms, we examined the rate of ligand sequestration from its FRET partner in the presence of different αTTP concentrations. If αTTP directly interacts with the bilayer (Reaction 1), the rate of ligand sequestration is expected to depend on protein concentration. On the other hand, if the protein binds tocopherol in the aqueous buffer (Reaction 2), the reaction rate will be limited by the rate of spontaneous ligand dissociation from the membrane. In this case the rate of tocopherol extraction will be independent of protein concentration. We utilized a FRET assay that we recently developed to monitor ligand transfer. In this system FRET occurs between NBD-tocopherol and a fluorescently labeled lipid, TRITC-DHPE, when both are present in the same bilayer (27Morley S. Cross V. Cecchini M. Nava P. Atkinson J. Manor D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Sequestration of NBD-tocopherol by αTTP results in loss of FRET between the lipid and NBD-tocopherol, which is readily detected fluorimetrically (see “Experimental Procedures”).Fig. 1 shows the kinetics of FRET release at various protein concentrations. We observed a pronounced dependence of the reaction half-life on αTTP concentrations from 8.7 ± 0.4 s (5 μm αTTP; n = 10) to 3.9 ± 0.2 s (30 μm αTTP; n = 9, Fig. 1B). The concentration-dependent nature of this process suggests that αTTP extracts tocopherol from membranes through a direct, collision-mediated mechanism.To further examine a direct αTTP-membrane interaction, we used a size-exclusion filtration assay that allows for the detection of stable protein-vesicle complexes (28Huang H. Ball J.M. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purified αTTP was incubated with varying concentrations of sonicated unilamellar vesicles, and the mixture was passed through a centrifugal filtration device (molecular weight cut-off = 100 kDa). Vesicles and associated protein were retained by the filter, whereas free protein passed through the filter to the lower chamber. As shown in Fig. 2A, the fraction of lipid-bound αTTP increased with increasing vesicle concentration. This effect was not because of nonspecific “trapping” of the protein by the vesicles, as another soluble protein (GST) did not associate with the vesicles under identical conditions (Fig. 2A). A physical interaction between αTTP and lipid bilayers was also evident from the fluorescence properties of the protein. The presence of five tryptophans in the αTTP primary structure gives rise to a characteristic intrinsic fluorescence spectrum when the protein is excited at 295 nm (λmax emission = 328 nm; Fig. 2B). In the presence of lipid vesicles, however, the emission spectrum is redshifted by 4 nm (λmax emission = 332 nm). Such a spectral shift is often observed when the local environment of tryptophan residues is changed to one of a more polar nature (30Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 354-363Google Scholar). These observations indicate that αTTP undergoes a distinct conformational change upon association with lipid bilayers. We also evaluated the interaction between αTTP and bilayers using DPI measurements. Specifically, we used this method to probe the interactions between soluble αTTP and a lipid bilayer adsorbed onto the surface of a sensor chip (see “Experimental Procedures”). α-TTP formed a distinct layer on the immobilized phospholipids, the specific mass of which was dependent on protein concentration (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 2Physical association of αTTP with lipid vesicles. A, purified recombinant αTTP (or glutathione S-transferase (GST); 1.5 μm) was incubated with the indicated concentration of sonicated unilamellar vesicles (SUV) for 30 min. Free protein was separated from membrane-bound protein by centrifugal filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown is a representative of three independent experiments. B, fluorescence emission spectrum of αTTP (0.8 μm; excitation = 295 nm) was monitored in the presence or absence of 15 mm concentrations of sonicated vesicles. Fluorescence intensities were normalized at the wavelength of maximal emission and corrected for scattering. These results are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Effect of vitamin E on the interaction between αTTP and membranes.

In DPI measurements we found that the amount of lipid-adsorbed αTTP was reduced by >2-fold in the presence of vitamin E (Fig. 3, B and C). Importantly, this effect was specific, since another neutral lipid, cholesterol, did not influence the αTTP-lipid interaction (Fig. 3C). Further evidence for the specificity of the ligand effect is the observation that δ-tocopherol exhibited a significantly weaker effect on the affinity of αTTP for membranes as compared with the effect of α-tocopherol (Fig. 3C). This difference likely reflects the reduced affinity of αTTP for δ-tocopherol (5Panagabko C. Morley S. Hernandez M. Cassolato P. Gordon H. Parsons R. Manor D. Atkinson J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6467-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 6Hosomi A. Arita M. Sato Y. Kiyose C. Ueda T. Igarashi O. Arai H. Inoue K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). We conclude from these data that the sensitivity of the αTTP-lipid interaction to ligands is a specific attribute of vitamin E, which is most attenuated by the natural ligand of the protein.To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of ligand transfer, we examined the catalytic efficacy of αTTP mutants associated with the AVED disorder. Table 1 summarizes the effects of these mutations on the binding affinity of αTTP for NBD-tocopherol. Both the glutathione S-transferase-fused and the “naked” (untagged) forms of αTTP bind tocopherol with high affinity (Kd ∼ 10 nm), demonstrating that the presence of the amino-terminal tag does not perturb the native conformation of the protein. Although none of the AVED-affected residues is present in the ligand binding pocket of the protein (Fig. 4A), the naturally occurring R59W and H101Q mutations cause a significant reduction in αTTP affinity for NBD-tocopherol (Kd = 39 and 71 nm, respectively, Table 1). The affinities of the remaining mutants for NBD-tocopherol are similar to that of the wild-type protein (Kd = 3–27 nm, Table 1).TABLE 1Affinity of mutant αTTP proteins for NBD-tocopherolTTP variantClinical phenotypeKdaAverages and S.D. from more than three titrations are shown.

B, time-dependent changes in FRET between NBD-tocopherol and fluorescent liposomes in the presence of wild type (WT), R192H, E141K, H101Q, or R59W variants of αTTP (30 μm active protein). Conditions are as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The efficacy of wild-type αTTP and several AVED variants in catalyzing the sequestration of tocopherol from membranes is shown in Fig. 4B. The rate at which the R192H or H101Q mutants facilitated ligand removal was essentially indistinguishable from the wild-type protein (t½ = 4.1 and 4.8 s for the R192H and H101Q mutants, respectively, at 30 μm protein). Loss of FRET induced by the E141K and R59W mutants, on the other hand, occurred at a significantly slower rate (t½ = 7.9 and 7.01 s, respectively). These observations indicate that the clinical phenotype associated with a particular mutation in αTTP (i.e. mutations associated with the severe versus the mild forms of AVED) is correlated with the competence of the protein in sequestering tocopherol from lipid bilayers.Another correlation between in vitro activity and clinical severity is evident when inspecting the concentration dependence of the ligand transfer rate for the different mutants (Fig. 5). All αTTP variants tested facilitated the sequestration of tocopherol to a similar extent (∼20% change in emission at 575 nm). However, the kinetic characteristics of this change were markedly different. α-TTP variants associated with the late-onset, mild phenotype of AVED (i.e. harboring the R192H, H101Q, or A120T substitutions) exhibited tocopherol transfer rates that are highly dependent on protein concentration, similar to the wild-type protein (i.e. a 2-fold decrease in t½ between 5 and 30 μm protein; Fig. 5). In contrast, the rate for protein-induced FRET loss decreased by only 20% for the R221W mutant and did not exhibit any significant concentration dependence in the case of the E141K and R59W variants of αTTP, associated with the severe form of AVED (Fig. 5). We previously reported similar kinetic distinctions between these αTTP mutant classes in their ability to catalyze the vesicle-to-vesicle transfer of radiolabeled tocopherol (20Morley S. Panagabko C. Shineman D. Mani B. Stocker A. Atkinson J. Manor D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that naturally occurring mutations in αTTP alter the ability of the protein to interact with membranes. To directly address this issue, we quantitated the interaction of various AVED mutants with lipids using DPI. As shown in Fig. 6, all proteins associated with phospholipids to a similar extent as the wild-type protein (∼1 ng of protein adsorbed per mm2). However, the effect of vitamin E on the protein-lipid interaction was strikingly different among the different mutant classes. α-TTP variants associated with the mild, late-onset form of AVED (i.e. R192H, H101Q) exhibited pronounced sensitivity to the presence of vitamin E, similar to the wild-type protein; the mass of lipid-adsorbed αTTP was reduced by ∼50% in the presence of tocopherol, as would be expected if αTTP-tocopherol has reduced affinity for the membrane. Mutant proteins associated with the severe, early onset form of AVED (i.e. R221W, R59W), on the other hand, were not affected by the presence of tocopherol in the bilayer. That the severe AVED mutations diminish the ligand sensitivity of the αTTP-membrane interaction was also observed in filtration experiments (data not shown). These data raise the possibility that a decline in tocopherol sensitivity, rather than differences in affinity for membranes per se, gives rise to the functional defects associated with the severe AVED phenotype.FIGURE 5Dependence of tocopherol sequestration rates on protein concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2074569502,"Background Adenosine levels rise during inflammation and modulate inflammatory responses by engaging with four different G protein-coupled receptors. It is suggested that adenosine exhibits pro-inflammatory effects through its A1 receptor (A1R), and anti-inflammatory effects through A2A receptor (A2AR). Therefore, understanding of the mechanisms that govern adenosine receptor regulation may advance treatment of various inflammatory disorders. We previously reported that peak A1R expression during leukocyte recruitment, is followed by a peak in A2AR during inflammation resolution. Principal Findings Here, we examined whether A1R activation sequentially induces A2AR expression and by this reverses inflammation. The effect of adenosine on A1R mediated A2AR expression was examined in peritoneal macrophages (PMΦ) and primary peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC) in vitro. Induction of A2AR was inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX) and partly dependent on A2AR stimulation. Administration of A1R agonists to healthy mice reduced A1R expression and induced A2AR production in PMC. Mice that were preconditioned with A1R agonists 24 hours before E. coli inoculation exhibited decreased TNFα and IL-6 sera levels and reduced leukocytes recruitment. Preconditioning was blocked by pretreatment with A1R antagonist, as well as, or by late treatment with A2AR antagonist, and was absent in A2AR−/− mice. Conclusions Our data suggest that preconditioning by an A1R-agonist promotes the resolution of inflammation by inducing the production of A2AR.

To investigate the role of specific β3 cysteines in αIIbβ3 expression and activation, we expressed in baby hamster kidney cells normal αIIb with normal β3 or β3 with single or double cysteine substitutions of nine disulfide bonds in EGF-3, EGF-4, and β-tail domains and assessed αIIbβ3 surface expression and activation state by flow cytometry using P2 or PAC-1 antibodies, respectively. Most mutants displayed reduced surface expression of αIIbβ3. Disruptions of disulfide bonds in EGF-3 yielded constitutively active αIIbβ3, implying that these bonds stabilize the inactive αIIbβ3 conformer. Mutants of the Cys-567–Cys-581 bond in EGF-4 were inactive even after exposure to αIIbβ3-activating antibodies, indicating that this bond is necessary for activating αIIbβ3. Disrupting Cys-560–Cys-583 in the EGF-3/EGF-4 or Cys-608–Cys-655 in β-tail domain resulted in αIIbβ3 activation only when Cys-560 or Cys-655 of each pair was mutated but not when their partners (Cys-583, Cys-608) or both cysteines were mutated, suggesting that free sulfhydryls of Cys-583 and Cys-608 participate in αIIbβ3 activation by a disulfide bond exchange-dependent mechanism. The free sulfhydryl blocker dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid inhibited 70% of anti-LIBS6 antibody-induced activation of wild-type αIIbβ3 and had a smaller effect on mutants, implicating disulfide bond exchange-dependent and -independent mechanisms in αIIbβ3 activation. These data suggest that different disulfide bonds in β3 EGF and β-tail domains play variable structural and regulatory roles in αIIbβ3.

Integrin αIIbβ3 mediates platelet aggregation by serving as a receptor for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Like other integrins, the affinity of αIIbβ3 for its ligands is tightly regulated by cellular events (inside-out signaling). αIIbβ3 is inactive in resting platelets, but following activation by inside-out signals it undergoes conformational changes resulting in ligand binding to its large globular head, which further modifies the conformation leading to clustering of the αIIbβ3 receptors, tyrosine phosphorylation, and cytoskeleton rearrangement (1Hynes R.O.

Although the precise mechanism by which αIIbβ3 is activated is incompletely understood, recent crystallographic and electron microscopic data suggest that during activation αIIbβ3 changes from a low affinity bent conformation with a closed headpiece to a high affinity extended conformation with an open headpiece. Several intermediate affinity conformations have been proposed to be in equilibrium between these extreme conformational states (7Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L.

Physiologic agonist-induced insideout signaling involves separation of the cytoplasmic tails of αIIb andβ3 that results in rearrangement of the extracellular domain of the integrin, culminating in ligand binding (10Hughes P.E.

Recent studies suggest that exofacial disulfide exchange is involved in the conformational changes that follow αIIbβ3 activation. Both αIIb and β3 subunits contain highly conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds. β3 contains 56 cysteines, of which 31 are located in four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and 8 are located in the carboxyl-terminal β-tail domain (βTD) (7Xiong J.P.

Several naturally occurring cysteine substitutions in the EGF-like domains of β3 (C549R, C560F, C560R, and C598Y) that cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a severe bleeding disorder, as well as several artificial cysteine substitutions exhibit constitutively active αIIbβ3 (14Mor-Cohen R.

J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but a recent report suggested that some exist as free sulfhydryls exhibiting properties of a redox site directly involved in integrin activation (20Yan B. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39964-39972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, the reducing agent dithiothreitol was shown to activate αIIbβ3 and cause slow progressive platelet aggregation by a mechanism involving both disulfide bond reduction and disulfide bond exchange (21Yan B. Smith J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8861-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Two other reports by one of us showed that extracellular free thiols and enzymatically catalyzed disulfide bond exchanges are required for acquisition of a ligand binding conformation of αIIbβ3 (22Lahav J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this context it is notable that αIIbβ3 harbors an endogenous thiol isomerase activity (24O'Neill S. Robinson A. Deering A. Ryan M. Fitzgerald D.J. Moran N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36984-36990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present study we analyzed the role of specific disulfide bonds in the exofacial domain in promoting αIIbβ3 activation. We created mutations in cysteine residues that disrupted nine disulfide bonds in the EGF and β-tail domains of β3 and expressed them in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. It will be shown that different cysteines play different roles in the activation of αIIbβ3 involving disulfide bond exchange-dependent or -independent mechanisms. Materials—Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium, l-glutamine, and fetal calf serum were from Biological Industries (Beit-Haemek, Israel). Lipofectamine reagent and G418 were from Invitrogen. Hygromycin was from Roche Applied Science. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated monoclonal antibody P2 against αIIbβ3 complex was obtained from Immunotech (Marseille, France). FITC-conjugated fibrinogen mimetic murine monoclonal antibody PAC-1 was obtained from BD Biosciences. The αIIbβ3-activating monoclonal antibody anti-LIBS6 was a gift from Dr. Mark Ginsberg (Dept. of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The activating monoclonal antibody PT25-2 was from Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan). The membrane impermeant-free sulfhydryl blocker dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) was from Sigma. Construction of Expression Vectors for Mutant cDNAs—cDNAs of αIIb or β3 in pcDNA3 vector were gifts from Dr. Peter Newman from the Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. cDNA of αIIb was subcloned to the PvuII site of pCEP4 mammalian expression vector carrying the hygromycin resistance gene as a selection marker (Invitrogen) as previously described (25Yatuv R. Rosenberg N. Zivelin A. Peretz H. Dardik R. Trakhtenbrot L. Seligsohn U. Blood. 2001; 98: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Substitutions of selected cysteine residues by serine or other residues were created in the pcDNA3/β3 vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using two overlapping oligonucleotide primers containing single base pair substitutions (available upon request). Correct incorporation of the mutations into the pcDNA3/β3 vectors was verified by DNA sequencing. For creation of double mutants containing two cysteine substitutions together, we first introduced one mutation into normal pcDNA3/β3 vector and then used the mutant pcDNA3/β3 clone as a template for introducing the second mutation. Co-transfection of αIIb and β3 cDNAs—BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented by 2 mg/ml l-glutamine and 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of normal or mutated forms of pcDNA3/β3 and 1 μg of normal pCEP4/αIIb using Lipofectamine reagent. The transfected cells were grown in a selection medium containing 0.7 mg/ml G418 and 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin. Mock cells were transfected with both pCEP4 and pcDNA3 and were selected in the same medium. At least two different transfections for each mutant or wild-type (WT) construct were performed and used for flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry of Transfected BHK Cells—Transfected BHK cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm EDTA, pelleted, and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were pelleted again, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 (5 × 105 cells/100 μl), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with either 20 μl of FITC-conjugated P2 antibody or 20 μl of FITC-conjugated PAC-1 antibody. The cells were diluted to 5 × 105 cells/ml and analyzed for surface fluorescence by flow cytometry (Coulter, EPICS, Luton, UK). To measure ligand binding after activation of αIIbβ3 by anti-LIBS6 or PT25-2 antibodies, FITC-conjugated PAC-1 was added to cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.25 mm MnCl2 (5 × 105 cells/100 μl) in the presence of 1 μl of anti-LIBS6 or 1 μg of PT25-2. These experiments were repeated in the presence of 2.5 mm DTNB, which inhibited free sulfhydryls. The base line for nonspecific binding of the antibodies was measured in mock cells. PAC-1 binding to αIIbβ3 was expressed as percent of binding obtained with P2. The effects of anti-LIBS6 and DTNB were compared by two-tailed, paired t test analysis. Alignment of EGF Domains and a Model of the EGF-3 Domain of β3—An initial alignment of 2125 EGF-like domains was taken from the Pfam data base (26Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (accession number PF07974). Sequences derived from a whole genome shotgun were discarded, as were sequences of variant and mutant proteins. The remaining data set of 1462 sequences was used to generate a hidden Markov model (27Eddy S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) subsequently utilized to collect and align 1856 EGF domain sequences from the annotated SwissProt data base (28Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). From this alignment, a smaller multiple sequence alignment of representative sequences was obtained, including the EGF-3 and EGF-4 domains of human integrin β3 and additional human EGF domains for which the three-dimensional structure is available. A model of the EGF-3 domain of β3 was constructed using the program NEST with default parameters (29Petrey D. Xiang Z. Tang C.L. Xie L. Gimpelev M. Mitros T. Soto C.S. Goldsmith-Fischman S. Kernytsky A. Schlessinger A. Koh I.Y. Alexov E. Honig B. Proteins. 2003; 53: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) based on the NMR structure of the EGF-3 domain in the β2 subunit (Protein Data Bank code 1L3Y) (30Beglova N. Blacklow S.C.

Effect of β3 Cysteine Substitutions on the Expression and Activation State of αIIbβ3—Fig. 1A displays the nine disulfide bonds in EGF-3, EGF-4, and β-tail domains that were disrupted. The pairing of cysteines was derived from the αvβ3 crystal structure (7Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Because Cys-544 was proposed to be bonded with Cys-523 rather than Cys-536 (30Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 31Takagi J. Beglova N. Yalamanchili P. Blacklo S.C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we also mutated the cysteine residues of the Cys-523–Cys-544 alternative pair (Fig. 1B). In most instances, we mutated each one of the cysteines of the pairs as well as both cysteines (Table 1). A total of 27 mutations were created, most with cysteine to serine substitutions; some were replicas of natural mutations detected in Glanzmann thrombasthenia patients (C549R, C560R, C560F) (14Mor-Cohen R.

All mutants were co-expressed with normal αIIb in BHK cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. The extent of surface expression of all αIIbβ3 mutants was 17–100% of WT, except for C575S and C586S mutants, which expressed <10% of WT and hindered us from analyzing their activation state (Fig. 2A). In all but one pair (Cys-536/Cys-544), the double mutants were expressed better than the corresponding single mutants, suggesting that hydrogen bonds between the substituting serine residues stabilized the αIIbβ3 structure, compensating for the loss of disulfide bonds. The natural C549R mutation caused reduced surface expression of αIIbβ3 similarly to the corresponding C549S artificial mutation, suggesting that the disruption of the Cys-549–Cys-558 bond and not the bulky Arg residue present in the natural mutation caused the reduced expression. In contrast, the natural C560R and C560F mutations caused αIIbβ3 surface expression that was lower than the corresponding artificial C560S mutation, suggesting that the bulky substituting residues (Arg and Phe) interfered with the expression of αIIbβ3.TABLE 1Natural and artificial mutations created for disruption of nine disulfide bonds in β3DomainDisulfide bondMutations createdaSubstitutions identified in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia are depicted in bold letters.EGF-3Cys-536—Cys-544bDisplayed in the αvβ3 crystal structure (7). or Cys-523—Cys-544cProposed by Springer and coworkers (30, 31).C536S, C544S, C523S, C536S/C544S, C523S/C544SCys-549—Cys-558C549S, C549R, C558S, C558S/C549SEGF-3/EGF-4Cys-560—Cys583C560S, C560R, C560F, C560S/C583SEGF-4Cys-567—Cys-581C567S, C581S, C567S/C581SCys-575—Cys-586C575S, C586S, C575S/C586SCys-588—Cys-598C588S, C598S, C588S/C598SβTDCys-608—Cys-655C608S, C655S, C608S/C655SCys-614—Cys-635C614SCys-617—Cys-631C617Sa Substitutions identified in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia are depicted in bold letters.b Displayed in the αvβ3 crystal structure (7Xiong J.P.

Cells harboring disulfide bond disruptions in EGF-3 displayed a pronounced increase in PAC-1 binding. Compared with WT cells, there was a 25–33-fold increase for Cys-536–Cys-544 or Cys-523–Cys-544 bonds and a 17–24-fold increase for the Cys-549–Cys-558 bond (Fig. 2B)(p < 0.001). The effect of disruptions of the Cys-560–Cys-583 bond located at the interface between EGF-3 and EGF-4 depended on the cysteine that was mutated (Fig. 2B). Although all substitutions of Cys-560 gave rise to a 22–24-fold increase in PAC-1 binding compared with WT cells (p < 0.001), a mutation in the partner cysteine C583S did not exhibit a significant increase in binding, and a double mutant (C560S/C583S) only yielded an 8-fold increased binding (p < 0.05). Disruption of two disulfide bonds in EGF-4 domain also yielded variable results (Fig. 2B). Cells with the Cys-567–Cys-581 bond disruptions caused by mutations of Cys-567, Cys-581, or both displayed no significant increase in binding of PAC-1. In contrast, cells with Cys-588–Cys-598 bond disruptions displayed increased PAC-1 binding, a 10-fold increase for C588S (p < 0.05), a 23-fold increase for C598S (p < 0.001), and a 34-fold increase for C588S/C598S (p < 0.001). Disruption of the Cys-608–Cys-655 bond in the βTD by a C655S mutation displayed a 14-fold increase in binding PAC-1 (p < 0.001), whereas a mutation in its counterpart, C608S, or the double mutation C608S/C655S did not exhibit a significant increase in PAC-1 binding (Fig. 2B). Mutations of cysteines of two other disulfide bonds within βTD, C614S or C617S, yielded no significant increase in PAC-1 binding, which agrees with a previous report (32Butta N. Arias-Salgado E.G. Gonzalez-Manchon C. Ferrer M. Larrucea S. Ayuso M.S. Parrilla R. Blood. 2003; 102: 2491-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Activation of αIIbβ3 Mutants by Activating Antibodies—To examine whether the constitutively active mutants reached their maximum activation state, we used two activating antibodies, anti-LIBS6 and PT25-2. As expected, anti-LIBS6 antibody caused a 50-fold increase in binding of PAC-1 to WT αIIbβ3 (Fig. 3A). The effect of anti-LIBS6 antibody on the αIIbβ3 mutants varied considerably; all mutants in EGF-3 exhibited no significant increase in PAC-1 binding (Fig. 3A), whereas mutants of the Cys-560–Cys-583 bond located at the interface between EGF-3 and EGF-4 displayed increased PAC-1 binding (Fig. 3B). The increase was inversely related to the extent of constitutive activation. In the Cys-560 mutants that were strongly activated, anti-LIBS6 antibody only exerted a 1.3–1.8-fold increase in PAC-1 binding; in the counterpart C583S mutant that was not constitutively active, PAC-1 binding increased by nearly 30-fold; and in the double C560S/C583S mutant, which was weakly constitutively active, anti-LIBS6 antibody caused a 5-fold increase in PAC-1 binding (p < 0.05). The Cys-567–Cys-581 bond mutants in EGF-4 that were constitutively inactive did not exhibit an increased PAC-1 binding induced by anti-LIBS6 antibody, whereas the constitutively active Cys-588–Cys-598 bond mutants displayed a 1.2–3-fold increase in PAC-1 binding (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). Anti-LIBS6 antibody also induced a further increase in PAC-1 binding to the Cys-608–Cys-655 mutants that was related to their constitutive activation state, a 2.6-fold increase for C655S, a 12-fold increase for C608S, and a 6.2-fold increase for C608S/C655S (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3D). All the above experiments were reproduced with PT25-2-activating antibody (data not shown). Because the epitope for anti-LIBS6 antibody is within residues 602–690 of β3 (13Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W.

Taken together our data show that whereas mutants involving Cys-560–Cys-583, Cys-588–Cys-598, or Cys-608–Cys-655 bonds could be further activated by activating antibodies, mutants with Cys-536/Cys-523–Cys-544 or Cys-549–Cys-558 bond disruptions could not be further activated, and mutants involving Cys-567–Cys-581 bond disruption remained non-active. Effect of the Free Sulfhydryl Blocker DTNB on the αIIbβ3 Activation State—To study the role of free sulfhydryls on the activation state of the β3 mutants, we selected disulfide bonds from each one of the four regions, EGF-3, EGF-3/EGF-4 boundary, EGF-4, and βTD and examined the effect of adding 2.5 mm DTNB on PAC-1 binding to αIIbβ3. Fig. 4 shows that DTNB caused a consistent, but not statistically significant, decrease in PAC-1 binding in all mutants examined except for C560S/C583S and C588S/C598S mutants, which exhibited a slight but statistically significant decrease (Fig. 4, B and C). Notably, the constitutively active mutants remained considerably active after DTNB exposure. Thus, blocking free sulfhydryls with DTNB in the selected αIIbβ3 mutants had no or small effect on their constitutively activation state. Inhibition of Anti-LIBS6 Antibody-induced vation induced by anti-LIBS6 antibody. As expected, anti-LIBS6 antibody-induced activation of WT αIIbβ3 measured by PAC-1 binding declined by 70% in the presence of 2.5 mm DTNB (Fig. 5) (p < 0.001). A less pronounced but statistically significant decline by 32, 32, and 35% was observed for C583S (Fig. 5A), C588S (Fig. 5B), and C608S (Fig. 5C) mutants, respectively (p < 0.005). In contrast, DTNB had a non-statistically significant inhibitory effect on anti-LIBS6 antibody-induced increase in PAC-1 binding to all other mutants examined. The EGF-3 and Cys-567–Cys-581 mutants that were not activated by anti-LIBS6 antibody were not tested with DTNB. Alignment of EGF-like Domains—Our data show that substitutions of different cysteines in the EGF and β-tail domains elicit diverse effects on the activation state of αIIbβ3. Because EGF-like domains are conserved and abundant in proteins (35Appella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 231: 1-4Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we performed a sequence alignment analysis to seek a potential pattern in this diversity. Ten conserved EGF-like domains are presented in Fig. 6. All EGF domains share a distinctive motif of 6 conserved cysteines (C1–C6) that typically form three internal disulfide bonds in a 1–3, 2–4, and 5–6 pattern, although C1, C2, C3, and C4 display in some instances alternative patterns of disulfide bridges that have the potential of rearranging disulfide bonds (36Barton W.A. Tzvetkova-Robev D. Miranda E.P. Kolev M.V. Rajashankar K.R. Himanen J.P. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 524-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Chen V.M. Hogg P.J. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2006; 4: 2533-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In β integrins, 2 additional cysteines were identified in EGF domains, one between C3 and C4, i.e. Cys-544 in β3/EGF-3 and Cys-583 in β3/EGF-4, and one beyond C6, Cys-560 in β3/EGF-3 (Fig. 6A). The crystal structure of β3 (7Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L.

Based on alignment of EGF domains, experimental findings, and NMR solution structure, Springer and coworkers (30Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct.

Although, an understanding of siderophore biosynthesis is known, the mechanism of their secretion and uptake still remains elusive.Here, we demonstrate an interplay among three iron regulated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) proteins, namely, Rv1348 (IrtA), Rv1349 (IrtB) and Rv2895c in export and import of M.tb siderophores across the membrane and the consequent iron uptake. IrtA, interestingly, has a fused N-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD), representing an atypical subset of ABC transporters, unlike IrtB that harbors only the permease and ATPase domain. SBD selectively binds to non-ferrated siderophores whereas Rv2895c exhibits relatively higher affinity towards ferrated siderophores. An interaction between the permease domain of IrtB and Rv2895c is evident from GST pull-down assay. In vitro liposome reconstitution experiments further demonstrate that IrtA is indeed a siderophore exporter and the two-component IrtB-Rv2895c system is an importer of ferrated siderophores. Knockout of msmeg_6554, the irtA homologue in Mycobacterium smegmatis, resulted in an impaired M.tb siderophore export that is restored upon complementation with M.tb irtA.Our data suggest the interplay of three proteins, namely IrtA, IrtB and Rv2895c in synergizing the balance of siderophores and thus iron inside the mycobacterial cell."
https://openalex.org/W2120237184,"Background Disclosure of authors' financial interests has been proposed as a strategy for protecting the integrity of the biomedical literature. We examined whether authors' financial interests were disclosed consistently in articles on coronary stents published in 2006. Methodology/Principal Findings We searched PubMed for English-language articles published in 2006 that provided evidence or guidance regarding the use of coronary artery stents. We recorded article characteristics, including information about authors' financial disclosures. The main outcome measures were the prevalence, nature, and consistency of financial disclosures. There were 746 articles, 2985 authors, and 135 journals in the database. Eighty-three percent of the articles did not contain disclosure statements for any author (including declarations of no interests). Only 6% of authors had an article with a disclosure statement. In comparisons between articles by the same author, the types of disagreement were as follows: no disclosure statements vs declarations of no interests (64%); specific disclosures vs no disclosure statements (34%); and specific disclosures vs declarations of no interests (2%). Among the 75 authors who disclosed at least 1 relationship with an organization, there were 2 cases (3%) in which the organization was disclosed in every article the author wrote. Conclusions/Significance In the rare instances when financial interests were disclosed, they were not disclosed consistently, suggesting that there are problems with transparency in an area of the literature that has important implications for patient care. Our findings suggest that the inconsistencies we observed are due to both the policies of journals and the behavior of some authors."
https://openalex.org/W2080253127,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) in prisons is a major health problem in countries of high and intermediate TB endemicity such as Brazil. For operational reasons, TB control strategies in prisons cannot be compared through population based intervention studies. Methodology/Principal Findings A mathematical model is proposed to simulate the TB dynamics in prison and evaluate the potential impact on active TB prevalence of several intervention strategies. The TB dynamics with the ongoing program was simulated over a 10 year period in a Rio de Janeiro prison (TB prevalence 4.6 %). Then, a simulation of the DOTS strategy reaching the objective of 70 % of bacteriologically-positive cases detected and 85 % of detected cases cured was performed; this strategy reduced only to 2.8% the average predicted TB prevalence after 5 years. Adding TB detection at entry point to DOTS strategy had no major effect on the predicted active TB prevalence. But, adding further a yearly X-ray mass screening of inmates reduced the predicted active TB prevalence below 1%. Furthermore, according to this model, after applying this strategy during 2 years (three annual screenings), the TB burden would be reduced and the active TB prevalence could be kept at a low level by associating X-ray screening at entry point and DOTS. Conclusions/Significance We have shown that X-ray mass screenings should be considered to control TB in highly endemic prison. Prisons with different levels of TB prevalence could be examined thanks to this model which provides a rational tool for public health deciders."

Identifying endogenous substrates for caspase-8 by using integrated bioinformatics and biological approaches is required to delineate the diverse roles of this caspase. We describe a number of novel putative caspase-8 substrates using the Prediction of Protease Specificity (PoPS) program, one of which is histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7). HDAC7 is cleaved faster than any other caspase-8 substrate described to date. It is also cleaved in primary CD4+CD8+ thymocytes undergoing extrinsic apoptosis. By using naturally occurring caspase inhibitors that have evolved exquisite specificity at concentrations found within the cell, we could unequivocally assign the cleavage activity to caspase-8. Importantly, cleavage of HDAC7 alters its subcellular localization and abrogates its Nur77 repressor function.

During apoptosis cells are systematically dismantled and packaged into small membrane-bound particles ready for removal by professional phagocytes, by a process that is driven by members of the caspase family of proteases. Members of the caspase family have generally been separated into two groups as follows: those involved in apoptosis (caspase-2, -3, and -6–10) and those involved in non-apoptotic processes such as inflammation and differentiation (caspase-1, -4, -5, and -14) (1Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar).

Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar).Of the initiator apoptotic caspases, the strongest evidence for alternative non-apoptotic roles is for caspase-8. The proteolytic activity of the caspase may be dispensable for some of these processes. For instance, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated NF-κB activation in T cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells is dependent on caspase-8 protein but not its proteolytic activity. In contrast, NF-κB activation in response to T cell receptor ligation in T cells does require caspase-8 activity (3Su H. Bidere N. Zheng L. Cubre A. Sakai K. Dale J. Salmena L. Hakem R. Straus S. Lenardo M. Science. 2005; 307: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).

Med. 2005; 202: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).If the cell utilizes lethal pro-apoptotic proteases such as caspase-8 to perform other cellular functions, an immediate challenge it must overcome is how to survive while harboring active caspase-8. One possibility is to sequester the “apoptotic” substrates (e.g. procaspase-3, procaspase-7, and Bid) from active caspase-8, while leaving non-apoptotic substrates available for proteolysis. To test this hypothesis, we need to identify the elusive non-apoptotic caspase-8 substrates. To this end we employed a bioinformatic approach. Searching the human proteome with a matrix model based on the well defined substrate specificity of caspase-8 revealed a number of potential substrates. We formally tested three of these and confirmed that one, HDAC7, is very efficiently cleaved by caspase-8 both in vitro and in vivo. HDAC7 is a class II histone deacetylase, and like other members of the family, it represses transcription of MEF2-dependent genes in a cell type-specific manner (11Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that cleavage of HDAC7 is a loss of function event, abrogating its transcription repressor activity. Finally we discuss the implications of HDAC7 cleavage in both apoptotic and non-apoptotic scenarios.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPoPS Search Parameters—The matrix model of caspase-8 specificity (C14.009 > Boyd > 1.2) was used to search the human proteome using the Web-based PoPS program.

Primary mouse thymocytes were treated with 100 ng/ml FasL with 1 μg/ml Enhancer (Alexis Biochemicals). Activation-induced cell death (AICD) was induced in primary thymocytes with 5 μg/ml biotinylated anti-mouse CD3ϵ chain (145-2C11; Pharmingen) with or without 5 μg/ml biotinylated anti-mouse CD28 (Pharmingen) and 25 μg/ml streptavidin (Southern Biotech) for 24 or 48 h. All cells were harvested, washed in ice-cold PBS, and cell pellets were stored at -20 °C. Frozen pellets were lysed in ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (containing protease inhibitors, as described above), normalized for protein concentration, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A portion of the lysate was added to caspase buffer containing 100 μm Ac-DEVD-afc, and executioner caspase activity was monitored as described previously (21Scott F.L. Denault J.B. Riedl S.J. Shin H. Renatus M. Salvesen G.S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In some experiments a portion of the cells was reserved prior to storage, stained with annexin V-PE or annexin V-FITC, and analyzed by FACS (FACSort, BD Biosciences). In other experiments, the sub-G1 population was identified by harvesting cells in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed by FACS on the FL3 channel.Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were analyzed by 8–18% linear gradient acrylamide SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and immunoblotting was as described (22Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Fluorescent Microscopy—COS7 cells grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates were transfected with FuGENE 6. Cells transfected with C-terminal GFP-tagged HDAC7 constructs were washed in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells co-transfected with 200 ng of C-terminal FLAG-tagged HDAC7, 200 ng of caspase-8, and 1.6 μg of XIAP-myc were washed twice with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol for 2 min, blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk (w/v) in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, and incubated with mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, 10 μg/ml) and a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Samples were stained with 250 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and mounted with VectaShield (Burlingame, CA). Images were captured with a Color CCD SPOT RT Camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) attached to an Inverted TE300 Nikon microscope.Nur77 Promoter Activity Assays—HEK293 cells in 6-well trays were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 48 h. The amount of DNA was kept constant by balancing with empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Cells were lysed in 100 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was assessed using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed to monitor transfection efficiency and viability of cells (hydrolysis of 800 μg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside in PBS with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm MgCl2, emission at 405 nm). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. For experiments involving transfection of caspase-8, if the β-galactosidase activity for a given experiment had a standard deviation of more than 10%, it was assumed that expression of caspase-8 had killed too many cells and that data set was excluded.Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was purified from primary thymocytes with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual genomic DNA was removed with DNA-free (Ambion), according to manufacturer's instructions. 1–5 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Nur77 mRNA was quantified with the SYBR green fluorogenic detection system on a Stratagene Mx3000p. PCRs were performed in duplicate with the following primers: Nur77 sense (5′-CTTGAGTTCGGCAAGCCTAC-3′) and Nur77 antisense (5′-CGAGGATGAGGAAGAAGACG-3′). Standard curves were plotted, and Nur77 expression was normalized to cyclophilin A.RESULTSIdentification of HDAC7 as a Potential Caspase-8 Substrate in Silico—The distinct specificity of caspases has been established using positional scanning substrate approaches (12Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 350: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Empirical data from these studies were used to generate a matrix model of caspase-8 specificity for the P4-P3-P2-P1-P1′ sub-sites. This model was used to search the human proteome for potential caspase-8 substrates using PoPS, a web-based program for prediction of protease substrates. Using this five subsite model (number C14.009 > Boyd > 1.2 in the model data base at the PoPS website), the maximum score for a potential caspase-8 substrate is 25. Extracellular proteins were eliminated from further consideration, as were candidate substrates whose predicted cleavage sites were within extracellular domains (supplemental Table 1). Three high scoring substrates, whose cleavage may have interesting biological consequences, were selected for in vitro analysis with recombinant caspase-8: HDAC7, RAB9A, and tripartite motif-containing 3 (TRIM3). Recombinant proteins were purified and incubated with recombinant caspase-8. Neither RAB9A nor TRIM3 was cleaved by caspase-8, despite the high scoring prediction (data not shown). For RAB9A it is clear why it was not cleaved; crystal structures show the predicted cleavage site is in a rigid tight turn, with P4–P2 within a β-strand, making it inaccessible to the protease active site (23Wittmann J.G. Rudolph M.G. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). There is no structural information about TRIM3 to explain why it was not cleaved by caspase-8. HDAC7 was cleaved by caspase-8, generating a C-terminal FLAG-tagged fragment of ∼63 kDa (Fig. 1A). This fragment is in accordance with that predicted by PoPS.Although we initially set our threshold at 24 to focus on proteins most likely to be caspase-8 substrates, using this matrix model for caspase-8 specificity, which is based on data using small synthetic substrates, PoPS attributes much lower scores for well characterized cleavage sites within in vivo caspase-8 substrates (supplemental Table 1). According to the PoPS prediction, HDAC7 may also harbor additional cleavage sites with lower PoPS score (Asp228, PoPS 15.31; Asp589, PoPS 14.57; Asp385, PoPS 14.33). To confirm the cleavage site allocated ant the highest PoPS score was indeed the one utilized by caspase-8 in vitro, we generated recombinant HDAC7 with Asp375 mutated to alanine. This mutant was not cleaved by caspase-8 (Fig. 1A).Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling regulates the transcription repressor function of HDAC7. Phosphorylation by protein kinase D or Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase I promote 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic accumulation of HDAC7, such that it no longer functions as a transcription repressor (24Dequiedt F.

Dephosphorylation by myosin phosphatase promotes nuclear import and transcription repression (26Parra M. Mahmoudi T. Verdin E. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cleavage of HDAC7 at Asp375 would yield fragments containing distinct functional domains; the N-terminal transcription factor binding elements and nuclear localization signal (NLS) would be separated from the histone deacetylase (HDAC) domain and nuclear export signal (NES; Fig. 1B). Cleavage may also disrupt the 14-3-3-binding site. Phylogenic and primary sequence analysis demonstrate that the caspase-8 cleavage site is conserved in other mammalian HDAC7 proteins, although it is not found in the more distantly related HDAC7 from chickens (Fig. 1, C and D). Indeed the chicken HDAC7 protein appears to be more closely related to the other class IIa histone deacetylase family members and the ancestral yeast class II histone deacetylase gene product (yHDA1), which do not contain the predicted cleavage site.Caspase-8 Cleaves HDAC7 with Physiological Efficiency—Procaspase-3, procaspase-7, and Bid are physiological caspase-8 substrates, whose cleaved counterparts have integral roles as pro-apoptotic cell death mediators. We therefore determined the catalytic efficiency for caspase-8 against HDAC7 compared with these physiological substrates. HDAC7 was cleaved more efficiently than either Bid or procaspase-3. Under these experimental conditions, the EC50 value for HDAC7 cleavage was achieved with 10- and 20-fold less caspase-8 than for Bid and procaspase-3, respectively (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, HDAC7 is the best caspase-8 substrate described to date.FIGURE 2HDAC7 is cleaved as efficiently as physiological caspase-8 substrates. A, caspase-3 C285A (5 nm, top), GST-Bid (25 nm, middle), or HDAC7-FLAG (bottom) was incubated with 0–1 μm caspase-8 in a ½ dilution series for 30 min at 37 °C. Asterisks indicate nonspecific recognition of caspase-8 large and small subunits by the caspase-3 antibody. Arrowheads indicate caspase-8 concentration at which half the substrate was cleaved (EC50). B, HDAC7-FLAG or 25 nm p35 C2A was incubated with 50 nm of the indicated active site-titrated caspase for 30 min at 37 °C. Asterisk represents HDAC7-FLAG that may be translated from a minor internal initiator methionine. C, conditions are as in B, with (+) or without (-) 10% PEG 6000. D, HDAC7-FLAG was incubated with 0–150 nm caspase in a ½ dilution series for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Considering all caspases can cleave substrates after aspartic acid residues, it was important to determine whether caspases other than caspase-8 can also cleave HDAC7. In standard caspase buffer, HDAC7 was also cleaved by the executioner caspases-3, -6, and -7 (Fig. 2B). An inactive mutant of p35, a baculovirus protein with broad reactivity with caspases, served as a positive control for caspase activity. Recombinant initiator caspases-2 and -8–10 are in a dynamic equilibrium between an inactive monomer and an active dimer. In a buffer that promotes full initiator caspase activity (caspase buffer plus 10% (w/v) PEG 6000), caspase-9 could also cleave HDAC7 to some degree, with caspases-8 and -10 being most efficient (Fig. 2C). When comparing the efficiency with which other caspases cleave HDAC7, the ranking is caspase-8 = caspase-7 > caspase-6 > caspase-3 (Fig. 2D).Exogenous HDAC7 Is Cleaved in Cells Undergoing Caspase-8-mediated Apoptosis—To determine whether endogenously activated caspase-8 can cleave HDAC7, we transfected HEK293 cells with HDAC7-FLAG and induced apoptosis with TRAIL. Greater than 50% of HDAC7-FLAG was cleaved within 2 h of TRAIL treatment (Fig. 3A). Indeed HDAC7-FLAG cleavage was evident before significant PARP cleavage, indicating it is an early event in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Only one C-terminal FLAG-tagged fragment was detected at ∼63 kDa, consistent with a single cleavage at Asp375. Transfection of HDAC7-FLAG D375A confirmed that cleavage was because of proteolys"
https://openalex.org/W2153499068,"Background Iron supplementation is employed to treat post-malarial anaemia in environments where iron deficiency is common. Malaria induces an intense inflammatory reaction that stalls reticulo-endothelial macrophagal iron recycling from haemolysed red blood cells and inhibits oral iron absorption, but the magnitude and duration of these effects are unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the red blood cell incorporation of oral administered stable isotopes of iron and compared incorporation between age matched 18 to 36 months old children with either anaemia post-malaria (n = 37) or presumed iron deficiency anaemia alone (n = 36). All children were supplemented for 30 days with 2 mg/kg elemental iron as liquid iron sulphate and administered 57Fe and 58Fe on days 1 and 15 of supplementation respectively. 57Fe and58Fe incorporation were significantly reduced (8% vs. 28%: p<0.001 and 14% vs. 26%: p = 0.045) in the malaria vs. non-malaria groups. There was a significantly greater haemoglobin response in the malaria group at both day 15 (p = 0.001) and 30 (p<0.000) with a regression analysis estimated greater change in haemoglobin of 7.2 g/l (s.e. 2.0) and 10.1 g/l (s.e. 2.5) respectively. Conclusion/Significance Post-malaria anaemia is associated with a better haemoglobin recovery despite a significant depressant effect on oral iron incorporation which may indicate that early erythropoetic iron need is met by iron recycling rather than oral iron. Supplemental iron administration is of questionable utility within 2 weeks of clinical malaria in children with mild or moderate anaemia."
https://openalex.org/W1984634028,"Mice lacking protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ) are hypersensitive to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections; however, the mechanism of PKCϵ coupling to the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), responsible for pathogen detection, is poorly understood. Here we sought to investigate the mechanism of PKCϵ involvement in TLR signaling and found that PKCϵ is recruited to TLR4 and phosphorylated on two recently identified sites in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Phosphorylation at both of these sites (Ser-346 and Ser-368) resulted in PKCϵ binding to 14-3-3β. LPS-induced PKCϵ phosphorylation, 14-3-3β binding, and recruitment to TLR4 were all dependent on expression of the scaffold protein MyD88. In mouse embryo fibroblasts and activated macrophages from MyD88 knock-out mice, LPS-stimulated PKCϵ phosphorylation was reduced compared with wild type cells. Acute knockdown of MyD88 in LPS-responsive 293 cells also resulted in complete loss of Ser-346 phosphorylation and TLR4/PKCϵ association. By contrast, MyD88 overexpression in 293 cells resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of PKCϵ. A general role for MyD88 was evidenced by the finding that phosphorylation of PKCϵ was induced by the activation of all TLRs tested that signal through MyD88 (i.e. all except TLR3) both in RAW cells and in primary human macrophages. Functionally, it is established that phosphorylation of PKCϵ at these two sites is required for TLR4- and TLR2-induced NFκB reporter activation and IκB degradation in reconstituted PKCϵ–/– cells.

TLRs signal through Toll-IL1-R (TIR) domain-containing adaptor proteins that are recruited to receptor TIR domains upon ligand binding (2Miggin S.M. O'Neill L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 80: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Of five TIR domain-containing adaptors identified in humans, MyD88 has been shown to be involved in signal transduction for all TLRs except TLR3 (3Jiang Z. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Nie H. Silva A.M.

MyD88 deficiency in macrophages and dendritic cells leads to loss of MAPK activation, NFκB activation, and proinflammatory cytokine production in response to various TLR ligands (5Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2837) Google Scholar, 6Hemmi H. Kaisho T.

However, some responses downstream of TLR4 are either only delayed (NFκB and MAPK activation) or not affected (INFβ production) in MyD88-deficient cells (8Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). These constitute MyD88-independent pathways and have led to the identification of other adaptor proteins. MyD88 adaptor-like (Mal) and Toll-IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) work as bridging adaptors for MyD88 and TRIF to activate NFκB and IRF3, respectively. Mal/MyD88 signal from TLR2/TLR4 to regulate NFκB activation (MyD88-dependent), whereas TRAM/TRIF signal to IRF3 in response to TLR4 activation (MyD88-independent) (9Sheedy F.J. O'Neill L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 82: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The specificity in the activation of transcription factors by different TLRs using common signaling pathways is therefore achieved by differential use of adaptor proteins. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of closely related serine/threonine kinases that regulate diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, immunity, and apoptosis (10Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 11Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Based on the cofactor requirements, the PKC family is classified into three subfamilies as follows: conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) regulated by diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and calcium; novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, θ, and η) regulated by diacylglycerol and phosphatidylserine; and atypical PKCs (ζ and λ/ι) that do not require diacylglycerol for activation (12Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Studies in mice lacking different PKC isoforms have established an important role for PKCs in intracellular immune signaling (reviewed in Ref. 13Tan S.L. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). PKCβ knock-out mice have an immunodeficiency because of defective B cell activation (14Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), whereas PKCθ is required for T cell receptor-mediated T cell activation (15Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A. Schwartzberg P.L. Littman D.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in PKCδ and PKCζ have defective B cell anergy and NFκB signaling, respectively (16Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. Garcia J.F. Camacho F. Diaz-Meco M.T. Rennert P.D.

Pennington D.J. Otto F. Parker P.J. Owen M.J. Bosca L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). LPS and INFγ-induced nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL1β, and prostaglandin E2 production in PKCϵ–/– macrophages is reduced, and this is attributed to the impaired NFκB activation upstream of IκB kinase β. Other PKC isoforms have also been implicated in TLR signaling. PKCα is involved in LPS- and poly(I-C)-induced NF-IL6 (19Chano F. Descoteaux A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2897-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and IRF3 (20Johnson J. Albarani V. Nguyen M. Goldman M. Willems F. Aksoy E. J. Biol.

LPS-induced MAPK activation, tumor necrosis factor-α production, and NFκB activation were shown to be PKCζ-dependent in different cell types (21Cuschieri J. Umanskiy K. Solomkin J. J. Surg. Res. 2004; 121: 76-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Dallot E. Mehats C. Oger S. Leroy M.J. Breuiller-Fouche M.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, involvement of PKCϵ in MKP-1 and IL12 induction in response to LPS stimulation in macrophages and dendritic cells, respectively, has been demonstrated (24Aksoy E. Amraoui Z. Goriely S. Goldman M. Willems F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3040-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Comalada M. Soler C. Celada A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Despite many studies implicating PKC isoforms in TLR signaling, there is little evidence on the mechanism of their involvement. Recently, TRAM has been identified as a substrate of PKCϵ, and its phosphorylation has been shown to regulate RANTES production through IRF3 activation (26McGettrick A.F. Brint E.K. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Rowe D.C. Golenbock D.T. Gay N.J. Fitzgerald K.A. O'Neill L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of PKCϵ activation in response to LPS remains obscure, and although TRAM phosphorylation by PKCϵ was required for it to signal, the exact function of this phosphorylation remains elusive. Similarly, Kubo-Murai et al. (27Kubo-Murai M. Hazeki K. Sukenobu N. Yoshikawa K. Nigorikawa K. Inoue K. Yamamoto T. Matsumoto M. Seya T. Inoue N. Hazeki O. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have shown recently that PKCδ binds to Mal, and this binding promotes TLR2 and TLR4 signaling to p38 MAPK and IκB. We have recently identified novel phosphorylation sites (Ser-346 and Ser-368) in the V3 region of PKCϵ that regulate its association with 14-3-3β. 3A. T. Saurin, J. Durgan, A. J. Cameron, A. Faisal, M. S. Marber, and P. J. Parker (2008) Nat. Cell. Biol., in press. Phosphorylation at these sites occurs sequentially through p38 (Ser-350) followed by GSK-3β (Ser-346) and auto-phosphorylation or classic PKC trans-phosphorylation (Ser-368) (43Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Saurin A.T. Hanrahan S. Totty N. Messing R.O. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The subsequent binding of 14-3-3β is required for efficient separation of cells at the end of cytokinesis. Here we investigated the role of PKCϵ in TLR signaling and discovered that LPS induced both recruitment of PKCϵ to TLR4 and its phosphorylation at Ser-346 and Ser-368, resulting in its association with 14-3-3β. PKCϵ recruitment to TLR4, phosphorylation, and binding to 14-3-3β were all dependent on MyD88 expression. We therefore propose that MyD88 represents the missing link that couples PKCϵ to TLR4 in response to LPS.

Generation of phospho-specific antibodies to serine 346 and serine 368 were carried out essentially as described previously (28Durgan J. Michael N. Totty N. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using the immunogens DRSKS(P)APTS and KIT-NS(P)GQRR, respectively. All other reagents were from Sigma. Plasmids—GFP-PKCϵ WT, GFP-PKCϵ regulatory domain, Myc PKCϵ WT, and PKCϵ mutants in pEGFP-C1 and in pCDNA4/TO vectors were constructed by PCR and subcloning and were sequence-verified. The PKCϵ regulatory domain construct was cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector. The human MyD88 construct was provided by Dr. Shizu Akira. The cDNA was re-cloned into pCDNA 3.1 and pCMV 2B vectors by PCR cloning and then sequence-verified. GST-14-3-3-β was from Professor Alastair Aitken. FLAG- and YFP-tagged TLR (TLR2, -3, and -4) constructs were a kind gift from Professor Golenbock. IRF3-dependent luciferase reporter construct, pGL3–561 (29Grandvaux N. Servant M.J. tenOever B.

Cells and Transfections—293 cells stably expressing human TLR4, MD2, and CD14 (referred to as 293/hTLR4) were purchased from Invivogen. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 10 μg/ml blasticidin, and 50 μg/ml Hygro-Gold at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 10% CO2. PKCϵ–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) have been described earlier (30Ivaska J. Whelan R.D. Watson R. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3608-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas MEFs from MyD88–/– mice were isolated from 12-day-old embryos and maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated by elutriation as described elsewhere (31Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. de Martin R. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8211-8215Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages for 3 days using 100 ng/ml recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PeproTech) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. 293/hTLR4 cells were transfected at ∼80% confluency with Lipofectamine 2000 or LTX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For NFκB reporter activation assays, cells were transfected with NFκB-TA-Luc (Clontech) and phRL-Renilla (Promega) at a 10:1 ratio using Lipofectamine LTX. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—∼70% confluent RAW cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with 10 μg/plate of the plasmid DNA (GFP-PKCϵ WT, Ser-346/S368A, S346A, S368A, or vector control) using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were split into 15-cm plates the next day and selected with 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) or 1 mg/ml G418 (depending on the constructs). Single clones were picked, and the rest were pooled and analyzed for GFP-PKCϵ expression by Western blot. PKCϵ MEFs stably expressing different GFP-PKCϵ constructs were generated by transfection and Zeocin selection of polyclonal populations. 3A. T. Saurin, J. Durgan, A. J. Cameron, A. Faisal, M. S. Marber, and P. J. Parker (2008) Nat. Cell. Biol., in press. siRNA Knockdown—MyD88-N siRNA duplex (Qiagen) targeted the N-terminal region (nucleotides 181–201) of human MyD88 and had the following sequence 5-CCGGCAACUGGAGACACAAdTdT-3 and 5-UUGUGUCUCCAGUUGCCGGdAdT-3. 2 × 105 293/hTLR4 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 50 nm siRNA using 5 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection with siRNA, cells were re-transfected with GFP-PKCϵ. For experiments investigating PKCϵ-TLR4 interaction after MyD88 knockdown, 60-mm plates were used, and 48 h after MyD88 siRNA transfection cells were co-transfected with GFP-PKCϵ and FLAG-TLR4. Cells were analyzed after a further 24 h. Immunoprecipitation, Pulldown, and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysis was carried out on ice with lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet from Roche Applied Science. Protein concentration was measured, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated by incubation at 4 °C with anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies as indicated for 2 h followed by a further 1-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose. Beads were washed twice with TNET (TNE + 1% Triton X-100) and once with TNE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) and boiled in LDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by 4–12% NuPAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. GST-14-3-3β pulldown assays were performed using bacterially expressed GST-14-3-3β-loaded glutathione beads. Native extracts were tumbled overnight at 4 °C prior to washing twice with TNET (TNE + 1% Triton X-100) and once with TNE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) and elution in LDS buffer. Isolation of Thioglycollate-elicited Peritoneal Macrophages—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated as described previously (18Castrillo A. Pennington D.J. Otto F. Parker P.J. Owen M.J. Bosca L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice (MyD88 knock-out and C57 black/6 WT) were injected with 3% thioglycollate intraperitoneally and sacrificed after 4 days. The peritoneum was flushed with sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (containing 5 mm EDTA), and the peritoneal suspension containing macrophages was carefully removed and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min. Cells were resuspended and seeded in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS in 10-cm plates at 37 °C with 10% CO2. After 1 h of incubation, nonadherent cells were removed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were used for experiments on the following day. LPS Triggers Phosphorylation of PKCϵ—The defective innate immunity of PKCϵ knock-out mice formally defines PKCϵ as a key regulator of TLR responses. For Gram-negative bacteria the relevant signaling paradigm involves LPS stimulation of TLR4; however, there is little direct evidence that TLR4 activation engages PKCϵ. Recent studies have identified two phosphorylation sites within the V3 region of PKCϵ that enable its binding to 14-3-3β and that are associated with the engagement of PKCϵ in signaling processes.3 To determine whether LPS activation of TLR4 triggers these responses, RAW 264.7 cells (here referred to as RAW cells) stably expressing GFP-PKCϵ were treated with LPS, and phosphorylation of PKCϵ was determined by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies. Phosphorylation of both the Ser-346 and Ser-368 sites was found to be induced in response to LPS (Fig. 1A); a similar induction was also seen in GFP-PKCϵ-transfected 293 cells stably expressing the human proteins TLR4, MD2, and CD14 (Fig. 1B). There is a degree of constitutive phosphorylation of PKCϵ at the Ser-368 site in both cell types; however, there is clear LPS-dependent induction. LPS also induced Ser-346 phosphorylation of GFP-PKCϵ in HEK 293 cells transiently expressing TLR4/MD2; however, no phosphorylation was observed in vector control transfected cells (data not shown). To test the response of the endogenous PKCϵ in terms of phosphorylation at Ser-346 and Ser-368, use was made of the 14-3-3β interaction of Ser-346/368 doubly phosphorylated PKCϵ (see below). Although this assay does not distinguish whether both sites are induced for the endogenous protein, in light of the observations above it is anticipated that both are increased (serum titers for the site-specific antisera were found to be inadequate for Western blotting the endogenous protein). Pulldown with GST-14-3-3β demonstrated that LPS induced an increased recovery of PKCϵ for both ectopic GFP-PKCϵ and the endogenous PKCϵ (Fig. 1C). A similar pulldown assay was used to demonstrate LPS-induced PKCϵ phosphorylation in primary human macrophages (Fig. 1D). The absolute requirement for dual 346/368 phosphorylation for the 14-3-3β interaction was confirmed through the use of single and double Ser → Ala mutants (Fig. 1E). The LPS-induced responses in RAW cells expressing GFP-PKCϵ were time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 1, F and G). For both the Ser-346 and Ser-368 sites the responses peak at 20–30 min, and both are effectively at basal levels by 2 h. As illustrated (Fig. 1F), the induction of Ser-346 and Ser-368 was >7- and >2-fold, respectively. Over a series of experiments the mean induction for Ser-346 was 7 ± 1.01- and 2.5 ± 0.16-fold for Ser-368. Consistent with the mechanism of Ser-346 phosphorylation in fibroblasts (Ser-350 phosphorylation by p38 primes Ser-346 for phosphorylation by GSK3-β; see below), activation site phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was induced and peaked just ahead of PKCϵ Ser-346 phosphorylation. After 30 min of stimulation, phosphorylation of Ser-346 was induced by as little as 10 ng/ml of LPS and was maximum at 25 ng/ml. LPS Induces PKCϵ Phosphorylation via p38γ/δ and GSK-3—Previous studies in fibroblasts have identified Ser-346 as a target for GSK-3, primed by p38α/β phosphorylation at Ser-350. To determine whether these same pathways account for the LPS-induced response in macrophages, cells were stimulated with LPS and various inhibitors assessed for their effects on Ser-346 phosphorylation. Three different GSK-3 inhibitors were found to block LPS-induced Ser-346 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A and data not shown for SB216763). Inhibition of all four p38 MAPK isoforms (with BIRB 796 (32Kuma Y. Sabio G. Bain J. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Cuenda A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19472-19479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar)) also blocked Ser-346 phosphorylation indicative of a priming role (Fig. 2B). However, the p38α/β-selective inhibitors failed to block LPS-induced PKCϵ Ser-346 phosphorylation (see further below). Previously, p38α/β have been implicated in UV-induced PKCϵ Ser-346 phosphorylation in fibroblasts.3 Hence the effect of LPS was investigated in MEFs expressing GFP-PKCϵ. As in RAW cells, pan-p38 MAPK inhibition blocked LPS-induced Ser-346 phosphorylation, whereas the p38α/β-selective inhibitors (SB203580 and SB202190) were not inhibitory (Fig. 2C). To confirm the specificity of this behavior, the UV response was re-assessed in MEFs in parallel to the LPS response. As shown in Fig. 2D, BIRB inhibited both the LPS- and UV-induced phosphorylation of PKCϵ at the Ser-346 site. However, whereas SB203580 inhibited the UV-induced response, it did not inhibit the LPS-induced response. These distinct patterns of behavior are indicative of selective activation and/or targeting of specific p38 MAPKs to the same priming phosphorylation of PKCϵ in response to distinct agonists. To assess the expected PKC dependence for Ser-368 phosphorylation, LPS- or LTA (TLR2 ligand; see further below)-stimulated cells were pretreated with BIMI (classic PKC + novel PKC inhibitor). Unexpectedly, no inhibition of Ser-368 phosphorylation was observed even at high BIMI concentration (Fig. 2E), although there was an inhibition by Go6976, a novel PKC inhibitor (data not shown) indicating that a distinct basophilic protein kinase is involved in the LPS response. Thus, although LPS triggers the phosphorylation of the 14-3-3β-binding sites of PKCϵ in both macrophages and fibroblasts, it does so via p38γ/δ + GSK-3 alongside an unknown basophilic kinase. This contrasts with the p38α/β + GSK-3 and PKC-dependent phosphorylation of these sites under other conditions.3 Notwithstanding this notable distinction, it is evident that LPS/TLR4 induce phosphorylation of PKCϵ in line with the established in vivo requirement for this kinase. Multiple TLR Ligands Trigger PKCϵ Phosphorylation—PKCϵ knockout mice are defective in the clearance of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To determine whether model Gram-positive ligands acting via TLR2 promote PKCϵ phosphorylation as determined above for LPS-TLR4, RAW cells were stimulated with either LTA or FSL-1 (TLR2/TLR6). Both ligands were found to increase PKCϵ Ser-346 and Ser-368 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), although the Ser-368 site was delayed relative to the Ser-346 site and induced only an ∼2-fold increase. In view of the conservation of this response, ligands engaging TLRs 1–9 were tested (Fig. 3B). All but the TLR3 ligand poly(I-C) stimulated PKCϵ Ser-346 phosphorylation. To ensure that poly(I-C) was acting via TLR3, 293/hTLR4 cells were transfected with TLR3 or TLR4, and responses to poly(I-C) and LPS were monitored. LPS-induced phosphorylation of Ser-346 in TLR4 expressing cells was observed, but no such response to poly(I-C) in TLR3-expressing cells was seen (Fig. 3C). However, poly(I-C) did induce an IRF-3-dependent reporter response in TLR3-expressing cells but not in cells expressing TLR4 (Fig. 3D). Thus a functionally linked TLR3 receptor is not linked to PKCϵ phosphorylation. A similar PKCϵ response was observed for primary human macrophages. In freshly isolated macrophages challenged with LPS, LTA, poly(I-C), or flagellin, an increase in PKCϵ phosphorylation at both Ser-346 and Ser-368 was observed with all ligands except poly(I-C) (TLR3) as indicated by PKCϵ binding to GST-14-3-3β (Fig. 3E). The induction observed for LTA was ∼2-fold compared with the 4–6-fold induction for LPS and flagellin. As noted above these responses are indicative of ligand-induced PKCϵ phosphorylation at 346/368 sites, although we cannot distinguish the changes in the individual sites by this procedure. MyD88 Links PKCϵ to TLRs—The pattern of PKCϵ responses to these TLRs parallels their engagement of MyD88, i.e. all but TLR3. To test whether MyD88 was responsible for linking PKCϵ to TLRs, cells from MyD88 knock-out mice were tested for responses to LPS using capture on GST-14-3-3β beads to monitor endogenous PKCϵ Ser-346/Ser-368 phosphorylation as evidenced by the increased recovery of PKCϵ complexed to 14-3-3β. By contrast to MyD88-replete MEFs, no response to LPS was observed in MyD88 knock-out cells (Fig. 4A). Peritoneally elicited macrophages from WT mice also responded to LPS with a substantial increase in PKCϵ recovered in a 14-3-3β pulldown, equivalent to that observed with the potent combination of TPA/calyculin. By contrast there was no LPS-induced recovery of PKCϵ from the MyD88 knock-out macrophages, despite a “WT” response to TPA/calyculin (Fig. 4B). The evidence from the knock-out model demonstrates a requirement for MyD88 in the TLR4-triggered PKCϵ response. To confirm this in an acute model, siRNAs to MyD88 were employed to knock down MyD88 expression. As illustrated in Fig. 4C, siRNA knockdown of MyD88 also abrogated the LPS-induced PKCϵ Ser-346 phosphorylation. The specificity of the effect of MyD88 knockdown on Ser-346 phosphorylation was confirmed by rescue experiments with mouse MyD88. As shown in Fig. 4D, re-expression of mouse MyD88 in cells with knockdown of endogenous MyD88 by human-specific siRNA rescued the Ser-346 phosphorylation. Interestingly, when FLAG-tagged MyD88 or untagged MyD88 is overexpressed in 293/hTLR4 cells, constitutively high Ser-346 phosphorylation is observed with no further increase in LPS stimulation (Figs. 4, E and F). This reflects elevated p38 phosphorylation in these MyD88 overexpressing cells (data not shown). PKCϵ Is Complexed with TLR4 via MyD88—The adaptor role of MyD88 and its requirement for linking PKCϵ to TLR4 suggested that PKCϵ may be physically associated with the (active) receptor. By employing FLAG-tagged TLR4, it was found that a fraction of co-expressed GFP-PKCϵ or myc-PKCϵ (Fig. 5A) could be recovered in TLR4 immunoprecipitates in an LPS-inducible manner; much lower levels of PKCϵ were recovered in anti-FLAG control immunoprecipitates (data not shown and see Fig. 5B).

This action is regulated by sequential phosphorylation by the kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) at sites that are hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer disease. The increased phosphorylation in Alzheimer disease could be due to increases in Cdk5 and/or GSK3 activity or, alternatively, through decreased activity of a CRMP phosphatase. Here we establish that dephosphorylation of CRMP2 at the residues targeted by GSK3 (Ser-518/Thr-514/Thr-509) is carried out by a protein phosphatase 1 family member in vitro, in neuroblastoma cells, and primary cortical neurons. Inhibition of GSK3 activity using insulin-like growth factor-1 or the highly selective inhibitor CT99021 causes rapid dephosphorylation of CRMP2 at these sites. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of Cdk5 using purvalanol results in only a gradual and incomplete dephosphorylation of CRMP2 at the site targeted by Cdk5 (Ser-522), suggesting a distinct phosphatase targets this residue. A direct comparison of dephosphorylation at the Cdk5 versus GSK3 sites in vitro shows that the Cdk5 site is comparatively resistant to phosphatase treatment. The presence of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase enzyme, Pin1, does not affect dephosphorylation of Ser-522 in vitro, in cells, or in Pin1 transgenic mice. Instead, the relatively high resistance of this site to phosphatase treatment is at least in part due to the presence of basic residues located nearby. Similar sequences in Tau are also highly resistant to phosphatase treatment. We propose that relative resistance to phosphatases might be a common feature of Cdk5 substrates and could contribute to the hyperphosphorylation of CRMP2 and Tau observed in Alzheimer disease.

Phosphorylation by Cdk5 at Ser-522 “primes” CRMP2 for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3 at Ser-518/Thr-514/Thr-509. CRMP1 is also a substrate for Cdk5 and GSK3. The physiological priming kinase for subsequent GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of CRMP4 has not yet been determined, although this function can be performed by DYRK2 in vitro (14Cole A.R. Causeret F.

Alternatively, because phosphatases are equally important for regulating phosphorylation levels, increased CRMP2 phosphorylation could occur in response to reduced phosphatase activity. Hence, we investigated the regulation of CRMP2 dephosphorylation at these important sites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Production of CRMP2 cDNA constructs, GST-CRMP2 fusion proteins, and CRMP2 antibodies have been described previously (11Cole A.R.

The CRMP2(K520A) mutant was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), confirmed by direct sequencing, then expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells as a GST-tagged protein (pGEX-6 vector). Generation of Pin1 wild type and mutant constructs as well as recombinant His6-Pin1 has been described (21Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The protein phosphatases PP1γ, PP2A1, and PP2C as well as His6-GSK3β were supplied by the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee. PP2A and PP2C were assayed using 32P-labeled casein. A milliunit of activity is that amount which removes 1 nmol of phosphate from phosphocasein/min (at 30 °C). Active PP2B was purchased from Promega UK Ltd as a heterocomplex of the 19-kDa calcium binding subunit and the 61-kDa catalytic subunit. One unit is that amount that removes 1 nmol of phosphate from p-nitrophenyl phosphate/min. The His6-Cdk5·p35 complex was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. The GSK3-specific inhibitor CT99021 was prepared as described previously (14Cole A.R. Causeret F. Yadirgi G. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. McManus E.J. Hernandez F. Eickholt B.J. Nikolic M. Sutherland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16591-16598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas IGF1 was purchased from Invitrogen. Purvalanol, okadaic acid, calyculin A, cypermethrin, and cyclosporin A were obtained from Calbiochem. Tau-5, Ser(P)-404, and Thr(P)-231 Tau antibodies were purchased from Chemicon, whereas AT8 and Ser(P)-396 antibodies were obtained from Innogenetics and Cell Signaling, respectively.In Vitro Phosphatase Assays—For analysis of CRMP2-Ser-522 dephosphorylation, GST-CRMP2 (2 μm) was phosphorylated using Cdk5 (2.5 milliunits/μl) in the presence of radiolabeled Mg-[γ-32P]ATP in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% (v/v) Brij-35, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol (30 °C, 1 h). Cdk5 activity was inhibited by the addition of purvalanol (50 μm), then phosphatase was added at the indicated amounts to phosphorylated CRMP2 (1 μm) for up to 1 h at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS loading buffer then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled bands were visualized by autoradiography and excised from the gel, and the amount of 32P released from CRMP2 was determined using Cerenkov counting. For analysis of CRMP2-Ser-518/Thr-514/Thr-509 dephosphorylation, CRMP2 was phosphorylated by Cdk5 in the presence of unlabeled ATP as described above. Purvalanol was added to inhibit Cdk5 activity, then GSK3β (2.5 milliunits/μl) and radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP was added for a further 1 h at 30 °C. GSK3β activity was inhibited by the addition of CT99021 (10 μm), then phosphatases (50 milliunits) were added for 1 h. Release of 32P from CRMP2 by phosphatases was performed as described above.Dephosphorylation of Endogenous CRMP2 in Rat Brain Lysate—Adult rat brains were homogenized using a 10-ml glass Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) (4 °C). After centrifugation to remove insoluble material, supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates containing a mixture of endogenous phosphatases were diluted to 1 mg/ml and incubated on ice or at 30 °C for 1 h in the absence or presence of 1 mm MgCl2 (to re-activate PP1 (23Yang S.D. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. FEBS Lett. 1981; 126: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) and/or 100 nm calyculin A and/or 1 mm EGTA or 10 mm CaCl2. In addition, the lysate was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h as an undiluted solution (3.3 mg/ml), diluted 1/5 in lysis buffer (0.67 mg/ml), or diluted 1/25 (0.13 mg/ml). All reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS loading buffer, and proteins were visualized by Western blotting.Cell Culture—SH-SY5Y, HEK293 cells, and primary cortical neurons isolated from P1 rat pups were maintained as previously described (11Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J. Connolly C.N. Sutherland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50176-50180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 μm purvalanol or 2 μm CT99021 for the times indicated or the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (10 nm or 1 μm), calyculin A (10 nm), cypermethrin (10 μm), and cyclosporin A (10 μm) for up to 45 min (longer periods caused cell death). SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight before the addition of 50 ng/ml IGF1. When IGF1 and inhibitors were combined, cells were pretreated with okadaic acid (10 nm), EGTA (10 mm), BAPTA-AM (10 μm), or calyculin A (10 nm) for at least 15 min, then 50 ng/ml IGF1 was added for a further 30 min. For transfection experiments, SH-SY5Y or HEK293 cells were grown in 6-cm dishes and transfected with 4 μg (total) of cDNA using Lipofectamine2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed by incubating lysates with 30 μl of a 50% (v/v) slurry of anti-FLAG-agarose or microcystin-Sepharose beads (2 h, 4 °C). After extensive washing, SDS loading buffer was added to the beads, and interacting proteins or CRMP2 phosphorylation levels were detected by Western blotting.Co-immunoprecipitation in Vitro—Equal amounts (2.5 μg) of recombinant PP1 and CRMP2 (non-phosphorylated or pre-phosphorylated by Cdk5 and GSK3β) were incubated in 150 μl of kinase buffer containing 100 nm calyculin A for 10 min at room temperature followed by 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 25 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were washed four times, then analyzed by Western blotting.Gel Filtration Chromatography—Rat brain lysate (0.5 ml, 6 mg/ml) was loaded onto a Superdex™ 200 HR 10/300 column equilibrated in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.03% (v/v) Brij-35, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm NaF, and 5 mm Na4P2O7), and proteins were separated at 0.4 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Fractions containing CRMP2 and CRMP4 were identical (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar, 23Yang S.D. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. FEBS Lett. 1981; 126: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These were pooled, and protein concentrations were measured before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.RESULTSPP1 Antagonizes GSK3 Phosphorylation of CRMP2—To determine the class of phosphatase(s) that most efficiently removes phosphate from Ser-518/Thr-514/Thr-509 of CRMP2, recombinant CRMP2 was first phosphorylated at Ser-522 (primed) by Cdk5 in the presence of unlabeled ATP (Fig. 1A). GSK3 did not phosphorylate CRMP2 at Ser-522 (Fig. 1A), whereas CDK5 did not phosphorylate Thr-514/Thr-509 to any great extent (Fig. 1B). Subsequent incubation of the primed CRMP2 by GSK3β resulted in phosphorylation of Ser-518/Thr-514/Thr-509 (Fig. 1B). Previously we showed that GSK3 will not incorporate phosphate into a mutant CRMP2-S522A (11Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J. Connolly C.N. Sutherland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50176-50180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Therefore, incubation of primed CRMP2 with radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP, GSK3, and a Cdk5 inhibitor ensured that only Ser-518/Thr-514/Thr-509, and not the priming site (Ser-522) or any other residues on CRMP2, were radiolabeled. Equal activities (50 milliunits) of a representative of each of the four major classes of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) were incubated with this radiolabeled CRMP2, and the amount of 32P remaining in CRMP2 was visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 1C) and measured by Cerenkov counting (Fig. 1D). In addition, release of phosphate specifically from these residues was assessed by immunoblot (Fig. 1E). CRMP2 was completely dephosphorylated by PP1, partially by PP2A and PP2C, and not at all by PP2B.Next, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with inhibitors of each class of phosphatase, and CRMP2 phosphorylation was monitored by immunoblot. A low concentration of okadaic acid (OA, 10 nm) inhibits PP2A, whereas a high concentration (1 μm) inhibits both PP2A and PP1 (dissociation constants (Ki) of 0.032 and 147 nm, respectively (24Takai A. Sasaki K. Nagai H. Mieskes G. Isobe M. Isono K. Yasumoto T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar)). Calyculin A (CA, 10 nm) inhibits both PP1 and PP2A, whereas cyclosporin A and cypermethrin are PP2B inhibitors. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with these inhibitors for 30 min (longer periods induced cell death) revealed that phosphorylation of CRMP2 at the GSK3 sites was significantly increased by treatment with CA and a high concentration of OA, but not a low concentration of OA, cyclosporin A, or cypermethrin (Fig. 2). The basal phosphorylation of CRMP2 was also increased by CA treatment of primary rat cortical neurons (Fig. 2C). Incubation of a rat brain lysate at 30 °C induced partial dephosphorylation of endogenous CRMP2 by endogenous phosphatases, which was blocked by co-incubation with CA (Fig. 2D). Dephosphorylation of CRMP2 was enhanced by addition of Mg2+ (promotes PP1 activity (23Yang S.D. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. FEBS Lett. 1981; 126: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)), and this was also blocked by CA. The rate of dephosphorylation was not influenced by the presence of EGTA (a calcium chelator) or the addition of exogenous calcium (Fig. 2E). Together, these observations indicate that the major phosphatase that dephosphorylates CRMP2 at the sites targeted by GSK3 in vitro and in cells is a PP1 family member.FIGURE 2Dephosphorylation of CRMP2 in cells. A, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were incubated with DMSO (control), okadaic acid (10 nm or 1 μm), calyculin A (CA, 10 nm), cypermethrin (Cyp, 10 μm), or cyclosporin A (Cyc, 10 μm) for 30 min. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using Thr(P)-514/509 (upper panel) and total CRMP2 (lower panel) antibodies. The ratio of phospho-CRMP2/total CRMP2 in cells treated with okadaic acid or calyculin A compared with control cells is presented in B (n = 3; *, p < 0.05 relative to control (Students t test); average ± S.D.). C, primary rat cortical neurons were treated without or with calyculin A (10 nm), then cell lysates were immunoblotted as described in A. D, rat brain lysate was left on ice (lane 1) or incubated at 30 °C for 1 h (lanes 2-5) in the presence of 10 nm calyculin A (lane 3), 1 mm MgCl2 (lane 4), or 10 nm calyculin A plus 1 mm MgCl2 (lane 5). The lysates were immunoblotted as described in A. E, same as D, except lysates were incubated in the presence of 1 mm EGTA or 10 mm CaCl2 as shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with CT99021, a highly selective inhibitor of GSK3, or with IGF1, an established physiological inhibitor of GSK3 activity and CRMP2 phosphorylation (14Cole A.R. Causeret F. Yadirgi G. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. McManus E.J. Hernandez F. Eickholt B.J. Nikolic M. Sutherland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16591-16598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), in the absence and presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Dephosphorylation of CRMP2 in response to CT99021 was blocked by co-incubating cells with CA (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, dephosphorylation of CRMP2 in response to IGF1 was blocked by CA (Fig. 3, C and D) but not a low concentration of OA (Fig. 3, E and F). Finally, exposing cells to extracellular (EGTA) or intracellular (BAPTA-AM) calcium chelators did not alter basal CRMP2 phosphorylation or the response of CRMP2 and protein kinase B phosphorylation to IGF1 (Fig. 3G). In theory, dephosphorylation of CRMP2 after IGF1 treatment of cells could be mediated by inactivation of GSK3 and/or activation of PP1. To investigate this further, primary cortical neurons were isolated from GSK3 “knock-in” mice, in which the regulatory phosphorylation sites on GSK3α (Ser-21) and GSK3β (Ser-9) were changed to alanine; thus, GSK3 could no longer be inhibited by IGF1 signaling (26McManus E.J. Sakamoto K. Armit L.J. Ronaldson L. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These were stimulated with IGF1, and the phosphorylation of CRMP2 was measured. In contrast to wild type neurons, the phosphorylation of CRMP2 was unaltered in the IGF1-treated GSK3-KI neurons despite efficient activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B pathway, as shown by robust phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB) at Ser-473 (Fig. 3H). The same is observed after BDNF stimulation (data not shown). This demonstrates that dephosphorylation of CRMP2 (at 518/514/509) in neurons treated with growth factors results from inactivation of GSK3 and requires only basal activity of PP1.FIGURE 3CT99021- and IGF1-induced dephosphorylation of CRMP2 requires PP1 activity. A, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated without (lanes 1 and 3) or with 10 nm calyculin A (lanes 2 and 4) for 15 min followed by the addition of 2 μm CT99021 (CT) for a further 30 min.

In addition, the membranes were incubated with antibodies that specifically recognize protein kinase B when phosphorylated at Ser-473 or an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated and unphosphorylated protein kinase B equally well (loading control). The phosphorylation level of protein kinase B and CRMP2 is presented relative to unstimulated controls after correction for loading (average ± S.D.; n.s., not significant; *, p < 0.002 relative to control (Student's t test); primary neuron preparations from at least seven different animals for each genotype). WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CRMP2 and PP1 Do Not Form a Stable Complex in Cells—Dephosphorylation of CRMP2 in IGF1-treated neurons was rapid (<10-15 min), so we hypothesized that PP1 might form a stable complex with CRMP2 to result in such a rapid dephosphorylation upon inactivation of GSK3. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged CRMP2, then lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose to isolate FLAG-CRMP2 and any interacting proteins. PP1 was not detectable in the precipitates (Fig. 4A) in the presence or absence of IGF1 or upon expression of wild type or a non-phosphorylatable mutant, CRMP2-S522A (Fig. 4A). Similarly, non-transfected SH-SY5Y lysates treated with or without IGF1 were incubated with microcystin-Sepharose beads to isolate endogenous PP1 (as well as PP2A), and CRMP2 was not detectable in these precipitates (Fig. 4B). In a separate experiment, recombinant GST-CRMP2 (phosphorylated or dephosphorylated) and His6-PP1 were co-incubated in vitro then isolated using glutathione-Sepharose (CRMP2) or Ni+-Sepharose (PP1). Reciprocal pulldown analysis confirmed that there was no significant direct interaction between these two proteins irrespective of phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, incubation of various dilutions of rat brain lysate at 30 °C resulted in different rates of dephosphorylation of endogenous CRMP2. If PP1 was part of a stable complex with CRMP2, the amount of CRMP2 dephosphorylation should not correlate with dilution factor. However, upon the addition of Mg2+ there was significantly greater dephosphorylation of CRMP2 at low (1/1) dilution compared with a highly diluted (1/25) lysate (supplemental Fig. 2). To"
https://openalex.org/W2092004666,"Osteoclasts, cells responsible for bone resorption, contribute to the development of degenerative, metabolic and neoplastic bone diseases, which are often characterized by persistent changes in bone microenvironment. We aimed to investigate the dynamics of osteoclast formation and death in cultures that considerably exceeded the length of standard protocol and to design a mathematical model describing osteoclastogenesis.RAW 264.7 monocytic cells fuse to form multinucleated osteoclasts upon treatment with pro-resorptive cytokine RANKL. We have found that in long-term experiments (15-26 days), the dynamics of changes in osteoclast numbers was remarkably complex and qualitatively variable in different experiments. Whereas 19 of 46 experiments exhibited single peak of osteoclast formation, in 27 experiments we observed development of successive waves of osteoclast formation and death. Periodic changes in osteoclast numbers were confirmed in long-term cultures of mouse bone marrow cells treated with M-CSF and RANKL. Because the dynamics of changes in osteoclast numbers was found to be largely independent of monocytes, a two-species model of ordinary differential equations describing the changes in osteoclasts and monocytes was ineffective in recapitulating the oscillations in osteoclast numbers. Following experimental observation that medium collected from mature osteoclasts inhibited osteoclastogenesis in fresh cultures, we introduced a third variable, factor f, to describe osteoclast-derived inhibitor. This model allowed us to simulate the oscillatory changes in osteoclasts, which were coupled to oscillatory changes in the factor f, whereas monocytes changed exponentially. Importantly, to achieve the experimentally observed oscillations with increasing amplitude, we also had to assume that osteoclast presence stimulates osteoclast formation.This study identifies the critical role for osteoclast autocrine regulation in controlling long-term dynamic of osteoclast formation and death and describes the complementary roles for negative and positive feedback mediators in determining the sharp dynamics of activation and inactivation of osteoclasts."
https://openalex.org/W1970342224,"Zymogens of the chymotrypsin-like serine protease family are converted to the protease state following insertion of a newly formed, highly conserved N terminus. This transition is accompanied by active site formation and ordering of several surface loops in the catalytic domain. Here we show that disruption of this transition in factor X through mutagenesis (FXa(I16L) and FXa(V17A)) not only alters active site function, but also significantly impairs Na(+) and factor Va binding. Active site binding was improved in the presence of high NaCl or with saturating amounts of factor Va membranes, suggesting that allosteric linkage exists between these sites. In line with this, irreversible stabilization of FXa(I16L) with Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone fully rescued FVa binding. Furthermore, the K(m) for prothrombin conversion with the factor Xa variants assembled into prothrombinase was unaltered, whereas the k(cat) was modestly reduced (3- to 4-fold). These findings show that intramolecular activation of factor X following the zymogen to protease transition not only drives catalytic site activation but also contributes to the formation of the Na(+) and factor Va binding sites. This structural plasticity of the catalytic domain plays a key role in the regulation of exosite expression and prothrombinase assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2090490066,"Phylogenetic mitochondrial DNA haplogroups are highly partitioned across global geographic regions. A unique exception is the X haplogroup, which has a widespread global distribution without major regions of distinct localization.We have examined mitochondrial DNA sequence variation together with Y-chromosome-based haplogroup structure among the Druze, a religious minority with a unique socio-demographic history residing in the Near East. We observed a striking overall pattern of heterogeneous parental origins, consistent with Druze oral tradition, together with both a high frequency and a high diversity of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) X haplogroup within a confined regional subpopulation. Furthermore demographic modeling indicated low migration rates with nearby populations.These findings were enabled through the use of a paternal kindred based sampling approach, and suggest that the Galilee Druze represent a population isolate, and that the combination of a high frequency and diversity of the mtDNA X haplogroup signifies a phylogenetic refugium, providing a sample snapshot of the genetic landscape of the Near East prior to the modern age."
https://openalex.org/W1973555098,"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) and Ca(2+) are two ubiquitous second messengers in transduction pathways downstream of receptors for hormones, neurotransmitters and local signals. The availability of fluorescent Ca(2+) reporter dyes that are easily introduced into cells and tissues has facilitated analysis of the dynamics and spatial patterns for Ca(2+) signaling pathways. A similar dissection of the role of cAMP has lagged because indicator dyes do not exist. Genetically encoded reporters for cAMP are available but they must be introduced by transient transfection in cell culture, which limits their utility. We report here that we have produced a strain of transgenic mice in which an enhanced cAMP reporter is integrated in the genome and can be expressed in any targeted tissue and with tetracycline induction. We have expressed the cAMP reporter in beta-cells of pancreatic islets and conducted an analysis of intracellular cAMP levels in relation to glucose stimulation, Ca(2+) levels, and membrane depolarization. Pancreatic function in transgenic mice was normal. In induced transgenic islets, glucose evoked an increase in cAMP in beta-cells in a dose-dependent manner. The cAMP response is independent of (in fact, precedes) the Ca(2+) influx that results from glucose stimulation of islets. Glucose-evoked cAMP responses are synchronous in cells throughout the islet and occur in 2 phases suggestive of the time course of insulin secretion. Insofar as cAMP in islets is known to potentiate insulin secretion, the novel transgenic mouse model will for the first time permit detailed analyses of cAMP signals in beta-cells within islets, i.e. in their native physiological context. Reporter expression in other tissues (such as the heart) where cAMP plays a critical regulatory role, will permit novel biomedical approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2092853625,"Understanding fixed motor pattern diversity across related species provides a window for exploring the evolution of their underlying neural mechanisms. The electric organ discharges of weakly electric fishes offer several advantages as paradigmatic models for investigating how a neural decision is transformed into a spatiotemporal pattern of action. Here, we compared the far fields, the near fields and the electromotive force patterns generated by three species of the pulse generating New World gymnotiform genus Gymnotus. We found a common pattern in electromotive force, with the far field and near field diversity determined by variations in amplitude, duration, and the degree of synchronization of the different components of the electric organ discharges. While the rostral regions of the three species generate similar profiles of electromotive force and local fields, most of the species-specific differences are generated in the main body and tail regions of the fish. This causes that the waveform of the field is highly site dependant in all the studied species. These findings support a hypothesis of the relative separation of the electrolocation and communication carriers. The presence of early head negative waves in the rostral region, a species-dependent early positive wave at the caudal region, and the different relationship between the late negative peak and the main positive peak suggest three points of lability in the evolution of the electrogenic system: a) the variously timed neuronal inputs to different groups of electrocytes; b) the appearance of both rostrally and caudally innervated electrocytes, and c) changes in the responsiveness of the electrocyte membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2068068198,"Despite extensive study of heterochromatin, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which such a structure forms. We show that the Drosophila homologue of the human alpha-thalassemia and mental retardation X-linked protein (dATRX), is important in the formation or maintenance of heterochromatin through modification of position effect variegation. We further show that there are two isoforms of the dATRX protein, the longer of which interacts directly with heterochromatin protein 1 (dHP-1) through a CxVxL motif both in vitro and in vivo. These two proteins co-localise at heterochromatin in a manner dependent on this motif. Consistent with this observation, the long isoform of the dATRX protein localises primarily to the heterochromatin at the chromocentre on salivary gland polytene chromosomes, whereas the short isoform binds to many sites along the chromosome arms. We suggest that the establishment of a regular nucleosomal organisation may be common to heterochromatin and transcriptionally repressed chromatin in other locations, and may require the action of ATP dependent chromatin remodelling factors."
https://openalex.org/W2093160601,"Autologous keratincoytes are routinely expanded using irradiated mouse fibroblasts and bovine serum for clinical use. With growing concerns about the safety of these xenobiotic materials, it is desirable to culture keratinocytes in media without animal derived products. An improved understanding of epithelial/mesenchymal interactions could assist in this.A keratincyte/fibroblast o-culture model was developed by extending an agent-based keratinocyte colony formation model to include the response of keratinocytes to both fibroblasts and serum. The model was validated by comparison of the in virtuo and in vitro multicellular behaviour of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in single and co-culture in Greens medium. To test the robustness of the model, several properties of the fibroblasts were changed to investigate their influence on the multicellular morphogenesis of keratinocyes and fibroblasts. The model was then used to generate hypotheses to explore the interactions of both proliferative and growth arrested fibroblasts with keratinocytes. The key predictions arising from the model which were confirmed by in vitro experiments were that 1) the ratio of fibroblasts to keratinocytes would critically influence keratinocyte colony expansion, 2) this ratio needed to be optimum at the beginning of the co-culture, 3) proliferative fibroblasts would be more effective than irradiated cells in expanding keratinocytes and 4) in the presence of an adequate number of fibroblasts, keratinocyte expansion would be independent of serum.A closely associated computational and biological approach is a powerful tool for understanding complex biological systems such as the interactions between keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The key outcome of this study is the finding that the early addition of a critical ratio of proliferative fibroblasts can give rapid keratinocyte expansion without the use of irradiated mouse fibroblasts and bovine serum."
https://openalex.org/W2074246693,"Internal initiation of translation is the process of beginning protein synthesis independent of the m(7)G cap structure at the 5'-end of an mRNA molecule. We have previously shown that the URE2 mRNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) whose activity is suppressed by eukaryotic initiation factor 2A (eIF2A; YGR054W). In this study, the minimal sequence required to efficiently direct internal initiation was determined using a system that abrogates cap-dependent scanning of the 40 S ribosomal subunit in both wild-type and eIF2A knock-out cells. Subsequently, secondary structural elements within the minimal sequence were determined by probing with RNases T1 and V1 and the small molecule diethylpyrocarbonate. It was found that the URE2 minimal IRES comprises a 104 nucleotide A-rich stem loop element encompassing the internal AUG codon. Interestingly, the internal AUG seems to be involved in base-pairing interactions that would theoretically hamper its ability to interact with incoming initiator tRNA molecules. Furthermore, none of the truncations used to identify the minimal IRES element were capable of abrogating the suppressive effect of eIF2A. Our data provide the first insight into the RNA structural requirements of the yeast translational machinery for cap-independent initiation of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2094341702,"ATF5, a member of activating transcription factor (ATF)/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) family of b-ZIP transcription factors, contributes to neural cell differentiation and is involved in cell apoptosis in response to cisplatin and a number of environment factors. However, the mechanisms governing the regulation of ATF5 protein during apoptosis are largely unknown. In this study we reported that ATF5 protein was a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Interestingly, the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of exogenous ATF5 protein was independent of lysine residues. Instead, the addition of a large N-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein tag increased the stability of ATF5 protein, and the free amino acid group of the N-terminal methionine of ATF5 protein was a site for ubiquitinylation, indicating that exogenous ATF5 was degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system through N-terminal ubiquitinylation. Furthermore, cisplatin increased ATF5 protein expression via preventing its ubiquitin-dependent degradation, which might be associated with its promoting the nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 and reducing the interaction between ATF5 and Cdc34. In summary, a down-regulation of proteasome-mediated degradation of ATF5 might contribute to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, providing a new mechanism of cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

Accumulated data from our laboratory and other investigators indicated that ATF5 functions as an apoptosis-related protein in response to a number of environment factors and DNA damage (5Wei Y. Jiang J. Sun M. Chen X. Wang H. Gu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Persengiev S.P. Green M.R. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Interference with the function or expression of ATF5 in glioma cells leads to their death in vitro and in vivo (7Angelastro J.M. Canoll P.D. Kuo J. Weicker M. Costa A. Bruce J.N. Greene L.A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that ATF5 might be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma. Consistent with this, ATF5 was widely expressed in carcinomas, and interference with its function caused apoptotic cell death of neoplastic breast cell lines (8Monaco S.E. Angelastro J.M. Szabolcs M. Greene L.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 120: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATF5 functioned as an anti-apoptotic role in an interleukin 3-dependent cell line (9Persengiev S.P. Devireddy L.R. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). And, we have showed that ATF5 was up-regulated by cisplatin, and its overexpression increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (5Wei Y. Jiang J. Sun M. Chen X. Wang H. Gu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), indicating the pro-apoptotic role of ATF5 in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Previously, Pati et al. (10Pati D. Meistrich M.L. Plon S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5001-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showed that ATF5 interacted with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34. Cdc34 and RAD6 had been reported to be important components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the nucleus which was responsible for the degradation of some transcriptional factors (11Pintard L. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 856-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although the progress in ATF5-interacting partners, function, and their relation to some diseases have been made in recent years, the precise molecular mechanisms of ATF5 protein regulation during apoptosis are largely unknown. Cisplatin is a well known DNA-damaging agent and is widely used in the treatment of solid tumors, including testicular, ovarian, bladder, cervical, head and neck, and small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancers (12Perez R.P.

Recent studies provided evidence that the stability of many proteins including Bax, Bak, and p53 contributed to cisplatin cytotoxicity in cancer cells (15Jones N.A. Turner J. McIlwrath A.J. Brown R.

Consistent with this, the proteasome inhibitor PS-341, the representative of a new class of chemotherapeutic drugs, was capable of inducing apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant squamous cell carcinoma cell (18Fribley A.M. Evenchik B. Zeng Q. Park B.K. Guan J.Y. Zhang H. Hale T.J. Soengas M.S. Kaufman R.J. Wang C.Y. J. Biol.

Rached C. Chada S. Ramesh R. AACR Meeting Abstracts, Washington, April 2006. American Association for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, PA2006: 880-881Google Scholar). These data indicated that cisplatin might induce cell apoptosis by regulating the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of protein. In this study we provided evidence that ATF5 was degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and exogenous ATF5 was degraded via N-terminal ubiquitinylation. In addition, cisplatin increased ATF5 protein expression by preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation. Furthermore, we reported for the first time that cisplatin-reduced ubiquitin-dependent degradation of ATF5 might be associated with its promoting the nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation of Cdc34 and inhibiting the interaction between ATF5 and Cdc34. These data indicated that down-regulation of proteasome-mediated degradation of ATF5 ubiquitinylation might contribute to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, providing a new mechanism of cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

Cell Culture and Cell Transfection—HeLa, HEK293, and MDA231 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% air). Cell transfection was performed using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Expression constructs for HA-tagged Ub and C-terminal EGFP-tagged pEGFPN3-ATF5 have been described previously (20Yang Y. Liu W. Zou W. Wang H. Zong H. Jiang J. Wang Y. Gu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 101: 167-180Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 21Liu W. Sun M. Jiang J. Shen X. Sun Q. Liu W. Shen H. Gu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged ATF5 plasmid was constructed by inserting the ATF5 coding sequence into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the pcDNA3.1/myc(-) vector. The deletion mutants of ATF5 were designated as ΔC1 (aa 1–40), ΔC2 (aa 1–204), ΔN1 (aa 41–282), ΔN2 (aa 121–282), and ΔN3 (aa 205–282) and were constructed by PCR amplification using pcDNA3.0-ATF5 as a template and the listed primers: ΔC1 sense, 5′-ATAGAATTCATGTCACTCCTGGCGACCCTG-3′, and ΔC1 antisense, 5′-ATAGGATCCATAGGGAGCCAGGGGGGCA-3′; ΔC2 sense, 5′-ATAGAATTCATGTCACTCCTGGCGACCCTG-3′, and ΔC2 antisense, 5′-AATGGATCCGGCAGGATGTGGGTAGGGG-3′; ΔN1 sense, 5′-ATAGAATTCATGGAGGTCCTTGGGGGAG-3′, ΔN1 antisense, 5′-AATGGATCCGCAGCTACGGGTCCTCTGGC-3′; ΔN2 sense, 5′-ATAGAATTCATGCCCCTCCCACCACCCTCC-3′; ΔN3 sense, 5′-AAAGAATTCATGACCACCCGAGGGGACCGC-3′. To construct N-terminal EGEP-tagged pcDNA3.0-EGFP-ATF5 plasmid, the ATF5 coding sequence was inserted into the EcoRI/NotI sites of the pcDNA3.0-EGFP vector, which has been previously described (22Sun M. Wei Y. Yao L. Xie J. Chen X. Wang H. Jiang J. Gu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The point mutants of ATF5 were derived from pEGFPN3-ATF5 plasmid by PCR amplification using the TakaRa MutanBEST mutagenesis kit. Mutated constructs were sequenced, and correct ones were selected for further experiments. The prokaryotic expression plasmid pET23b-HA-ATF5 was constructed by inserting the coding sequence of HA-tagged ATF5 into the NdeI/XhoI sites of the pET23b vector. The recombinant plasmid pET23b-HA-Xa-ATF5, which contained an HA tag followed by a factor Xa protease cleavage site (lle-Glu-Gly-Arg) after the first methionine, was constructed using TakaRa MutanBEST mutagenesis kit. PcDNA3.0-Cdc34 plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification using pCS2+cdc34 plasmid (a kind gift from Carlos R. Herrera) as a template. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—Cells treated with 25 μm MG132 for 12 h were re-suspended in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mg/ml leupeptin) with 1% SDS to disrupt protein-protein interaction, boiled for 10 min, then diluted in 10 volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The lysates were sonicated at 4 °C and subsequently precleared with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were subsequently divided for individual immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed using Western blot assay. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—His-tagged ATF5 protein was purified from bacteria BL21. 50 μg of cell extracts was mixed with 20 μl of ATF5 protein and nickel-agarose in 120-μl reaction buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm ubiquitin-aldehyde, 1 mg/ml ubiquitin or FLAG-ubiquitin, 25 μm MG132) at 30 °C for 2 h with constant rotation. Reactions were carried out in the presence of either 0.5 mm ATP and an ATP regeneration system (10 mm phosphocreatine, 5 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase) or 50 units/ml hexokinase and 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose to deplete endogenous ATP. Then the nickel agarose was washed, and the bound proteins were eluted in protein sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. For Factor Xa cleavage, the protein was pretreated with Factor Xa for 16 h at 25 °C before SDS-PAGE analysis. Half-life Assay—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pEGFPN3-ATF5 construct or its mutants. 40 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 h. The cells were harvested, and 50 μg of cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-EGFP and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The protein levels were calculated using densitometry-analyzing software, and the values of ATF5 were plotted against the values of GAPDH. The ratio of ATF5/GAPDH at 0 h was taken as 100%. The assay was repeated independently at least three times. Determining the Expression Efficiency of Protein by Fluorescent Microscopy and Flow Cytometry—Cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in 0.5 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde. EGFP expression was analyzed by flow cytometry with excitation and emission settings of 488 and 530 nm, respectively. The assay was repeated independently at least three times. Immunofluorescence and confocal assay were performed as previously described (22Sun M. Wei Y. Yao L. Xie J. Chen X. Wang H. Jiang J. Gu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR and Co-immunoprecipitations—Reverse transcription-PCR was performed as described previously (5Wei Y. Jiang J. Sun M. Chen X. Wang H. Gu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Primers used for PCR were as follows: ATF5 sense, 5′-AAGTCGGCGGCTCTGAGGTA-3′, and ATF5 antisense, 5′-GGACTCTGCCCGTTCCTTCA-3′; P21 sense, 5′-GACACCACTGGAGGGTGACT-3′, and P21 antisense, 5′-GGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAA-3′. The co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays were performed as previously described. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein was isolated according to the method of Schreiber et al. (23Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Cisplatin Increases ATF5 Protein Expression by Inhibiting Its Ubiquitin-mediated Degradation—Our previous study showed that ATF5 protein was up-regulated during cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (5Wei Y. Jiang J. Sun M. Chen X. Wang H. Gu J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of cisplatin-induced ATF5 expression, ATF5 mRNA expression was examined using reverse transcription-PCR in HeLa cells treated with cisplatin at different concentration. The level of ATF5 mRNA expression did not significantly change in response to cisplatin, and the level of P21 mRNA expression was significantly increased in response to cisplatin, which was consistent with a previous report (24Funaoka K. Shindoh M. Yamashita T. Fujinaga K. Amemiya A. Totsuka Y. Cancer Lett. 1996; 108: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). These data indicated that cisplatin might regulate ATF5 expression at protein level. To verify if cisplatin caused accumulation of ATF5 by preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation, the level of ATF5 protein expression in HeLa cells pretreated with DMSO or proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 1 h followed by cisplatin treatment for 12 h was analyzed using Western blot assay. As expected, the ATF5 protein expression was increased by cisplatin in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–3). The positive effect of cisplatin on ATF5 protein expression was eliminated in the presence of MG132, although the total amount of ATF5 protein was increased after MG132 treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 4–6). The same experiments were performed in HEK293 (Fig. 1C) and MDA231 (Fig. 1D) cells, and similar results were obtained, indicating that cisplatin might regulate ATF5 expression via a proteasome-dependent degradation. Efficient degradation of proteins by the proteasome generally requires the conjugation of multiple molecules of ubiquitin to the substrate (25Hoff H. Zhang H. Sell C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 285: 79-92PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether ATF5 was ubiquitinylated in vivo, Myc-tagged ATF5 plasmid was transiently co-transfected into HeLa cells with HA-tagged ubiquitin. Followed by MG132 treatment, the Myc-tagged ATF5 was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. We detected a high molecular weight of HA-marked molecules whose intensity was increased by MG132 treatment (Fig. 1E, lane 3 versus lane 4). Furthermore, when the same sample was immunoblotted with anti-ATF5 antibody, the film demonstrated a similar ladder of ATF5 species (Fig. 1E, lanes 7 and 8). These results strongly suggested that ATF5 was poly-ubiquitinylated in vivo. Next, we investigated the contribution of cisplatin in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of ATF5. Upon MG132 treatment, endogenous ATF5 formed efficient conjugation of ubiquitin-ATF5 which was eliminated markedly by cisplatin (Fig. 1F, lane 3 versus lane 4). Furthermore, we obtained the similar result using anti-ATF5 antibody to detect the same sample (Fig. 1F, lane 7 versus lane 8). These results suggested that cisplatin increased ATF5 protein level at least partly through inhibition of the ubiquitin-mediated of ATF5. Cisplatin Promoted the Nucleus Export of Cdc34 and Reduced the Interaction between ATF5 and Cdc34—Previously, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Cdc34 was reported to target ATF5 degradation (10Pati D. Meistrich M.L. Plon S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5001-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the forced expression of Cdc34 decreased the protein level of endogenous ATF5 significantly (Fig. 2A). To investigate the mechanism of cisplatin-reduced ATF5 ubiquitination and degradation, we first examined the effect of cisplatin on the expression of Cdc34. Upon cisplatin treatment, the total level of Cdc34 protein expression in HeLa cells was not significantly changed (data not show). Interestingly, we observed that Cdc34 translocated from the nuclear to the cytoplasm in response to cisplatin treatment. Cdc34 was randomly localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm and co-localized with ATF5 in nucleus in HeLa cells, and Cdc34 was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm and did not co-localize with ATF5 after a 12-h exposure to cisplatin (Fig. 2B). These changes were confirmed using Western blot analysis. ATF5 co-immunoprecipitated with Cdc34 was decreased significantly by cisplatin treatment (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the level of Cdc34 in cytoplasm was increased, but the level of Cdc34 in nuclear extraction was decreased after cisplatin treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). However, ATF5 expression was limited to the nucleus of HeLa cells and was increased by cisplatin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). In addition, the half-life of endogenous ATF5 in the nucleus of HeLa cells was prolonged from ∼45 min to almost 80 min after cisplatin treatment (Fig. 2E). To confirm these results, we examined the ability of nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells treated with or without cisplatin to ubiquitinylate ATF5 in vitro. Whereas nuclear extracts from control HeLa cells produced efficient ubiquitin conjugation of purified ATF5 protein in an ATP-dependent manner, extracts from cisplatin-treated HeLa cells had hardly any activity above background controls (Fig. 2F). Next, we investigated the contribution of Cdc34 in the degradation of ATF5 in the presence or absence of cisplatin. The ability of nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells to ubiquitinylate ATF5 was enhanced by purified Cdc34 protein, and the negative effect of cisplatin on the ubiquitination of ATF5 was inhibited in the presence of purified Cdc34 protein in vitro (Fig. 2G). These results suggested that cisplatin-reduced ubiquitin-dependent degradation of ATF5 in the nucleus might be associated with the translocation of Cdc34 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The N-terminal 204 Amino Acids of Exogenous ATF5 Contain the Major Domain for Its Degradation—ATF5 protein contains a transcriptional activation domain (AD domain; aa 1–204) including a proline-rich region and a DNA binding domain (DBD domain; aa 204–282) which has high homology compared with ATF4 (6Persengiev S.P. Green M.R. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To map the region responsible for the degradation of ATF5, various deletion mutants of ATF5 were constructed (Fig. 3A) and were transiently co-transfected into HeLa cells with 1 μg of pEGFPN3 empty vector, which was used as a control of transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection cells were treated with DMSO or MG132. We observed that MG132 significantly increased the expression of ATF5 FL, ΔC1, ΔC2, ΔN1, and ΔN2 without changing the expression of ΔN3 (Fig. 3B), indicating that the N-terminal 204 amino acids of ATF5 was essential for its degradation. To further verify the domain of ATF5 contributing to cisplatin-reduced ATF5 degradation, we investigated the effect of cisplatin on the expression of ATF5 full-length (FL), the AD domain (ΔC2), and the DBD domain (ΔN3) in HeLa cells pretreated with DMSO or MG132. The expression of ATF5 FL and the AD domain (ΔC2) was increased by cisplatin treatment in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 3C, a and b). However, neither cisplatin nor MG132 had an effect on the expression of the DBD domain (Fig. 3Cc). These results suggested that the essential region for degradation of exogenous ATF5 by proteasome pathway was the N-terminal 204 amino acids (the AD domain). In Vivo Degradation of ATF5 by the Proteasome Is Independent of Lysine Residues—The conjugation of ubiquitin to an internal lysine was the initial step in the degradation of the majority of the substrates of the ubiquitin system (25Hoff H. Zhang H. Sell C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 285: 79-92PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of three lysine residues (Lys-29, Lys-106, and Lys-107) in ATF5 AD domain in its ubiquitination, three lysine mutants (K29R, K106107R, or K29R/K106107R) were constructed into pEGFPN3 vector by replacing lysine with arginine at one, two, or three positions (Fig. 4A, left panel) and were transiently transfected into HeLa cells. We found that all these mutants were expressed at low levels similar to that of the wild-type protein by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S1). Consistent with this, immunoblotting analysis showed that expression levels of all these mutants were increased by MG132 significantly (Fig. 4A), suggesting that none of the lysine was essential for ATF5 degradation in vivo. Next, we measured the half-lives of these mutants by cycloheximide chase experiments. Both wild-type ATF5 and its lysine mutants were rapidly degraded, with half-lives of ∼45 min (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–5). And, their half-lives were prolonged to ∼90 min by MG132 treatment (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–10). Although the DBD domain of ATF5 was not required for ATF5 degradation, it may provide lysine residues that could serve as attachment sites for ubiquitylation of ATF5. To address the contribution of DBD domain in the ubiquitylation of ATF5, ATF5 and its three lysine mutants deleting DBD domain were constructed (Fig. 4C, upper panel). These plasmids were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and Western blot analysis showed that their expression were increased by MG132 significantly (Fig. 4C, lower panel). We also investigated the ubiquitination of wide-type ATF5 and its lysine mutants containing or deleting DBD domain in vivo. pEGFPN3-ATF5, Mut3, ΔC2, Mut6, or control vector was co-transfected with HA-Ub into HeLa cells. Followed by MG132 treatment, the EGFP-tagged ATF5 was immunoprecipitated using anti-EGFP antibody from cellular extracts and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. As expected, we detected a high molecular weight of HA-marked ubiquitin-conjugated ATF5 and its mutants (Fig. 4D). On the basis of these results, we concluded that the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of exogenous ATF5 was independent of lysine residues in vivo. Addition of a Large N-terminal Tag Stabilizes Exogenous ATF5 but Does Not Block Its Ubiquitinylation—Many authors reported that the addition of a large tag such as a 6× Myc or an EGFP at the N terminus of the proteins could stabilize those N-terminal-ubiquitinated proteins (26Coulombe P. Rodier G. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6140-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Because ATF5 ubiquitinylation did not require the presence of lysine residues, we sought to examine the possibility that it might be ubiquitinylated at N terminus. To address this point, we constructed an N-terminal EGEP-tagged ATF5 plasmid (Fig. 5Aa). We found that the N-terminal EGFP tag dramatically increased ATF5 expression compared with the C-terminal EGFP tag by fluorescence microscopy observation (Fig. 5Ab), flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 5Ac), and Western blot assay (Fig. 5Ad). Cycloheximide chase experiments clearly showed that N-terminal EGFP tag dramatically increased the stability of ATF5 protein compared with the C-terminal EGFP tag (Fig. 5B). Because a large N-terminal EGFP tag could stabilize ATF5 protein, we investigated whether the tag blocked its ubiquitinylation. ATF5-EGFP or EGFP-ATF5 was co-transfected with HA-Ub into HeLa cells followed by MG132 treatment or not and immunoprecipitated using anti-EGFP antibody. As expected, immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody detected the ubiquitin-ATF5 conjugates whose intensity was increased after MG132 treatment whenever the EGFP tag was at the C terminus or the N terminus (Fig. 5C), indicating that the N-terminal large tag could not block its ubiquitinylation in vivo. We confirmed this result by in vitro ubiquitinylation assay using N-terminal glutathione S-transferase-tagged ATF5 protein purified from bacteria (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggested that the N-terminal large tag did not block the recognition site for ubiquitin, although it could increase the stability of exogenous ATF5. Exogenous ATF5 Is Ubiquitinylated at the N Terminus—For several proteins it was reported that the first ubiquitin is conjugated to the N-terminal residue rather than to an internal lysine (27Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the case of MyoD, it was clearly shown that chemical blocking of the α-NH2 group completely stabilized the protein by in vitro an in vivo degradation assay (28Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To address whether the conjugation site of ATF5 to ubiquitin was the free N-terminal NH2, we generated constructs of ATF5 that after the first methionine contained an HA tag (which did not contain any lysine: Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Ala) followed by a factor Xa protease cleavage site (lle-Glu-Gly-Arg) or not. The purified HA-ATF5 and HA-Xa-ATF5 proteins were used as substrates and incubated with whole HeLa cell extracts in in vitro ubiquitination assay. After reaction, the protein was treated with or without factor Xa protease. If ATF5 was ubiquitinylated at the N terminus, ubiquitin-conjugated HA-Xa-ATF5 treated with factor Xa protease could not be detected by immunoblotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody for the ubiquitin-HA has been cut away. Compared with control (Fig. 6, upper panel, lane 1), we did observe the ubiquitinylated HA-ATF5 and HA-Xa-ATF5 without treatment of factor Xa protease (Fig. 6, upper panel, lanes 3 and 5). After factor Xa proteasome treatment, the ubiquitinylated HA-Xa-ATF5 was eliminated completely, but the ubiquitinylated HA-ATF5 was not diminished (Fig. 6, upper panel, lanes 4 and 6). When the same sample was blotted with antibody to ATF5 itself, the film demonstrated a similar ladder of ATF5 species, and the HA-Xa-ATF5 had its N-terminal HA tag removed in the presence of factor Xa as shown by the increase in gel migration (Fig. 6, lower panel), indicating that exogenous ATF5 was ubiquitinylated at the N-terminal methionine. In this study we revealed that cisplatin increased the expression of ATF5 protein by preventing its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This conclusion was based on the following evidence. First, cisplatin increased ATF5 protein expression without changing its mRNA expression. Second, the amount of ATF5 protein was increased by cisplatin in the absence of MG132, not in the presence of MG132. Interestingly, cisplatin decreased the level of ATF5 protein expression in the presence of MG132 in HeLa cells, not in the other examined cells, indicating the specificity of cisplatin-reduced ATF5 expression in the presence of MG132 in HeLa cell. Although protein ubiquitination has been best characterized as a mechanism for targeting proteins to the proteasome for degradation (29Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar), recently it has become clear that this modification could also serve many other functions, largely by serving as a protein-protein interaction motif (30Wood A. Garg P. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20256-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Collingwood T.S. Smirnova E.V. Bogush M. Carpino N. Annan R.S. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30920-30928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination could also modulate the activity of transcription factors by recruiting coactivators or corepressors or by serving as a trigger for nuclear export (32Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are currently only a couple of examples of ubiquitin serving as a nuclear import signal. The nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB was indirectly controlled by ubiquitination (33Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conjectured that the expression and translocation of certain unknown protein regulated by cisplatin in the presence of MG132 might negative regulate the expression of ATF5, which needed further investigation. Third, we identified ATF5 protein as a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, cisplatin reduced poly-ubiquitin conjugates of ATF5 in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, these results suggested that cisplatin-induced ATF5 accumulation was associated with a down-regulation of ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in controlling the levels of various cellular proteins and, therefore, regulates basic cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, cell transformation, and cell apoptosis (25Hoff H. Zhang H. Sell C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 285: 79-92PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 34Ben-Neriah Y. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence indicated that cisplatin might induce cell apoptosis by regulating the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of proteins (16Johnson C.L. Lu D. Huang J. Basu A. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 861-867PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fribley A.M. Evenchik B. Zeng Q. Park B.K. Guan J.Y. Zhang H. Hale T.J. Soengas M.S. Kaufman R.J. Wang C.Y. J. Biol.

American Association for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, PA2006: 880-881Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which cisplatin regulates ubiquitination and degradation of protein are largely unknown. Here, we reported for the first time that cisplatin might accommodate the ubiquitin-proteasome system through regulating the nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34. Cdc34 and RAD6 had been reported to be important components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the nucleus, which was responsible for the degradation of some transcriptional factors (11Pintard L. Peter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 856-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Functionally, Cdc34 in association with different ubiquitin protein ligases, has been shown to target many different substrates for ubiquitination and degradation during cell division, signal transduction, and development (10Pati D.

(10Pati D. Meistrich M.L. Plon S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5001-5013Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showed that ATF5 interacted with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34, and Cdc34 overexpression reduced the expression of ATF5 in JEG3 cells. Consistent with this, co-transfection of a Myc-tagged ATF5 with Cdc34 resulted in a significant loss of ATF5 protein in HeLa cells which could be reversed by incubation of MG132 (data not shown). Furthermore, we found that cisplatin promoted the translocation of Cdc34 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and reduced the interaction between Cdc34 and ATF5, thus inhibiting the degradation of ATF5. Because Cdc34 was an essential gene for the transition into S phase of the cell division cycle (10Pati D. Meistrich M.L. Plon S.E. Mol. Cell.

Another interesting finding was that exogenous ATF5 degradation was independent of lysine residues. MyoD, p21, p16, ERK3, the Epstein-Barr virus LMP1, and HPV-16 E7 are degraded after attachment of the first ubiquitin moiety to their N-terminal moiety (26Coulombe P. Rodier G. Bonneil E. Thibault P.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5944-5950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The addition of a large tag at the N terminus of these proteins increases the stabilization of the proteins by largely unknown mechanisms (27Ciechanover A. Ben-Saadon R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 103-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here, we identified ATF5 as a new protein degraded in this fashion. The addition of a large N-terminal tag blocked the degradation of exogenous ATF5 and increased its stability significantly. Furthermore, we provided direct proof that exogenous ATF5 was ubiquitinylated at the N terminus in vitro. Interestingly, the large N-terminal EGFP tag of exogenous ATF5 could not block the recognition site for ubiquitin, in agreement with the previous findings about p21 reported by Bloom et al. (43Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The EGFP tag contained lysine, and it could at least theoretically be ubiquitinylated at the N terminus. Some authors considered that a large tag caused a steric hindrance that interferes with unfolding by and/or translocation into the proteasome independent of the presence of the ubiquitin chain (26Coulombe P. Rodier G. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6140-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results we concluded that exogenous ATF5 was degraded via N-terminal ubiquitinylation. However, it was observed that there was a difference between the degradation of exogenous ATF5 and endogenous ATF5 in the presence of cisplatin, suggesting that the endogenous ATF5 might have a varied method of degradation. For several substrates such as MyoD, P21, in which the first ubiquitin has been reported to be conjugated to the N terminus, the internal lysines also play a role in modulating their stability (26Coulombe P. Rodier G. Bonneil E. Thibault P. Meloche S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6140-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Several substrates are degraded in a manner that is ubiquitination-independent yet proteasome-dependent. Thus, the modulatory pathway of endogenous ATF5 might be complex, and a multipath needs more research. In summary, the present studies demonstrated that ATF5 was degraded by proteasome pathway. Cisplatin prevented the degradation of ATF5, at least partly through promoting the translocation of Cdc34 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The precise mechanisms of N-terminal ubiquitination of exogenous ATF5 protein and cisplatin-mediated Cdc34 translocation need further investigations. Download .pdf (.15 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2095759510,"In humans, liver phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) has an established catabolic function, and mutations in PAH cause phenylketonuria, a genetic disease characterized by neurological damage, if not treated. To obtain novel evolutionary insights and information on molecular mechanisms operating in phenylketonuria, we investigated PAH in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (cePAH), where the enzyme is coded by the pah-1 gene, expressed in the hypodermis. CePAH presents similar molecular and kinetic properties to human PAH [S(0.5)(L-Phe) approximately 150 microM; K(m) for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) approximately 35 microM and comparable V(max)], but cePAH is devoid of positive cooperativity for L-Phe, an important regulatory mechanism of mammalian PAH that protects the nervous system from excess L-Phe. Pah-1 knockout worms show no obvious neurological defects, but in combination with a second cuticle synthesis mutation, they display serious cuticle abnormalities. We found that pah-1 knockouts lack a yellow-orange pigment in the cuticle, identified as melanin by spectroscopic techniques, and which is detected in C. elegans for the first time. Pah-1 mutants show stimulation of superoxide dismutase activity, suggesting that cuticle melanin functions as oxygen radical scavenger. Our results uncover both an important anabolic function of PAH and the change in regulation of the enzyme along evolution."

This acidification is involved in concentration of neurotransmitters, processing of secretory proteins, endocytosis, and other important cellular processes (1Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase contains a globular catalytic domain, V1, which hydrolyzes ATP, attached by central and peripheral stalks to an integral membrane domain, Vo, which pumps ions across the membrane. ATP hydrolysis generates rotation of the central stalk and an attached membrane ring of hydrophobic subunits. Ions are pumped through a pathway at the interface between the rotating ring and a static membrane component, which is linked to the outside of the V1 domain by the peripheral stalk (1Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). In yeast, the V1 domain contains subunits A–H, while the membrane-bound Vo is made of subunit a, c, c′, c″, d, and e. The core of the V1 domain is composed of a hexameric arrangement of alternating A and B subunits responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis. The Vo domain consists of a ring of proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″) adjacent to subunits a and e. The V1 and Vo domains are connected by a central stalk, composed of subunits D and F of V1 and subunit d of Vo, and a few peripheral stalks, composed of subunits C, E, G, and H together with N-terminal domain of subunit a (1Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Because V-ATPases function in various physiological processes, regulation of their activity is very important. The peripheral stalk subunits have been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the enzyme via a reversible dissociation and re-association mechanism (2Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G.

These findings suggest that the peripheral stalk of V-ATPase is composed of two or three EG heterodimers together with subunits H and C, and the N-terminal domain of subunit a.

Murata T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Bacterial V-ATPases have no counterpart for subunit C and H of eukaryotic V-ATPases that are responsible for modulating the interaction between V1 and Vo (22Keenan Curtis K. Kane P.M. J. Biol.

The V1 domain responsible for ATP-driven rotation is composed of the Ntp-A, -B, -C(d), -D, -E -F(G), and -G(F) subunits. The Vo domain responsible for utilization of the rotation energy of V1 for Na+ translocation is composed of oligomers of the 16-kDa NtpK(c) forming a membrane rotor ring and a single copy of the NtpI(a) subunit (Fig. 1). The peripheral stalk of this enzyme is likely to be composed of NtpF(G) and NtpE with the N-terminal domain of NtpI(a) (Fig. 1, shown in gray), although the subunit arrangement and stoichiometry of these subunits are unclear. In this study, NtpE, NtpF, and the N-terminal hydrophilic domain of NtpI (NtpINterm) were individually purified, and the interactions between the three subunits were investigated. The purified NtpINterm was shown to bind directly to NtpF but not NtpE, and the three subunits make up the ternary complex with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. A low resolution structure model of the complex obtained by SAXS reveals an elongated “L”-shape. Initial Expression Trials of NtpE, NtpF, and NtpINterm—Full-length ntpE and ntpF genes, and nine DNA constructs encoding the N-terminal soluble domain of NtpI with different C-terminal boundaries were amplified by PCR. The amplified DNA fragments were incorporated by overlap PCR to the T7 promoter sequence, the ribosome-binding site, the His tag, the cleavage site for tobacco etch virus protease, a linker sequence, and the T7 terminator sequence, which are coding following protein sequence from N terminus: His tag (His-7)/tobacco etch virus cleavage site (EHLYFQG)/linker (SSGSSG)/protein sequence (23Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). The His-tagged proteins were synthesized by the dialysis mode of cell-free protein expression using these PCR DNA templates, as described elsewhere (24Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Matsuda N. Matsuda T. Nakajima R. Tanaka A. Yokoyama S. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2004; 5: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The total reaction mixtures were centrifuged to remove insoluble proteins, and the total and soluble fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE to assess the quantity and the solubility of the expressed proteins. Expression and Purification of the Subunits—The DNA fragments expressed in the cell-free system were cloned into the plasmid vector, pET23d, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by isopropyl (thio)-β-d-galactoside induction. The E. coli lysate was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, England) equilibrated with A buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 750 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and bound proteins were eluted with B buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 500 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The sample buffer was exchanged to A buffer using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column. To obtain non-tagged protein, the proteins were treated with tobacco etch virus protease at 4 °C for 12 h. The reaction solution was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column again, and the flow-through fractions containing the non-tagged proteins were pooled. This step was not included in protocol for the purification of His-tagged proteins. The protein samples were then dialyzed against C buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5), loaded onto a HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare, England) column equilibrated with C buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of 10 mm-1.0 m NaCl. Finally, the samples were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200pg (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with D buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and eluted using D buffer. The purified sample was concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM 10 filter, Amicon). Pulldown Assay Using Only One Tagged Subunit and Co-purification of the Complex—His-tagged sample (NtpE or NtpINterm) and an excess of non-tagged sample(s) (NtpE, NtpF, and/or NtpINterm) were mixed and incubated for 90 min on ice. The mixture was loaded on a HisTrap HP column equilibrated with A buffer, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of A buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with B buffer. All eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To obtain non-tagged complex (NtpE-F or NtpE-F-INterm), the histidine-affinity tag was removed by tobacco etch virus protease treatment at 4 °C for 12 h. The reaction solution was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column again, and the flow-through fraction was pooled. Finally, concentrated pooled samples were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200pg (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with D buffer and eluted with D buffer. Purified complex was concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM10 filter). Measurements of CD Spectroscopy—The CD spectroscopy was performed with a Jasco J-725 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan). The purified subunits and complexes were dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and diluted to 0.25 mg of protein/ml which were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Far UV scans were collected between 200 nm and 240 nm in 0.2 nm steps at 20 °C. All CD measurements were corrected for background buffer contribution. The raw data were converted to molar residual ellipticity (θ) using standard analysis. Real-time Binding Assay by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The BIAcore 3000 system and reagents, including sensor chips and the amine coupling kit, were obtained from GE Healthcare. Purified NtpE (50 μg/ml) or NtpINterm (30 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified sample was passed over the surface of the sensor chip with a typical flow rate of 30 μl/min, and the interactions were monitored for 3 min at 20 °C. The sensor surface was then washed with D buffer containing 2% glycerol for 3 min. Chip regeneration conditions varied according to the interactions studied: for NtpE (ligand)-NtpF (analyte) interaction, the chip was washed with 10 mm glycine (pH 1.5) for 30 s; for NtpINterm (ligand)-NtpF (analyte) interaction and NtpINterm (ligand)-NtpEF complex (analyte) interaction, the chip was washed with D buffer containing 2% glycerol for 5 min, which is enough to dissociate the bound analyte. For high affinity interactions of the NtpE-NtpF and NtpINterm-NtpEF complexes, the association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff) were calculated using BIAevaluation software (Version 4.1, GE Healthcare) with the program, 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model. The dissociation constant (KD) was determined from the koff/kon values. In the case of the NtpINterm-NtpF interaction, it was not possible to evaluate the rate constants from the koff/kon values because of low affinity. We obtained an approximate equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) by measuring the equilibrium resonance units (Req) at several analyte concentrations at equilibrium. The fitted curve (Req versus concentrations of analyte) and the KD values were obtained using the BIAevaluation software with a single 1:1 interaction binding isotherm. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity (AUC/SV) and equilibrium (AUC/SE) experiments were carried out using an Optimal XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). For AUC/SV experiments, cells with a standard Epon two-channel centerpiece and sapphire windows were used. Samples in D buffer and reference buffer (D buffer) were loaded into cells. The rotor temperature was equilibrated at 20 °C in the vacuum chamber for 1–2 h prior to start-up. Absorbance (A280) scans were collected at 10-min intervals during sedimentation at 50 × 103 rpm. The sample concentrations were 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 mg of protein/ml protein for purified subunits (NtpE, NtpF, and NtpINterm) or 0.8 mg of protein/ml proteins for mixed samples and the purified complex (NtpE-F-INterm). Partial specific volume of the protein, solvent density, and solvent viscosity were calculated from standard tables using the program SEDNTERP, version 1.09 (25Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifrugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 19-125Google Scholar). The resulting scans were analyzed using the continuous distribution (c(s)) analysis module in the program Sedfit version 11.0 (26Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In this analysis a differential sedimentation coefficient distribution, c(s), that deconvolutes diffusion effects, based on the direct boundary modeling with distributions of Lamm equation solutions, is determined (27Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficient increments of 200 were used in the appropriate range for each sample, and the weight average frictional ratio (f/fo) was allowed to float during fitting. The weight average sedimentation coefficient was obtained by integrating the range of sedimentation coefficients in which peaks were present. The s20,w value, sedimentation coefficient corrected to 20 °C in pure water, was calculated from the observed sedimentation coefficient value using the program SEDNTERP. AUC/SE experiments were also carried out in cells with a six-channel centerpiece and quartz windows. The samples were diluted 0.4, 0.2, and 0.15 mg of protein/ml with D buffer. The absorbance wavelength was set at 280 nm, and data were acquired at 20 °C. Data were obtained at 12, 15, and 18 × 103 rpm for NtpE and NtpF, at 9, 12, and 15 × 103 rpm for NtpINterm, at 7, 10, and 13 × 103 rpm for mixed samples, and at 6, 9, and 12 × 103 rpm for purified NtpE-F-INterm complex. A total equilibration time of 16 h was used for each speed, with a scan taken at 12 h and 14 h to ensure equilibrium had been reached. The optical baseline was determined by accelerating at 40 × 103 rpm at the end of data collection. Data analysis was performed by global analysis of data sets obtained at different loading concentrations and rotor speeds using UltraSpin software (MRC Center for Protein Engineering, Cambridge, UK, www.mrc-cpe.cam.ac.uk/ultraspin). SAXS—SAXS experiments were carried out at the RIKEN Structural Biology Beamline I BL45XU at SPring-8, Japan (28Fujisawa T. Inoue K. Oka T. Iwamoto H. Uraga T. Kumasaka T. Inoko Y. Yagi N. Yamamoto M. Ueki T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 797-800Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The x-ray wavelength used, λ, was 0.09 nm, and the beam size at the sample position was 0.25 × 0.5 mm2. The sample-to-detector distance was determined to be 3343 mm by the silver behenate (d = 5.380 nm, The Gem Dagout) as a standard sample in the SAXS experiment. This setup covers the momentum transfer ranges 0.057 nm-1 < q < 2.133 nm-1 (where q = 4π sin θ/λ, 2θ is the scattering angle), however, the data points were discarded in q < 0.1 nm-1 to avoid the influence of parasitic scattering into the result. The sample temperature was controlled to 293.00 ± 0.01 K with a high precision thermoelectric controller. The sample solutions were brought into a sample cell, which has 30 μl in volume, a path length of 3 mm, and a pair of 0.02-mm thickness synthetic quartz windows. The SAXS patterns of protein solutions and corresponding buffer were measured by an on-line imaging plate detector, Rigaku R-AXIS IV++. The sample cell was continuously moved during x-ray exposure to reduce the radiation damage. The SAXS profiles were collected as three subsequent exposures of 100 s with the attenuated beam (∼1/100 against the intrinsic intensity). The radiation damage was tested by comparing subsequent exposures of the same sample, and only the data without the signs of radiation damage were analyzed. Exposures from sample and buffer were alternated to minimize the possible effects of drift in any experimental parameters. The SAXS patterns were circularly averaged and reduced to one-dimensional profiles using the in-house software (28Fujisawa T. Inoue K. Oka T. Iwamoto H. Uraga T. Kumasaka T. Inoko Y. Yagi N. Yamamoto M. Ueki T. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 797-800Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Those scattering profiles were then normalized by the x-ray intensity measured by the ionization chamber placed upstream of the sample, the exposure time, and the protein concentration c (mg/ml) of the solution. Data processing was performed using the program PRIMUS in the software package of ATSAS 2.2 (Svergun). These data treatments resulted in scattering profiles, I(q). To eliminate inter-particle interference, I(q), recorded at three different protein concentrations (1.7, 2.4, and 3.0 mg of protein/ml) as described above, were scaled using a protein concentration c, I(q,c)=I(q){/}c(Eq. 1) where I(q, c) denotes the SAXS profile normalized by weight percent concentration. The radius of gyration was determined by fitting the innermost portion of I(q, c) to, I(q,c)=I(0,c) exp(−Rg(c)2q2/3)(Eq. 2) where I(0, c) and Rg(c) are the concentration-normalized intensity at an angle of zero (q = 0) and the apparent radius of gyration at the protein concentration c, respectively. The value of Rg(c) was determined using Guinier approximation with qmaxRg(c) < 1.3. Data points for q < 0.143 nm-1, which were affected by intermolecular interactions, were excluded from the data fit. The reported SAXS data were treated as monodisperse systems unless otherwise mentioned. The molecular mass of protein, Mw, was estimated by comparing the extrapolated forward scattering intensity, I(0, c): c→0, of NtpE-F-INterm complex with that of bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) as the standard protein in SAXS measurements. Bovine serum albumin protein is a 66.4-kDa monomeric protein, which is one of the most common standards for estimating the molecular mass by using SAXS. The pair distribution function, P(r), was calculated by the program GNOM (29Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2926) Google Scholar) based on an indirect Fourier transform algorithm in the q range from 0.1072 to 2.133 nm-1 for NtpE-F-INterm complex. The maximum molecular length, Dmax, was estimated as a distance, r, where P(r) = 0 for r ≥ Dmax. Low Resolution Shape Reconstruction—After processing the scattering data with GNOM, low resolution shape reconstruction of the NtpE-F-INterm complex was conducted with an ab initio bead-modeling program, DAMMIN (30Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). DAMMIN were applied to SAXS profiles in q < 2.133 nm-1 and to those weighted by q-4 to ensure Porod's law. Reproducibility of the structural solution was confirmed by repeating ten reconstructions without any shape and symmetrical constraints. To evaluate the creditability and accuracy of the reconstructed model, we employed the program, DAMAVER (31Volkov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1597) Google Scholar), which aligns all reconstructed models and removes outliers below a given cut-off volume, for setting up the criterion of the pairwise normalized spatial discrepancies (NSD). The ab initio model exceeding 〈NSD〉 (mean value of all pairs NSD) + 2δ (NSD) (variation of NSD) were discarded. The most probable model of NtpE-F-INterm complex after DAMAVER processing is chosen by the criterion of NSD. The mean value of NSD and variation of NSD in the set of ten ab initio models was 0.406 and 0.040, respectively. Others—Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and stained with Imperial Protein Stain (Pierce). Densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE gels was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Wako (Japan). Secondary structure prediction was carried out using the PSIPRED server (available on the World Wide Web). Expression and Purification of the NtpE, NtpF, and NtpINterm—Both NtpE and NtpF expressed as well as soluble His-tagged proteins in the E. coli cell-free protein expression system and in vivo in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Table 1). NtpE and His-tagged NtpE and NtpF were individually purified using column chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) yielding proteins of apparent molecular masses of 24, 28, and 15 kDa, respectively, as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3).TABLE 1Expression and purification of NtpE, NtpF, and NtpINtermSubunit nameResidues numberMolecular massbTheoretical value based on the amino acid sequence without the His tagExpression triala+++, very good; ++, good; +, bad; –, very badPurificationQuantitycSee “Experimental Procedures”SolubilitycSee “Experimental Procedures”StabilityYielddMilligrams of protein/liter culturekDaNtpE1–19623+++++Stable3.8NtpF1–11715++++++Stable7.81–30036+++–NDeND, not determinedND1–30636+++–NDND1–31638+++–NDND1–32639++++++NDNDNtpINterm1–33440++++++NDND1–34140++++++Stable14.71–35542++++UnstableND1–36543++++UnstableND1–38446++–NDNDa +++, very good; ++, good; +, bad; –, very badb Theoretical value based on the amino acid sequence without the His tagc See “Experimental Procedures”d Milligrams of protein/liter culturee ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Subunit NtpI constitutes the membrane-embedded Vo domain together with an NtpK ring, and probably has two half channels for Na+ translocation across the membrane (33Murata T. Yamato I. Kakinuma Y. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 2005; 308: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The 76-kDa NtpI is composed of two regions; a hydrophilic N-terminal half domain, which is likely to form contacts with the peripheral stalk(s), and a hydrophobic C-terminal half domain with several transmembrane helices (predicted as seven by hydropathy analyses) responsible for Na+ translocation (34Kawano M. Igarashi K. Yamato I. Kakinuma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24405-24410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We constructed nine DNA templates, which encode the N-terminal hydrophilic domain of NtpI with different C-terminal boundaries as shown in Table 1. The NtpINterm fragment (1–384 residues), which contains the putative first trans-membrane region was expressed as insoluble protein. Shorter NtpINterm fragments (1–365 and 1–355 residues), both of which do not contain the putative trans-membrane region, were expressed as soluble and also as insoluble proteins (Table 1). It was not possible to isolate these proteins, because they aggregated heavily during purification. Other shorter NtpINterm fragments (1–341, 1–334, and 1–326 residues) were expressed as all soluble proteins. In this study, we used the NtpINterm fragment (1–341), the largest of these three proteins. The remaining shorter NtpINterm (1–316, 1–306, and 1–300 residues) were expressed as insoluble proteins (Table 1). It was possible to obtain highly pure non-tagged and His-tagged NtpINterm (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5), with apparent molecular masses of 45 kDa and 47 kDa, respectively, as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2047802749,"Acute HIV-1 infection of CD4 T cells often results in apoptotic death of infected cells, yet it is unclear what evolutionary advantage this offers to HIV-1. Given the independent observations that acute T cell HIV-1 infection results in (1) NF-kappaB activation, (2) caspase 8 dependent apoptosis, and that (3) caspase 8 directly activates NF-kappaB, we questioned whether these three events might be interrelated. We first show that HIV-1 infected T cell apoptosis, NF-kappaB activation, and caspase 8 cleavage by HIV-1 protease are coincident. Next we show that HIV-1 protease not only cleaves procaspase 8, producing Casp8p41, but also independently stimulates NF-kappaB activity. Finally, we demonstrate that the HIV protease cleavage of caspase 8 is necessary for optimal NF-kappaB activation and that the HIV-1 protease specific cleavage fragment Casp8p41 is sufficient to stimulate HIV-1 replication through NF-kappaB dependent HIV-LTR activation both in vitro as well as in cells from HIV infected donors. Consequently, the molecular events which promote death of HIV-1 infected T cells function dually to promote HIV-1 replication, thereby favoring the propagation and survival of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W1965368612,"Potassium channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) are EF-hand calcium-binding proteins of the recoverin/neuronal calcium sensor 1 family that co-assemble with the pore-forming Kv4 alpha-subunits and thus control surface trafficking of the voltage-gated potassium channels mediating the neuronal I(A) and cardiac I(to) currents. Different from the other KChIPs, KChIP4a largely reduces surface expression of the Kv4 channel complexes. Using solution NMR we show that the unique N terminus of KChIP4a forms a 6-turn alpha-helix that is connected to the highly conserved core of the KChIP protein via a solvent-exposed linker. As identified by chemical shift changes, N-terminal alpha-helix and core domain of KChIP4a interact with each other through the same hydrophobic surface pocket that is involved in intermolecular interaction between the N-terminal helix of Kv4alpha and KChIP in Kv4-KChIP complexes. Electrophysiological recordings and biochemical interaction assays of complexes formed by wild-type and mutant Kv4alpha and KChIP4a proteins suggest that competition of these two helical domains for the surface groove is responsible for the reduced trafficking of Kv4-KChIP4a complexes to the plasma membrane. Surface expression of Kv4 complexes may thus be controlled by an auto-inhibitory domain in the KChIP subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1969880518,"The auxiliary beta subunits of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels greatly contribute to the diversity of BK (mSlo1 alpha) channels, which is fundamental to the adequate function in many tissues. Here we describe a functional element of the extracellular segment of hbeta2 auxiliary subunits that acts as the positively charged rings to modify the BK channel conductance. Four consecutive lysines of the hbeta2 extracellular loop, which reside sufficiently close to the extracellular entryway of the pore, constitute three positively charged rings. These rings can decrease the extracellular K(+) concentration and prevent the Charybdotoxin (ChTX) from approaching the extracellular entrance of channels through electrostatic mechanism, leading to the reduction of K(+) inflow or the outward rectification of BK channels. Our results demonstrate that the lysine rings formed by the hbeta2 auxiliary subunits influences the inward current of BK channels, providing a mechanism by which current can be rapidly diminished during cellular repolarization. Furthermore, this study will be helpful to understand the functional diversity of BK channels contributed by different auxiliary beta subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2017992719,"The U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) is an integral part of the spliceosome that is important for the recognition of the 3′ splice site. U2AF consists of a large and a small subunit, the prototypes of which are U2AF65 and U2AF35. Recent evidence suggests that several homologs of both U2AF subunits exist that are able to regulate alternative splicing. Here we have investigated the expression, intracellular localization, and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of one homolog of the small U2AF subunit, U2AF26, and a splice variant lacking exon 7, U2AF26ΔE7. In contrast to the nuclear U2AF26, which displays active nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, U2AF26ΔE7 is localized in the cytoplasm. Our studies reveal a nuclear localization sequence in the C-terminal exons 7 and 8 of U2AF26 that differs from the known nuclear localization sequence in U2AF35. In addition, we could identify P32 as a protein that is able to interact with U2AF26 through this domain, and we demonstrate that this interaction is required for the nuclear translocation of U2AF26. Our results suggest the existence of two distinct nuclear import pathways for U2AF26 and U2AF35 that could independently control their intracellular distribution and availability to the splicing machinery. Such a mechanism could work in addition to the differential expression of U2AF homologs to contribute to the regulation of alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2077632759,"Background Despite increasingly frequent bacterial resistance to antibiotics, antibacterial innovation is rare. Ketolides constitute one of the very few new antibiotic classes active against Streptococcus pneumoniae developed during the last 25 years. Their mechanism of action resembles that of macrolides, but they are unaffected by common resistance mechanisms. However, cross-resistance to ketolides has been observed in some macrolide-resistant strains. We examined how new antibiotic exposure may affect overall pneumococcal resistance patterns in the population. The aims of this study were to assess the potential dissemination of newly emerged resistances and to control the selection of strains already multiresistant to existing antimicrobials. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed an age-structured population model for S. pneumoniae transmission in a human community exposed to heptavalent vaccine, and β-lactams, macrolides and ketolides. The dynamics of intra-individual selection of resistant strains under antibiotic exposure and interindividual transmission were simulated, with antibiotic-specific resistance mechanisms defining the path to co-resistances and cross-resistances, and parameters concerning the French situation. Results of this simulation study suggest that new antibiotic consumption could markedly slow the diffusion of multiresistant strains. Wider use was associated with slower progression of multiresistance. When ketolides were prescribed to all ages, resistance to them reached 10% after >15 years, while it took >40 years when they were prescribed only to adults. In the scenario according to which new antibiotics totally replaced former antimicrobials, the β-lactam resistance rate was limited at 70%. Conclusions In a context of widespread vaccination and rational use of antibiotics, innovative antibiotic, prescribed to all age groups, may have an added impact on multiresistant-strain dissemination in the population."
https://openalex.org/W2004234970,"Background The signaling pathways that may modulate the pathogenesis of diseases induced by expanded polyglutamine proteins are not well understood. Methodologies/Principal Findings Herein we demonstrate that expanded polyglutamine protein cytotoxicity is mediated primarily through activation of p38MAPK and that the atypical PKC iota (PKCι) enzyme antagonizes polyglutamine-induced cell death through induction of the ERK signaling pathway. We show that pharmacological blockade of p38MAPK rescues cells from polyglutamine-induced cell death whereas inhibition of ERK recapitulates the sensitivity observed in cells depleted of PKCι by RNA interference. We provide evidence that two unrelated proteins with expanded polyglutamine repeats induce p38MAPK in cultured cells, and demonstrate induction of p38MAPK in an in vivo model of neurodegeneration (spinocerebellar ataxia 1, or SCA-1). Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our data implicate activated p38MAPK in disease progression and suggest that its inhibition may represent a rational strategy for therapeutic intervention in the polyglutamine disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1985285050,"Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) provides a tractable model with which to define common, conserved features of gamma-herpesvirus biology. The multi-membrane spanning glycoprotein M (gM) is one of only 4 glycoproteins that are essential for MuHV-4 lytic replication. gM binds to gN and is thought to function mainly secondary envelopment and virion egress, for which several predicted trafficking motifs in its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail could be important. We tested the contribution of the gM cytoplasmic tail to MuHV-4 lytic replication by making recombinant viruses with varying C-terminal deletions. Removing an acidic cluster and a distal YXXPhi motif altered the capsid distribution somewhat in infected cells but had little effect on virus replication, either in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, removing a proximal YXXPhi motif as well completely prevented productive replication. gM was still expressed, but unlike its longer forms showed only limited colocalization with co-transfected gN, and in the context of whole virus appeared to support gN expression less well. We conclude that some elements of the gM cytoplasmic tail are dispensible for MuHV-4 replication, but the tail as a whole is not."
