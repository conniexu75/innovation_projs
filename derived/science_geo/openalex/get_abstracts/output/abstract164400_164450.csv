Here we show that glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of interleukin-2 mRNA expression in activated normal T cells required new protein synthesis, suggesting that this phenomenon is secondary to expression of glucocorticoid-regulated genes. One of the most prominent glucocorticoid-induced genes is glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), which has been reported to inhibit activation-induced up-regulation of Fas ligand (FasL) mRNA. Indeed, transient expression of GILZ in Jurkat T cells blocked induction of a reporter construct driven by the FasL promoter. This could be accounted for by GILZ-mediated inhibition of Egr-2 and Egr-3, NFAT/AP-1-inducible transcription factors that bind a regulatory element in the FasL promoter and up-regulate FasL expression. GILZ also potently inhibited AP-1-driven and IL-2 promoter-driven reporter constructs, and recombinant GILZ specifically interacted with c-Fos and c-Jun in vitro and inhibited the binding of active AP-1 to its target DNA. Whereas homodimerization of GILZ required the presence of its leucine zipper, the interaction with c-Fos and c-Jun occurred through the N-terminal 60-amino acid region of GILZ. Thus, GILZ represents a glucocorticoid-induced gene product that can inhibit a variety of activation-induced events, at least in part by direct interference with AP-1, and is therefore a candidate for a mediator of glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression.

They are used clinically for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma, and for preventing transplant rejection. Glucocorticoids inhibit transcriptional up-regulation of T cell-derived cytokines, such as IL1-2, IL-4, IL-10, and γ-interferon (1Boumpas D.T. Chrousos G.P. Wilder R.L. Cupps T.R. Balow J.E. Ann.

Another target of glucocorticoids in T cells is Fas ligand (FasL), a membrane protein that triggers apoptosis of mature T cells by engaging Fas (4Crispe I.N. Immunity. 1994; 1: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Yang Y. Mercep M. Ware C.F. Ashwell J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Inhibition of FasL-initiated apoptosis by glucocorticoids may help to stem the loss of immune cells in HIV-infected individuals (6Lu W. Salerno-Goncalves R. Yuan J. Sylvie D. Han D.S. Andrieu J.M. AIDS. 1995; 9: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The apparent immune-enhancing effect of FasL suppression underscores the complexity of glucocorticoid biology and implies that there are numerous levels where glucocorticoid actions are controlled. Glucocorticoids are small hydrophobic molecules that diffuse through the plasma membrane to reach the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which then translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription. The GR contains an N-terminal hormone-independent activation domain, a DNA-binding domain containing a pair of zinc fingers, and a C-terminal ligand-dependent activation domain integrated with the ligand-binding domain (2Gottlicher M. Heck S. Herrlich P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 7Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). The C terminus is also the site of interaction with coactivator proteins, including SRC-1, CBP/p300, and PCAF (8Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Ligand-bound GR is mostly monomeric in solution but homodimerizes upon cooperative binding to a GRE, a region of DNA containing two inversely symmetrical GR-binding elements (11Chandler V.L. Maler B.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1983; 33: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Classic GREs regulate glucocorticoid-inducible genes that play roles in metabolism and cell growth, such as those encoding metallothionein, tyrosine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (7Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar, 12Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The activated GR can also suppress transcription upon binding negative GREs, whose sequences differ from the classic GRE, and are found in the genes encoding IL-1β (13Zhang G. Zhang L. Duff G.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), pro-opiomelanocortin (14Drouin J. Trifiro M.A. Plante R.K. Nemer M. Eriksson P. Wrange O. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1988; 241: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and proliferin (17Mordacq J.C. Linzer D.I. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). GREs adjacent to other transcription factor-binding sites, such as for AP-1, can contribute to the function of composite elements where the GR can have either positive or negative effects, depending on the cellular context and the composition of AP-1 (18Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that the GR also represses gene activation without binding DNA. This mode of repression, termed “direct interference” (19Ponta H. Cato A.C. Herrlich P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1129: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), has been associated with glucocorticoid inhibition of AP-1 and NF-κB, transcription factors that contribute to the transcriptional induction of most cytokine genes. The first reported example of direct interference was glucocorticoid repression of the AP-1 response element (TRE) of the collagenase gene (20Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 21Yang-Yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Both components of AP-1, c-Fos and c-Jun, were shown to interact with the GR in the absence of any GR to DNA interaction. Levels of AP-1 in the nucleus were not altered by glucocorticoids, and the ability of AP-1 to bind to the TRE was unaffected (20Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 22Konig H. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, however, the GR could displace c-Jun from the TRE (21Yang-Yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J. Drouin J. Karin M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1205-1215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), and c-Jun could displace the GR from the GRE (23Schule R. Rangarajan P. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Yang N. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that the liganded GR was directly interfering with AP-1 function were the observations that repression could take place in the absence of new protein synthesis, occurred at a concentration of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) lower than that required for transcriptional induction by the GR (20Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar), and could be carried out by mutant GRs whose transactivation ability was disrupted (20Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 21Yang-Yen H.F. Chambard J.C. Sun Y.L. Smeal T. Schmidt T.J.

Cell. 1990; 62: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Direct interference by the GR with the p65 subunit of NF-κB has also been reported (24Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The direct interference model for repression by nuclear receptors has been extended to the octamer-binding factors (25Kutoh E. Stromstedt P.E. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4960-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and C/EBP (26Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (repressed by the estrogen receptor). The direct interference model was further supported through the use of a C-terminal zinc finger point mutant GR whose homo-dimerization surface was disrupted, preventing cooperative binding to and transactivation through the classic GRE, which was able to repress AP-1 activity as a monomer (27Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Mice whose normal GR was replaced by this mutant appeared grossly normal and had no obvious peripheral lymphoid defects, although their thymocytes did not undergo apoptosis upon treatment with Dexin vitro (28Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J. Kretz O. Wessely O. Bock R. Gass P. Schmid W. Herrlich P. Angel P. Schutz G. Cell. 1998; 93: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In embryonic fibroblasts from these mice, Dex could block the TRE and the inflammatory mediators collagenase and gelatinase B, suggesting that direct interference is a major, if not the predominant, physiological mode of action of the GR. Another transcription-independent model for repression by the GR invokes competition, or “squelching,” between the GR and AP-1 or NF-κB for mutual coactivators such as p300/CBP. These coactivators possess histone acetyltransferase activity, which acts on chromatin to permit access to site-specific transcription factors. Limiting coactivators would thus serve to direct the cellular response toward the strongest signal (29Klein-Hitpass L. Schwerk C. Kahmann S. Vassen L. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting this model is based on studies in which overexpression of coactivators (30Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) or treatment with histone de-acetylase inhibitors relieves glucocorticoid repression (31Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, this model does not satisfactorily account, for example, for the ability of the activated retinoic acid receptor to repress AP-1 but not NF-κB (32De Bosscher K. Schmitz M.L. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13504-13509Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, additional mechanisms would be needed to confer specificity. To determine if the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids might be due at least in part to mechanisms other than direct interference or squelching, we asked whether the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of activation-induced up-regulation of IL-2 mRNA requires new protein synthesis. Cycloheximide prevented the suppression, suggesting that a glucocorticoid-induced gene product might be responsible. A recent analysis of glucocorticoid-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by cDNA gene chip array found that among the over 9,000 cDNA tested, the most highly induced gene was the DSIPI (“delta sleep-inducing peptide immunoreactor,” named for its shared immunoreactivity with the sequence-unrelated nonamer neuropeptide DSIP (33Sillard R. Schulz-Knappe P. Vogel P. Raida M. Bensch K.W. Forssmann W.G. Mutt V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). 2D. Franchimont, J. Galon, M. S. Vacchio, S.

Geenen, G. P. Chrousos, J. D. Ashwell, and J. J. O'Shea, submitted for publication. DSIPI shares nearly 100% nucleotide sequence homology with the C-terminal 75% of human glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) (34D'Adamio F. Zollo O. Moraca R. Ayroldi E. Bruscoli S. Bartoli A. Cannarile L. Migliorati G. Riccardi C. Immunity. 1997; 7: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Because murine GILZ has been reported to inhibit the expression of FasL in activated T hybridoma cells, we investigated the possibility that this glucocorticoid-responsive gene might mediate the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on the expression of activation-induced genes. The Jurkat human T cell line (ATCC) and the murine T cell hybridoma MA 5.8 (35Sussman J.J. Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Saito T. Klausner R.D. Ashwell J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 50 µm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 150 µg/ml gentamicin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from the NIH Blood Bank and were isolated by density gradient centrifugation with the use of lymphocyte separation medium (Biofluids). Antisera against GILZ were prepared by immunizing with the GST-GILZ fusion protein. A rabbit was immunized with 500 µg of the GST-GILZ fusion protein mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant and was boosted with 100 µg of GST-GILZ in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 2–4-week intervals. The monoclonal antibody against TCR-ζ was obtained from Ralph Kubo (La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA) (36Ono S. Ohno H. Saito T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 639-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PMA, ionomycin, dexamethasone, and doxycycline were obtained from Sigma. Luciferase reporters containing 511 nucleotides upstream of the FasL translation initiation site (−511) or containing the Egr-binding site (FLRE) (37Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and Egr-2- (38Rengarajan J. Mittelstadt P.R. Mages H.W. Gerth A.J. Kroczek R.A. Ashwell J.D. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 2000; 12: 293-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and Egr-3-driven (39Mages H.W. Baag R. Steiner B. Kroczek R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7157-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) luciferase reporters have been described. The eukaryotic expression plasmid TAM-67, encoding a transactivation-defective c-Jun mutant, and the luciferase reporter constructs TRE-luc, driven by six copies of the proximal (−153) TRE element from the murine IL-2 promoter, NFAT-luc, driven by three copies of the distal (−287) NFAT/AP-1 element of the murine IL-2 promoter, and IL-2-luc, driven by 0.3 kilobase pairs of the human IL-2 promoter, have been described (40Petrak D. Memon S.A. Birrer M.J. Ashwell J.D. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2046-2051PubMed Google Scholar). c-fos and c-jun in pcDNA3 expression vectors were obtained from Nancy Colburn (NCI, National Institutes of Health). The GILZ cDNA was amplified from total RNA obtained from Dex-treated murine 2B4.11 hybridoma cells (41Hedrick S.M. Matis L.A. Hecht T.T. Samelson L.E. Longo D.L. Heber-Katz E. Schwartz R.H. Cell. 1982; 30: 141-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Nucleotide 65 of GILZ derived from 2B4.11 cells (T) differed from the corresponding nucleotide in the original characterization of this gene (C) (GenBank NM 010286), resulting in a change in the predicted amino acid sequence from a threonine to an isoleucine. This difference was also found in the T cell hybridoma 3DO, as well as spleen cells from C57/BL6 mice, and is consistent with the published nucleotide sequences of rat (AB025431) and human (AB025432) GILZ. After adding a C-terminal Myc tag epitope, the cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the expression vector pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI). The GILZ mutant ΔLZ, from which leucine zipper-spanning amino acids 76–96 were removed, was generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pCI-neo. GILZ-(C-terminal)Myc was transferred into the tetracycline-regulated expression vector pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). The plasmid pcDNA6, encoding the tetracycline repressor, was obtained from Invitrogen. Constructs encoding GST-GILZ fusion proteins were created by amplifying the GILZ cDNA and fragments 1–60, 61–104, 61–137, 105–137, and ΔLZ to incorporate BamHI and EcoRI sites and transferring them into pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In transient reporter assays, 2 × 106 Jurkat cells in 0.2 ml of complete medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, were electroporated with the indicated plasmids with a GenePulser (Bio-Rad) using 960 microfarads and 250 V. Empty parental expression plasmids were included to equalize the amount of DNA used in each cuvette. Where indicated, cultures were stimulated with 20 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 1 µg/ml ionomycin. Error bars represent the geometric error of duplicate transfections. Experiments using the tetracycline-regulated expression system were performed using tetracycline-free fetal calf serum (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 1 µg of the pcDNA4-GILZ constructs, 0.5 µg of the repressor-encoding plasmid pcDNA6, and 2.5 µg of the luciferase reporter plasmids were used. Doxycycline was added at a final concentration of 100 nm. The base-line activities of the reporter plasmids were generally in the range 300 to 6000 relative light units and did not change appreciably when GILZ was coexpressed. Total RNA (3 µg) was separated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and MOPS buffer (Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After transfer to a Genescreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), RNA was covalently bound by UV cross-linking, and hybridization with32P-labeled cDNA probes was carried out at 42 °C in 5× SSPE, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 50% formamide (Analytical Biosciences). cDNAs encoding human IL-2 and glyceraldyhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used as probes. Final washes were performed at 65 °C in 2× SSPE and 2% SDS. After exposing the blot to detect human IL-2 mRNA, the membrane was stripped by boiling in 0.1× SSC and 1% SDS and probed for GAPDH. Blots were visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions between the GST fusion protein-coated beads and35S-labeled proteins were performed in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 250 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol while rotating at 4 °C for 2 h. Proteins remaining after washing the beads with binding buffer were eluted by boiling in sample buffer, separated by electrophoresis through 10% or 13.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and visualized with a PhosphorImager. To obtain AP-1, the murine T cell hybridoma MA 5.8 was stimulated for 30 min with 50 nmPMA. Extracts were prepared as described, as was the binding reaction buffer, except that 50 mm NaCl was included (37Mittelstadt P.R. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3744-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The following reagents were added as indicated: 1 pmol (a 50-fold excess) of unlabeled AP-1 or NF-κB oligonucleotides, 2 µg of Fos-specific (K-25) or control Egr-2-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 8 µm GST or GST-GILZ. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, 20 fmol of [32P]dATP end-labeled AP-1 oligonucleotide was added to the reactions, which were allowed to incubate for an additional 30 min at room temperature. The samples were resolved by electrophoresis through a 5% native acrylamide gel run at 100 V in 0.5× TBE for 1 h and visualized with a PhosphorImager. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were AP-1, 5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′, and NF-κB, 5′-TAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAG-GCA-3′. Samples from equivalent numbers of cells were lysed in sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol) and denatured by boiling. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with antibodies, and developed with 125I-labeled protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-GILZ antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:200. The anti-TCR-ζ- probed blot was probed with rabbit anti-mouse Ig (H + L) antibodies (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Transcription-independent direct interference is accepted as a major, if not the major, mechanism by which glucocorticoids suppress transcription of responsive genes. A key feature of this phenomenon is that suppression should occur in the absence of new protein synthesis (provided that induction of the gene in question itself does not rely on factors that require de novo synthesis). IL-2 plays a pivotal role in the immune response, and its transcriptional induction in T cells activated in vitro can be inhibited by Dex (42Gillis S. Crabtree G.R. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1624-1631PubMed Google Scholar, 43Vacca A. Martinotti S. Screpanti I. Maroder M. Felli M.P. Farina A.R. Gismondi A. Santoni A. Frati L. Gulino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8075-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of IL-2 transcription largely depends on constitutively expressed transcription factors and thus does not require new protein synthesis (44Kronke M. Leonard W.J. Depper J.M. Greene W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 161: 1593-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To determine whether glucocorticoid-mediated repression of IL-2 production requires new protein synthesis, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated for 3 h with PMA and ionomycin in the presence or absence of Dex and/or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), at which time IL-2 mRNA levels were determined by Northern blotting (Fig.1 A). PMA/ionomycin-induced IL-2 mRNA up-regulation was inhibited by cotreatment with Dex (compare lanes 2 and 4). Treatment with CHX did not induce expression of IL-2 message but did cause an increase in the activation-induced level (compare lanes 2 and 6). This increase, characteristic of early-response genes whose transiently elevated mRNA levels are prolonged by blocking synthesis of presumed destabilizing proteins, has been described as “superinduction” (45Lau L.F. Nathans D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Adding CHX to Dex-stimulated cells restored the level of IL-2 mRNA to that of the CHX-superinduced cells. Note that although CHX treatment itself caused a reduction in GAPDH, as reported previously (46Nakamura H. Haley K.J. Nakamura T. Luster A.D. Lilly C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L601-L610PubMed Google Scholar), the GAPDH levels were the same within the group cultured without CHX and within the group cultured with CHX and therefore serves as a loading control. These data argue against a strict direct interference model, suggesting instead that in normal T cells the liganded GR induces a gene whose product inhibits transcription of IL-2. BecauseGILZ is among the most responsive of the genes up-regulated by glucocorticoids,2 we considered the possibility that it might be a general mediator of glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional repression. Stable expression of GILZ in T cell hybridoma cells has been shown to block activation-induced up-regulation of FasL (34D'Adamio F. Zollo O. Moraca R. Ayroldi E. Bruscoli S. Bartoli A. Cannarile L. Migliorati G. Riccardi C. Immunity. 1997; 7: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). To begin to address the mechanism by which GILZ acts, we first determined whether its inhibitory effect on FasL induction is at the transcriptional level. GILZ cDNA was transiently expressed in Jurkat T cells together with FasL promoter-driven reporter plasmids. When cotransfected with an empty expression plasmid, the intact FasL reporter plasmid (bases −511 to −1 relative to the translation initiation site) was strongly induced by treatment with PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 2 A). Cotransfection of a GILZ-expressing plasmid decreased the induction in a dose-responsive manner, indicating that GILZ acts on transcription. This region of the fasL gene contains a number of transcription factor binding sites that have been implicated in FasL regulation, including sites for Egr family members (−214 to −207), NFAT (−276 to −272), and NF-κB (−138 to −128) (37Mittelstadt P.R.

We have found that much of the activity of the FasL promoter depends upon the Egr-binding site (termed the FLRE), since mutation of this element abrogated activation-induced reporter up-regulation. To determine if the effect of GILZ on FasL promoter activity was due to interference with the Egr-mediated pathway, a reporter driven by a promoter containing just the FasL FLRE (−220 to −205) driving the proximal 3′ region of the FasL promoter (37Mittelstadt P.R.

It can be simulated using the Bragg bubble-raft model1, in which a close-packed array of soap bubbles corresponds to the equilibrium positions of atoms in a crystalline solid. Here we show that homogeneous defect nucleation occurs within a crystal when its surface roughness is comparable to the radius of the indenter tip, and that the depth of the nucleation site below the surface is proportional to the half-width of the contact. Our results may explain the unusually high local stress required for defect nucleation in nano-indented face-centred cubic crystals."

They participate in a variety of cellular functions, such as providing reducing equivalents for ribonucleotide reductase, antioxidant defense, control of cellular redox state, and the redox control of transcription and signal transduction (1Holmgren A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The proteins of mitochondrial and cytosolic Trx systems were shown to be encoded by distinct genes. The components of the mitochondrial Trx system were identified by the presence of signal peptides and by experiments that directly tested intracellular localization of these proteins. The GSH system is composed of GSH, GSSG reductase, glutaredoxin (thiol/disulfide oxidoreductase (Grx), also called thioltransferase), and GSH peroxidase (1Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The composition of Trx and GSH systems is similar in that Trx and Grx are thiol/disulfide oxidoreductases characterized by the Trx fold; GSH peroxidase and Trx peroxidase are thiol-dependent peroxidases also containing the Trx fold; and Trx reductase and GSSG reductase are NADPH-dependent FAD-containing homodimeric pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductases. In contrast to the Trx system, the GSH system was only found and characterized in the cytosol. Moreover, single GSSG reductase and Grx genes were described in mammals, and only one GSH form exists in mammalian cells. However, GSSG reductase was shown to possess a mitochondrial signal peptide, allowing it to be directed to mitochondria (12Kelner M.J. Montoya M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 366-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Likewise, GSH was detected in mitochondrial fractions (mitochondrial GSH accounts for ∼10% of the cellular GSH pool), and two GSH peroxidases, GPx1 and GPx4, can also be targeted to mitochondria (13Esworthy R.S. Ho Y.S. Chu F.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 14Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Thus, Grx is the only component of the GSH system that was not found to reside in mitochondria. Grx is a small, 10–14-kDa GSH-dependent protein (1Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Aslund F. Beckwith J. Cell. 1999; 96: 751-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 3Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Its function is to maintain reduced state of cysteines in cellular proteins. Like Trx, Grx contains the N-terminal redox center, the so-called CXXC motif (two cysteines separated by two other amino acid residues). The Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys version of this sequence is typically present in Grx. The two thiol groups in this motif are the source of reducing equivalents for substrate reduction. These residues form reversible disulfide bond during catalysis and were shown to be the enzyme active site. Grx also contains conserved C-terminal sequences involved in GSH binding (15Nordstrand K. Sandstrom A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It appears that the absence of Grx in mitochondria contrasts with the expected importance of this protein in providing reducing equivalents for DNA synthesis and maintaining reduced status of thiols in proteins in this cellular compartment. In this report, we describe identification and functional characterization of a mitochondrial Grx. Expression constructs were generated using EST clones corresponding to mouse and human Grx2 mRNAs. The mouse Grx2 expression construct was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the mouse Grx2 cDNA as a template and primers containing NdeI (5′-GACACGTCATATGGGAAACAGCACATCGTC-3′) and XhoI (5′-CCACTCGAGATGTCTTTCCTCTTGTTTTTTTTTTAAATAACAC-3′) sites. The human Grx2 sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a plasmid containing the human Grx2 insert as a template and primers containing NcoI (5′-ACAGCCATGGAGAGCAATACATCATC-3′) andXhoI (5′-TAACTCGAGCTGAAATTCTTTCCTCTTAC-3′) sites. The amplified products and the pET21d(+) vector (Novagen) were digested with NcoI and XhoI, and the polymerase chain reaction fragments encompassing the mouse or human Grx2 were ligated into the restricted pET21d(+) using T4 DNA ligase. Once subcloned, the amplified regions were sequenced in their entirety. Human and mouse Grx2 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and proteins were isolated as follows. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in 200 ml of cell culture media. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 8 ml of ice-cold 5 mm imidazole, 0.5m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (buffer A). After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied onto a 5-ml His-bind column preequilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A and, in addition, with 15 ml of 60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9. Grx2 was eluted with 10 ml of 1 mimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. Human Grx1 was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (16Qiao F.-Y. Xing K.-Y. Liu A. Ehlers N. Raghavachari N. Lou M.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 42: 743-751Google Scholar). For the N-Grx2-GFP construct, the mouse Grx2 cDNA was amplified with primers Grx2-F1 (5′-CGAGCTCACCATGTCCTGGCGCCG-3′) and Grx2-R2 (5′-GTGGATCCCATGTCTTTCCTCTTGTT-3′) and cloned into theSacI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2 vector (CLONTECH). The Grx2-GFP construct was obtained by amplification of the Grx2 cDNA with primers Grx2-F2 (5′-CGAGCTCACCATGGGAAACAGCACAT-3′) and Grx2-R2 and cloning the product into the SacI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2. The construct encoding the N-terminal sequence of Grx2 (33 amino acids) fused to GFP (the N-GFP construct) was obtained by amplification of the mouse cDNA with primers Grx2-F1 and Grx2-R1 (5′-TGGATCCCGAGCCCGCAGCT-3′) and cloning the product into theSacI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2. The GFP-N-Grx2 construct was obtained by amplification of the mouse Grx2 cDNA with Grx2-F1 and Grx2-R2C (5′-TGGATCCATGTCTTTCCTCTTGTT-3′) and cloning the product into the SacI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C3 vector (CLONTECH). All plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain NovaBlue (Novagen), and the plasmids were isolated using Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). NIH-3T3 cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were transfected with appropriate constructs using the calcium phosphate method of transfection. Cells were transfected with 8.8 µg of plasmid as described (17Sambrooc J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.36Google Scholar) and incubated for 24 h in a CO2 incubator. A MitoTracker (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used as a reference marker for mitochondria. The transfected cells were rinsed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the same medium containing MitoTracker at a 1:2000 dilution. The cells were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-HEPES and were immediately used for image collection. Double-labeled images of life cells were collected with water immersion lens using a dual excitation/emission and dual channel mode on a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES laser-scanning microscope. The standard assay for Grx2 activity was the procedure developed by Mieyal et al. (18Mieyal J.J. Starke D.W. Gravina S.A. Hocevar B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8883-88891Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Mieyal J.J. Starke D.W. Gravina S.A. Dothey C. Chung J.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6088-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and modified by Raghavachari and Lou (20Raghavachari N. Lou M.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm GSH, 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.4 units of GSSG reductase, and an aliquot of purified Grx2 in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C following a 5-min preincubation with 2 mm synthetic substrate, hydroxyethyldisulfide (HEDS). The decrease in absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm was monitored for 5 min using Beckman DU 640 Spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). To determine the Grx2 activity, the slope of the linear portion of the time course for 340-nm absorption loss in a control (Grx2-free) sample was subtracted from the slope of the samples containing Grx2. One unit of Grx2 activity was defined as 1 µmol of NADPH oxidized per min under these standard assay conditions. Temperature (20–45 °C) and pH (6.5–9.0) dependences of Grx2 activities were determined using the standard Grx2 assay. Studies on substrate specificities utilized S-sulfocysteine and cystine in place of HEDS. Substrate concentrations were in the range of 0.0125–1.6 mm and assayed with 5 milliunits of Grx2. The apparent K m andk cat values were calculated using the Lineweaver-Burk plot. A 0.02-unit aliquot of reduced Grx2 was incubated with 30 µmiodoacetamide in 50 µl of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min prior to the Grx2 assay. Purified Grx2 was initially incubated with 5 mm DTT at room temperature for 30 min and filtered through PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove unreacted DTT. An aliquot (0.02 units) of the resulting reduced Grx2 in 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was preincubated with various concentrations of H2O2 (0.125–1.5 mm) in a total volume of 6 µl for 5 min at 25 °C. Ten µl of catalase (2 µg) was subsequently added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for additional 5 min at room temperature to degrade the remaining H2O2. The Grx2 activity was then determined using the standard Grx2 assay. To examine if H2O2-treated Grx2 could be reactivated by reducing agents, Grx2 (0.2 units) was incubated with 1 mmH2O2 in 120 µl of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 µg of catalase. The sample was then divided into six fractions, and each fraction was mixed with 0.1 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm GSH, 5 mm GSH, Trx/Trx reductase system, or Trx alone and incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. The final volume of each reactivation reaction was 40 µl. Ten µl of each sample was used for the Grx2 assay. Concentrations of NADPH, E. coli Trx, and E. coli Trx reductase in the Trx/Trx reductase system were 0.25 mm, 10 µm, and 0.8 µm, respectively. Trx/Trx reductase system without H2O2-inactivated Grx2 was used as a control. Human recombinant Grx1 was assayed in parallel with Grx2. BLAST programs were used to search for homologs of previously described glutaredoxins in EST and nonredundant data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. These programs were also used to determine the structure of the human Grx2 gene and to identify alternative splicing forms of mammalian Grx2 mRNAs. Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using the ClustalW program. Homology between Grx2 proteins and Grx from other sources was sufficient to develop a molecular model of the core of the Grx2 structure. Mouse Grx2 tertiary structure was modeled using the SWISS-MODEL program (21Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar, 22Peitsch M.C.

Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and the following known three-dimensional structures as templates: the NMR solution structure of human Grx1 in the fully reduced form (1JHB) (24Sun C. Berardi M.J. Bushweller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1687-1998Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), crystal structure of pig Grx1 (1KTE) (25Katti S.K. Robbins A.H. Yang Y. Wells W.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1998-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and NMR structure of human mutant Grx1 complexed with GSH (1B4QA) (26Yang Y. Jao S.C. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The modeling was performed for sequences spanning residues 49–150 of mouse Grx2. EST clones were obtained from Research Genetics, and their nucleotide sequences were determined at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln DNA sequencing facility. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using polyacrylamide gels, standards, and other electrophoretic reagents from Novex. Homology search analyses using known Grx sequences revealed a previously uncharacterized sequence that was represented by several mammalian ESTs. Multiple sequence alignments of human ESTs for this sequence identified a cDNA that contained an open reading frame of 164 amino acid residues. Subsequent homology analyses revealed that this open reading frame was also encoded by mouse, rat, and swine ESTs, suggesting that it was conserved among mammals and birds. Nucleotide sequences of representative human and mouse ESTs were experimentally verified (Fig. 1). The new human open reading frame exhibited 36% identity to human Grx1 and was designated as Grx2. Multiple sequence alignments of human, mouse, and rat Grx2 with known Grx1 proteins (Fig.2 A) indicated that Grx2 had a conserved disulfide active center, the CXXC motif, typical of Grx and Trx proteins. In addition, sequences that were previously demonstrated to be involved in GSH binding were conserved between Grx1 and Grx2. Grx2 exhibited highest homology to Grx from plants and fungi (e.g. 48% identity to Grx from a higher plantVernicia fordii; accession number AF047694). It was also highly homologous to the N-terminal sequence of human thioredoxin reductase isozyme TGR that consists of a natural fusion of N-terminal Grx and C-terminal Trx reductase domains (39% identity, accession number AF171055). Two additional unpublished sequences for Grx2 recently appeared in GenBankTM (accession numbers NM016066 for CGI-133 protein and AF132495 for glutaredoxin 2). These sequences were in a good agreement with our human Grx2 sequence.Figure 2Amino acid and nucleotide sequence analyses of mammalian Grx2 proteins.

Sequences of human and mouse Grx2 proteins were determined in the present study. The rat Grx2 sequence was compiled from 10 unique ESTs. Two conserved cysteines that are located in the N-terminal portion of the protein and that form a redox active center are shown by closed circles above the sequence. Residues identical in all six sequences are highlighted. The star above the sequences indicates a methionine residue that is translated from the second in-frame ATG codon (see text for details).

Nucleotide sequence identities with several other partial genomic sequences (e.g. BAC clones RP11–556C11 and RP11–239J11) also indicated the location of the human Grx2 gene on chromosome 1. Organization of the human Grx2 gene is shown in Fig. 2 B. The 10-kb gene contained 4 exons and 3 introns with the coding regions present in exons 1–4. The initiator ATG codon, in a moderately favorable Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of translation (GCTATGC), was present in the first exon, while an additional in-frame ATG codon (in a more favorable Kozak sequence, GGAATGG) occupied nucleotide positions 2–4 within exon 2. Examination of the human Grx2 sequence with SignalP and PSORT programs indicated the presence of a predicted mitochondrial signal peptide (hydrophobic sequence with a high proportion of lysine or arginine residues that forms an amphiphilic α-helix). Mitochondrial leader sequences were also present in mouse and rat Grx2 sequences. As often observed in mammalian genes, the mitochondrial signal peptide was encoded by exon 1, whereas sequences conserved within the Grx family of enzymes were encoded by downstream exons. To test whether the first exon of Grx2 encodes a signal peptide that directs the protein to mitochondria, we expressed various fusion proteins of Grx2 and GFP, followed by the detection of GFP fluorescence by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). When the N-terminal signal peptide of Grx2 was fused to the N terminus of GFP, the latter protein was detected in mitochondria. Likewise, expression of a full-length Grx2 fused to the N terminus of GFP directed the fusion protein to mitochondria. However, GFP alone (data not shown) and GFP placed downstream of Grx2 that lacked the signal peptide were not directed to mitochondria and did not show any specific localization pattern. Thus, Grx2 has a functional mitochondrial signal peptide and should be considered a mitochondrial protein. Interestingly, when GFP was present upstream of the full-length Grx2 (last row in Fig. 3), the fusion protein was significantly enriched in nuclei. Examination of EST sequences for human, mouse, and rat Grx2 revealed alternative mRNA forms that differed in sequences upstream of exon 2. For example, a human cDNA sequence was detected (accession number AA421320) that contained sequences upstream of exon 1 on chromosome 1q31.2–31.3, which replaced sequences corresponding to exon 1, whereas downstream sequences (exons 2–4) for both forms were identical. Alternative splicing forms of mouse (Fig.4 A) and rat (Fig.4 B) Grx2 mRNAs were also detected. These rodent forms either lacked sequences corresponding to a portion of exon 1 downstream of the translation initiation ATG codon or contained new sequences in place of sequences encoding mitochondrial signal peptides. In the rat, one alternative splicing form was represented by 12 ESTs, which is approximately half of all available rat Grx2 EST sequences. This alternative splicing form lacked 90 nucleotides within exon 1 that resulted in an in-frame stop signal between the initiation ATG and the second ATG codons (Fig. 4 B). Mouse EST sequences for Grx2 showed even more complex sequence variations. While sequences corresponding to exon 2 were identical in all mouse ESTs, we detected four distinct alternative sequences (accession numbers BE192757,AA466975, AA050108, and W61977) in place of sequences corresponding to exon 1 (Fig. 4 A). Overall, these data indicated extensive sequence variations in 5′-sequences of mammalian Grx2 mRNAs and suggested alternative first exon splicing as a mechanism to generate these mRNA forms. Grx2 was represented by 24 human ESTs derived from nine cDNA libraries, including nine fetal brain, four testes, two fetal kidney, and two colon ESTs as well as several individual sequences derived from prostate tumor, corneal stroma, HL60 (promyelocyte) cell line, kidney, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Mouse Grx2 was represented by 36 ESTs from 12 cDNA libraries. Like the human protein, it was highly represented by ESTs derived from testes (seven sequences), fetal (two sequences), and embryonic (nine sequences) tissues. Mouse Grx2 was also represented by mammary gland, lymph node, kidney, thymus, placenta, myotubes, proximal colon, and hypothalamus ESTs. The data suggested that Grx2 mRNA is expressed in a variety of tissues with possible increased levels in testes and fetal and embryonic tissues. It should be noted that several cDNA libraries that contained Grx2 clones were normalized. This fact limits the assessment of absolute expression levels of Grx2 mRNA. Human and mouse Grx2 were expressed in E. coli in the form of His-tagged proteins. Recombinant proteins were isolated using a nickel affinity column and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig.5). To express mature human and mouse Grx2s (forms that lack mitochondrial leader peptides), constructs were developed in which translation was initiated from the second in-frame ATG codon that corresponded to nucleotides 2–4 within human exon 2. Examination of human and mouse recombinant proteins revealed little difference in their catalytic activities (data not shown). Catalytic properties of human Grx2 were determined in parallel with and compared with recombinant human Grx1. The activity of Grx2 was limited to a narrow range of pH between 7.5 and 8.5, with the optimal pH of 8.0. This pH dependence of Grx2 activity as well as temperature dependence (data not shown) were similar to those of Grx1 (17Sambrooc J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T.

Recombinant Grx2 catalyzed reduction of mixed disulfides formed between GSH and HEDS, S-sulfocysteine, or l-cystine (Fig. 6). The apparentK m values for HEDS, S-sulfocysteine, andl-cystine were 1.68, 1.77, and 0.30 mm, respectively (Table I). The catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of Grx2 was different for the three substrates. Grx2 displayed the highest efficiency with cystine, followed by HEDS andS-sulfocysteine with equal efficiency (Table I).Table ICatalytic properties of Grx2SubstrateK mk catk cat/K mmmmin−1mm−1min−1HEDS1.6840.023.8S-Sulfocysteine1.7746.926.5Cystine0.323.177.0 Open table in a new tab Grx2 activity was inhibited in the presence of the alkylating agent, iodoacetamide. Incubation of the protein with iodoacetamide for 15 min resulted in 95% inhibition, suggesting that an active site SH group(s) was involved in the reaction catalyzed by Grx2. Grx2 was also partially inactivated when treated with H2O2. As shown in Fig.7, the activity loss was 20% in the presence of 0.1 mm and 40% in the presence of 0.5 mm H2O2 and remained at 50–55% even after H2O2 was increased to 1.5 mm. The activity of Grx1 was also inhibited by H2O2 (Fig. 7), as previously reported (28Lou M.F. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 16: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Grx2 activity could be almost fully regenerated by treating the partially inactivated protein with 5 mm GSH; however, no protein reactivation was observed in the presence of 5 mmDTT or the E. coli Trx/Trx reductase system (TableII). This observation contrasted with the finding that Grx1 could be reactivated by these reagents (data not shown).Table IIOxidation of Grx2 by H2O2 and its reactivation by reductantsTreatmentPercentage of Grx2 activity%Inactivated Grx2 (1 mmH2O2)47.3 ± 4.9Inactivated Grx2 + GSH (0.5 mm)52.2 ± 5.8Inactivated Grx2 + GSH (5 mm)96.4 ± 1.9Inactivated Grx2 + DTT (5 mm)50.4 ± 11.6Inactivated Grx2 + Trx/Trx reductase57.3 ± 3.8Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. n = 3. Open table in a new tab Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. n = 3. Amino acid sequence similarity between Grx1 (for which several three-dimensional structures are available) and Grx2 was sufficient to generate a molecular model of Grx2. We modeled mouse Grx2 structure using NMR structures of human Grx1 and x-ray structure of pig Grx1 as templates (Fig.8). The predicted Grx2 structure revealed conservation of all major structural features found in mammalian Grx1. Specifically, Grx2 had a Trx fold that can be recognized by the presence of a characteristic β-sheet core surrounded by α-helixes. The CXXC motif in Grx2 was located at the N-terminal end of a first α-helix, which is another typical structural feature of Trx fold proteins. The close structural similarity between Grx1 and Grx2 could explain similarity in their catalytic properties. The model, however, was not sufficient to explain differences in reactivation properties between Grx1 and Grx2. We described identification and characterization of a novel mammalian mitochondrial glutaredoxin (thioltransferase), Grx2. The new protein exhibited only 36% sequence identity with the previously characterized mammalian cytosolic glutaredoxin, Grx1. However, it conserved the disulfide active center CXXC sequence and a substrate binding motif and exhibited catalytic properties typical of previously characterized Grx proteins. To characterize Grx2, we analyzed catalytic properties of bacterially expressed and purified mouse and human proteins in parallel with Grx1. Substrate specificity and substrate inhibition patterns were similar for two proteins. Likewise, Grx1 and Grx2 were both sensitive to inactivation by an alkylating agent, iodoacetamide, and an oxidant, hydrogen peroxide. However, the H2O2-inactivated Grx2 could only be reactivated fully in the presence of high concentrations of GSH, while other strong reducing agents, such as DTT and Trx were not effective in Grx2 reactivation. This property of Grx2 distinguished this protein from Grx1, whose activity could be restored effectively by DTT or the Trx/Trx reductase system. The conserved sequences within mammalian Grx2 were preceded by a leader sequence indicative of a mitochondrial protein, and this signal was shown to direct either GFP or Grx2-GFP fusion protein to mitochondria. This finding that Grx2 resides in mitochondria is significant in view of the previously established location of other components of the GSH system in this cellular compartment. Although no mitochondrial Grx was previously reported in any eukaryotic organism, our data suggest that Grx2 is a functional mitochondrial protein. The finding of a second Grx in mammals is similar to the fact that several Grx isoenzymes were previously described in bacteria, yeast, and plants. These proteins exhibit strong sequence homology, often have overlapping functions, and generally participate in the same or related metabolic pathways. However, recent evidence indicates that Grx isozymes may also play unique roles in cellular redox regulation (2Aslund F. Beckwith J. Cell. 1999; 96: 751-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4Aslund F. Beckwith J. J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome encodes two Grx isozymes containing the CXXC motif. Expression of both proteins is induced in response to oxidative, osmotic, and heat stress and in response to stationary phase growth and growth on nonfermentable carbon sources (30Grant C.M. Luikenhuis S. Beckhouse A. Soderbergh M. Dawes I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, yeast Grx1 and Grx2 are activated by the high osmolarity glycerol pathway and negatively regulated by the Ras-protein kinase A pathway. However, Grx1 is induced to significantly higher levels compared with Grx2 following heat and osmotic shock, whereas Grx2 is rapidly induced in response to reactive oxygen species and upon entry into stationary phase growth (30Grant C.M. Luikenhuis S. Beckhouse A. Soderbergh M. Dawes I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, the S. cerevisiae genome encodes three Grx isozymes, which contain an active center motif with a single conserved Cys (29Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The five yeast Grx isozymes show a complex functional relationship, such as the synthetic lethality of either Grx5 and Grx2 mutations or inactivation of the Grx5 gene together with genes for Grx3 and Grx4. In addition, Grx5 plays a specific role in protection against oxidative and osmotic stresses (29Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The E. coli genome encodes three functional Grx isozymes characterized by common as well as unique functional properties (4Aslund F. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1375-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to E. coli and S. cerevisiae, where multiple Grx proteins occupy the same (cytosolic) compartment, the two mammalian Grx proteins appear to reside in different compartments. Thus, the finding of similar catalytic profiles for these enzymes is not surprising. Expression patterns of Grx2 mRNA, which appears to be prevalent in fetal and embryonic tissues and in testes, may provide an additional clue to functional distinction between mammalian Grx1 and Grx2. In addition to mRNA forms encoding mitochondrial Grx2, we detected mRNA forms that were obtained by alternative splicing. Such forms were detected in the human, mouse, and rat sequences. Interestingly, some of the alternative forms contained in-frame stop signals. It is not clear how these forms could result in expression of functional proteins. One possibility is that the ATG codon that occupies positions 2–4 within exon 2 in the human sequence and the corresponding ATG codons in the mouse and rat sequences could function as an alternative translation initiation site. This ATG is conserved in all mammalian Grx2 sequences, and we showed that it could initiate translation of human and mouse Grx2 proteins when these proteins were expressed inE. coli. The use of this ATG codon to initiate protein synthesis may potentially result in a cytosolic form of Grx2. In addition, the fusion protein, in which GFP was upstream of Grx2, was enriched in nuclei, so we cannot exclude the nuclear location of some of the alternative splicing forms. This situation would be similar to expression of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, whose gene contains two in-frame ATG codons. The use of the first ATG yields a mitochondrial protein, whereas the second ATG also can initiate glutathione peroxidase synthesis, resulting in a cytosolic enzyme. Moreover, the use of an alternative first exon instead of the mitochondrial exon appears to direct the protein to the nucleus (31Pfeifer H. Conrad M. Roethlein D. Kyriakopoulos A. Brielmeier M. Bornkamm G.W. Behne D. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The role of the GSH system in mitochondria is not fully understood. Nevertheless, one may envision the importance of the GSH system in protecting this organelle from reactive oxygen species that are generated as by-products of metabolic processes. Grx2 may be expected to serve an important role in this protection by maintaining reduced states of thiols in mitochondrial proteins and by reducing their glutathionylated cysteine residues with the concurrent oxidation of GSH to GSSG. This physiological function of Grx2 may also be extended to pathological and toxicological conditions that are characterized by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species generated in mitochondria and where the demand for the Grx function may be increased. During revision of this paper, a paper has been published on line that also describes identification and characterization of Grx2 (32Lundberg, M., Johansson, C., Chandra, J., Enoksson, M., Jacobsson, G., Ljung, J., Johansson, M. & Holmgren, A.

https://openalex.org/W2055008532,"The existence of Δ4 fatty acid desaturation in the biosynthesis of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) has been questioned over the years. In this report we describe the identification from Thraustochytrium sp. of two cDNAs,Fad4 and Fad5, coding for Δ4 and Δ5 fatty acid desaturases, respectively. The Δ4 desaturase, when expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, introduced a double bond at position 4 of 22:5(n-3) and 22:4(n-6) resulting in the production of DHA and docosapentanoic acid. The enzyme, when expressed in Brassica juncea under the control of a constitutive promoter, desaturated the exogenously supplied substrate 22:5(n-3), resulting in the production of DHA in vegetative tissues. These results support the notion that DHA can be synthesized via Δ4 desaturation and suggest the possibility that DHA can be produced in oilseed crops on a large scale."

In response to histamine stimulation of intact femoral artery, a smooth muscle-specific protein called CPI-17 (for protein kinase C-potentiatedinhibitory protein for heterotrimeric myosin light chain phosphatase of 17 kDa) is phosphorylated and converted to a potent inhibitor for myosin phosphatase. Phosphorylation of CPI-17 is diminished by pretreatment with either Y27632 or GF109203x, suggesting involvement of multiple kinases (Kitazawa, T., Eto, M., Woodsome, T. P., and Brautigan, D. L.

DEAE-Toyopearl column chromatography of aorta extracts separated two CPI-17 kinases. One kinase was protein kinase C (PKC) α, and the second kinase was purified to homogeneity as a 45-kDa protein, and identified by sequencing as PKCδ. Purified PKCδ was 3-fold more reactive with CPI-17 compared with myelin basic protein, whereas purified PKCα and recombinant RhoA-activated kinases (Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein Ser/Thr kinase and protein kinase N) showed equal activity with CPI-17 and myelin basic protein.

Expression of CPI-17 is highly restricted to smooth muscle tissues, and it is especially abundant in arterial smooth muscles. For example, CPI-17 is estimated to be 7 µm in rabbit femoral artery (25Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 26Woodsome, T. P., Eto, M., Everett, A., Brautigan, D. L., and Kitazawa, T. (2001) J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr38 in CPI-17 converts it to a potent MLCP inhibitor with an IC50 of ∼5 nm (24Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 27Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Phospho-CPI-17 enhances myosin phosphorylation and contraction of both permeabilized arterial smooth muscle and intact fibroblast (28Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 503: 871-881Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Unlike other well known type 1 phosphatase (PP1) inhibitor proteins, such as inhibitor1, DARPP32, and inhibitor2, which inhibit monomeric PP1C but not MLCP, CPI-17 can inhibit the trimeric form of MLCP, without dissociation of subunits (25Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CPI-17 is a soluble and globular protein with molecular mass of 17 kDa (27Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Permeabilization of femoral artery strips using β-escin or Triton X-100 depletes endogenous CPI-17 with loss of the contractile response to phorbol ester. The PKC-induced contraction of permeabilized artery is reconstituted by addition of recombinant CPI-17 (30Kitazawa T. Takizawa N. Ikebe M. Eto M. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression pattern of CPI-17 among six different smooth muscle tissues correlates with their extent of PKC-induced contraction, implying that CPI-17 is key to the PKC-mediated Ca2+ sensitization (26Woodsome, T. P., Eto, M., Everett, A., Brautigan, D. L., and Kitazawa, T. (2001) J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). Assays with purified kinases show that Thr38 of CPI-17 can be phosphorylated by multiple kinases such as PKC, ROCK, PKN, and ZIP-like kinase (24Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar,31Koyama M. Ito M. Feng J. Seko T. Shiraki K. Takase K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Indeed, CPI-17 is phosphorylated in femoral artery strips in response to stimulus with phenylepherine, histamine, GTPγS, and phorbol ester (34Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9897-9900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Importantly, histamine-induced phosphorylation of endogenous CPI-17 and contraction of femoral artery are diminished by treatment with both GF109203x (a PKC inhibitor) and Y27632 (a ROCK inhibitor), suggesting that both PKC and ROCK are involved in CPI-17-induced vasoconstriction (34Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9897-9900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Here, using recombinant CPI-17 as a substrate, we purified from pig aorta smooth muscle CPI-17 kinases that are sensitive to GF109203x and Y27632. PKCα and PKCδ were purified from pig aorta smooth muscle using recombinant CPI-17 as a substrate. We measured CPI-17 kinase activity both in vitroand in smooth muscle cells using GF109203x and Y27632 as inhibitors, and found that both inhibitors reduce CPI-17 phosphorylation by PKC and contraction of arterial smooth muscle by phorbol ester. In vascular smooth muscle, elevation of cytosolic Ca2+concentration leads to activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase and phosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin (1Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Studies using smooth muscle strips permeabilized with α-toxin, β-escin, and other detergents revealed that myosin phosphorylation is enhanced by stimulus with various agonists, such as histamine, or by treatment with drugs such as phorbol ester, in the presence of constant submaximal Ca2+ concentration (2Nishimura J.

These findings indicate that myosin phosphatase activity is suppressed in response to various stimuli to produce Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle contractility (reviewed in Ref. 5Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Myosin phosphatase (MLCP)1 is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme, consisting of a 110-kDa myosin targeting subunit (MYPT1), a 21-kDa noncatalytic subunit (M21), and a δ isoform of PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1Cδ) (6Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdodi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Rho-activated kinase (ROCK) and protein kinase C (PKC) have been proposed to mediate the inhibition of MLCP in response to various agonists (5Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of α-toxin-permeabilized portal vein strips with GTPγS and ATPγS reduced MLCP activity in parallel with thiophosphorylation of MYPT1 (7Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J.

The inhibitory site (Thr695 in chicken MYPT1) is also phosphorylated by a MLCP-associated kinase similar to ZIP kinase, called ZIP-like kinase (8Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol.

Active RhoA, a small G protein, associates on the coiled-coil region of ROCK to enhance kinase activity (reviewed in Ref. 15Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Y27632, a pyridine derivative used as a specific ROCK inhibitor, inhibits both phenylepherine- and GTPγS-induced Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle (16Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggesting that ROCK-mediated inactivation of MLCP increases Ca2+ sensitivity in response to agonists. Involvement of ROCK in inhibition of MLCP explains RhoA-dependent regulation of Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle contraction. Dominant active RhoA elicits vasoconstriction of saponin- or β-escin-permeabilized rabbit mesenteric artery (18Hirata K. Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Kubota S. Kaibuchi K. Matsuura Y. Seki H. Saida K.

Stimulation of smooth muscle with phenylepherine potentiates and translocates endogenous RhoA from cytosol to membrane, though localization of active ROCK is obscure (20Gong M.C. Fujihara H.

These results support the view that Rho-dependent mechanisms are the predominant pathway for Ca2+ sensitization. In contrast to ROCK, PKC does not phosphorylate MYPT1 directly. However activation of PKC by addition of phorbol ester induces inhibition of MLCP and contraction of vascular smooth muscles (22Itoh H. Shimomura A. Okubo S. Ichikawa K. Ito M. Konishi T. Nakano T.

The p53 protein functions as a transcription factor that binds DNA and induces the expression of a number of genes involved in cell growth arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. p53 is maintained at low steady-state levels in the cell and is induced and activated post-translationally by various signaling pathways that respond to cellular stress (1Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 2Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Cellular insults that initiate the stress response and activate p53 include DNA-damaging agents (chemical, UV, and ionizing radiation), oxygen stress, or the inappropriate activation of oncogenes. Activated p53 induces either growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the extent and duration of signals generated from the damage (3Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J. Cell. Mol.

The post-translational modifications involved in p53 activation and increased steady-state levels of the protein include phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination. The stability and half-life of p53 are tightly regulated by mdm2 and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (5Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 6Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 7Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that mdm2 is an E31 ubiquitin ligase for p53 (8Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 9Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A number of critical regulatory proteins in the cell are modified by ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation. Proteasomal degradation of key regulatory proteins control biological events involving the cell cycle, differentiation, immune responses, DNA repair, chromatin structure, and apoptosis (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). The initial step in the Ub cascade is the activation of Ub by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). E1 hydrolyzes ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate to generate a thioester bond between the active site Cys of E1 and the carboxyl-terminal Gly of Ub. The activated Ub is transferred to one of several different ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc or E2) in an ATP-independent manner. The Ubc enzymes are catalytically similar to E1 in that a thioester bond is formed with Ub. The ubiquitin-conjugated E2 then functions in combination with an E3 ligase to transfer Ub to the target protein. The final Ub transfer results in an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl-terminal Gly of Ub and the ε amino group of a Lys residue on the target protein. The E3 ubiquitin ligase binds specifically to the target protein and participates in the transfer of Ub. Multiple Ub moieties are transferred through this cascade to generate a poly-ubiquitin chain. The ability of different E2 enzymes to function with a given E3 has led to a model that different E2·E3 complexes provide a level of substrate specificity. This model is attractive as combinatorial specificity can be achieved with a limited number of E2 and E3 enzymes (11Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become evident that ubiquitin E3 ligases can be divided into two major classes, the Hect domain E3 enzymes and the RING finger domain E3 enzymes. E6AP is the prototype for the Hect domain class, and members of this family are homologous toE6AP carboxyl terminus (12Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). This E3 class utilizes an active site Cys to form a thiolester bond with Ub, analogous to E1 and E2. In contrast to the Hect domain family, members of the RING finger class of ligases are thought to interact with the Ub·E2 conjugate and “activate” the complex for the transfer of Ub to the acceptor protein (13Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 14Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Current models suggest an E3-ubiquitin intermediate is not formed with the RING finger domain class of E3s. mdm2 is a member of the RING finger domain class of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The carboxyl terminus of mdm2 contains a variant of the RING finger domain (15Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). RING finger domain E3 ligases can be further classified into two general groups. The first group is the modular ligases where the RING finger domain and the substrate specificity domain reside in two different proteins within the E3 ligase complex,e.g. Rbx1 and the F-box protein in the SCF complex, respectively. In the second group, the ligases have the substrate recognition and the RING finger domain within the same polypeptide chain, such as mdm2 and cbl (16Tyers M. Willems A.R. Science. 1999; 284 (., 603–4): 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In this report we characterize the mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. Surprisingly, the p53-Ub(n) product has Ub at multiple sites on p53 and does not appear to form a poly-ubiquitin chain. Using pre-conjugated Ub·Ubc4, the kinetics of the mdm2-mediated enzymatic transfer of Ub to p53 has been characterized, and the results support a mechanism requiring enzyme isomerization. E1 and Ubc4 (UbcH5B (18Rolfe M. Beer-Romero P. Glass S. Eckstein J. Berdo I. Theodoras A. Pagano M. Draetta G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ubiquitin (Sigma-Aldrich) was chemically modified with Oregon Green (og) succinimidyl ester as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes) and purified as described previously (19Wee K.E. Lai Z. Auger K.R. Ma J. Horiuchi K.Y. Dowling R.L. Dougherty C.S. Corman J.I. Wynn R. Copeland R.A. J. Protein Chemistry. 2000; 19: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Lys48 to Arg (K48R) and Lys63 to Arg (K63R) mutants and double mutant K48R/K63R of Ub were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The wild-type Ub clone was a generous gift from the laboratory of Dr. Tracey Handel from the University of California at Berkeley. DNA sequencing as well as analysis of the purified protein by mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of the desired mutations. A glutathione S-transferase fusion of the human mdm2 protein was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Cell pellets were lysed by sonication and centrifuged prior to a 2-h incubation with GSH-Sepharose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resin was collected on a coarse sintered glass filter, washed, and loaded into a column for elution with reduced glutathione (pH 7.0–7.2). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC using a C4 column. Peak fractions were pooled, the DTT content was adjusted to 50 mm, and bovine serum albumin was added to 100 µg/ml. The purified protein was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. A cell pellet from baculovirus-infected insect cells (Sf9), expressing human p53, was lysed by sonication in buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged. The soluble fraction was diluted to 0.1m NaCl and centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. The mixture was passed over a coarse sintered glass filter, and the resin was washed and loaded into a column for step elution with NaCl. The p53 protein peak eluted at ∼0.2 m. The eluted material was diluted to 0.1 m NaCl, loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column, and eluted with a 0.1 to 1.0 m linear NaCl gradient. The eluted material was adjusted to 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm NaCl by the addition of the appropriate stock solutions. Analysis by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and reverse phase HPLC revealed that the final protein was greater than 95% pure. The conjugation of og-Ub and Ubc4 was performed at 37 °C in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm DTT). The mixture contained E1 (0.5 µm), adenylate kinase (32 units/ml), og-Ub (100 µm), Ubc4 (50 µm). Pre-mixed ATP/MgCl2 (2 mm) was added to start the reaction and then incubated for 10 min. The reaction was transferred to ice and EDTA (final concentration 10 mm) and NaCl (final concentration 400 mm) were added to stop the reaction. The volume was reduced using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a 3000-molecular weight cutoff filter. The concentrated reaction was loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mm DTT and eluted isocratically. og-Ub·Ubc4 was collected in the fractions representing the second peak of absorbance at 280 nm. Pooled fractions were concentrated as above, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The active conjugate was defined as the fraction of og-Ub·Ubc4 sensitive to reduction by 100 mm DTT. The samples were analyzed by HPLC on a C4 column, and typically 80–90% was DTT-sensitive, suggesting an active thiolester linkage. The conjugate appeared stable over time as determined by activity and HPLC analysis. Reactions were carried out in 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmNaCl, and 10 mm octylglucoside in a 20-µl reaction volume. The reactions were performed at room temperature with varying incubation times, stopped with 4× SDS-reducing sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Reactions performed with the free components contained E1 (100 nm), og-Ub (5 µm), Ubc4 (1 µm), p53 (1 µm), mdm2 (3 nm), MgCl2 (5 mm), and ATP (1 mm). Reactions run in the absence of E1 included p53 (1 µm), og-Ub·Ubc4 (5 µm), and mdm2 (3 nm). Reactions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE gels from Novex (Carlsbad, CA), and the fluorescence intensity of the p53-Ub(n) bands was quantified on a FluorImager 595 (Molecular Dynamics) using an excitation at 488 nm and an emission filter of 530 nm, or on a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescence intensity was converted to molar units of og-Ub by reference to an og-Ub calibration curve and assuming that the quantum yield for og-Ub fluorescence was not significantly affected by formation of the og-Ub·p53 complex. Little or no change in the quantum yield for Oregon Green was detected after conjugating to Ub (19Wee K.E. Lai Z. Auger K.R. Ma J. Horiuchi K.Y. Dowling R.L. Dougherty C.S. Corman J.I. Wynn R.

The majority of steady-state experiments were run at a single time point of 20 min, using p53 (1 µm), og-Ub·Ubc4 (5 µm), and mdm2 (3 nm). The velocity of product formation was fit to one of the following equations by global fitting of the entire data set using the software program Grafit (Erithacus Software Ltd.). The equations below describe the following situations: Eq. 1, simple steady-state kinetics for one varied substrate at a fixed concentration of all others; Eq. 2, a Ping Pong Bi Bi steady-state mechanism; Eq. 3, a Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi ternary complex steady-state mechanism; Eq. 4, competitive inhibition; Eq. 5, noncompetitive inhibition (mixed type); Eq. 6, substrate inhibition. v=Vmax[S][S]+KmEquation 1 v=Vmax[AX][B]KB[AX]+KAX[B]+[AX][B]Equation 2 v=Vmax[AX][B]αKAXKB+αKB[AX]+αKAX[B]+[AX][B]Equation 3 v=Vmax[S][S]+Km1+[I]KiEquation 4 v=Vmax[S][S]1+[I]βKi+Km1+[I]KiEquation 5 v=Vmax[S][S]1+[S]Ki+KmEquation 6 In these equations V max is the maximal velocity obtained at infinite concentrations of all substrates; [AX] and [B] are the concentrations of the group transfer donor and acceptor substrates (in our systems [AX] = [og-Ub·Ubc4] and [B] = [p53]), respectively; [S] is the concentration of the varied substrate when the other substrate is held constant;K m is the Michaelis constant for the varied substrate; K AX and K B are either Michaelis constants (in Eq. 2, Ping Pong mechanism) or equilibrium dissociation constants (in Eq. 3, Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism) for substrates AX and B, respectively; α is the substrate cooperativity factor (e.g. the Michaelis constant is equal to α times the equilibrium dissociation constants when all other substrates are saturating);K i is the dissociation constant for the inhibitor·enzyme binary complex and βK i is the dissociation constant for the inhibitor·enzyme·substrate ternary complex. The methylated ubiquitin and ubiquitin aldehyde were obtained from Boston Biochemical. The lactacystin was from Calbiochem. The p53 (clone DO-1) and IκB (SC-371) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, and the 4B2 anti-mdm2 antibody was a generous gift from the laboratory of Dr. Arnold Levine. The transfer of ubiquitin in the mdm2/p53 ubiquitin ligase assay was monitored by Oregon Green fluorescence and detected by reducing SDS-PAGE. Previous results have shown that the Oregon Green label is incorporated on Lys6 of Ub (19Wee K.E. Lai Z. Auger K.R. Ma J. Horiuchi K.Y. Dowling R.L. Dougherty C.S. Corman J.I. Wynn R. Copeland R.A. J. Protein Chemistry. 2000; 19: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Reactions were monitored as a function of time with all the components of the ubiquitin cascade: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), Ub, ATP, Ubc4 (E2), mdm2, and p53. As shown in Fig. 1 A, Ub was detected on p53 after 2.5 min and was incorporated for up to 60 min of reaction time. The p53-Ub(n) reaction products exhibited increased fluorescence intensity and “laddering” to slower mobility species in the gel. Western blots using an anti-p53 antibody (DO-1) demonstrated that the bands were indeed “laddered” p53 species (Fig. 3 A). The reaction products from three independent experiments were quantified, and the results (Fig. 1 C,solid circles) demonstrate the time-dependent incorporation of Ub onto p53 reaching a plateau after 60 min. The incorporation of Ub on p53 required the activation of Ub by the E1 enzyme prior to the mdm2-mediated transfer to p53 (data not shown). Product formation was also dependent on the addition of p53 to the reaction (Fig. 1 A). Next we determined if the E1 activation and transfer of Ub to Ubc4 could be dissociated from Ub·Ubc4 and mdm2-mediated transfer to p53. To this end, og-Ub was conjugated to Ubc4 in the presence of E1, and the resulting product (og-Ub·Ubc4) was purified. The pre-conjugated E2 (og-Ub·Ubc4) was then used in the mdm2/p53 ubiquitination assay, and the results are shown in Fig.1 B. As with the free components, og-Ub was incorporated into p53 in a time-dependent manner. No incorporation was seen at time = 0 nor if p53 was left out of the reaction. Quantitation of the p53-Ub(n) from three independent experiments is shown with the open circles in Fig. 1 C. These results demonstrate that pre-conjugated Ub·Ubc4 results in reaction kinetics and p53-Ub(n) products similar to what is produced with the free components. Both reactions were shown to be dependent on mdm2 (data not shown). The ability to use pre-conjugated E2 (og-Ub·Ubc4) eliminated the E1-coupled reaction and simplified kinetic characterization of mdm2-mediated Ub transfer to p53.Figure 3Ubiquitination of p53 results in multiple mono-ubiquitination.

Reactions were performed either in the absence (−) or presence of wild-type Ub (ub) or methylated Ub (me) and analyzed by anti-IκB Western blots as described previously (47Strack P. Caligiuri M.

Solid lines on the right of each Western illustrate the location of ubiquitinated species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Initial studies of mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination suggested that mdm2 utilized a thiolester intermediate similar to the Hect domain E3 ligases (20Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). The ability to use the pre-conjugated Ub·Ubc4 eliminated the E1 thiolester intermediate (21Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the mdm2 ubiquitination of p53. A titration of the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent NEM was compared in the p53 ubiquitination reactions using the free components and the pre-conjugated Ub·Ubc4. As shown in Fig.2, the pre-conjugated condition rendered the reaction resistant to NEM relative to the free components. The concentration of NEM required to achieve 50% inhibition was ∼100-fold higher for the pre-conjugated system than for the free component assay. The NEM sensitivity in the free component assay may be attributed to E1, because the inhibition curve for formation of Ub·E1 can be superimposed with the inhibition of p53-Ub formation in the free component assay (Fig. 2 B). The inhibition of the pre-conjugated reaction observed at higher NEM concentrations may reflect modification of the Cys residues in the RING finger domain that are required for ligase activity. Ligase activity is dependent on an intact RING finger domain as conversion of Cys461 to Ala eliminates ligase activity both in vitro and in vivo for both p53 and mdm2 (8Fang S. Jensen J.P.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of proteins in the cell often results in poly-ubiquitin chain formation. A peptide bond is formed between the ε-amino group of Lys in the target protein and the carboxyl terminus of Ub. Chain extension results from additional isopeptide bond formation with the carboxyl-terminal Gly of an additional Ub and usually Lys48 of the previously conjugated Ub molecule. Current data suggest that efficient recognition by the proteasome requires at least four Ub molecules in the chain linked in this Lys48 configuration (22Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Other Lys residues of Ub have been reported to support polymeric Ub-chain formation, including Lys63 (24Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 25Dubiel W. Gordon C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R554-R557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To investigate the Lys residue(s) involved in mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53, we used a Lys48 to Arg (K48R), Lys63 to Arg (K63R), or a double mutant (K48R/K63R) of Ub to eliminate the ability to form poly-ubiquitin chains with those residues. Use of these Ub mutants resulted in p53-Ub(n) that appeared identical to the use of wild-type Ub (data not shown). This result suggested that neither Lys48 nor Lys63 were involved in the putative chain formation. Because there was no diminution of product formed using the mutated ubiquitins, Ub that had been subjected to reductive methylation to block all the Lys residues was used in the in vitro ligase reaction. Again, the reaction produced a p53 laddering pattern as seen with wild-type Ub (Fig.3 A). These results suggest that Ub was conjugated to p53 monomerically at multiple sites and not as a poly-ubiquitin chain. To ensure the fidelity of the methylated Ub, wild-type and methylated Ub were used in the poly-ubiquitination reaction of IκB by the SCFβ-TRCP complex from THP.1 cell lysates. The formation of high molecular weight poly-ubiquitinated IκB was detected when wild-type Ub was used but was inhibited in the presence of methylated Ub or without the addition of exogenous Ub (Fig. 3 B). The partial shift in bands immunoreactive with anti-IκB probably represents the use of endogenous Ub from the cell extract. Previous data has shown IκB to be poly-ubiquitinated (26Scherer D.C.

Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1382-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The methyl Ub was also tested in the “auto-ubiquitination” reaction of mdm2 (8Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 9Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and as seen in Fig.3 C, use of wild-type Ub led to formation of high molecular weight species whereas methylated Ub inhibited the formation of the ubiquitin-mdm2 species. No reaction products were detected when mdm2 was left out and the addition of p53 did not significantly change the ubiquitination of mdm2 (data not shown). The reaction was also dependent on E1 (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that ubiquitination of p53 by mdm2 results in the addition of multiple mono-ubiquitin moieties. In contrast, mdm2 auto-ubiquitination results in poly-ubiquitin chain formation. To access how the in vitro ligase reaction that results in multiple mono-ubiquitination of p53 reflects the reaction in vivo, we directly compared each product. Ubiquitinated p53 from the ligase reaction was analyzed with lysates from lactacystin treated human colon carcinoma cells (HCT116). HCT116 cells have wild-type p53 (28Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar) and lactacystin treatment inhibits proteasome-mediated degradation, allowing for the accumulation of p53-Ub(n). As shown in Fig. 3 D, the pattern of p53-Ub(n) from the in vitro ligase reaction recapitulates the pattern seen from lactacystin-treated cells. Preconjugated og-Ub·Ubc4 and p53 were used as substrates to characterize mdm2-mediated Ub transfer to p53. This reaction reduces the ubiquitination of p53 to a simple two substrate (Bi Bi) reaction. mdm2 (1–5 nm) was incubated with 5 µmog-Ub·Ubc4 and 1 µm p53 and formation of the product p53-(og-Ub)(n) was linear with time over 20 min (Fig.4 and inset of Fig.1 C). The initial velocity of product formation was also linearly dependent on mdm2 concentration (Fig. 4, inset). The experimental data presented below were obtained at a fixed mdm2 concentration of 3 nm. To define the mechanism of catalysis, we varied both og-Ub·Ubc4 and p53 concentration simultaneously. Fig.5 A illustrates the untransformed data from experiments in which the velocity of p53-Ub(n) formation was determined by varying p53 concentration with several fixed concentrations of og-Ub·Ubc4. A series of parallel lines were obtained when these data were presented in a double-reciprocal format. The reverse experiment was performed in which the velocity was measured as a function of og-Ub·Ubc4 concentration at several fixed concentrations of p53. The data from this set of experiments also yielded a series of parallel lines when plotted as a double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 5 B). Parallel lines are usually reflective of a Bi Bi reaction conforming to a double-displacement, or Ping Pong mechanism. The data in Fig. 5,A and B, were fit to Eq. 2 for such a Ping Pong mechanism. The kinetic constants obtained from either data set were essentially the same and were therefore averaged and are presented in Table I.Table IAverage values (n = 3) of the kinetic constants for mdm2-mediated ubiquitin transfer to p53Kinetic constantValuesPing Pong mechanismRERBB1-aRERBB, Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi. mechanismog-Ub · Ubc4,K m3.0 ± 1.0 µm3.2 ± 1.7 µmp53,K m1.1 ± 0.4 µm1.0 ± 0.6 µmk cat5.0 ± 2.0 min−14.8 ± 2.2 min−1αNA1-bNA, not applicable to this mechanism.320 ± 200All values were obtained through global fitting using Grafit.

We and others have shown that human PLCε is translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and activated by direct association with Ras at its Ras/Rap1-associating domain. In addition, translocation to the perinuclear region was induced upon association with Rap1·GTP. However, the function of the CDC25 homology domain remains to be clarified. Here we show that the CDC25 homology domain of PLCε functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 but not for any other Ras family GTPases examined including Rap2 and Ha-Ras. Consistent with this, coexpression of full-length PLCε or its N-terminal fragment carrying the CDC25 homology domain causes an increase of the intracellular level of Rap1·GTP. Concurrently, stimulation of the downstream kinases B-Raf and extracellular signal-regulated kinase is observed, whereas the intracellular level of Ras·GTP and Raf-1 kinase activity are unaffected. In wild-type Rap1-overexpressing cells, epidermal growth factor induces translocation of PLCε to the perinuclear compartments such as the Golgi apparatus, which is sustained for at least 20 min. In contrast, PLCε lacking the CDC25 domain translocates to the perinuclear compartments only transiently. Further, the formation of Rap1·GTP upon epidermal growth factor stimulation exhibits a prolonged time course in cells expressing full-length PLCε compared with those expressing PLCε lacking the CDC25 homology domain. These results suggest a pivotal role of the CDC25 homology domain in amplifying Rap1-dependent signal transduction, including the activation of PLCε itself, at specific subcellular locations such as the Golgi apparatus.

In mammalian cells, ∼20 proteins, such as Ras, Rap, R-Ras, Ral, Rit, Rin, and Rheb, belong to the Ras family. The best characterized members of the family are Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, and N-Ras, which have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation downstream of diverse cell surface receptors. Localization at the plasma membrane following post-translational modifications is crucial for the function of Ras proteins. On the other hand, Rap1, which was originally isolated as a Ras-related GTPase, can suppress Ki-Ras-induced transformation and thus is also termed Krev-1 (4Noda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 97-109PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of Ras-mediated pathways by Rap1 is attributable to tight binding of Rap1 to the second Ras/Rap1-binding sites of Ras effectors, such as Raf-1 and yeast adenylyl cyclase, without stimulating their activities (5Hu C.-D.

However, it is likely that Rap1 exerts functions other than the inhibition of Ras pathways because Rap1 localizes mainly in the perinuclear compartments including the Golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic vesicles, where Ras proteins do not exist (8Beranger F.

Ras family GTPases cycle between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states, serving as a molecular switch of signal transduction (1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In response to extracellular stimuli, transition from the GDP-bound state to the GTP-bound state is facilitated by GEFs1 specific to an individual member of the Ras family, leading to the accumulation of the GTP-bound active form. Once activated, Ras family GTPases become associated with specific effectors, thereby stimulating downstream signaling pathways. Thereafter, protein-bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP and inorganic phosphate, causing dissociation from the effector. Thus, for the understanding of the biological function of the Ras family, it is important to identify effectors for each GTPase and to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying their activation upon binding to GTPases. To date, various proteins, such as Raf kinases (A-Raf, B-Raf, and Raf-1), Ral GEFs (RalGDS, Rlf, and Rgl), and PI3-K, have been characterized as Ras effectors on the basis of their ability to bind to Ras in a GTP-dependent manner (2Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In the case of Raf-1, the RBD (amino acids 51–131) directly interacts with the effector region of Ras (amino acids 32–40). On the other hand, the domain of RalGDS responsible for the binding to Ras·GTP is designated the RA domain (16Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Interestingly, x-ray crystallography revealed that the overall tertiary structure of the RA domain of RalGDS is similar to that of the Raf-1 RBD, although no extensive sequence similarity between these two domains was found (17Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 18Huang L. Weng X. Hofer F. Martin G.S. Kim S.H. Nat. Struct.

Moreover, the crystal structure of PI3-Kγ was determined, demonstrating that the RBD of PI3-Kγ has the same fold as the Raf-1 RBD and the RA domain of RalGDS (20Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 21Pacold M.E. Suire S. Perisic O. Lara-Gonzalez S. Davis C.T. Walker E.H. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Eccleston J.F. Williams R.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, the GTP-dependent interaction between Ras and its effectors is mediated by structurally conserved modules. Mechanisms underlying the activation of effectors subsequent to Ras binding are complicated, but a primary role for Ras binding is considered to be the recruitment of effectors to the plasma membrane. For instance, Ras induces subcellular translocation of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane, where Raf-1 undergoes a variety of modifications such as serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation to become fully activated (22Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). For full activation of Raf-1 kinase activity, however, binding of the RBD to the Ras effector region is insufficient, and an additional interaction between the cysteine-rich region of Raf-1 (amino acids 139–184) and the activator region of Ras (amino acids 26–31 and 41–53) is required (6Okada T.

Recently, we and other groups identified a novel type of phosphoinositide-specific PLC, named PLCε, which possesses an RA domain that is responsible for high affinity binding to GTP-bound forms of Ras and Rap1 (24Shibatohge M.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Upon binding to Ras and Rap1, PLCε translocates to spatially distinct sites, the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region, respectively, where PIPs exist as substrates (25Song C. Hu C.-D. Masago M. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2752-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Ras-dependent subcellular translocation and activation of PLCε were also reconstituted in vitro by the use of a liposome carrying recombinant Ras and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (25Song C. Hu C.-D. Masago M. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2752-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The activation of PLCε in vivofollowing cotransfection with constitutively activated Ras was reported as well (27Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Taken together, PLCε is involved in Ras-mediated and Rap1-mediated signaling pathways, triggering the hydrolysis of PIPs at different subcellular regions depending on cellular contexts. However, it is unclear whether Ras binding exerts an allosteric effect on enzymatic activity as proposed for PI3-K activation. Also, modifications of PLCε, such as serine/threonine phosphorylation, after membrane translocation have not been reported. Thus, precise mechanisms whereby the enzymatic activity of PLCε is regulated at specific subcellular sites remain to be clarified. In addition to the RA domain, a CDC25 homology domain was found in the N-terminal portion of PLCε. The CDC25 homology domain was originally identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC25 protein, which acts as a GEF for yeast Ras proteins. Afterward, an array of mammalian Ras GEFs, such as Sos1, Sos2, Ras-GRF-1, Ras-GRF-2, and RasGRP, were isolated, revealing that the CDC25 homology domain was conserved among all of these proteins and responsible for their GEF activity. In addition, GEFs for Rap1, such as C3G (28Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell.

Hence, the CDC25 homology domain of PLCε is predicted to show GEF activity toward Ras family GTPases. The Ras exchanger motif, which is conserved among an array of Ras GEFs but is not directly implicated in catalysis (36Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), was not found in PLCε. Here, we show that the CDC25 homology domain of PLCε exhibits GEF activity toward Rap1 but not toward any other Ras family GTPases examined, including Rap2 and Ha-Ras. We further demonstrate that deletion of the CDC25 homology domain diminishes EGF-dependent sustained translocation of PLCε to the perinuclear region in wild-type Rap1-expressing cells. In addition, sustained increase in the Rap1·GTP level was observed in PLCε-expressing cells but not in cells expressing a PLCε mutant lacking the CDC25 homology domain. Based on these observations, a novel self-amplifying mechanism of the Rap1/PLCε pathway leading to prolonged activation is proposed. cDNAs for full-length human PLCε and its deletion mutants, PLCεCDC25 (amino acids 1–1200) and PLCεΔN (amino acids 1088–2302), were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma), generating pFLAG-CMV2-PLCε, pFLAG-CMV2-PLCεCDC25, and pFLAG-CMV2-PLCεΔN, respectively. cDNAs for full-length human PLCε, PLCεCDC25, and PLCεΔN were also subcloned into the baculovirus vector pVL1393-FLAG (Pharmingen), generating pVL1393-FLAG-PLCε, pVL1393-FLAG-PLCεCDC25, and pVL1393-FLAG-PLCεΔN, respectively. pcDNA-EGFP-PLCεΔN was constructed by replacing the full-length PLCε coding sequence of pcDNA-EGFP-PLCε (25Song C.

Rap2A, R-Ras, M-Ras, RalA, Rit, Rin, and Rheb were expressed as His6-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli and purified using TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH).

After incubation for specified periods, ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) was added, and the sample was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane, which was subjected to extensive washing with wash buffer. The radioactivity remaining on the filter was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. For GDP release assays, 2 pmol of Rap1A preloaded with [3H]GDP (3,000 cpm/pmol) were incubated with 1 pmol of FLAG-PLCε or its mutant in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm GTP at 30 °C (for Rap1A, Rap2A, Ha-Ras, M-Ras, RalA, Rit, Rin, and Rheb) or 20 °C (for R-Ras). COS-7 cells were transfected with a combination of expression plasmids as described in figure legends. After incubation for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, cells were starved for another 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum. In some experiments, the cells were stimulated with EGF as described in the figure legends.

Supernatants of centrifugation (15,000 ×g) for 10 min at 4 °C were used as cell extracts. GST-RalGDS-RID (20 µg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated with cell extracts for 1 h at 4 °C and washed with lysis buffer A four times. Precipitated Rap1 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-Rap1 antibody (sc-65; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). COS-7 cells were transfected with a combination of expression plasmids as described in figure legends. After incubation for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were starved for another 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum. Thereafter, the cells were harvested and dissolved in lysis buffer B (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.8 µm aprotinin, 15 µm E-64, 20 µm leupeptin, 50 µm bestatin, and 10 µm pepstatin A). Supernatants of centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C were used as cell extracts. FLAG-B-Raf or FLAG-Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to kinase assays essentially as described (6Okada T. Hu C.-D. Jin T.-G. Kariya K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell.

After incubation, proteins in the reaction mixture were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized and quantitated by a bioimaging analyzer (BAS2000; Fujix). Immunoprecipitated B-Raf and Raf-1 were quantitated by immunoblotting with anti-B-Raf (sc-166; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Raf-1 (sc-133; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, respectively. COS-7 cells were transfected with a combination of expression plasmids as described in the figure legends. After incubation for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were starved for another 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum.

Supernatants of centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C were used as cell extracts. Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using anti-phosphorylated ERK (number 9106; New England Biolabs Inc.) and anti-ERK (number 9102; New England Biolabs Inc.) antibodies. COS-7 cells cultured in a slide chamber were transfected with a combination of expression plasmids as described in the figure legends. After incubation for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, the cells were starved for another 18 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum. In some experiments, cells were stimulated with EGF as described in the figure legends. Following fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, the cells were stained with anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (T2762; Molecular Probes) antibodies. Subcellular localization of EGFP-PLCε, EGFP-PLCεΔN, HA-Rap1AWT, and HA-Rap1AV12was analyzed under a confocal laser microscope (MRC-1024; Bio-Rad). For staining the Golgi apparatus, serum-starved cells were incubated with 5 µm BODIPY TR ceramide (D-7540; Molecular Probes) (39Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E.

Following fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde, subcellular localization of the Golgi apparatus and EGFP-PLCε was analyzed. Structural features of deletion mutants employed in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1. PLCεCDC25 contains the CDC25 homology domain (amino acids 532–775) yet lacks the C-terminal portion. In contrast, PLCεΔN lacks the N-terminal portion containing the CDC25 homology domain. These two constructs as well as full-length PLCε were expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins in Sf9 cells and then purified to near homogeneity by using anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography. Thereafter, these recombinant proteins were subjected to in vitro GEF assays using Rap1 as substrate (Fig. 2). PLCε exhibited significant GEF activity toward Rap1 as determined by GDP binding and GDP release assays (Fig. 2, A and B). Further, PLCεCDC25 showed Rap1 GEF activity similar to that of PLCε, whereas PLCεΔN exerted no significant effect (Fig.2 C), implying that the CDC25 homology domain is responsible for GEF activity. A FLAG-tagged construct consisting of the CDC25 homology domain and additional 100-amino acid flanking sequences (amino acids 432–875) did not show GEF activity under similar conditions, which may be ascribed to improper protein folding (data not shown). To further examine the substrate specificity of GEF activity, various Ras family small GTPases were purified and subjected to in vitroGEF assays (Fig. 3). PLCε did not stimulate GDP release from Ras family GTPases examined other than Rap1. Notably, Rap2 was virtually insensitive to the action of PLCε, although Rap2 exhibits high sequence similarity to Rap1.Figure 2In vitro GEF activity toward Rap1A.

Reverse engineering of the biochemical pathways from proteomics and DNA micro array data using the suggested neural network model is discussed. multiplicity of infection Recently developed analytical techniques such as gene chips and proteomics generate data reflecting the status of an entire cell or organism at a given time and therefore provide a snapshot of all the pathways that compose the genetic network of a cell or organism. A set of these snapshots taken at short time intervals forms time series of mRNA or protein amounts. Such time series reflect regulatory interactions among the members of the system. The availability of such kind of data makes it possible to utilize existing, or to design new mathematical models of the regulatory processes, which make it possible to analyze the dynamics of the processes and identify interactions among genes and their products. Knowledge of the principles of the system control can lead to the design of simulation models that can predict situations that can not be achieved experimentally and thus provide a feedback to experimental biologists. A number of different mathematical models of cell regulatory processes have appeared in recent years. One of the approaches formalizes gene regulation into a network with nodes representing genes and connections among genes, which define the regulatory action of one gene product on another gene. Mathematically such processes can be expressed by a neural network. A number of models were suggested based on two-stage Boolean or linear (feed forward) representation (1Kauffman S.A. Curr. Top.

Recurrent neural networks used for the description of dynamics of genetic networks, in particular of eukaryotic systems (9Marnellos G. Mjolsness E. Pac. Symp.

Comparative analysis of performance of the neural network-based models can be found in Ref. 12Wessels, L. F., van Someren, E. P., and Reinders, M. J. (2001) Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 508–519Google Scholar. Recurrent neural networks can also deal with feedback, which can occur in natural gene control processes, and they are flexible enough to fit experimental data. If the components of the system and their regulatory interactions are known, recurrent neural networks can be used to model and simulate the dynamics of gene expression in such systems. Several other models of genetic networks utilizing the apparent analogy between gene control and electronic circuits have been designed (13McAdams H.H. Shapiro L. Science. 1995; 269: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 14McAdams H.H. Arkin A. Trends Genet. 1997; 94: 814-819Google Scholar, 15McAdams H.H. Arkin A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

The λ decision circuit, which operates within a singleEscherichia coli cell and controls one phase of single phage life cycle, is probably the most completely characterized complex genetic network. Because the qualitative behavior of the λ phage switch is known, it can serve as a test for the validity of a mathematical model. The goal is to describe by a model the dynamics of such a system under known physiological conditions. The model must first satisfy observed behavior, and if so it can be used to simulate the system. Here a model of the genetic network used by bacteriophage λ to choose between lytic and lysogenic pathways, based on the recurrent neural network principle, is presented. The model is based on the assumption that the regulatory effect on the expression of a particular gene can be expressed as a neural network (Fig. 1). Each node of the network represents a particular gene, and the wiring between the nodes defines regulatory interactions (11Vohradsky J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It can be assumed that the state of gene expression at time t + dtdepends on the state of expression at time t and the connection weights (Fig. 1). Generalization of this principle leads to the definition of the rate of expression as a change of accumulation of gene i product over time (dzi/dt). The rate of expression of genei can be derived from the expression levels (yj) at the time t and connection weights (wij) of all genes connected to the given gene. Thus gi, a regulatory effect on gene i, is gi=∑jwijyj+bi.Equation 1 This regulatory effect is transformed by a sigmoidal transfer function f to the interval with a bias vectorb, which can be interpreted as a reaction delay parameter. In our case its value represent timing of the events in the network. The actual rate of expression is then modulated by a multiplicative constant k1i that represents the maximal expression rate of a given gene. Let the rate of expression of a target gene i(dzi/dt) be given by the regulatory effects of other genes ρi minus degradationxI, dzi/dt=ρi−xiEquation 2 where i runs over the members of the set shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The degradation effectxi is modeled by the kinetic equation of a first order chemical reaction xi = k2izi, and ρi represents the regulatory effect reflected in a variable gi(ρi = k1if(gi)). The constantk2 represents the rate constant of degradation of the gene product i, and k1 is its maximal rate of expression. The model for the control of theith gene has the form, dzidt=k1i·f∑jwijyj+bi−k2iziEquation 3 where f represents the sigmoid transfer function and the yj are concentrations of the components of the system (for j = i; zi = yi). Equation 3 describes the dynamics of accumulation of the gene i product and represents a “node” function. Each node can be connected with other nodes to form a neural network (Fig. 1). The wiring between the nodes of the network is defined by the weight matrix w. A nonzero value ofwij for the nodes i and jmeans that the connection between the nodes exists. The magnitude of the weight wij represents a strength of interaction, or a regulatory effect, between the two nodes. The neural network is fully described by the differential equations corresponding to the particular nodes. The number of equations is given by the number of nodes, and the amounts of gene products at arbitrary time tcan be computed by solving the set of differential equations. Equation 3 represents a special case of a class of recurrent neural networks described by a general formula, τidyidt=fi∑jwijyj−θi−yiEquation 4 which is a special case of analog Hopfield neural networks (seee.g. Ref. 19Bose N.K. Liang P. Neural Network Fundamentals with Graphs, Algorithms, and Applications. McGraw-Hill, New York1996Google Scholar), where fi is a nonlinear transfer function, w represents connection weights, andθ is an external input to the node i. These types of networks have been used as associative memories and as models of brain activity, and their dynamics have been studied thoroughly. Depending on the weight matrix, the state transition of the network can lead to a point attractor (stationary state), can become oscillatory (limit cycle), or can even become chaotic depending on the weights and the complexity of the network. Several methods of “training,”i.e. computation of the weight matrix and the other parameters from experimental time series, have been suggested (20Pineda F.J. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1987; 59: 2229-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar,21Bose N.K. Liang P. Neural Network Fundamentals with Graphs, Algorithms, and Applications. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 323Google Scholar). Bacteriophage λ is a virus consisting of protein particle and double-stranded DNA of ∼50 kilobases with cohesive single strands at the ends of the molecule. Soon after infection, the λ DNA circularizes, and lytic or lysogenic growth is chosen. In the lytic pathway, viral DNA is replicated many times and then packed into viral coats, causing lysis of the host cell and the release of up to 100 viruses that infect new bacteria. In some cases, the lytic cycle is aborted, and the phage switches to the lysogenic pathway, in which the phage genome is integrated into the bacterial host DNA and is replicated and transmitted as any other chromosomal DNA. A simplified schematic representation of the λ phage genes having a regulatory role in determining lysis or lysogeny in the chromosome of infected E. coli is shown in Fig. 2. Other genes involved in the process of lysis and lysogeny are not involved in the process of regulation and are therefore not considered. Transcribing RNA polymerase molecules stop just at the end ofN and cro, respectively. The N andcro mRNAs are translated into their respective proteins (22Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch, Phage Lambda and Higher Organisms. Cell Press & Blackwell science, Cambridge, MA1986: 54Google Scholar, 23Echols H. Guarneros G. Hendrix R. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 75-93Google Scholar, 24Herskowitz I. Hagen D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1980; 14: 399-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The N protein is a positive regulator that enables the transcription of genes to the left of N includingcIII and the recombination genes and genes to the right ofcro including cII and the DNA replication genesO, P, and Q (25Das A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6711-6716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N works as a positive regulator by enabling RNA polymerase to transcribe through the regions of DNA that would otherwise cause the mRNA to terminate. CIII protects CII from proteolytic degradation (26Hoyt M.A. Knight D.M. Das A. Miller H.I. Echols H. Cell. 1982; 31: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because CII works as an activator, it enables RNA polymerase to bind and begin transcription at two promoters that would otherwise remain silent: PRE and PI. cI can be transcribed from two promoters, PRM and PRE. Transcription from PRM is maintained by CI in a self-inducing feedback loop, and transcription from PRE depends on the concentration of CII. Starting at PRE, polymerase transcribes leftward to the end of the cI gene. When this mRNA is translated it produces CI but not Cro, which is encoded on the other strand. CI binds to OL and OR. CI bound to these two sites turns on transcription of its own gene and blocks transcription of lytic genes and early ones necessary for phage construction. In the meantime Cro binds to OR3 to block synthesis of CI. It then binds to the second operator, OL, to turn off transcription initiated at PL and to the remaining sites of OR, as described above. Both CI and Cro bind to OR to stop their own transcription at higher concentrations. This occurs far after the decision has been made and does not influence the process of decision and therefore is not considered in the model. This analysis defines both the timing of the process and regulatory interactions among the members of the system. Formalization of the process to a neural network is shown in Fig.1. The scenario of the process is not fully understood but it can be deduced that the decision, which of the two alternative pathways is to be chosen, depends on the activity of CII (26Hoyt M.A. Knight D.M. Das A. Miller H.I. Echols H. Cell. 1982; 31: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch, Phage Lambda and Higher Organisms. Cell Press & Blackwell Science, Cambridge, MA1986: 58-59Google Scholar). It has been found that if CII is highly active, the infecting phage lysogenizes; otherwise it grows lytically. In cells in which CII is rapidly degraded, no CI is synthesized. If Cro binds to OR3 before CI is bound to OR1 and OR2, the phage will not establish lysogeny. This never occurs if the CII protein is highly active. It has been shown that the rate of expression of cI depends on the activity of the PRE promotor, which is controlled by CII. The CIII protein also helps to establish lysogeny; its role is to protect CII from degradation (the half-life of CII is about 5 min in the presence of CIII but <1 min in the absence of CIII (26Hoyt M.A. Knight D.M. Das A. Miller H.I. Echols H. Cell. 1982; 31: 565-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)). If CIII is absent, CII is virtually always inactivated, and the phage can grow only lytically. In the cells where protease levels are high, no CI is synthesized, the Cro protein is synthesized, and lytic growth ensues. Therefore the rate of synthesis of CI depends on the activity of CII, which depends on the environmental conditions. CII is the crucial element of the decision network and its activity determines which of the two pathways will be chosen. The elements of the decision circuit have been identified above. The “influence” matrix, which is just the formalization of the analysis of the decision network made above, can then be derived (Fig.1b). The kinetic profiles of individual gene products were computed numerically from the set of differential equations defined in Equation 3 with the weight matrix from Fig. 1b. There, + and − signs were replaced by values satisfying constraints derived in the previous paragraph. Constants were calculated as shown in Fig. 3. It has been found that the variable influencing the decision to which side the “switch” will flip is the stability of CII. The simulation of the two principal situations (low and high stability of CII) is shown in Fig. 3. Results of simulations shown in Fig. 3, a and b, revealed that when the CII half-life is short, practically immediately after the network initiation Cro dominates the field and represses expression of all other members of the network. Fig. 3b shows the time course of the changes in number of molecules of N, CII, and CI transcribed from PRE and PRM. First of all, N is synthesized followed by CII, which initiates transcription ofcI from PRE, but CI never reaches the amount necessary to activate the self-inducing loop of expression ofcI from PRM. 1The curve of the cI product transcribed from PRM remains close to zero. Nevertheless, detailed inspection of the curve shows that very little CI from PRM is being synthesized. Fig. 3, c and d, shows the simulation of the situation when CII is well protected from cleavage. CI from PRE reaches a sufficiently high value to start up the self-inducing expression from PRM, which immediately starts to block the synthesis of N, CII, and Cro and consequently of its own transcription from PRE. The amount of cI product transcribed from PRM is high enough to maintain the self-inducing loop. CI reaches a concentration that maintains its dominance, represses all other members of the network, and establishes lysogeny. It has been observed that probability of lysogeny increases markedly with increasing MOI2 up to an MOI of ∼7 (28Kourilsky P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 122: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As the simulation reveals (Fig. 4), at low MOI both CII and CIII are synthesized at low levels, and the CII concentration is too low to activate PRE and initiate transcription of cI from PRM. Concentration of Cro is therefore high enough to establish lysis. With increasing MOI, the concentration of CII increases until it reaches an amount necessary to initiate the self-inducing production of CI. Any further increase of MOI does not substantially change the concentration of CII. The peak concentration of CII is maintained by the balance between its production and the concentration of the CI repressor, which, after establishing the lysogenic path, blocks the synthesis of CII. The infection of a population of cells with an average MOI produces a distribution of MOI across the population. Because the concentration of CII markedly depends on MOI, the result is a distribution of lytic/lysogeny outcomes, which has been observed. Ultraviolet light stimulates proteases that cleave CI, breaking the PRMfeedback loop, which maintains the transcription of cI (29Levine A. Bailone A. Devoret R. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the prophage stage, promoters PR and PL are no longer repressed by CI and cro, other lytic genes can be expressed, and phage replication and lysis are initiated. This situation is principally analogous to the simulation shown in Fig. 3a. The question remains: how sensitive is the switch? In other words, does there exist a transition region of CII half-life where the decision is uncertain? To investigate this question, a set of simulations was run, in which the value of the half-life of CII was gradually increased, and the terminal state of the network was checked until it switched from lysis to lysogeny. It was found that there exists a point at which an almost infinitesimal change of the half-life of CII caused inversion of the terminal state of the network. This is illustrated in Fig.5, in which the simulated time courses of the members of the λ decision network are plotted for different increments of the CII half-life. It can be seen that there exists a point of inversion at which a change in less than a few molecules of CII causes a change in the terminal state of the network (lytic or lysogenic). The parameters and weight matrix of the model were chosen to give values in the range of the experimentally observed one. To test whether the switch works the same way using other combinations of parameters, the behavior of ∼100 networks with randomly generated parameter values was simulated. The range of parameter values was constrained only by the known and observed limits, which were mentioned above. The “switch point” moved to different positions, and the amplitude of time courses of components of the network was different; but in all cases the principle of the bifunctional switch remained the same. The transition region was always almost infinitesimally narrow. Such behavior has never been reported before. This is of course not a mathematical proof that the system always relaxes to this terminal state, but it at least supports the notion that this is the natural behavior of the λ phage switch. A similar phenomenon is exhibited by the dependence of the lysis/lysogeny decision on MOI. At low MOI the concentration of CII is never high enough to establish lysogeny. With increasing MOI the concentration of CII increases as well, up to a point when it is high enough to initiate transcription of cI from PRM. This flips the switch and establishes lysogeny. A further increase of MOI does not substantially increase the concentration of CII, which is already sufficient to start up the lysogenic path. Values of the weight matrix in all simulations were set to follow constraints found during qualitative analysis of the behavior of the system to give outputs in a range roughly corresponding to the experimentally observed ones. Biochemically correct values can only be obtained from experimental time series, which are not presently available. In a single cell all biochemical reactions occur on a nanomolar scale, i.e. with countable amounts of molecules. The direction the reaction pathway takes depends on the amounts of reagents at a particular time in a particular place. The fluctuations of these amounts are stochastic, and the output of a regulatory process can be stochastic as well. This topic has been analyzed thoroughly in the work of McAdams and Arkin (14McAdams H.H. Arkin A. Trends Genet. 1997; 94: 814-819Google Scholar, 16McAdams H.H. Arkin A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 65-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In principle, such a stochastic nature of cell molecular processes can lead to instability. Any instability is potentially dangerous because of the resonance effect the instability can propagate in time and finally can cause breakup of the system. It implies that in the evolutionary process, the regulatory systems in the cell evolved such that they were capable of eliminating such stochastic behavior and thus inherited instability. Very often the stability of natural processes is maintained by redundancy. The λ phage decision network comprises redundancy as well. The self-regulatory circuit ofcII and cro, which by binding to the OR1–3 region controls its own expression, is an example. From a simplistic point of view it would be sufficient to control the amount of these compounds just by the balance between synthesis and degradation that under normal circumstances would maintain a stable terminal amount of both CI and Cro. The self-regulation is redundant and ensures that the stable terminal state will be reached in any case. It would be possible to design a circuit, much simpler than the λ one, that would be capable of flipping a switch. The reason for the complexity of the λ decision network could be that it evolved to ensure maximal stability of the output. To ensure that the system will reach a terminal state, the range of values of the variable that determines the fate of the system (in this case CII half-life) must be very broad such that the probability that the value will fall into the region of uncertainty is as low as possible. This result is in perfect agreement with the predictions made from the model described here. The width of the sensitive region corresponds to an amount smaller than a single molecule of CII. Thus in all cases the terminal state of the network is predictable and leads to the two observed states, lysis or lysogeny. From this point of view, the model not only corresponds perfectly to the observed behavior but also predicts a situation that cannot be reached experimentally and offers an explanation coherent with the observed principles. The Boolean-like behavior of the λ phage genetic network was not expected, and there was no direct or indirect evidence available that a genetic network of this type can display such behavior. Modeling and simulation of the λ genetic network revealed the dynamics of the transition from one stage to another and showed how sensitive it is on the molecular level. Such results can not be achieved experimentally. In this sense mathematical modeling is a very powerful tool for the analysis of the behavior of regulatory systems in the cell. In this paper the ability of a neural network model to simulate and predict the behavior of already quite complex system is presented. The model generates time series of amounts of components of the system. With progress in the development of techniques such as quantitative and functional proteomics (11Vohradsky J.

This means the determination of the values of the weight matrix and other parameters from experimentally measured time series 3It is possible to take advantage of the theory of recurrent neural networks, which suggests appropriate methods (e.g. Ref. 33Pearlmutter B.A. IEEE Trans. Neural Network. 1995; 6: 1212-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar or 19Bose N.K. Liang P. Neural Network Fundamentals with Graphs, Algorithms, and Applications.

The weight matrix can then be translated in terms of mutual control of the elements of the system. Values close to zero mean no control, and high positive or negative ones mean positive or negative control, respectively. The weight matrix directly determines the connections in the neural network. Together with other independent observations the neural network can be translated to a pathway. This reverse engineering can become a base for a very efficient method for reconstructing regulatory pathways from experimentally measured data. The modeling approach has an advantage of any mathematical model; it can predict situations that cannot be reached experimentally. If quantitative data obtained from a well designed experiment allow a model to be constructed, the functionality of which is tested by comparison with experiments, the model can serve to investigate an infinite number of different situations such as those caused by mutagenesis, changes in activity of the elements of the system, etc. The model allows the dynamics of the process and the terminal states of the system to be investigated. It can bypass experimental limitations and thus explore biological situations currently restricted by experimental accessibility. It also brings deeper understanding of the nature of the whole process. The simulation capabilities are unlimited and can provide a check on the intuitive understanding of a process. Neural networks are known as models of brain activity or tools capable of recognizing an input pattern. A neural network, out of a possible infinite number of states, tends to relax to a limited number of terminal configurations depending on the initial state of the variables forming the network. This resembles the principles of complex coordination of the functions within a cell. The cell is an extremely complex system and without tight control would reach an infinite number of states. In practice it reaches a very limited number of configurations that maintain the healthy state of the cell and its overall stability. Many control systems exist in a cell that eliminates any perturbations that would lead to cell instability and its subsequent breakdown. I am convinced, and in this paper I am trying to bring the evidence, that the neural networks are capable of simulating natural processes and can be used to model cell regulatory systems.

Dexamethasone represses interleukin-1β-stimulated histone acetylation and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor expression through a combination of direct inhibition of p65-associated histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and by recruiting histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to the p65-HAT complex. Here we show that mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor partial agonist, has no ability to induce gene expression but represses interleukin-1β-stimulated histone acetylation and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor release by 50% maximally. Mifepristone was able to inhibit p65-associated HAT activity to the same extent as dexamethasone but failed to inhibit the natural promoter to an equal extent due to an inability to recruit HDAC2 to the p65-associated HAT complex. These data suggest that the maximal repressive actions of glucocorticoids require recruitment of HDAC2 to a p65-HAT complex. These data also suggest that pharmacological manipulation of specific histone acetylation status is a potentially useful approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

DNA is packaged into chromatin, a highly organized and dynamic protein-DNA complex. The fundamental subunit of chromatin, the nucleosome, is composed of an octamer of four core histones; an H3/H4 tetramer, and two H2A/H2B dimers, surrounded by 146 bp1 of DNA (1Beato M. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Beato M. Eisfeld K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The nucleosome therefore acts as a barrier to the initiation of transcription by preventing the access of transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to their cognate recognition sequences on DNA (4Workman J.L. Buchman A.R. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The N-terminal tails of histones contain lysine residues that are the sites for post-transcriptional acetylation. This is a dynamic process that occurs on actively transcribed chromatin only (5Perry M. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7336-7347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, core histones may be modified by phosphorylation, methylation, ADP-ribosylation, or ubiquitinization of a specific amino acid residue (6Wu R.S. Panusz H.T. Hatch C.L. Bonner W.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 20: 201-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).

Glucocorticoids are the most effective therapy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway (11Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Functionally, they act partly by inducing some anti-inflammatory genes such as secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) (12Sallenave J.M. Shulmann J. Crossley J. Jordana M. Gauldie J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), lipocortin-1 (13Flower R.J. Rothwell N.J. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (14Levine S.J. Benfield T. Shelhamer J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but mainly by repression of inflammatory genes, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes, and receptors (11Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). They act by binding to a cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which upon binding is activated and rapidly translocates to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, GR either induces gene transcription by binding to specific DNA elements in the promoter/enhancer regions of responsive genes or reduces gene transcription by transrepression (15Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). GR reduces gene transcription by a functional interaction with proinflammatory transcription factors such as AP-1 (Fos-Jun heterodimers) and NF-κB (p65-p50 heterodimers) (15Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 16Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 12: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that GR represses NF-κB-mediated HAT activity and GM-CSF release by a combination of direct inhibition of CBP-associated HAT activity, but not that of CBP itself, and by recruitment of HDACs to the NF-κB activation complex (18Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Many of the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids may be mediated by repression of transcription factors (transrepression), whereas the endocrine and metabolic effects of corticosteroids are mediated via GRE binding (transactivation). This has led to a search for novel corticosteroids that selectively transrepress, thus reducing the risk of systemic side effects. A separation of transactivation and transrepression has been demonstrated using reporter gene constructs in transfected cells using selective mutations of GR (19Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some corticosteroids, such as RU24858, RU486 (mifepristone), and ZK98299, have a greater transrepression than transactivation effect (19Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 20Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These corticosteroids, including RU24858 and RU40066, have anti-inflammatory effects in vivo (21Vayssiere B.M. Dupont S. Choquart A. Petit F. Garcia T. Marchandeau C. Gronemeyer H. Resche R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These studies rely on the overexpression of components of these pathways, which could lead to problems in interpretation. We have therefore examined the role of CBP and associated HATs in the regulation of glucocorticoid functions in nontransfected cells. We have investigated the ability of dexamethasone and mifepristone to suppress expression of the inflammatory cytokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulation factor (GM-CSF), and induce SLPI and to regulate histone acetylation and deacetylation in A549 cells. We have demonstrated that mifepristone, unlike dexamethasone, is unable to induce histone H4 acetylation but is able partially to repress IL-1β-stimulated histone acetylation without recruitment HDAC2 to the p65 complex. This results in a partial reduction of acetylated Lys8 associated with the GM-CSF promoter and reduced GM-CSF mRNA production. The mechanism of mifepristone repression of IL-1β-stimulated histone H4 Lys8acetylation was by direct inhibition of p65-associated HAT activity with no effect on recruitment of HDAC2 to the p65-HAT complex. A549 cells, a human lung adenoma cell line (ATCC designation CCL185) and a good model for human lung epithelial cells, were grown to 50% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum before incubation for 48–72 h in serum-free media. Cells were stimulated by IL-1β (1 ng/ml), and the effects of dexamethasone, mifepristone, and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (Sigma, Poole, UK) (22Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on GM-CSF and SLPI release were measured. Determination of GM-CSF expression was measured by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoassay of SLPI, polystyrene microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with sample diluted with hydroxycarbonate (pH 9.6). Plates were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% ovalbumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Antibodies against SLPI (R&D Systems Europe) were diluted 1:2000 and added to each plate. After 1 h at room temperature, plates were washed sequentially with 0.1% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Dako, Cambridge, UK) for 1 h. Detection was performed following R&D instructions. Recombinant human SLPI (R&D Systems Europe) was used as a standard. PCR primers were as follows, with annealing temperature and product size in parentheses: GM-CSF sense 5′-CCC AAT gAA gCC TCA CCg AAT-3′ and antisense 5′-TCg gAg Cgg gTA gTT AAC AgC-3′ (67 °C, 604 bp); SLPI sense 5′-ATg AAg TCC AgC ggC CTC TT-3′ and antisense 5′-ATg gCA ggA ATC AAg CTT TC-3′ (54 °C, 408 bp); and GAPDH sense 5′-CCC TgA ATT TgA Cag TCT CACC-3′ and antisense 5′-CAC AAT AAA ACT TgC CCA gAA AAA-3′ (62 °C, 175 bp). Extraction of RNA from A549 cells was performed using an RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). Sample RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry, and 1 µg was reverse transcribed to cDNA as previously described (23Wright L.C. Seybold J. Robichaud A. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L694-L700PubMed Google Scholar). PCRs were performed on 5 µl of the cDNA with a Hybaid Omnigene thermal cycler (Hybaid, Ashford, Middlesex, UK) in a final reaction volume of 25 µl in the presence of 0.4 units ofTaq DNA polymerase. 35 cycles were used, with a denaturing step at 94 °C for 45 s, followed by the specific primer annealing temperature for 45 s and an extension step at 72 °C for 45 s. Histones were extracted from nuclei overnight using HCl and H2SO4 at 4 °C as previously described (18Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Cells were microcentrifuged for 5 min, and the cell pellets were extracted with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm sodium bisulfite, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 8.6% sucrose, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was repeatedly washed in buffer until the supernatant was clear (centrifuge at 8000 rpm, 5 min after each wash), and the nuclear pellet was washed in nuclear wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 13 mm EDTA) and resuspended in 50 µl of 0.2 n HCl and 0.4 nH2SO4 in distilled water. The nuclei were extracted overnight at 4 °C, and the residue was microcentrifuged for 10 min. The supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone and left overnight at −20 °C. The sample was microcentrifuged for 10 min, washed with acetone, dried, and diluted in distilled water. Protein concentrations of the histone-containing supernatant were determined by Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitates, whole cell extractions, or isolated histones were measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-ECL membranes. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL. A549 cells (0.5 × 106) were cultured in eight-well slide chambers with mifepristone (10−6m), dexamethasone (10−6m), or IL-1β (1 ng/ml). Cells were washed with Hanks' solution and air-dried for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then fixed in ice-cold acetone-methanol (50/50, w/w) (−20 °C) for 10 min. Slides were air-dried and incubated with blocking buffer (20% normal swine serum in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% saponin) (Dako) for 20 min, followed by 1-h incubation with primary antibody solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin). Antibodies against acetylated H4 Lys5, H4 Lys8(Serotec) (24Turner B.M. O'Neill L.P. Allan I.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), GR (Serotec), and NF-κB/p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used at 1:100 to 1:300 dilution. Slides were washed twice and incubated with biotinylated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako) (1:200) for 45 min. Slides were washed again before incubation with fluorescein isothiocyante-conjugated streptavidin (1:100) for 45 min. The slides were washed twice more before counterstaining with 20% hematoxylin, and mounting. Stained cells were observed by fluorescent microscopy. Cells were plated at a density of 0.25 × 106 cells/ml and exposed to 5 µCi/ml of [3H]acetate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C cells were stimulated for 6 h. Histones were isolated and separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-16% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) were excised. The radioactivity in extracted core histones was determined by liquid scintillation counting and normalized to protein level. Radiolabeled histones were prepared from A549 cells following incubation with TSA (100 ng/ml, 6 h) in the presence of 0.1 mCi/ml [3H]acetate. Histones were dried and resuspended in distilled water. Crude HDAC preparations were extracted from total cellular homogenates with Tris-based buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol) as previously reported (25Kolle D. Brosch G. Lechner T. Lusser A. Loidl P. Methods. 1998; 15: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The crude HDAC preparation or immunoprecipitates were incubated with3H-labeled histone for 30 min at 30 °C before the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 n HCl, 0.4n acetic acid. Released 3H-labeled acetic acid was extracted by ethyl acetate, and the radioactivity of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Extracts were prepared using 100 µl of mild IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysis mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min and microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Extracts were precleared with 20 µl of A/G agarose (a 50/50 mix; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and 2 µg of normal rabbit IgG. After microcentrifugation, 20 µl of A/G agarose conjugated with 5 µg of p65 antibody were incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with rotation. The immune complexes were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of IP buffer. For the HAT assay, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with IP-HAT buffer, and for Western blotting, after a final wash with IP buffer, the buffer was aspirated completely and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. IP-HAT assays were performed using a modified method of Ogryzko (26Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Immune complexes with resin were resuspended in 150 µl of HAT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, complete protease inhibitor mixture). Typically, 20 µl of free core histone solution extracted from A549 cells (final concentration 10 µg) and 30 µl of immunoprecipitate were incubated. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.25 µCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (5 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and performed for 45 min at 30 °C. After incubation, the reaction mixture was spotted onto Whatman p81 phosphocellulose filter paper (Whatman) and washed for 30 min with 0.2 m sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.2) at room temperature with 2–3 changes of the buffer and then washed briefly with acetone. The dried filters were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. A-549 cells pretreated for 30 min with dexamethasone or mifepristone were treated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml) for 4 h. Protein-DNA complexes were fixed by formaldehyde (1% final concentration) and treated as previously described (27Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 200 µl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, complete proteinase inhibitor mixture) and subjected to three 10-s pulses of sonication on ice. Sonicated samples were centrifuged to spin down cell debris, and the soluble chromatin solution was immunoprecipitated using sonicated salmon sperm DNA-agarose A slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Buckingham, UK) as described by Chen et al. (28Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Protein-bound immunoprecipitated DNA was washed with LiCl wash buffer and Tris-EDTA buffer, and immune complexes were eluted by adding elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 mNaHCO3). The elution was treated successively for 4 h at 65 °C in 200 mm NaCl, 1% SDS to reverse cross-links and incubated for 1 h at 45 °C with 70 µg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform; precipitated with ethanol, 0.3 m NaHCOOH, 20 µg glycogen; and resuspended in 50 µl of Tris-EDTA buffer. Quantitative PCR was performed with 10 µl of DNA sample and 30 cycles. Primer pairs of GM-CSF were as follows: forward (5-CTGACCACCTAGGGAAAAGGC-3) and reverse (5-CAGCCACATCCTCCTCCAGAGAAC-3). PCR products were resolved by 3% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. A multiple comparison was made between the mean of the control and the means from each individual treatment group by Dunnett's test using SAS/STAT software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All statistical testing was performed using a two-sided 5% level of significance test. The concentrations of dexamethasone or mifepristone producing 50% of the maximal inhibition seen (EC50) were calculated from concentration-response curves by linear regression. We used the partial glucocorticoid agonist mifepristone (RU-486) to examine the different roles of GR transactivation and transrepression in control of GM-CSF and SLPI expression. Using reporter gene assays and overexpression of GR, it has been postulated that mifepristone and related compounds may discriminate between transrepression and transactivation at GRE and AP-1- and NF-κB-driven genes (19Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 20Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Mifepristone inhibited IL-1β-stimulated GM-CSF release with a maximal inhibition of 50.4% (EC50 = 0.7 × 10−9m; Fig.1 A) and failed to induce SLPI expression (Fig. 1 B). This was in contrast to dexamethasone, which totally suppressed IL-1β-stimulated GM-CSF release (EC50 = 1.4 × 10−9m) and caused a marked induction of SLPI release (7.6 ± 0.5versus 1.5 ± 0.7 ng/ml at 10−6m). Thus, at the level of functional mediator release, there is a clear discrimination between the activation and repressive roles of mifepristone. In addition, mifepristone inhibited IL-1β-induced SLPI production with maximal inhibition of 65% at 10−5m(Fig. 1 C). Dexamethasone strongly inhibited IL-1β-stimulated SLPI release (73%) at a concentration of 10-10m before stimulating further SLPI release to levels seen with dexamethasone (10−6m) alone. Many reports have suggested that control of gene expression is dependent upon changes in chromatin structure resulting from alterations in the acetylation status of core histones (29Imhof A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R422-R424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used the HDAC inhibitor TSA (10 ng/ml) to determine the role of HDACs in mediating the effects of dexamethasone and mifepristone on inhibition of IL-1β-stimulated GM-CSF release. TSA further stimulated IL-1β-induced GM-CSF release, suggesting a role for HDACs in modulating gene induction, possibly reflecting a feedback mechanism to enable switching off of GM-CSF after an initial inflammatory pulse. In addition, TSA attenuated both the maximal inhibition and the EC50 for dexamethasone (maximum inhibition, 61versus 91% at 10−6m; EC50, 7.8 × 10−8 versus1.4 × 10−9m) while having no effect on mifepristone actions (maximum inhibition, 50 versus 45% at 10−6m; EC50, 0.7 × 10−5 versus 1.2 × 10−5m) (Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that mifepristone actions in repressing IL-1β-stimulated GM-CSF release are independent of HDAC activity, whereas the full repressive effects of dexamethasone require HDAC activity. In order to determine whether dexamethasone or mifepristone could affect bulk IL-1β-stimulated histone acetylation, experiments were performed in whole cell extracts from cells treated with IL-1β and/or mifepristone or dexamethasone. IL-1β induced a 4-fold increase in histone acetylation (Fig. 2). Mifepristone alone had no effect on basal histone acetylation but inhibited IL-1β-induced histone acetylation with maximal inhibition of 53% (Fig. 2, upper panel). In contrast, dexamethasone had a biphasic effect on IL-1β-stimulated histone acetylation (Fig.2, lower panel), similar to the effects seen on SLPI production. Dexamethasone alone also induced histone acetylation in a concentration-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy showed that dexamethasone and mifepristone enhanced GR nuclear translocation. IL-1β had no effect on GR translocation (Fig.3, a–d). In contrast to this result, IL-1β, but not dexamethasone and mifepristone, enhanced NF-κB (p65 subunit) nuclear translocation (Fig. 3, e–h). We examined histone H4 lysine acetylation in order to confirm the role of histone acetylation in IL-1β-, dexamethasone-, or mifepristone-mediated effects. IL-1β caused acetylation of Lys8 (AcH4K8; Fig. 3 p) and Lys12 residues (data not shown), while dexamethasone targeted acetylation on Lys5 (AcH4K5; Fig.3 k) and Lys16 (data not shown) as previously reported (18Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Mifepristone failed to stimulate acetylation of any lysine residue (Fig. 3, j and n). Western analysis of specific acetylated lysines showed that dexamethasone, but not mifepristone, induced acetylation of Lys5 residues at the concentration of 10−6m (Fig. 4 A). In addition, dexamethasone significantly inhibited IL-1β-stimulated Lys8 acetylation (Fig. 4 B). Mifepristone also reduced IL-1β-stimulated Lys8 acetylation but to a lesser extent than dexamethasone. These data suggest that mifepristone can slightly inhibit histone acetylation induced by IL-1β and, in contrast to dexamethasone, is unable itself to induce histone acetylation. The above data examine bulk histone acetylation status. In order to be functionally relevant, these events must occur at the correct promoter sites. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that H4 Lys8 acetylation, but not H4 Lys5 acetylation, was involved in IL-1β-stimulated GM-CSF promoter activation. Both dexamethasone and mifepristone inhibited the IL-1β-stimulated increase of GM-CSF promoter associated with acetylated H4 Lys8 (Fig. 4 C). The effect of dexamethasone was greater (64% reduction) than that seen with mifepristone (45% reduction). This data confirms the earlier results showing that dexamethasone was more effective than mifepristone in inhibiting GM-CSF release and also suggests that the effect occurs at the level of gene expression. This was confirmed using reverse transcription-PCR. This showed that IL-1β induced expression of both GM-CSF and SLPI steady-state mRNA (Fig. 4 D, compare lanes 1 and 2). GM-CSF steady state mRNA levels were reduced to a greater extent with dexamethasone (1 µm, 95%) than by mifepristone (1 µm, 51%)(Fig. 4 D, compare lanes 5 and8), mimicking the effect seen at the protein level. SLPI steady-state mRNA expression also followed its release patterns with a reduction at low concentrations of dexamethasone (10−9m, lane 3) and subsequent gene induction at higher concentrations (10−6m, lane 5). In contrast, mifepristone reduced SLPI steady-state mRNA levels at low concentrations (10−9m, lane 7) without subsequent induction of gene expression at higher concentrations (Fig.4 D, lane 8). These data indicate that release is controlled at the level of gene expression. Although not formally demonstrated here, previous data have suggested that dexamethasone regulation of GM-CSF release in lung epithelial cells is regulated at the level of gene transcription (30Adkins K.K. Levan T.D. Miesfeld R.L. Bloom J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L372-L378PubMed Google Scholar). In order to clarify the inhibitory mechanism of mifepristone on histone acetylation, we investigated p65-associated histone acetylation and deacetylation in IL-1β and/or mifepristone- or dexamethasone-stimulated cells. We have previously shown that IL-1β-stimulated HAT activity induced acetylation of Lys5and Lys12 residues only after mild, but not stringent, CBP immunoprecipitation conditions, suggesting that CBP itself does not play a role in NF-κB-induced histone acetylation (18Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation was increased 3-fold following IL-1β stimulation (p < 0.05, Fig.5 A). Dexamethasone and mifepristone both inhibited p65-associated IL-1β-induced histone acetylation in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 3.7 × 10−10 and 3.1 × 10-7m, p < 0.05) (Fig.5 A, open bars). Dexamethasone and mifepristone, in the absence of IL-1β, produced no change in p65-associated histone acetylation from that seen in control untreated samples (Fig. 5 A, open bars). In order to confirm that dexamethasone and mifepristone targeted p65-associated HAT activity specifically, control experiments with a blocking peptide were performed, which showed that no histone acetylation activity was pulled down in these assays (184 ± 41 versus >2500 dpm/106 cells). To confirm the earlier data on GM-CSF release (Fig. 1 D), we examined the effect of HDAC inhibition on dexamethasone and mifepristone actions on IL-1β-induced p65-associated HAT activity. TSA (10 ng/ml) reduced dexamethasone suppression of p65-associated HAT activity (IC50 = 1.9 × 10-8 versus 3.7 × 10-10m, p < 0.05) but had no effect on the mifepristone concentration-response curve (IC50 = 5.5 × 10-8m versus 3.1 × 10-7m) (Fig. 5 A, closed bar). In the presence of TSA, there was no significant difference in IC50 for IL-1β-stimulated p65-associated HAT activity between dexamethasone and mifepristone (IC50 = 1.9 × 10-8m versus 5.5 × 10-8m). In the same immunoprecipitates, mifepristone was found to have little or no effect on histone deacetylation except at the highest concentrations studied (10−6m; 103.2 ± 15.0 versus 15.3 ± 3.9 dpm/106 cells,p < 0.05). In comparison, dexamethasone caused a concentration-dependent increase in p65-associated HDAC activity (10−6m; 939.4 ± 58.3versus 15.3 ± 3.9 dpm/106 cells,p < 0.01) (Fig. 5 B). We have previously shown that dexamethasone induced HDAC2 recruitment to the p65-associated HAT complex. We therefore examined whether this was the case for mifepristone. We determined the effect of mifepristone on HDAC2 expression, histone deacetylase activity, and p65/HDAC association. In marked contrast to dexamethasone, mifepristone failed to induce either HDAC2 expression or histone deacetylation activity (Fig.6 A). Western blot analysis of p65 immunoprecipitates showed a recruitment of HDAC2 to the p65-immunoprecipitated complex following treatment of cells with IL-1β and low concentrations (10-8m) of dexamethasone (Fig. 6 B), suggesting a role for HDAC2 in the suppressive actions of dexamethasone. In contrast, mifepristone failed to mediate recruitment of HDAC2 to the p65-associated HAT complex. It has been postulated that mifepristone and related compounds may dissociate transrepression from transactivation at AP-1- and NF-κB-driven promoters (19Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 20Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used mifepristone to examine the roles of GR transactivation and transrepression in the control of GM-CSF and SLPI expression and histone acetylation status. Mifepristone was unable to stimulate histone H4 acetylation and SLPI release. IL-1β caused a concentration-dependent increase in GM-CSF expression, which was inhibited by 50% maximally by mifepristone. A similar effect of mifepristone was seen on IL-1β-stimulated histone acetylation and on p65-associated HAT activity. We have previously demonstrated that dexamethasone was able to inhibit IL-1β-stimulated histone acetylation by a combination of direct inhibition of p65-activated HAT activity and by recruitment of HDACs to the activated p65-HAT complex. Here we show that mifepristone has a similar ability to dexamethasone in repressing p65-associated HAT activity but, in contrast, is unable to recruit HDAC2 to the activated p65-HAT complex. We have previously shown that this p65-induced HAT activity is associated with, but not due to, CBP and PCAF (18Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). We show that the p65-associated HAT activity was directly inhibited by both dexamethasone and mifepristone in vitro, suggesting that this is the target for glucocorticoid action rather than CBP itself. It is possible that CBP may play a scaffolding role in this process. Many previous studies have reported a role for CBP in mediating NF-κB activity and/or its interactions with GR (31Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Biol.

All of these studies involve overexpression of one or more of the factors thought to be involved in the interactions or microinjection of antibodies. As such, these must be considered as contrived systems that must be confirmed in the natural cell. In this study, in the absence of overexpression, we were unable to show any role for CBP or PCAF in mediating the IL-1β-stimulated p65-associated increase in histone acetyltransferase and GM-CSF gene expression. An alternative scenario is that dexamethasone and mifepristone inhibit p65 association with co-activators such as CBP and PCAF. Although not measured directly here, we have previously shown that this is not the case for dexamethasone (18Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Many of the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids may be mediated by repression of transcription factors (transrepression), whereas the endocrine and metabolic effects of corticosteroids are mediated via GRE binding (transactivation) (38Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This has led to a search for novel corticosteroids that selectively repress inflammatory gene transcription and would thus reduce the risk of systemic side effects. Transactivation via GR/GRE binding involves a GR homodimer, while transrepression of transcription factor (AP-1 and NF-κB) activity involves a GR monomer. A separation of transactivation and transrepression has been demonstrated using reporter gene constructs in transfected cells using selective mutations of GR (19Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some corticosteroids, such as RU24858, mifepristone, and ZK98299, have a greater transrepression than transactivation effect (19Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 20Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Indeed, the topical corticosteroids used in asthma therapy today, such as fluticasone propionate and budesonide, appear to have more potent transrepression than transactivation effects, which may account for their selection as potent anti-inflammatory agents (39Adcock I.M. Nasuhara Y. Stevens D.A. Barnes P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel class of corticosteroids has been described in which there is potent transrepression with relatively little transactivation. These “dissociated” corticosteroids, including RU24858 and RU40066 have anti-inflammatory effects in vivo (21Vayssiere B.M. Dupont S. Choquart A. Petit F. Garcia T. Marchandeau C. Gronemeyer H. Resche R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The clinical relevance of these effects of GR mutants is indicated by the construction of a GR dimerization-deficient mutant mouse in which GR is unable to dimerize and therefore bind to DNA, thus separating the transactivation and transrepression activities of corticosteroids (40Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J. Kretz O. Wessely O. Bock R. Gass P. Schmid W. Herrlich P. Angel P. Schutz G. Cell. 1998; 93: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). These animals, in contrast to GR knockout animals, survive to adulthood. In these animals, dexamethasone was able to inhibit AP-1-driven gene transcription, but the ability to facilitate GRE-mediated effects such as cortisol suppression and T-cell apoptosis was markedly inhibited. This suggests that the development of corticosteroids with a greater margin of safety is possible and may predict the development of oral corticosteroids that may be safe to use in asthma and other inflammatory diseases. The results of glucocorticoid actions on airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation in these animals await determination. The results presented in this study differ from those of Heck and colleagues (20Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) in regard to the ability of mifepristone to cause transrepression and others with regard to NF-κB requirement for CBP (31Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29291-29294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The most obvious reason for this is the use of reporter gene assays and GR overexpression in the study of Heck, while they were not employed here. This has important ramifications for the use of reporter genes and overexpression assays in understanding the role of specific proteins in complex systems. In summary, we have shown that the glucocorticoid receptor agonist mifepristone has no ability to induce gene transcription but represses IL-1β-stimulated histone acetylation and GM-CSF release by 50% maximally. IL-1β-stimulated NF-κB activated distinct p65-associated HATs (35 and 55 kDa) but did not activate CBP or PCAF HAT activity. Mifepristone was able to inhibit p65-associated HAT activity to the same extent as dexamethasone but failed to recruit HDAC2 to the p65-HAT complex. These data suggest that the maximal transcriptional repressive action of glucocorticoids requires recruitment of HDAC2 to the p65-HAT complex. In addition, our results suggest dissociation between the ability of mifepristone to repress histone acetylation and gene expression and of its ability to activate histone acetylation and to switch on gene expression. This suggests that our model of histone acetylation/deacetylation may prove to be useful for the examination of dissociated glucocorticoids."

These cataracts are associated with proteolytic processing of the abundant lens protein γ-crystallin, leading to its aggregation and subsequent opacification of the lens. The general cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64, blocked cataract formation and γ-crystallin cleavage in α3 (−/−) lenses. Using a new class of activity-based cysteine protease affinity probes, we identified the calcium-dependent proteases, m-calpain and Lp82, as the primary targets of E-64 in the lens. Profiling changes in protease activities throughout cataractogenesis indicated that Lp82 activity was dramatically increased in α3 (−/−) lenses and correlated both spatially and temporally with cataract formation. Increased Lp82 activity was due to calcium accumulation as a result of increased influx and decreased outflux of calcium ions in α3 (−/−) lenses. These data establish a role for α3 gap junctions in maintaining calcium homeostasis that in turn is required to control activity of the calcium-dependent cysteine protease Lp82, shown here to be a key initiator of the process of cataractogenesis.

Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). These channels allow transfer of small molecules between the cytoplasm of neighboring cells. A number of studies have shown that communication facilitated by gap junctions is important both during embryonic development and for maintaining normal physiological functions within a cell (1Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar, 2Lo C.W. Dev. Genet. 1999; 24: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism by which gap junction communication contributes to these processes is still obscure. In recent years, the vertebrate lens has been used extensively to study gap junction communication (3White T.W. Bruzzone R. Brain. Res. Brain. Res. Rev. 2000; 32: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The lens is a cellular, avascular organ made up predominantly of elongated fiber cells that are formed by the differentiation of epithelial cells that line the anterior surface of the developing lens. During differentiation, fiber cells lose their cytoplasmic organelles and begin to express lens-specific proteins know as crystallins. With age, this differentiation program gives rise to a spherical conglomerate of cells made up of concentric layers of fiber cells. As new layers form, older primary fiber cells are compressed inward, forming a central “nuclear region” of the mature lens. In the vertebrate lens, each cell is coupled to its neighbors via gap junctions, resulting in a network of cell-cell contacts that has been suggested to be important for the maintenance of ion flux and for metabolic cooperation between the peripheral lens cells and the interior fiber cells (4Goodenough D.A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Three connexin genes are expressed in the vertebrate lens; epithelial cells express α1 (Cx43)1 connexin; fiber cells express α3 (Cx46) and α8 (Cx50) connexin (5Church R.L. Wang J.H. Steele E. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 979-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 6Paul D.L. Ebihara L. Takemoto L.J. Swenson K.I. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1077-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In order to establish a functional role for gap junctions in the lens, connexin knockout mice have been generated (7Gong X. Li E. Klier G. Huang Q. Wu Y. Lei H. Kumar N.M. Horwitz J. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 8White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Disruption of the α3 (Cx46) or α8 (Cx50) genes gives rise to distinct phenotypes; α8 ablation in mice results in reduced lens size (microphthalmia), and α3 knockout (α3 (−/−)) mice develop nuclear cataracts within 2 weeks of birth. Significantly, mutations in either α3 or α8 connexins are linked to congenital cataracts in humans (9Pal J.D. Liu X. Mackay D. Shiels A. Berthoud V.M. Beyer E.C. Ebihara L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C596-C602Crossref Google Scholar, 10Shiels A. Mackay D. Ionides A. Berry V. Moore A. Bhattacharya S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 526-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Structural integrity of the abundant lens proteins known as crystallins is necessary for maintaining the lens' refractive index. Perturbations in crystallin structure have been linked to cataract formation (11Horwitz J. Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Eye. 1999; 13: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,12Mandal K. Chakrabarti B. Thomson J. Siezen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8096-8102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, γ-crystallin cleavage is associated with congenital, juvenile, and senile human cataracts (13Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Stephan D.A. Gillanders E. Vanderveen D. Freas-Lutz D. Wistow G. Baxevanis A.D. Robbins C.M. VanAuken A. Quesenberry M.I.

Initial characterization of the phenotype of α3 (−/−) mice indicated that lens opacity was associated with an accumulation of γ-crystallin cleavage products, leading to the formation of an insoluble conglomerate of disulfide-associated polypeptides (7Gong X. Li E. Klier G. Huang Q. Wu Y. Lei H. Kumar N.M. Horwitz J. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This increased cleavage of crystallin molecules in the lenses of α3 (−/−) mice suggested a critical role for proteolysis during the process of cataractogenesis. Several forms of cataracts are directly associated with perturbations in the levels of calcium within the lens, indicating a potential role for the calcium dependent cysteine proteases known as calpains (15Truscott R.J. Marcantonio J.M. Tomlinson J. Duncan G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 2405-2411PubMed Google Scholar, 16Paterson C.A. Zeng J. Husseini Z. Borchman D. Delamere N.A. Garland D.

Eye Res. 1997; 64: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Numerous reports have described the use of a general cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64, in experimental studies of cataract formation. E-64 inhibits cataract formation in cultured lenses treated with cataract-inducing agents such as diamide, selenite, and calcium ionophore (18Shearer T.R. Ma H. Fukiage C. Azuma M. Mol. Vis. 1997; 3: 8PubMed Google Scholar, 19Azuma M. David L.L. Shearer T.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the specific protein targets of this inhibitor in the lens were not identified, and tools for measuring activity of specific proteases in situ were lacking. Recently, new biochemical reagents have been generated that allow the monitoring of global changes in protease activity. These reagents take advantage of the broad reactivity of the natural product E-64 to create chemical probes that covalently react with the papain family of cysteine proteases in an activity-dependent manner (20Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, labeling intensity can be used to determine relative activities of multiple proteases within a sample extract or tissue. In the present study, we have employed this labeling approach to identify the lens-specific calpain Lp82 and m-calpain as the predominant targets of E-64 in the mouse lens. Furthermore, in situ activity profiling of intact α3 (−/−) lenses revealed that, whereas m-calpain and Lp82 are expressed in both wild type and α3 (−/−) lenses, only Lp82 activity correlated with cataract formation. We therefore propose that calcium accumulation and the subsequent activation of the lens-specific calpain Lp82 in the α3 (−/−) lens are key events leading to cataract formation. These studies also provide a functional link between α3 gap junctions and maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the lens. E-64 was purchased from Calbiochem. Z-VAD was purchased from Enzyme System Products. DCG-03, DCG-04,125I-DCG-03, and 125I-DCG-04 were synthesized as described (20Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). TC199 medium was purchased from Cellgro. The Vectastain kit (Vector Laboratories) was used to detect biotinylated proteases. Anti-Lp82 polyclonal antibodies were provided by T. R. Shearer (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Anti-m-calpain polyclonal antibodies were provided by J. S. Elce (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). Anti-µ-calpain monoclonal antibodies were provided by N. S. Kosower and S. Bar-Noy (Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel). Lenses were dissected from either WT or α(−/−) 129sv mice using a posterior approach. Wet weights were determined. Lenses were homogenized in 0.1m NaCl, 50 mm Na2HPO4(pH 7.0) at 40 mg of lens (wet weight/ml) of solution. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added, and homogenates were incubated at 60 °C for 5 min. Samples (10 µl) were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with anti-γ-crystallin antibodies. Lenses from 1-week-old mice were dissected using the posterior approach in a microwell dissection dish containing 37 °C pre-warmed, serum-free TC199 medium supplemented with 250 units/ml penicillin and 25 µg/ml streptomycin. Lenses were incubated in a 24-well TC dish containing 1 ml/well TC199 at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. Protein concentration of the culture medium was determined 2 h after culturing to confirm that the lenses remained intact. Damaged lenses were discarded. For protease inhibition experiments, lenses were incubated as above in the presence of 100 µm E-64. Alternatively, lenses were incubated in the presence of 50 µm general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. Lenses were dissected as described above and homogenized in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol at 50 mg of lens (wet weight)/ml of solution. Labeling was performed using 100 µg of total protein/sample as described previously (20Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of free calcium (0–3 mm). The control proteasome label was used as described previously (21Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Intact lenses from α3 (−/−) or WT mice were cultured as described above in the presence of 50 µm DCG-04 for 6 h. Incubation was performed in the presence or absence of 200 µm E-64 as indicated. Subsequently, lenses were homogenized in buffer A supplemented with 200 µm E-64. In some cases DCG-04-labeled lenses were subjected to immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. Equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added, and homogenates were boiled for 5 min. Homogenates were separated on a 9% acrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in a 5% skim milk/TBST solution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing three times for 10 min each with TBST and incubation with Vectastain (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h. Subsequently, membranes were washed three times for 10 min each with TBST and analyzed using the Super Signal reagent (Pierce). Lenses from WT, α3 (−/−), or α8 (−/−) mice were dissected and vacuum-dried for 48 h. In some cases the nuclear and cortical regions of the lens were dissected to give a wet weight ratio of 40:60, respectively, before drying. Pairs of dry lenses were then weighed and solubilized in 100 µl of 2% nitric acid for 12 h at 37 °C. De-ionized water was added to a final volume of 5 ml. The content of calcium, magnesium, and potassium was determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 3000XL analyzer. All measurements were normalized to dry lens weight. Ca2+influx measurements were performed as described previously (22Thomas G.R. Sanderson J. Duncan G. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In brief, clear lenses from 10-day-old mice were pre-incubated at 35 °C for 2 h in artificial aqueous humor (AAH) containing: 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mmNaHCO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.25). Subsequently, medium was replaced with an AAH solution containing 2 µCi of 45Ca and incubation continued for 2 h at 35 °C. Lenses were washed three times for 1 min each time in 5 ml of AAH, rolled on filter paper, and weighed. Lenses were homogenized in the presence of tissue solubilizer (Solusol; National Diagnostics) at 100 µl/lens pair and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Radioactivity of homogenates was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Ca2+ influx was determined using the following equation. Ca2+ influx=cpmlenscpmmedium×[Ca2+]mediumVmediumMlens×1T(Eq. 1) cpmlens = counts/min (cpm) measured in the lens, cpmmedium = cpm measured in the medium, [Ca2+]medium = concentration of calcium in the medium, V medium = volume of the medium; M lens = wet mass of the lens, andT = time of incubation with 45Ca-containing solution. Twelve pairs of clear lenses from 10-day-old WT or α3 (−/−) mice were incubated in the presence of AAH containing 2 µCi of 45Ca. After 2 h of incubation, lenses were washed three times for 1 min each time in 5 ml of AAH and placed in 1 ml of fresh non-radioactive AAH. Lens cpm as well as medium cpm was determined after 2 h of incubation using a liquid scintillation counter. Initial lens cpm was calculated by adding lens cpm to medium cpm. Relative outflux units were calculated by subtracting the final lens cpm from the initial lens cpm and dividing by the initial lens cpm. Alternatively, the initial lens cpm was divided by the medium cpm. The two methods of calculation yielded the same results. The statistical average was obtained for the data collected from each pair. Two-tailed p values were determined using the Mann-Whitney unpaired test. Connexin α3 (−/−) mice develop nuclear cataracts that further progress with age to dense nuclear opacities. To characterize the initial events leading to cataract formation, lenses from α3 (−/−) mice ranging in age from 1 to 4 weeks were analyzed (Fig. 1 A). In all α3 (−/−) mice examined (>50), detectable lens opacity appeared between 10 and 14 days of age. Since γ-crystallin cleavage was previously reported to be associated with α3 (−/−) cataractogenesis (7Gong X. Li E. Klier G. Huang Q. Wu Y. Lei H. Kumar N.M. Horwitz J. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), the processing of γ-crystallin was analyzed during the onset of cataracts (Fig.1 B). The initiation of cataracts coincided with the appearance of a previously reported low molecular weight γ-crystallin fragment (7Gong X. Li E. Klier G. Huang Q. Wu Y. Lei H. Kumar N.M. Horwitz J. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Further analyses of total lens homogenate using antibodies specific for crystallin αA, crystalline αB, and control cytoskeletal proteins did not reveal significant pattern differences between WT and α3 (−/−) lenses (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that protease activation is a key event during α3 (−/−) cataractogenesis, we utilized a lens organ culture system. In this system, transparent lenses dissected from 1-week-old α3 (+/+) and α3 (−/−) mice were maintained for 1 week in culture. Although (+/+) lenses remained transparent during the entire 6-day incubation period, α3 (−/−) lenses developed a mild nuclear cataract after 2 days in culture, which progressed to a large, dense opacity. In order to study the role of proteolysis in cataract formation, cultured lenses were incubated with several classes of protease inhibitors. The γ-crystallin cleavage site adjacent to an aspartic acid residue suggested that caspases might be involved in this process. However, neither cataractogenesis nor γ-crystallin cleavage was inhibited by the addition of the general caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD to α3 (−/−) cultured lenses (Fig. 1 C). In agreement with these results, caspase activity, measured with several fluorogenic substrates, was located predominantly in the cortical region of the α3 (−/−) lenses, not the nuclear region associated with the cataracts (data not shown). Furthermore, eight different recombinant caspases (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10) did not cleave γ-crystallinin vitro (data not shown). In contrast, incubation of α3 (−/−) lenses with low concentrations of the general cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64, completely blocked cataract formation (Fig.1 C) and inhibited γ-crystallin cleavage (Fig.1 D). No change in lens weight or hydration was observed in E-64-treated lenses (data not shown). These results indicate that cysteine protease(s) of the papain family are critical players in the process of cataractogenesis in the α3 (−/−) lens. Having identified an inhibitor of cataract formation in α3 (−/−) lenses, our attention turned toward determining the molecular targets of this compound. Recently, our laboratory developed activity-based probes of the papain family of cysteine proteases based on the structure of the natural product, E-64 (20Greenbaum D. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A. Bogyo M. Chem Biol. 2000; 7: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The compounds (DCG-03 and DCG-04) are epoxide-containing, irreversible inhibitors that are tagged with both a biotin moiety and a site for attachment of a radioactive iodine residue (Fig.2 A). Proteins modified by these probes can be visualized by SDS-PAGE, followed by affinity blotting or by autoradiography. Both DCG-03 and DCG-04 blocked cataract formation in cultured α3 (−/−) lenses, suggesting that they have the same permeability properties and inhibit the same critical protease targets as E-64 (data not shown). Affinity labeling of lens homogenates from (+/+) or α3 (−/−) mice using 125I-DCG-03 or 125I-DCG-04 yielded a distinct labeling pattern (Fig. 2 B,black arrows). The labeling of polypeptides by DCG-03 and DCG-04 occurred only in the presence of 1 mmfree calcium (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, a proteasome-specific probe, 125I-NLVS, labeled proteasome subunits regardless of calcium concentration. There was no significant difference in the intensity of E-64-labeled polypeptides in (+/+) and α3 (−/−) lenses, suggesting that the calcium-regulated cysteine proteases targeted by the probes are present at similar levels in both the knock-out and wild type lenses. Furthermore, the activity of all of the predominant labeled proteases (82, 80, 62, and 32 kDa) showed dose-dependent response to addition of free calcium to the extract (Fig. 2 C). Their activities showed the greatest response within the physiologically relevant range of calcium concentrations (0–0.5 mm). Furthermore, the 62-kDa protease showed a sharp increase in activity within this concentration range, indicating that its activity is likely to be significantly affected even by minor changes in the level of intracellular calcium within the lens. To further evaluate the role of cysteine protease activation in α3 (−/−) cataract formation, DCG-04 was used for in situaffinity labeling of intact lenses. Cultured lenses from 10-day-old mice were incubated for 6 h in the presence of 50 µmDCG-04 followed by homogenization of lenses, SDS-PAGE, and affinity blotting for biotin (Fig. 3 A). The pattern of labeled polypeptides obtained from α3 (−/−) lenses was identical to that observed in the in vitro labeling experiments, indicating that the same protein species are targeted by both labeling methods (compare Fig. 3 A to Fig.2 B). However, in contrast to the labeling in vitro, ex vivo DCG-04 treatment yielded markedly increased labeling of specific polypeptides in α3 (−/−) lenses (Fig. 3 A). Measurement of 125I-DCG-04 uptake in lenses of 2-week-old α3 (−/−) and WT mice confirmed that labeling differences did not result from changes in the permeability of the lens (data not shown). Competition with E-64 completely blocked labeling of all polypeptides, indicating that DCG-04-labeled proteins are also the primary targets of E-64. Since covalent modification of targets by affinity labeling reagents requires enzymatic activity, labeling intensity provides a direct indication of the levels of active proteases present in the sample. Therefore, these observations suggest that the activity of a calcium-regulated cysteine protease is significantly increased in the α3 (−/−) lens. One of the unique properties shared by calpains is their ability to catalyze autoprocessing of mature high molecular weight enzymes to smaller fragments (17Azuma M. Fukiage C. David L.L. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using antisera selective for the three predominant calpains expressed in the lens (m-calpain, µ-calpain, and Lp82) to identify the labeled polypeptides and to determine if some of the proteins were fragments generated by autocatalytic processing (Fig. 3 B). Immunoprecipitation analyses of DCG-04-labeled α3 (−/−) lenses identified the 82-, 62-, and 32-kDa polypeptides as components derived from Lp82. Similarly, the 80-kDa DCG-04-labeled polypeptide was identified as m-calpain. Following immunoprecipitation of m-calpain, an additional 43-kDa band was observed that is likely to represent a previously described breakdown product of m-calpain (17Azuma M. Fukiage C. David L.L. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A 62-kDa fragment of Lp82 has been suggested to be the active form of the enzyme (23Ma H. Hata I. Shih M. Fukiage C. Nakamura Y. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye. Res. 1999; 68: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine if this fragment was being autocatalytically produced in the lens, DCG-04-modified, full-length Lp82 was immunoprecipitated and then incubated for 5 min in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm free calcium (Fig.3 C). Intact Lp82 was processed to produce the active site-containing 62-kDa fragment only in the presence of calcium. Addition of E-64 completely inhibited this processing event. In order to track expression and activation of m-calpain and Lp82 during initiation of cataractogenesis, α3 (−/−) and WT intact lenses dissected from 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-week-old mice were affinity-labeled in situ with DCG-04 (Fig.4 A). Activity profiles were compared with protein levels of Lp82 and m-calpain determined in the same samples by immunoblotting. These results indicated that m-calpain activity reached a peak at 1 week of age and was only slightly elevated in the α3 (−/−) lens compared with the WT lens. In contrast, Lp82 activity peaked at 2 weeks of age in both the WT and α3 (−/−) lenses and was significantly elevated in the α3 (−/−) lenses. This increased activity of Lp82 was confirmed by the appearance of the affinity-labeled 62-kDa active form, which could be detected as early as 1 week of age in the α3 (−/−) lenses with no measurable activity observed in the parallel WT lenses. Immediately following peak activation, Lp82 activity decayed gradually and was undetectable by 4 weeks in the α3 (−/−) lenses, consistent with previous reports regarding Lp82 expression in the mouse lens (23Ma H. Hata I. Shih M. Fukiage C. Nakamura Y. Azuma M. Shearer T.R. Exp. Eye. Res. 1999; 68: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Notably, in the α3 (−/−) lenses intact Lp82 could no longer be detected by 3 weeks of age (Fig. 4 A, middle panel). This expression pattern is consistent with the rapid activation of Lp82 and the accumulation of its degradation products (which are not recognized by the antibody). The m-calpain expression levels, on the other hand, were not altered with age and did not differ significantly between WT and α3 (−/−) lenses (Fig. 4 A, right panel). These results suggest that, although protein levels of both m-calpain and Lp82 are nearly equivalent in WT and α3 (−/−) lenses, Lp82 is activated during α3 (−/−) cataract formation. To determine the spatial distribution of Lp82 activity within the lens, 2-week-old α3 (−/−) knock-out lenses were labeled with DCG-04 and individual lens regions dissected. Analysis of protease activity indicated that m-calpain activity was located predominantly in the epithelial and cortical regions of the lens, while Lp82 activity was found predominantly in the nuclear region (Fig. 4 B), further supporting a central role for Lp82 in α3 (−/−) cataractogenesis. To determine whether the protease activity profiles observed forex vivo cataract formation correlated with cataract formation in vivo, cultured lenses were labeled with DCG-04 after various incubation times. Activation of Lp82 occurred within 1 day of lens culture and reached a peak at 2 days. This activation profile coincided with the time frame for cataract initiation in vivo. Furthermore, the activity profile of Lp82 in cultured lenses was similar to the labeling profile observed for lenses in which cataract formation took place in vivo (data not shown). The finding that calcium-dependent cysteine proteases were hyperactivated in α3 connexin-deficient lenses suggested that α3 gap junctions play an important role in maintaining calcium homeostasis of the lens. To investigate this possibility, levels of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ ions in WT and α3 (−/−) lenses were measured using optical emission spectroscopy (Fig. 5). Lenses from α3 (−/−) mice exhibited a dramatic age-dependent increase in the levels of Ca2+ with no marked change in the levels of Mg2+ and K+ (Fig. 5 A). This increase in Ca2+ in the α3 (−/−) lenses was mainly due to accumulation of Ca2+ in the nuclear region of the lens (Fig. 5 B). Cultured lenses from 1-week-old α3 (−/−) mice also exhibited increased calcium accumulation compared with cultured WT lenses (Fig. 5 C). Significantly, ex vivotreatment with E-64 did not affect lens calcium levels, suggesting that protease activation acts downstream of calcium accumulation during cataractogenesis. In contrast to the α3 (−/−) lenses, which generate severe cataracts, deletion of α8 connexin results in microphthalmia accompanied by a mild cataract. Ca2+ levels measured in lenses from 1-month-old α8 (−/−) mice were only slightly elevated relative to WT levels and were substantially lower that the levels observed for age-matched α3 (−/−) lenses (Fig. 5 D). This result suggests that α3 and α8 gap junctions may have distinct functions in the lens and that cataract severity is correlated with calcium accumulation. To gain further insight into the role of α3 gap junctions in maintaining calcium homeostasis, Ca2+ influx and outflux rates were measured. In this assay, pre-cataractous, clear lenses from 8-day-old mice were examined. The influx and outflux rates were measured using 45Ca as a tracer. For Ca2+influx measurements, lenses were incubated in an artificial aqueous humor containing 45Ca. Following 2 h of incubation, α3 (−/−) lenses exhibited a 30% increase in the calcium influx rate compared with WT (Fig.6 A, left panel). To determine calcium outflux, lenses pre-loaded with45Ca were placed in a non-radioactive artificial aqueous humor. After 2 h of incubation, radioactivity was measure"

Because individual telomeres in cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance appear to periodically become extremely short, cells using this pathway to maintain telomeres may be faced with a continuous state of crisis. We expressed telomerase in a human cell line that uses the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance to test whether telomerase would prevent telomeres from becoming critically short and examine the effects that this might have on the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance. In these cells, telomerase maintains the length of the shortest telomeres. In some cases, the long heterogeneous telomeres are completely lost, and the cells now permanently contain short telomeres after only 40 population doublings. This corresponds to a telomere reduction rate of 500 base pairs/population doubling, a rate that is much faster than expected for normal telomere shortening but is consistent with the rapid telomere deletion events observed in cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance (Murnane, J. P., Sabatier, L., Marder, B. A., and Morgan, W. F. (1994)EMBO J. 13, 4953–4962). We also observed reductions in the fraction of cells containing alternative lengthening of telomere-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies and extrachromosomal telomere repeats; however, no alterations in the rate of sister chromatid exchange were observed. Our results demonstrate that human cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance retain factors required for telomerase to maintain telomeres and that once the telomerase-based pathway of telomere length regulation is engaged, recombination-based elongation of telomeres can be functionally inhibited.

Telomeres decrease in length, ultimately leading to proliferative failure in most dividing normal human cells (5Allsopp R.C. Chang E. Kashefi-Aazam M. Rogaev E.I. Piatyszek M.A. Shay J.W. Harley C.B.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 313-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, in vitro immortalized human cells and most cancer cells escape this growth arrest signal by activating a cellular mechanism of telomere length maintenance (8Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6458) Google Scholar). Telomere length maintenance is most often performed by the ribonucleoprotein telomerase that adds blocks of telomere repeats onto the ends of chromosomes (9Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). However, a recombination-based pathway to maintain telomere length often termed the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)1 pathway can also be found in some human in vitro immortalized and cancer-derived cells (10Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 11Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Dalla-Pozza L. Dunham M.A. Reddel R.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Telomerase-independent mechanisms of telomere length maintenance also exist in other organisms. Drosophila and mosquitoes use transposable elements to maintain telomeres (12Mason J.M. Biessmann H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 58-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 13Roth C.W. Kobeski F. Walter M.F. Biessmann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5176-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In mutant yeast lacking telomerase, survivors use one of two independent pathways of telomere length maintenance that require either Rad50 or Rad51 (14Le S. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Greider C.W. Genetics. 1999; 152: 143-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Teng S.C. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8083-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Type I survivors contain multiple tandem copies of the Y′ element and very short terminal tracts, whereas Type II survivors (10% of the total) require rad50p and have long and heterogeneous telomeres with terminal tracts of 12 kb or longer (15Teng S.C. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8083-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 16Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The Type II survivors are thought to maintain telomere length in a similar fashion as that found in human cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance (17Teng C.S. Chang J. McCowan B. Zakian A.V. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 947-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Embryonic stem cells derived from telomerase knockout mice can also activate a telomerase-independent mechanism to maintain telomere length (18Niida H. Shinkai Y. Hande M. Matsumoto T. Takehara S. Tachibana M. Oshimura M. Lansdorp P. Furuichi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4115-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because telomerase-independent mechanisms of telomere length maintenance exist, it has been suggested that telomerase inhibition therapy for telomerase-positive human cancers may result in resistant cells that have activated an alternative mechanism of telomere length regulation. However, several studies demonstrating that telomerase inhibition leads to cell death in human cancer cells have not reported the emergence of escapees that use the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance (19Herbert B. Pitts A.E. Baker S.I. Hamilton S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Corey D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14276-14281Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W.

Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Several characteristics can be used to identify human cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere length maintenance. First, they have no detectable telomerase activity and lack expression of the catalytic protein component, hTERT, or in some cases, they lack both hTERT and the integral RNA component, hTR (22Bryan T.M. Marusic L. Bacchetti S. Namba M. Reddel R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Second, cells using the recombination-based pathway to maintain telomeres have very long and heterogeneous telomeres ranging in length from less than 2 kb to 50 kb (1Murnane J.P. Sabatier L. Marder B.A. Morgan W.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Third, they contain extrachromosomal telomere repeats (ECTRs) that may be linear double-stranded fragments of telomeric DNA (23Ogino H. Nakabayashi K. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Fujii M. Suzuki T. Ayusawa D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fourth, cells using the recombination-based pathway to maintain telomeres have a novel type of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies called ALT-associated PML bodies (AA-PBs) that contain PML protein, TRF1, TRF2, replication factor A, Rad51, and Rad52 (24Yeager T.R. Neumann A.A. Englezou A. Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4175-4179PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear how characteristics associated with the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance are generated, and the molecular mechanisms involved also remain unclear. Various hypotheses for the mechanism that causes this apparently dysregulated telomere function in cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance have been made (1Murnane J.P. Sabatier L. Marder B.A. Morgan W.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Telomere elongation could occur in a cell using the ALT pathway when telomere-binding proteins can no longer associate with the telomere, at which time recombination enzymes may cause the observed rapid elongation. It has also been proposed that cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance may contain abnormal telomere end-binding proteins that under certain conditions cause rapid loss of telomere repeat sequences. It appears as though cells that use telomerase to maintain telomeres repress the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance (19Herbert B. Pitts A.E. Baker S.I. Hamilton S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Corey D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14276-14281Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W. Harrington L. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 21Colgin L.M. Wilkinson C. Englezou A. Kilian A. Robinson M.O. Reddel R.R. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and cells that use the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance repress the expression of components of telomerase (22Bryan T.M. Marusic L. Bacchetti S. Namba M. Reddel R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). At present, there is no experimental evidence demonstrating that ALT and telomerase pathways co-exist under nonexperimental circumstances. Murnane et al. (1Murnane J.P. Sabatier L. Marder B.A. Morgan W.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) have carefully followed telomere dynamics at a single telomere marked by a plasmid-induced chromosome-healing event. They showed a general pattern of progressive telomere shortening at about 50 bp/division until a critical short size was reached, at which time rapid telomere elongation events occurred, producing subclones with widely different telomere lengths. This observation has several important implications. It suggests that telomeres in cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance are not continuously undergoing lengthening events, but rather that it is a signal generated by a “too short telomere” that initiates a recombination-based process. In addition, it suggests that these cells should be in a frequent state of crisis due to a “too short telomere.” In the extreme case where one ignores deletion events producing rapid shortening, it would take a maximum of 1000 population doublings for a 50-kb telomere to lose all its repeats at 50 bp/division. Most cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance have 140–180 telomeres (70–90 chromosomes). If the telomeres are not synchronized into a coordinated shortening/lengthening cycle, then one of their telomeres should be critically short about every 6 or 7 divisions (1000 divisions/150 telomeres = 1 short telomere/6.7 divisions). Given that deletion events greatly increase the rate of shortening (see “Results”), cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere length maintenance are likely to be in a relatively continuous state of crisis, in which one or a few of their telomeres are critically short and either recombining and regenerating telomeric sequences or fusing and producing chromosomal abnormalities. In the present study, we hypothesized that expressing an exogenous telomerase in cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance might prevent telomeres from becoming critically short and that telomerase should thus prevent both the initiation of recombination-based elongation events and ongoing chromosomal abnormalities. We tested these predictions by expressing hTR and hTERT in the SV40 large T antigen immortalized normal human lung fibroblast cell line VA13, which uses the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance. Some clones of telomerase-expressing ALT cells exhibited homogeneous short telomeres that persisted during long-term passage. This change in telomere length represents a rapid telomere length reduction of about 500 bp/population doubling that is 10-fold faster than expected for the rates of shortening observed in normal telomerase-negative cells. In addition, characteristics associated with the ALT pathway are specifically diminished. Our results indicate that once telomerase is controlling telomere maintenance, the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance can be functionally inhibited. Telomere length was determined using TRF analysis. First, cell pellets were suspended in 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), using 30 µl/106cells. Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) and proteinase K (2 mg/ml final concentration) were added. After digestion at 55 °C for 12 h and proteinase K inactivation at 70 °C for 30 min, the samples were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA. After dialysis, 1 µg of each sample was digested with a mixture of six enzymes (AluI,CfoI, HaeI, HinfI, MspI, and RsaI) and run on a 0.7% agarose gel overnight at 70 V. The gel was denatured for 20 min in 0.5 m NaOH and 1.5m NaCl, rinsed for 10 min in distilled water, dried for 1 h at 55 °C, neutralized in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5m Tris, and hybridized with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (TTAGGG)4. After washing once with 2× SSC (1× = 0.15 m sodium chloride and 0.015 msodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 15 min at room temperature and twice (10 min each time) in 0.1× SSC + 0.1% SDS, the gel was exposed to a Phosphor screen and analyzed using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The mean TRF length was calculated using the TEL-ORUN program as described previously (25Wright W.E. Tesmer V.M. Liao M.L. Shay J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The TRAP reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Intergen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 4:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone Laboratories). To make retroviral vector particles, 30 µg of vector plasmid (pBabePurohTERT) containing the cDNA of the human telomerase catalytic protein component was transfected into the packaging cell line PhoenixE using FUGENE6 (Roche). Two days later, the supernatants from these cells were used to infect the amphotropic packaging cell line PA317. After 10 days of puromycin (3 µg/ml) selection, the supernatants of the PA317 cells were filtered and used to infect VA13 cells. After the infection, cells were selected using puromycin (750 ng/ml) for 5 days. VA13 cells were then transfected with a plasmid that allows expression of human telomerase RNA (pU1hTR), which has been described previously (26Ford L.P. Suh J.M. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9084-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After transfection and selection, the VA13 cell population that was now telomerase positive was plated at clonal density. Clones were picked, expanded, and maintained in continuous culture. VA13 cells and their clones were incubated with Colcemid (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 12 h and then harvested using trypsin. Cells were then treated with hypotonic KCl buffer (0.075 m) for 25 min at 37 °C, fixed, washed several times with methanol/acetic acid (3:1), suspended, and dropped onto slides. After washing with PBS for 15 min, slides were fixed in formaldehyde (4% in PBS) for 2 min, washed three times with PBS (5 min each time), and treated with 1 mg/ml pepsin for 8 min at 37 °C. Formaldehyde fixation and washing steps were repeated an additional time. The slides were dehydrated by a 2-min incubation in 70% ethanol, a 2-min incubation in 90% ethanol, and a 2-min incubation in 100% ethanol and air-dried. The slides were incubated with a hybridization mixture (20 µl) containing 70% formamide, 3′-Cy3-conjugated (CCCTAA)3 2′-deoxyoligonucleotide N3′-P5′ phosphoramidate probe (27Gryaznov S.M. Biochim.

The slides were then incubated for 3 h at room temperature and washed with 70% formamide, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.2) four times (15 min each time). The slides were then washed with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, and 0.05 mTris four times (5 min each time); dehydrated by a 2-min incubation in 70% ethanol, a 2-min incubation in 90% ethanol, and a 2-min incubation in 100% ethanol; air dried in the dark; mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories); and imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. For fluorescence labeling and identification of AA-PBs, 50,000 parental VA13 cells and clones 1 and 2 expressing both hTR and hTERT were grown on coverslips in a 12-well tissue culture dish. After 1–2 days in culture, the cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 5 min, and washed three times (5 min each time) with PBS. Cells were permeabilized by exposure to 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min and washed three times (5 min each time) with PBS. The cells were blocked with a solution of 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h and then incubated with mouse anti-PML and rabbit anti-hTRF2 for 1 h. The cells were then washed briefly with PBS three times and incubated with secondary antibodies (fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG) diluted in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then washed in PBS and mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Image acquisition and overlay analysis were done using a Leica confocal microscope. Cells treated with 100 µm bromodeoxyuridine for 72 h were incubated with Colcemid (15210-040; Life Technologies, Inc.) for 12 h, trypsinized, and treated with hypotonic KCl buffer (0.075m) for 25 min at 37 °C. They were then fixed and washed several times with methanol/acetic acid (3:1) until a clean white cell pellet was obtained. The pellet was suspended in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and dropped onto slides. The slides were then treated with 10−5 M Hoechst 33258 (5 µg/ml), rinsed with distilled water, and mounted in McIlvaine Buffer (pH 8.0) with a coverslip. The slides were then irradiated with a 15-watt black light at 50 °C for 15 min. The coverslips were removed, and the slides were washed with water and stained in 2% Giemsa solution in 0.01 mphosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 15 min. The slides were examined and digitally imaged on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (63×; 1.2 NA; Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective). Both hTR and the catalytic protein component of human telomerase (hTERT) were ectopically expressed in the VA13 ALT (telomerase-negative) cell line to reconstitute telomerase activity. After telomerase was reconstituted, clones were picked and expanded. Although the mixed population of telomerase-expressing VA13 cells continued to have very long telomeres, we noted a significant increase in the fraction of shorter telomeres. We thus picked individual clones to assess whether this was due to clonal variation in telomere sizes or to a greater fraction of small telomeres within individual clones. Fig. 1shows that both processes are occurring. Clones of parental telomerase-negative VA13 cells have no increase in shorter telomeres or clones that lose all long telomeric signal (Fig. 1 A). However, almost all telomerase-expressing clones exhibited an accumulation of some shorter telomeres, whereas a few clones had completely eliminated long telomeres and only contained short ones (Fig. 1 B). Clones that have lost all long telomeric signal are marked with astar. Thus, the changes in telomere length observed in VA13 cells by telomerase expression are specific. The TRAP activity for three VA13 clones expressing telomerase is shown in Fig.2A. The average telomere length declined after 40 population doublings from 25 kb to 6.2 kb for clone 1 and 2.6 kb for clone 2 (Fig. 2 B). This rate of shortening of about 500 bases/population doubling is 10-fold faster than the rate of telomere loss observed for normal human cells. This rapid loss is consistent with the observed rapid deletion of long telomeres that occurs in yeast and human cells using ALT (1Murnane J.P. Sabatier L. Marder B.A. Morgan W.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 28Li B. Lustig A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1310-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Telomeres in VA13 cells expressing human telomerase (hTel) clone 1 and clone 2 became more homogeneous in length compared with the parental VA13 telomerase-negative ALT cells. The distribution pattern of the telomere lengths observed in VA13hTel clones 1 and 2 is similar to the distributions found in most cancer or in vitro immortalized cells using telomerase to maintain telomeres. In contrast, clone 3 had significant amount of telomerase activity but still contained the long telomeric signal. Nevertheless, clone 3 does appear to have an increase in smaller telomere sequence compared with parental VA13 cells, suggesting that telomerase is functioning on chromosome ends in these cells, perhaps in competition with ALT, and may be in the process of converting to a short-telomere phenotype (see Fig. 2 B). Because the reformation of long heterogeneous telomeres was not observed (even after 100 population doublings) in clones 1 and 2 (Fig.2 C), we conclude that the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance can be functionally inhibited by the telomerase pathway once it fully controls telomere length maintenance.Figure 2Telomerase expression can lead to the inhibition of the ALT pathway. A, analysis of telomerase activity using the TRAP of VA13 parental cells and clones of VA13 expressing hTR and hTERT (VA13hTel clones 1–3). All three VA13hTel clones had ∼10-fold greater telomerase activity than the reference tumor cell line H1299. B, analysis of telomere lengths using the TRF protocol of VA13 parental cells and VA13hTel clones 1–3 that were run on a 1.0% agarose gel using a Fige Mapper (Bio-Rad). VA13 and VA13 clone 3 expressing telomerase have telomeric DNA that migrates above 19 kb, VA13hTel clone 1 has a mean telomere length of 6 kb, and VA13hTel clone 2 has a mean telomere length of 3 kb. C shows TRF analysis of serial-passaged VA13-hTel clones 1 and 2 run on a 1.0% agarose gel using a Fige Mapper (Bio-Rad) alternating from 180 V forward to 180 V backwards in decreasing intervals of 0.1–0.8 s at 14 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If telomerase were preventing telomeres from becoming critically short, one might expect a reduction in apoptosis and chromosomal instability. Apoptosis rates were determined by analyzing the presence of nuclear fragmentation by DAPI staining. The fraction of cells containing apoptotic bodies was 18% in the parental VA13 cells, 5% in VA13hTel clone 1, 8% in VA13hTel clone 2, and 6% in VA13hTel clone 3. Because apoptosis can be induced by chromosome fusions, we analyzed the chromosomes of the parental VA13 telomerase-negative cells and of VA13hTel clones 1–3. The parental VA13 cells had multiple chromosomal rearrangements including end-to-end associations, chromosomes with internal chromosomal telolomere repeat DNA, and some chromosome ends with no detectable telomeres (Fig.3, arrows; data not shown). The telomeres with no detectable telomere signals may represent terminally short telomeres that are substrates for either elongation or end-fusion events. VA13hTel clones 1–3 had no detectable end-to-end associations (see Fig. 3 B). Thus, VA13hTel clones 1–3 have decreased rates of apoptosis and greater chromosomal stability resulting from telomerase expression. We next tested whether VA13hTel clones 1–3 had AA-PBs and ECTRs. The structures containing both PML protein and telomere-binding proteins TRF1 and TRF2 as determined by overlaying composites were scored as AA-PBs. Fig. 4A shows a representative picture of a VA13 cell containing AA-PBs, in which immunofluorescence of PML protein and TRF1 and TRF2 overlap. Although VA13hTel clones 1–3 contained some AA-PBs, clones 1 and 2 showed a 20-fold reduction in the percentage of cells containing AA-PBs as compared with the parental VA13 cells (see Fig. 4 A,percentage of cells containing AA-PBs). Fig. 4 B shows a representative metaphase spread of a VA13 cell containing ECTR DNA as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (white circles). ECTR DNA was abundant in the parental VA13 cells, whereas VA13hTel clones 1–3 had significantly fewer ECTRs (Fig.4 B, see ECTR/metaphase). Clone 2, which has the shortest telomeres, showed a 50-fold reduction in the amount of ECTR DNA. Interestingly, the number of both ECTRs and AA-PBs was greater in clone 3 (which still has large telomeres) as compared with clone 1 or 2. To test whether a non-telomere-specific recombination event was affected in VA13hTel clones 1–3, we analyzed the average number of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) that occurred per chromosome. Fig.5shows a representative analysis of SCE in the parental VA13 cell. The parental VA13 and VA13hTel clones 1–3 all had an average of 0.6 exchanges/chromosome, which is a typical number for a cell that has been immortalized with SV40 T antigen (Fig.5) (29Nichols W.W. Bradt C.I. Toji L.H. Godley M. Segawa M. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 960-964PubMed Google Scholar). Blooms cells were used as a positive control in Fig. 5. This indicates that although telomerase specifically diminishes AA-PBs and ECTRs, it has not changed the recombination pathway used to exchange sister chromatid. However, because we have only analyzed mitotic recombination by determining the average number of SCEs per chromosome, we cannot assess whether other recombination pathways have been affected by the expression of telomerase.Figure 5The rate of sister chromatid exchange does not change in VA13 cells expressing telomerase. The SCEs for VA13 VA13hTel clones 1–3 were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative picture of the SCE of VA13 cells is shown. The SCEs were counted, and the average number of SCEs/chromosome is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This is the first report in human cells demonstrating that telomerase can functionally inhibit the recombination-based pathway of telomere length maintenance. We demonstrate this by expressing telomerase in a cell line that uses the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance and show that telomerase expression can specifically change telomere length and diminish additional characteristics found in cells that use the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance. The ability of telomerase to block the recombination-based pathway of telomere length regulation could be achieved in several ways. First, the telomerase ribonucleoprotein may directly sequester proteins required for the initiation of the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance. Second, telomerase may simply change the telomere structure. This change in telomere structure could be sufficient to prevent the recombination pathway of telomere maintenance from functioning. Third, telomerase may cap the ends of telomeres and prevent reinitiation of the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance (30Smith C.D. Blackburn E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We favor the hypothesis that telomerase prevents the telomeres from becoming critically short and inhibits the activation of the rapid elongation events by the recombination machinery. The progressive disappearance of overly long telomeres in turn inhibits the generation of rapid deletion events and the production of ECTRs. Interestingly, the population of ALT cells expressing telomerase can be converted to cells containing short telomeres more rapidly by growing them in 40% oxygen (data not shown). Hypoxia induces telomere breakage (31Saretzki G. Sitte N. Merkel U. Wurm R.E. von Zglinicki T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5148-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and would accelerate the loss of long telomeres. Clone 3, which had long telomeres even after 100 population doublings in 20% oxygen, developed short telomeres when grown in 40% oxygen for only 10 doublings. ECTRs are reduced upon expression of telomerase in VA13hTel clones 1–3. ECTRs may be created by the cleavage of the long telomeres during rapid deletion events, and such events may not occur in shorter telomeres. This suggests they are a byproduct of the very long telomeres generated by the ALT pathway. ECTRs have been identified in ATM−/− mouse cells, establishing that ECTRs are not uniquely present in cells using the ALT pathway of telomere length regulation (32Hande M.P. Balajee A.S. Tchirkov A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Lansdorp P.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our prediction is that ECTR DNA is produced by telomere instability. We also observed a decrease in the number of AA-PBs in VA13hTel clones 1–3. These structures contain several proteins that could be important for telomere maintenance in the ALT pathway, including TRF1, TRF2, replication factor A, Rad51, and Rad52 (24Yeager T.R. Neumann A.A. Englezou A. Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4175-4179PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins could be involved in forming new telomeres in cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance due to their associated functions; however, it is not clear whether their sequestration at PML bodies is indirect or important for the ALT pathway. The level of telomerase activity in these cells was much greater than that observed in our reference tumor cell line H1299 (Fig.2 A). In our experience, this high level of activity would normally be sufficient to elongate telomeres to greater than 10–15 kb in most cell types (33McChesney P.A. Aisner D.L. Frank B.C. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The construct we used to express hTR produces an RNA in which the integral telomerase RNA is flanked by U1 RNA sequences on both ends. We suspect that these U1 RNA sequences are interfering with the efficiency with which telomerase is recruited to act on the telomeres, so that the maintenance telomere length in clones 1 and 2 is only a few kilobases. Using constructs that produced a telomerase maintenance length that was short rather than long greatly facilitated the ability to distinguish telomeres being maintained by telomerase from the very long ALT telomeres. We demonstrate that telomerase expression in the VA13 ALT cells leads to increased chromosome stability. In cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance and some cancer cells, occasional telomeres can shorten to the point that telomere sequence can no longer be detected (1Murnane J.P. Sabatier L. Marder B.A. Morgan W.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4953-4962Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 34Fouladi B. Sabatier L. Miller D. Pottier G. Murnane J.P. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 540-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The frequency of appearance of terminally short telomeres may be one of the factors that influence the growth properties of a particular cancer cell. In the parental VA13 cells that use the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance, telomeres appear to undergo fusion-breakage-fusion cycles much more frequently compared with VA13 cells that use telomerase to maintain telomere length (Fig. 3; data not shown). The constant generation of critically short telomeres could explain the increase in cell death and chromosome abnormalities in these ALT cells. This would suggest that cancer cells using the recombination-based pathway of telomere length maintenance might not divide as fast as cancer cells using the telomerase-based pathway to maintain telomere length. Because PML bodies are thought to be DNA repair factories, the ability of telomerase to prevent telomeres from becoming critically short may be directly related to the observed reduction in AA-PBs. In conclusion, the VA13 cells that use the recombination-based pathway of telomere maintenance appear to be continuously faced with a state of crisis. The expression of telomerase prevents telomeres from becoming so short that they initiate recombination events. Once telomerase has “trapped” the bulk of the telomeres in a normal size range, the observable characteristics of ALT pathway (heterogeneous telomeres, ECTRs, AA-PBs, and genomic instability) disappear.

Many different mechanisms have been proposed for the NO synthesis reaction, but there is still no consensus of opinion. In all the mechanisms, the first step is reduction of the heme of the oxygenase domain by an electron generated by NADPH dehydrogenation in the reductase domain, followed by activation of molecular oxygen. It has also been suggested that the essential cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) donates an electron to the ferrous-dioxy intermediate (7Raman C.S. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S.

They therefore proposed a domain swap model for the structure of native iNOS. This also explains why homodimer formation is prerequisite for NOS activity. However, it was not certain that electron transfer occurs via the same mechanism in the nNOS and eNOS dimers, both of which are controlled by reversible Ca2+/CaM binding. Sequence alignment between the three NOS isoforms reveals that both nNOS and eNOS contain an extra 40–46 amino acids within their FMN binding subdomains, which are absent in iNOS. Our previous report and others demonstrated that removal of these amino acids affects the Ca2+/CaM-dependent activation of nNOS and eNOS, suggesting that they are autoinhibitory elements (14Daff S.

The heme of wild type nNOS was reduced with NADPH only in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, whereas the heme of the 40-amino acid deletion mutant (delta40) was reduced spontaneously upon addition of NADPH in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. The delta40 mutant had 10% of the activity of the wild type enzyme without Ca2+/CaM, which was increased 3-fold upon addition of Ca2+/CaM (14Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Our goal is to understand how CaM binding regulates inter-subunit/intra-subunit electron transfer to mediate heme reduction and NO formation activity in both the wild type enzyme and the delta40 mutant. In the present study, we have generated the following nNOS mutants: full-length E592A (a point mutation in the heme domain removing substrate binding capability), full-length E592Adelta40 mutant (combining the E592A mutation with deletion of 40-amino acids in the FMN binding subdomain), and the oxygenase domains of the wild type enzyme (Wildox) and the E592A mutant (E592Aox). To elucidate the route of electron transfer between the heme domain and the reductase domain in nNOS (i.e. intra- or inter-subunit), we prepared a series of heterodimers, each composed of a full-length subunit and an oxygenase domain subunit. We discuss the electron transfer routes from the reductase domain to the heme active sites in the heterodimers and the regulation of catalytic activities by Ca2+/CaM. pGroESL for expression of Escherichia coligroEL and groES proteins was kindly provided by Dr. A.

To clone Wildox containing the oxygenase domain (residues 1–720), the downstream primer used for PCR was 5′-GGTCTAGATTA(GTG)6GTTGGTGCCCTTCCACACG-3′, in which a 6xHis-tag was also attached to the C terminus of the Wildox mutant, and a stop codon and an XbaI site were included. We used the upstream primer, 5′-TGTGGAATTGTGAGC-3′, which corresponds to the sequence in the pKF19k plasmid. The desired PCR products were confirmed by sequencing using an automatic sequencer DSQ-2000L (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). cDNA fragments containing wild type and the desired mutations were cloned into NdeI and XbaI sites of the vector pCWori+ and transformed into E. colistrain BL21(DE3) for expressing most mutants and the wild type enzyme (20Sagami I.

The nNOSs were expressed in BL21 E. colicells, containing another plasmid, pGroESL, for expression of chaperone proteins (20Sagami I. Sato Y. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Then, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, δ-aminolevulinic acid, and riboflavin were added to the culture medium to make final concentrations of 0.5 mm, 0.45 mm, and 3 µm, respectively. Further incubation with mild shaking at 25 °C continued for another 20 h for the oxygenase domains or 40 h for the full-length enzymes. Full-length wild type and mutants of nNOS were purified using DEAE-TOYOPEARL, 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin-Sepharose column chromatographies as described previously (14Daff S. Sagami I.

For purification of Wildox and the other oxygenase domain mutants, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 µm H4B, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin). The E. coli cells were crushed in buffer A by sonication on ice. After centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, ammonium sulfate was added to the resulting supernatant up to 40% saturation. The precipitates were collected and then dissolved in buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 10 µm H4B, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin. The solution was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer and was applied to an Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) pre-equilibrated with buffer B containing 20 mm imidazole, 10 µmH4B, and 1 mm DTT. The column was washed with buffer B containing 20 mm imidazole. The oxygenase domain protein was eluted with buffer B containing 100 mmimidazole. After concentration, the enzyme fraction was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Before analysis, the buffers were changed to buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 5 µm H4B, and 20 µm DTT using a Sephadex G-25 column. For preparation of H4B-free enzymes, all buffers used for the purification procedure contained 1 mm β-ME instead of H4B and DTT. All purified enzymes were more than 90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The concentrations of the nNOSs were determined optically from the [Fe(II)·CO] − [Fe(II)] difference spectra using Δε444–467 nm = 55 mm−1 cm−1. This Δε value was estimated by the pyridine hemochromogen method (24Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C.Q. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A.

The full-length nNOSs and the oxygenase domain dimers were dissociated into monomers by incubation with 3 m urea in buffer C containing 1% Tween 20 and 2 mm β-ME for 1.5 h at 25 °C and then for 1 h at 0 °C. To generate heterodimers, the enzyme mixture was diluted five times with buffer C containing 1 mml-Arg, 10 µm H4B, and 1 mm DTT, and incubated at 0 °C for more than 3 h. Then the mixture was loaded on a Ni-NTA-agarose column equilibrated with buffer C containing 20 mm imidazole, 1 mml-Arg, 10 µm H4B, and 1 mm DTT. The column was washed with a 10× column volume of the equilibration buffer. The bound protein was eluted with buffer C containing 100 mm imidazole, 1 mml-Arg, 10 µm H4B, and 1 mm DTT. The eluted fraction was then applied to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer C containing 1 mml-Arg, 10 µm H4B, and 1 mm DTT. After washing with a 10× column volume of buffer C containing 1 mml-Arg, 10 µm H4B, and 1 mm DTT, the heterodimer was eluted with buffer C containing 10 mmNADPH, 1 mml-Arg, 10 µmH4B, and 1 mm DTT. To examine the dimer contents of the mutants, purified full-length NOSs and heterodimers were analyzed on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 size exclusion chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mml-Arg and connected to a fast-protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The molecular masses of the protein peaks were estimated relative to the molecular mass of standards proteins: ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and ovalbumin (43 kDa). The rate of NO formation was determined from the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, monitored at 401 nm using a methemoglobin minus oxyhemoglobin extinction coefficient of 49 mm−1 cm−1 (2Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester1996Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidation rate was determined spectrophotometrically as an absorbance decrease at 340 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1. Unless otherwise indicated, assays were carried out at 25 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 10 µm oxyhemoglobin, 0.1 mm NADPH, 5 µm each of FAD and FMN, 10 µg/ml CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 5 µm H4B, 20 µm DTT, and 0.05–0.1 µm nNOS in the presence or absence of 0.1 mml-Arg (15Siddhanta U.

Spectral experiments under aerobic conditions were carried out on a Shimadzu UV-2500 spectrophotometer maintained at 25 °C by a temperature controller. Anaerobic spectral experiments to measure heme reduction rates were conducted on a Shimadzu UV-160A spectrophotometer maintained at 15 °C in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere with an O2 concentration of less than 50 ppm. To ensure that the temperature of the solution was appropriate, the cell was incubated for 10 min prior to spectroscopic measurements. The experiments were repeated at least three times. Regression analyses were performed, and lines giving an optimum correlation coefficient were selected. Experimental errors were less than 10%. The resting Fe(III) forms of the E592A and E592Adelta40 mutants in the absence ofl-Arg and H4B had broad Soret peaks at 400 nm, indicating a mixture of high and low spin heme types (Fig.1). The position of the peak did not move upon addition of 1 mml-Arg, whereas addition of 10 µm H4B shifted the Soret peak position to 396 nm, indicating that the heme irons became mostly the high spin type. These results suggest that the mutations affected the substrate binding ability but did not change the H4B binding in terms of the absorption spectral character. Under anaerobic conditions, the addition of NADPH to E592A caused a broad decrease in absorbance between 400 and 500 nm, indicating the reduction of the bound flavins of the enzyme. In the absence of Ca2+/CaM, no further change was observed over a period of 30-min incubation (Fig. 1 A). Addition of Ca2+/CaM, however, initiated heme reduction as observed for wild type full-length nNOS and resulted in the appearance of a peak at 444 nm in the presence of CO. On the other hand, the E592Adelta40 mutant showed clear heme reduction with NADPH in the absence of Ca2+/CaM under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 1 B). The Fe(II) heme·CO complexes of both the mutants had a peak at 444 nm as observed for wild type full-length nNOS. To elucidate how much heme reduction with NADPH occurred in the absence or presence of Ca2+/CaM, we measured the absorbance change of the mutants at 444 nm with respect to time in a saturated solution of CO under anaerobic conditions. As summarized in TableI, after 30-min incubation with NADPH, heme reduction was about 30% complete in wild type nNOS and the E592A mutants in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. The rates of reduction were also slow. Note that Ca2+/CaM-independent heme reduction was observed even in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (data not shown). Addition of Ca2+/CaM to the system resulted in an increase in the reduction rate (10-fold) and the proportion of heme reduced (up to 90%). In contrast, for the delta40 and E592Adelta40 mutants, about 60–85% heme reduction occurred in the presence of NADPH and in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, with comparable rates to that of the wild type enzyme in the presence of Ca2+/CaM.Table ICatalytic activities of homodimer of wild type and the mutants in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaMCa2+/CaM1-aIn the presence (+) or absence (−) of 1 mm Ca2+ and 10 µg/ml CaM.NO formation1-bRate of conversion of oxyhemoglobin (10 µm) to methemoglobin on NO synthesis in the presence of 0.1 mm NADPH and 0.5 mm l-Arg obtained at 25 °C.NADPH oxidation1-cRate of NADPH (0.1 mm) oxidation in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm l-Arg.Heme reduction with NADPH1-dRate of heme reduction obtained at 15 °C.

Open table in a new tab NO formation activities and NADPH oxidation rates are also summarized in Table I. For the wild type enzyme, NO formation activity could only be detected in the presence of Ca2+/CaM even though some NADPH oxidation and heme reduction occurred under the same conditions in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. Addition of Ca2+/CaM is therefore a trigger for NO formation in the wild type enzyme, consistent with previous reports. In the presence ofl-Arg and Ca2+/CaM, NADPH consumption and NO formation are well coupled in the wild type enzyme. For the delta40 mutant, significant NO formation was observed in the absence of Ca2+/CaM but not as much as expected from the heme reduction rate and ratio. Addition of Ca2+/CaM increased the NO formation activity and rate of NADPH oxidation in the presence of l-Arg. Coupling between NO formation and NADPH consumption was not as efficient in the mutant even in the presence of l-Arg and Ca2+/CaM as described previously for the delta40 mutant expressed in yeast (14Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Addition ofl-Arg did not lower the NADPH consumption rates for either the wild type enzyme or the delta40 mutant in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. As expected, full-length E592A and E592Adelta40 mutants had no NO formation activities. The NADPH oxidation rates of these mutants were increased on addition of Ca2+/CaM, but were not subsequently lowered by addition of l-Arg, unlike the wild type enzyme. These results confirm that the mutants are insensitive to the substrate. We also analyzed the dimer formation ability of these mutants using fast-protein liquid chromatography gel filtration. More than 75% of each of the delta40, E592A, and E592Adelta40 mutants were eluted as dimers after incubation with 1 mml-Arg and 10 µm H4B (data not shown). To prepare heterodimers consisting of a full-length nNOS subunit and an oxygenase domain subunit with a six-histidine tag at the C terminus, we first treated the full-length dimers and oxygenase domain dimers with 3 murea. Fig. 2 shows typical gel-filtration profiles for the E592Adelta40 mutant, the Wildox mutant, and E592Adelta40/Wildox heterodimer. After urea treatment, about 30% of the E592Adelta40 was eluted as monomer, whereas only 10% of the Wildox was monomeric. Similarly, the monomeric forms of the other full-length nNOSs (wild type, E592A, and delta40) were obtained more easily than those of the corresponding oxygenase domain proteins. The monomer proportions were not increased even when the dimers were treated with higher concentrations of urea for longer time periods. More severe conditions destroyed the NOS proteins. After renaturation by 10× dilution and incubation with buffer containing H4B and l-Arg, each heterodimer was separated and purified from the homodimers and the monomers by sequential chromatographies. Namely, at first, we isolated the enzyme fractions containing histidine tags (i.e. containing oxygenase domain subunits) using Ni-NTA column chromatography. We then isolated the enzymes containing NADPH binding sites (i.e. containing full-length subunits) using a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column chromatography. Consequently, only heterodimers containing a full-length nNOS subunit and an oxygenase domain subunit are retained. The Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)·CO complexes of the heterodimers had similar spectra to those of the wild type enzyme. In the spectra of the Fe(II)·CO complexes, no absorption band at around 420 nm ascribed to the denatured complex, P420, was observed (as discussed later in Fig. 5), confirming that the heme domains were not altered by these treatments.Figure 5A, absorption spectral changes of the delta40/E592Aox heterodimer.

Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Activation of protein kinase A in HeLa cells increases PTP1B activity severalfold. The epidermal growth factor receptor also phosphorylates PTP1B, on a tyrosine kinase substrate motif flanking Tyr-66 (24Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), although the consequences of this phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on enzymatic activity is poorly understood. Studies of the regulation of PTP1B have been confined largely to cells in culture; little is known of its regulation in vivo. Herein we report on the regulation of PTP1B activity by insulinin vivo using a mouse model. The data clearly demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of PTP1B in fat and skeletal muscle in response to challenge with insulin. This insulin-sensitive response is rapid and accompanied by an increase in phosphotyrosine content and a modest decline in phosphoserine content. Elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels increases PTP1B activity. Suppression of cyclic AMP levels or inhibition of protein kinase A reduces PTP1B activity. FVB mice were used in these studies. All animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at SUNY/Stony Brook. Mice were maintained on a normal light/day cycle. The mice used in these experiments were 8–16 weeks of age, with no age-related differences observed in the parameters measured. Four-month-old FVB mice were fed ad libitum and maintained on normal light/dark cycles. During the evening prior to experiments, mice were allowed access to drinking water only. Experiments were routinely conducted between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. Mice were anesthetized and insulin (160 units/kg), isoproterenol (2.0 µg/kg), or forskolin (10 mg/kg) was administered via intravenous injection as described previously (25Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chemi. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Control mice received injections with vehicle alone. Mice were administered with insulin as described, and epididymal white fat and hind limb skeletal muscle were removed at the times indicated. The fat and skeletal muscle samples were immediately homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (130 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 60 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies to the following antigens employed in these studies were obtained from the indicated sources: PTP1B (product P18020 from Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA); anti-P-Tyr antibodies (product SC-7020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phosphoserine antibodies (product 61-8100, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The immune complexes were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the chemiluminescence reagent, and brief autoradiography of Kodak X-Omat film. Mice were administered with insulin as described above, and epididymal white fat and hind limb skeletal muscle were removed at the times indicated. The fat and skeletal muscle biopsies were immediately homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (130 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (25Moxham C.M. Tabrizchi A. Davis R.J. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chemi. 1996; 271: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After 60 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. An aliquot (1 mg of protein) of the clarified lysate was resuspended to 0.5 ml in the same tissue lysis buffer and incubated with 1 µg of anti-PTP1B antibody at 4 °C for 2 h with constant rotation. Then, 10 µl of Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and then washed twice with PTP1B assay buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)). The phosphatase activity of the immobilized PTP1B was assayed as follows: either PTP1B or mouse IgG immobilized on protein-A beads was resuspended in 50 µl to assay buffer. The reaction mixture (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 nm32P-labeled substrate Raytide) was then added to a final volume of 80 µl and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated, and the 32P released was quantified by a charcoal binding assay as described previously (26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Tsai A.Y. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8698-8702Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide Raytide (Oncogene Science) was phosphorylated at its unique tyrosine residue, by following the manufacturer's instructions. Adipocytes were released from epididymal fat pads of male FVB mice by digestion for 30 min at 37 °C in KRB buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mmKCl, 2.6 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 mmd-glucose, 3% BSA) with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Calbiochem). Adipocytes were washed twice in KRB buffer without collagenase and twice in HBM buffer containing 0.1 mm cyclic AMP-PDE inhibitor (Ro-20-1724) and 10 mm NaF. Adipocytes were then incubated in either the absence or the presence of 50 µm forskolin or 20 µm 8-CPT-cAMP at 37 °C for 15 min, then stopped with a 300-µl aliquot of lysis buffer. FVB mice were anesthetized deeply and administered insulin as a bolus, directly to the vena cava. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B was immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from fat and skeletal muscle sampled in the mice following a challenge with insulin, and PTP1B activity was measured using the radiolabeled, phosphorylated Raytide substrate, highly specific for PTP1B (Fig.1). Insulin administration in vivo stimulated a sharp, transient decline in the activity of fat PTP1B (Fig. 1 A). The activity of PTP1B declined by 60–70% in fat tissue within 15 min of administration and recovered to normal, basal levels within 60 min of the challenge with insulin. The decline in PTP1B was maximal at 15 min, as sampling at earlier times displayed a lesser decline (not shown). Analysis of the PTP1B regulation by insulin in skeletal, hind muscle yielded similar results,i.e. insulin stimulates a decline in PTP1B activity, albeit a more modest decline (Fig. 1 B). To address the nature of the change in PTP1B that accompanies the decline in activity in response to insulin, fat and skeletal muscle were sampled and the tissue extracts were used to examine the phosphotyrosine content of PTP1B via immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. In fat tissue extracts from insulin-treated mice, the amount of phosphotyrosine content in PTP1B increased about 2-fold (Fig.2 A). The increase in PTP1B tyrosine phosphorylation peaked at 15 min after challenge with insulin, declining thereafter to near normal, basal levels within 60 min. The amount of PTP1B protein itself was not influenced by insulin treatment in vivo, over this time period. The changes in PTP1B activity (decreases) and those of phosphotyrosine content (increases) appear to correlate (compare Figs. 1 and 2). Sampling of PTP1B was also performed in skeletal muscle from mice prior to and following administration of insulin in vivo (Fig.2 B). The time courses in skeletal muscle for tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B in response to insulin administration were very similar to those in fat tissue. The relative increase in the amount of phosphotyrosine content in the PTP1B in response to insulin was routinely observed to be greater in the skeletal muscle than in the fat tissue. In acutely prepared mouse adipocytes, treatment with the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor tryphostin AG1024 resulted in a complete loss of insulin-stimulated inhibition of PTP1B activity (Fig. 3) and abolition of the insulin-stimulated increase in PTP1B phosphotyrosine content (data not shown).Figure 3The activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B is decreased in adipocytes treated with insulin: reversal by the insulin receptor kinase inhibitor tryphostin AG1024. Mice adipocytes were challenged with either insulin (100 nm) alone or insulin in combination with the tryphostin AG1024 (10 µm) for 15 min in vitro. Whole-cell extracts of adipocytes were prepared, and immunoprecipitates of PTP1B were subjected to direct assay of activity using the Raytide-labeled substrate. The data in the bar graph are mean values ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Changes in serine phosphorylation have been reported to alter the activity of PTP1B (23Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We probed if the action of insulin modified phosphoserine content as well as phosphotyrosine content of PTP1B. Using the peak response at 15 min following insulin administrationin vivo, the phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine content of PTP1B was sampled in fat and skeletal muscle (Fig.4). Phosphotyrosine content increased significantly in response to the challenge with insulin at 15 min. The amount of phosphoserine content of PTP1B declined <20% in the samples prepared from fat tissue (Fig. 4 A). The same results were obtained in the skeletal, hind muscle of the animals following insulin administration (Fig. 4 B). For insulin action in vivo it seems clear that the decline in PTP1B activity in response to insulin can be explained by the sharp increase in phosphotyrosine content coupled with a much more modest decrease in phosphoserine content in PTP1B. Serine phosphorylation of PTP1B in cultured cells has been reported to lead to either no change or increased PTP1B activity, whereas no such studies have been conducted in vivo. The effects of elevating intracellular cyclic AMP on PTP1B activity and serine phosphorylation were examined in vivo (Fig.5). The administration of the diterpene activator of adenylyl cyclase forskolin to mice resulted in a sharp increase in cyclic AMP accumulation (not shown). Activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin was accompanied by a sharp increase in phosphoserine content of PTP1B in fat (Fig. 5 A) and skeletal muscle (Fig. 5 B). The increased serine phosphorylation was accompanied by an increase in the activity of PTP1B (Fig.5 C). Interestingly, forskolin treatment was found to reduce the amount of phosphotyrosine in fat and skeletal muscle PTP1B by ∼50% (Fig. 5, A and B). To complete the study of the regulation of PTP1B activity and phosphorylation, we made use of agents that can ready alter intracellular cyclic AMP levels and white fat adipocytes prepared acutely from these FVB mice (Fig. 6). Treating mouse adipocytes with either forskolin or with a water-soluble, hydrolysis-resistant form of cyclic AMP (cyclophenylthio-cyclic AMP, CPT-cyclic AMP) resulted in an increased PTP1B activity (Fig. 6 A) and serine phosphorylation (Fig.6 B). Phosphoserine content of PTP1B increased more than 1-fold over basal levels in response to either forskolin or CPT-cyclic AMP at 15 min (Fig. 6 A). The phosphotyrosine content of PTP1B, in contrast, declined in response to challenge with either agent by 25–40%. These data suggest that elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels, and presumably activation of protein kinase A, leads to increased serine phosphorylation of PTP1B, while catalyzing a decline in phosphotyrosine content. We explored the effects of reducing input from cyclic AMP by inhibition of protein kinase A with KT5720 and suppression of cyclic AMP levels directly with 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (Fig.7). To test whether or not the effects on PTP1B phosphorylation were dependent upon activation of protein kinase A, we examined the effects of treatment with the protein kinase inhibitor KT5720 on the activity (Fig. 7 A) and phosphorylation state (Fig. 7 B) of PTP1B. KT5720 treatment for 15 min alone led to a decline in the activity and phosphoserine content of PTP1B, much like that obtained in response to 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine, a potent inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase. Experiments, in which cyclic AMP levels were reduced with 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine, demonstrated a decrease in PTP1B activity (Fig.7 A) and in the phosphoserine content of PTP1B, while phosphotyrosine content increased (Fig. 7 B). As was noted with suppression of cyclic AMP levels with the adenosine analogue, PTP1B phosphotyrosine content declined while phosphoserine content increased. These data suggest that either via a suppression of cyclic AMP levels or by the inhibition of protein kinase A, the phosphoserine content of PTP1B is reduced by ∼50%, while phosphotyrosine content increased 2-fold. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B has been implicated as a negative regulator on tyrosine kinase action (24Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), including insulin signaling (27Egawa K. Maegawa H. Shimizu S. Morino K. Nishio Y. Bryer-Ash M. Cheung A.T. Kolls J.K. Kikkawa R.

Ramachandran C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and obesity (14Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), although declines in skeletal muscle PTP1B have been reported in patients with diabetes with insulin resistance (12Kusari J. Kenner K.A. Suh K.I. Hill D.E. Henry R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has been shown for mice with targeted deficiency of the heterotrimeric G-protein Gαi2 (28Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Science. 1993; 260: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and frank insulin resistance that PTP1B expression is increased (29Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the PTP1B gene (PTP1B−/−) demonstrate increased insulin sensitivity and resistance to obesity (30Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Little is known about the extent to which tyrosine kinases may regulate PTP1B expression or activity. PTP1B can be phosphorylated by the activated epidermal growth factor receptor (24Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Studies using cells in culture clearly demonstrate that PTP1B is a substrate for phosphorylation on both serine (21Schievella A.R. Paige L.A. Johnson K.A. Hill D.E. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 239-246PubMed Google Scholar) and tyrosine (24Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) residues. Whether or not PTP1B is a target for phosphorylation by protein kinasesin vivo was the hypothesis tested in the current work. Challenging mice with insulin leads to a rapid and marked decline in PTP1B activity in two insulin-sensitive tissues, fat and skeletal muscle. Treatment with AG1024 blocks insulin-stimulated inhibition of PTP1B and PTP1B phosphotyrosine content. Insulin stimulation dose not alter the abundance of this protein-tyrosine phosphatase. The decline in PTP1B activity is accompanied by an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B in response to insulin stimulationin vivo. Insulin stimulates a sharp increase in the amount of PTP1B phosphotyrosine, whereas the phosphoserine content of PTP1B displayed a modest decline. Although the tyrosine residue(s) on PTP1B phosphorylated in response to insulin have not been defined, an FENSYMCM motif in the C-terminal domain of the molecule, in close proximity to the active site, seems a likely candidate. Increased phosphoserine content of PTP1B was stimulated in response to the elevation of cyclic AMP in vivo. This confirms earlier studies on the serine phosphorylation of PTP1B in HeLa cells in response to elevated cyclic AMP and a study showing that phosphorylation of PTP1B regulates its activity (23Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The increase in the amount of phosphoserine in PTP1B assayed in vivo was accompanied by an increase in the level of PTP1B activity. When examined in adipocytes acutely prepared from mice, PTP1B activity also was found to be increased by elevation of cyclic AMP levels by treatment with the diterpene activator of adenylyl cyclase forskolin as well as by addition of CPT-cyclic AMP directly to the adipocytes medium. The increases in phosphoserine content in PTP1B in response to elevated cyclic AMP was accompanied by a modest decline in phosphotyrosine content. PTP1B serine phosphorylation and activity of PTP1B was reduced by inhibition of protein kinase A, suggesting a critical role for not only insulin, but also protein kinase A in the regulation of PTP1B (23Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PTP1B by protein kinase C has been reported (23Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,31Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F. Franza B.R. Hill D.E. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), although the effects of this serine/threonine phosphorylation on activity remains controversial (31Flint A.J. Gebbink M.F. Franza B.R. Hill D.E. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1937-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Reducing the level of intracellular cyclic AMP with 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine resulted in a decline in PTP1B activity. PTP1B displays a canonical site (LRRLSTK) for protein kinase A, which appears to allosterically increase enzymatic activity when phosphorylated. The active site of the PTP1B is contained in the C-terminal region of the molecule, within residues 229–241 (IHCSAGCGRTGAI) (32Hoppe E. Berne P.F. Stock D. Rasmussen J.S. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Su X.D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, protein kinase A attenuates insulin receptor kinase activity (34Stadtmauer L. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3402-3407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decline in phosphotyrosine content of PTP1B in response to elevated cyclic AMP noted here may reflect protein kinase A-stimulated loss of insulin receptor kinase activity. Declines in cyclic AMP levels provoke a decline in PTP1B activity and would be expected to enhance insulin signaling. The PTP1B-deficient mice display enhanced insulin signaling (30Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Gαi2inhibits adenylyl cyclase, lowers intracellular cyclic AMP, and would be expected to reduce PTP1B and thereby enhance insulin signaling. Expression of a GTPase-deficient, constitutively active mutant of Gαi2 does, in fact, lead to reduced cyclic AMP levels and enhanced glucose tolerance in transgenic mice (35Chen J.F. Guo J.H. Moxham C.M. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The increased levels of cyclic AMP observed in transgenic mice with targeted loss of Gαi2 in fat and skeletal muscle (36Moxham C.M. Hod Y. Malbon C.C. Dev. Genet. 1993; 14: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), likewise, lead to elevated levels of PTP1B and insulin resistance (29Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The disruption of the PTP1B gene, in contrast, leads to enhanced insulin sensitivity and resistance to obesity. Thus, elevation of cyclic AMP provokes increased serine phosphorylation and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP1B and consequent increased activity, whereas treatment with insulin leads to an increased phosphotyrosine content of PTP1B and reduced activity. A simple model for the regulation of PTP1B is shown (Fig.8). According to the model, activation of protein kinase A leads to increased serine phosphorylation and activity of PTP1B, which counter-regulates insulin signaling. Stimulation of insulin, in contrast, leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibition of PTP1B, which enhances insulin signaling. PTP1B activity appears to be a critical point in reinforcing insulin responses at a point downstream of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. PTP1B acts as a point of counter-regulation of insulin action by agents such as catecholamines, which elevate cyclic AMP and activate both protein kinase A and PTP1B.

In the present study we show that phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1, PS-PLA1, stimulates histamine release from RPMC through production of 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS in the presence of FcεRI cross-linker. The potency of 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS was almost equal to that of 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS. A catalytically inactive PS-PLA1, in which an active serine residue (Ser166) was replaced with an alanine residue did not show such activity. sPLA2-IIA, another secretory PLA2 that is capable of producing lyso-PSin vitro, was also a poor histamine inducer against RPMC. PS-PLA1 significantly stimulated histamine release from crude RPMC, indicating that lyso-PS is mainly derived from cells other than mast cells. In agreement with this phenomenon, the enzyme stimulated the histamine release more efficiently when RPMC were mixed with apoptotic Jurkat cells. Under these conditions, lyso-PS with unsaturated fatty acid was released from the apoptotic cells treated with PS-PLA1. Finally, heparin, which has affinity for PS-PLA1, completely blocked the stimulatory effect of the enzyme.

Lyso-PS is ∼1,000 times more active at inducing this response than PS (2Martin T.W. Lagunoff D. Nature. 1979; 279: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Smith G.A. Hesketh T.R.

In addition, lyso-PS, like other lysophospholipid mediators such as lysophosphatidic acid, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine, induces a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in several cell lines including Jurkat cells (8Xu Y. Casey G. Mills G.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and ovarian cancer cells (9Xu Y. Fang X.J. Casey G. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although lyso-PS (1-acyl-2-lyso-PS) is thought to be produced from PS by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) reaction (10Mietto L. Boarato E. Toffano G. Bruni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 930: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the physiological role of lyso-PS is unclear as the enzyme involved in lyso-PS production has not been fully elucidated. Recently, PS-specific PLA1, which was first discovered in the culture medium of activated rat platelets, has been purified and cloned (11Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This secretory enzyme, called PS-PLA1, belongs structurally to a lipase family and acts specifically on PS, hydrolyzing fatty acid from the sn-1 position to produce 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS, another lyso-PS that has not been fully characterized (11Sato T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11053-11059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PS appears to be the only phospholipid that is hydrolyzed by this enzyme, although we do not know what type of membrane is a target of the enzyme. PS-PLA1 does not hydrolyze phosphatidyl-d-serine, an optical isomer of phosphatidyl-l-serine. Thus it is reasonable to assume that 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS has the same activity as 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS and that PS-PLA1 is involved in mast cell activation by producing 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS, although its function has not been characterized yet. Another secretory phospholipase A that may have an ability to produce lyso-PS is group IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) (15Komada M. Kudo I. Mizushima H. Kitamura N. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,16Seilhamer J.J. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Plant S. Miller J.A. Kloss J. Johnson L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5335-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like PS-PLA1, sPLA2-IIA was first identified in culture supernatants from activated rat platelets (17Horigome K. Hayakawa M. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This enzyme is often detected at various sites of inflammation and has been implicated in the inflammation process and eicosanoid production (18Kudo I. Chang H.W. Hara S. Murakami M. Inoue K. Dermatologia (Basel). 1989; 1: 72-76Crossref Google Scholar, 19Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 20Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Atsumi G. Inoue K. Kudo I. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, this enzyme is able to produce 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS from PS, although it also hydrolyzes other phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. In this study, the role of two phospholipase As, PS-PLA1and sPLA2-IIA, in the mast cell activation was investigated. The results indicate that PS-PLA1 is indeed capable of producing lyso-PS from intact membranes and is involved in mast cell activation. Our findings indicate that PS-PLA1plays a key role in the production of bioactive lysophospholipid, lyso-PS. Bovine brain PS and di-oleoyl PS were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and Rhizopus delemar lipase was obtained from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). The rat monoclonal anti-2,4-dinitrophenylatedAscaris (DNP-As) IgE antibody (21Hara K. Komatsu H. Tsutsumi N. Ujiie A. Ikeda S. Kobayashi T. Kudo I. Inoue K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1994; 17: 1121-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and DNP-As (22Katayama S. Shionoya H. Ohtake S. Microbiol. Immunol. 1978; 22: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) were kind donated by Dr. Kiyoto Hara (Kissei Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Nagano, Japan). Anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody (CH-11) was purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. RPMC from the peritoneal cavity of male Wistar rats, weighing 200–250 g, were purified with Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (23Suzuki-Nishimura T. Nagaya K. Matsuda K. Uchida M.K. Aoki J. Umeda M. Inoue K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 57: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified RPMC were suspended in HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 12 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm dextrose, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). The purity of the RPMC in the final preparation was >95%, as estimated by toluidine blue staining. We used the cells recovered from the peritoneal cavity as “crude RPMC.” Using Wright-Giemsa staining we confirmed that the crude peritoneal cells (about 2 × 107 cells per rat) consisted mainly of mononuclear leukocytes (macrophages and monocytes) with a minor population of other cells such as mast cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils). The ratio of mononuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and other cells was typically 94:1:5. Thus in the crude RPMC preparation there are about 20 times as many other cells as mast cells. Human Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. To induce apoptosis, the cells were incubated with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (CH-11, 20 ng/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. In the co-culture system, we mixed 1 × 104 of purified RPMC and 2 × 105 Jurkat cells. PS exposure was measured by the binding of FITC-labeled annexin V using the Annexin V-FITC Kit (Immunotech). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells (apoptotic cells or rat peritoneal cells) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 495 µl of binding buffer. Annexin V-FITC (5 µl) was added to the suspension and incubated for 10 min on ice in the dark. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The RPMC were washed once, suspended at a cell density of 5 × 104 RPMC/ml (in 0.2 ml) in HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution and sensitized with 10 µg/ml monoclonal IgE anti-DNP-As for 30 min at 37 °C. After two washes in HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution, the cells were stimulated with 60 µg/ml DNP-As at 37 °C in the presence of lyso-PS or recombinant PS-PLA1. After 15 min, 1.2 ml of ice-cold HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution was added to terminate the reaction, and the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Histamine in the supernatant was determined by the fluorometric assay of Shore et al. (24Shore P. Burkhalter A. Chon V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1956; 127: 182-186Google Scholar). Histamine release was calculated as a percentage of the total cell content. Values for histamine release are presented as the means ± S.E. for several replicate experiments on different samples of pooled cells. Spontaneous histamine release in the absence of compounds was 3.4 ± 3.3%. In some cases, concanavalin A (ConA; 100 µg/ml), which is known to cross-link the FcεRI receptor, was used to prime the RPMC instead of IgE-antigen. HEPES-buffered Tyrode solution used in this study contains 0.01% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Albumin is an essential factor in the assay system to evaluate lyso-PS activity, although high concentration (>1%) affected the activity (data not shown). We determined optimal concentration of bovine serum albumin to be a range from 0.01 to 0.1% and used 0.01% in this study (data not shown). Diacyl-PS (5 µmol) was incubated with R. delemar lipase (20 mg/ml; Seikagaku-kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) or phospholipase A2 (from porcine pancreas, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm Tris malate buffer, pH 5.7, in the presence of 0.25 volume of diethyl ether, at 37 °C for 2 h. After extraction of free fatty acids with diethyl ether/petroleum ether (1:1; v:v), four times, the remaining lyso-PS was extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.C. Dyer W.F. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42871) Google Scholar) and used as 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS. The 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS was stored at −80 °C in chloroform/methanol (2:1; v:v) and used within 24 h to avoid fatty acid migration (26Pluckthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat PS-PLA1 was prepared as described previously (11Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly Sf9 cells (8 × 105 cells/ml) in a spinner flask were infected with recombinant rat PS-PLA1 baculovirus (multiplicity of infection = 10) and incubated for 96 h at 27 °C. The proteins were purified from the culture supernatant of the infected cells by sequential passages through a DEAE ion exchange column, a heparin-Sepharose column, and a blue Sepharose column as described previously (11Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Approximately 400 µg of recombinant PS-PLA1 was recovered from 1 liter of infected culture fluid. The specific activity of purified recombinant PS-PLA1 was 2.8 nmol/min·µg of protein for PS. PS-PLA1 belongs to the lipase family, and alignment of amino acid sequences of PS-PLA1 with other members of the lipase family, such as lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase, indicated that Ser166 is important for the activity of the enzyme (11Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Catalytically inactive mutant PS-PLA1, in which the active serine residue is replaced with an Ala residue, was produced as follows: two oligonucleotides, 5′-GGGGGGAATTCATGTGTCCTGGCCTCTGGGGGACA-3′ (nucleotide positions 124 of rat PS-PLA1 cDNA (11Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)) and 5′-GAGCCCCCAGAGCGACACCAATGA-3′ (nucleotide positions 485–508 of rat PS-PLA1 cDNA), were used as primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to introduce a mutation. The amplified PCR product and oligonucleotide, CCCCCAAGCTTCTACACACAGGCCATTTTCAGGTC (nucleotide positions 1348–1371 of rat PS-PLA1), were then used as primers for a second PCR. The resulting PCR product was introduced into EcoRI/HindIII sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pFASTBAC1 plasmid (Invitrogen), and production of recombinant baculovirus was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bac-to-Bac system). The mutant PS-PLA1proteins were expressed and purified as described above. sPLA2-IIA protein was purified from culture medium of activated rat platelets as described previously (17Horigome K. Hayakawa M. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The specific activity of purified sPLA2-IIA was 32 nmol/min·µg of protein. Rat PS-PLA1 cDNA (encoding amino acids Val27–Val456) was ligated into theBamHI/HindIII sites of the pET21c vector (pET system, Novagen). After the plasmid had been introduced intoEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Rat PS-PLA1 polypeptides were recovered in the insoluble fraction. The cell pellet was sonicated for 20 min on ice using a tip-type sonicator. After sonication, protein was recovered by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. The insoluble pellet was dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer and subjected to 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the corresponding protein band was excised and mixed with Freund's adjuvant. BALB/c mice were immunized with the protein, and monoclonal antibodies were produced using the PAI myeloma cell line. Eight monoclonal antibody-producing hybridoma cell lines (clones 7F10, 8H7, 10G4, 12B12, 12D9, 15D12, 16F1, and 20D4) were established. In this study, monoclonal antibody from clone 15D12 (mouse IgG1) was used for Western blotting. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters using the Bio-Rad protein transfer system. The filters were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, incubated with anti-rat PS-PLA1 monoclonal antibodies (ascites prepared from clone 15D12, diluted 1:1000) in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skimmed milk and 0.05% Tween 20, and then treated with anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase. Proteins bound to the antibodies were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Apoptotic human Jurkat T cells (2.3 × 108 cells) or rat peritoneal cells (2.4 × 108 cells in the presence of ConA (100 µg/ml)) were incubated with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in the presence or absence of recombinant PS-PLA1 (1.8 µg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Phospholipids in the cell supernatants were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.C. Dyer W.F. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42871) Google Scholar) at acidic pH (2.5). Under these conditions, acidic lysophospholipids such as lyso-PS and lysophosphatidic acid were recovered from the organic phase. The extracted lipids were dried, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1), and used for a functional bioassay and mass spectrometry analysis. The recovery of lipids was monitored by adding a trace amount of 1-[14C]oleoyl-lyso-PS to the samples. Under these conditions, recovery of 1-[14C]oleoyl-lyso-PS was always >95%. Lipid extracts from the cell culture supernatant were analyzed with a Quattro II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with an electrospray ion source (ESI) as described previously (27Taguchi R. Hayakawa J. Takeuchi Y. Ishida M. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 953-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Aliquots (2 µl) of samples (100–200 pmol/µl) dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1) were introduced by means of a flow injector into the ESI chamber at a flow rate of 2 µl/min. The eluting solvent used was acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:3:1) containing 0.1% ammonium formate, pH 6.4. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive and negative ion modes. Nitrogen gas at a temperature of 80 °C and a flow rate of 12 liter/min was used for drying. In most cases, the capillary voltage was set at 3.7 kV, and the cone voltage was set at 30 V, both in the positive and negative ion modes. For MS/MS experiments, 3–4 × 10−4 torr of argon was used as the collision gas, and a collision energy of 30–40 V was used for obtaining fragment ions for precursor ions. The ability of 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS to stimulate antigen-dependent mast cell activation was determined. Purified RPMC primed with anti-DNP monoclonal IgE were incubated with DNP-As in the presence of lyso-PS. Like 1-oleoyl-2-lyso-PS, 2-oleoyl-1-lyso-PS was able to stimulate histamine release from IgE-antigen-stimulated mast cells (Fig.1 A). The dose-dependent curve showed that 2-oleoyl-1-lyso-PS was as potent as 1-oleoyl-2-lyso-PS at stimulating histamine release. Neither lyso-PS was able to enhance histamine release in the absence of antigen. Similar results were obtained when ConA was used instead of IgE-antigen complexes (Fig. 1 B). 2-Acyl-1-lyso-PS and 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS were also prepared from bovine brain-derived PS, with different acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions. The activity of these lyso-PS was almost identical to that of 2-oleoyl-1-lyso-PS (data not shown), indicating that the fatty acid moiety does not affect the activity of lyso-PS. It is generally accepted that the acyl chain at the sn-2 position of 2-acyl-lysophospholipids easily migrates to the sn-1 position, resulting in production of 1-acyl-lysophospholipids (26Pluckthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine whether 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS is really active against mast cells, ConA-primed mast cells were incubated with PS liposomes for 15 min in the presence or absence of PS-PLA1, and histamine release from the cells was determined. PS is known to stimulate mast cell activation at a concentration above 2 × 10−5m. However, at lower concentrations, PS alone was unable to stimulate histamine release from ConA-primed RPMC. As shown in Fig.2, PS stimulates histamine release from RPMC only in the presence of recombinant PS-PLA1 in a dose-dependent manner. This shows that the 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS produced from PS by PS-PLA1 is active against RPMC, since the migration of the acyl chain takes several hours (26Pluckthun A. Dennis E.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Figure 2Dose-response curve showing effect of PS-PLA1 on ConA-stimulated histamine release from RPMC in the presence of PS liposomes. Purified RPMC (1 × 104) were incubated for 15 min with 100 µg/ml of ConA, and various concentrations of PS liposomes, in the presence (1 µg/ml) (closed circles) or absence (open circles) of PS-PLA1. Histamine release is expressed as percent of the total cell histamine, and values are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we examined the effect of recombinant PS-PLA1 on histamine release from IgE-antigen-stimulated mast cells in the absence of PS liposomes. As shown in Fig. 3, when the purified RPMC, which were pretreated with anti-DNP monoclonal IgE, were incubated with DNP-As in the presence of recombinant PS-PLA1 (5 µg/ml), the amount of histamine released increased. A similar result was obtained when ConA was used instead of IgE-antigen for FcεRI cross-linking (Fig. 3). PS-PLA1alone did not show such an activity. This result suggests that lyso-PS is produced from PS on the RPMC membrane by PS-PLA1. When we analyzed the crude RPMC, we found that they contain many cells other than mast cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, it is possible that lyso-PS is produced from PS not only on mast cells but also on the other cells that reside near the mast cells. To test this possibility, we first used co-culture system in which purified RPMC were mixed with apoptotic cells. PS is located mainly in the inner leaflet of lipid bilayers in normal cells. Thus, the accessibility of PS-PLA1 to the substrate on the plasma membrane seems to be limited. It is generally accepted that PS appears on the cell surface in apoptotic cells or cytokine-activated cells. As shown in Fig.4 C, exposure of PS is limited in normal Jurkat cells, but it is evident in apoptotic (anti-Fas antibody-treated) Jurkat cells. When the purified RPMC were mixed with apoptotic Jurkat cells, the ability of PS-PLA1 to stimulate histamine release from the mast cells increased significantly (Fig.4 A). These results clearly indicate that PS-PLA1hydrolyzes PS exposed on apoptotic cells and produces lyso-PS. Next, we used crude RPMC instead of purified RPMC and subjected them to a histamine assay in the presence of ConA and PS-PLA1. Exposure of PS was limited in crude RPMC population but was enhanced after cells were treated with ConA (Fig. 4 D). As shown in Fig. 4 B, when the crude mast cells were used, the ability of PS-PLA1 to stimulate ConA-induced histamine release from RPMC increased significantly. The crude mast cell preparation consisted mainly of mononuclear leukocytes (macrophages and monocytes) with a minor population of other cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) (see “Experimental Procedures”), and together they were about 20 times more numerous than RPMC. Thus again in this system it was shown that PS-PLA1 efficiently stimulates FcεRI-dependent histamine release from RPMC in the presence of PS-exposing cells. It was also shown that a catalytically inactive mutant PS-PLA1 has no enzyme activity (Fig.5 A) and is unable to stimulate histamine release from RPMC (Fig. 5 B). This result confirmed that catalytic activity of PS-PLA1 is required to enhance histamine release from RPMC. All these data strongly indicate that PS-PLA1 can hydrolyze PS efficiently when it appears on the surface of apoptotic cells and that lyso-PS is actually derived from cells surrounding mast cells in vivo.Figure 4PS-PLA1 effectively stimulated histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells in the presence of apoptotic cells or non-mast cells. A, purified RPMC (1 × 104) were incubated for 15 min with ConA (100 µg/ml), in the presence or absence of PS-PLA1 (400 ng/ml), or in the presence of Jurkat cells (2 × 105), which were pretreated with anti-Fas antibodies 4 h prior to the experiments to induce apoptosis. Histamine release is expressed as percent of the total cell histamine, and values are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. B, purified (open circles) or crude (closed circles) RPMC (1 × 104) were incubated for 15 min with ConA (100 µg/ml) in the presence of PS-PLA1. The dose-response curve for PS-PLA1 is shown. Histamine release is expressed as percent of the total cell histamine, and values are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. C andD, exposure of PS on the surface of apoptotic Jurkat cells (C) and rat peritoneal cells (D) was determined by FITC-annexin V binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results show a representative experiment from at least three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Catalytic activity is required for stimulation of histamine release from RPMC. A, Ser166 → Ala mutant PS-PLA1 did not show catalytic activity. The PS hydrolyzing activity of Ser166→ Ala mutant PS-PLA1 was measured using 1-[14C]acyl-2-lyso-PS as the substrate, as described previously (11Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Values are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. The amount of PS-PLA1 added in each assay was measured by Western blotting and is shown in the inset. B, catalytic activity of PS-PLA1 was required for stimulation of histamine release. Crude RPMC (1 × 104) were incubated for 15 min with ConA (100 µg/ml) and wild-type PS-PLA1 (lane 1) or Ser166→ Ala mutant PS-PLA1 (lane 2) (1 µg/ml each). Histamine release is expressed as percent of the total cell histamine, and values are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further examined whether lyso-PS itself is actually produced by PS-PLA1 from the cell membranes. As shown in Fig.6 B, the ability of the cell supernatant from the apoptotic cells to stimulate ConA-induced histamine release from RPMC was greatly enhanced when the apoptotic cells or crude RPMC were treated with PS-PLA1. From the standard curve of lyso-PS (Fig. 6 A), it is estimated that ∼8 nmol or the equivalent of lyso-PS was recovered from 2.3 × 108 cells. This corresponds to 4% of the total PS of the cells (data not shown). Lipids in the cell supernatant were further analyzed by ESI-MS. In good agreement with the activity data (Fig.6 B), signals with m/z values of 522.4, and 494.3, which correspond to lyso-PS with oleic acid (18:1, m/z522.4), and palmitoleic acid (16:1, m/z 494.3), respectively, were detected in the lipid fraction from supernatant of apoptotic Jurkat T cells (Fig. 6 C) and crude RPMC (ConA-treated, Fig. 6 G) incubated with PS-PLA1. The identity of the peak (m/z 522.4) as 18:1-lyso-PS was confirmed by MS/MS analysis of the daughter ions (data not shown). The signals were not detected in the absence of PS-PLA1treatment (Fig. 6, D and H). Interestingly the lipids were detected almost exclusively in the cell supernatant and not in the cell fraction (Fig. 6, E and I). It can be concluded that the lyso-PS detected is 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS, since acyl chains at the sn-2 position of phospholipids are rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Like other lipases, PS-PLA1 has an affinity for heparin (11Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We next examined whether such affinity for heparin is important for mast cell activation by PS-PLA1. As shown in Fig.7, 50 ng/ml of heparin completely blocked the histamine release from crude RPMC. However, heparin did not inhibit the ability of PS-PLA1 to hydrolyze PS in vitro nor lyso-PS-induced histamine release from RPMC (data not shown). This result indicates that an association between PS-PLA1 and the cell surface membrane via heparan sulfate proteoglycan is important for the cellular function of the enzyme. We finally examined the ability of sPLA2-IIA to stimulate RPMC activation and compared it with that of PS-PLA1, since sPLA2-IIA is capable of producing lyso-PS in vitro. sPLA2-IIA efficiently hydrolyzes anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine and PS in vitro, and it does not hydrolyze phospholipids on intact membranes. When the same amounts of each enzyme were separately added to crude RPMC in the presence of FcεRI cross-linker, PS-PLA1 was much more potent than sPLA2-IIA in inducing histamine release (Fig.8 A). A similar result was obtained when purified RPMC were co-cultured with apoptotic Jurkat cells in the presence of FcεRI cross-linker and PS-PLA1, although at high concentrations, sPLA2-IIA significantly stimulated histamine release (Fig. 8 B). The present study was undertaken to determine whether PS-PLA1 participates in the activation of RPMC. Three results of this study indicate that PS-PLA1 stimulates histamine release from RPMC through the production of 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS: 1) 1-acyl-2-lyso-PS has almost the same ability as 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS to stimulate IgE-antigen-induced histamine release from RPMC; 2) recombinant PS-PLA1, but not mutant PS-PLA1, stimulated IgE-antigen-induced histamine release from RPMC; and 3) lyso-PS with unsaturated fatty acids was detected by MS analysis after apoptotic cells or crude RPMC were incubated with recombinant PS-PLA1. In addition, the present results, summarized below, provide some insights into how lyso-PS production by the enzyme is regulated and how the enzyme acts on cell membranes. PS-PLA1 was effective in stimulating histamine release from purified RPMC co-cultured with apoptotic Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4 A) or from crude RPMC (Fig. 4 B). In addition, lyso-PS with unsaturated fatty acids was actually detected in the cell supernatant by mass spectrometry. These results clearly show that PS-PLA1 produces lyso-PS by hydrolyzing PS exposed on the surface of peritoneal cells or apoptotic cells, although, like other phospholipases, it does not act on intact cell membranes. They also suggest that a key factor regulating lyso-PS production is the availability of PS on the cell surface. It is well accepted that apoptotic cells expose PS on the surface. In addition, PS exposure is enhanced in activated platelets and cytokine-stimulated or ConA-treated cells (this study). Thus it can be concluded that PS exposed on such cells may be a target for PS-PLA1 in vivo. In fact, we previously detected lyso-PS with unsaturated fatty acids in activated rat platelets, which abundantly express PS-PLA1 (13Yokoyama K. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1280-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We also observed that the activated rat platelets stimulated IgE-antigen- or nerve growth factor-induced histamine release from RPMC. 2K. Kawamoto, J. Aoki, A. Tanaka, A. Itakura, Y. Kiso, and H. Matsuda, manuscript in preparation.Lyso-PS has also been reported to be present in vivo: it has been detected in the aqueous humor of the eyes (28Liliom K. Guan Z. Tseng J.L. Desiderio D.M. Tigyi G. Watsky M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1065-C1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is produced by rat peritoneal cells or at the site of tissue injury (10Mietto L. Boarato E. Toffano G. Bruni A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 930: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is possible that PS-PLA1 is responsible for the production of such lyso-PS in vivo. In this study, we showed that lyso-PS, produced by PS-PLA1, was almost exclusively recovered from cell supernatant. In our previous work we have found that lyso-PS applied to cells is immediately converted to PS by acylation (5Tamori-Natori Y. Horigome K. Inoue K. Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The result may explain why lyso-PS was not detected in the cell fractions. Another factor regulating lyso-PS production is the expression of PS-PLA1 in vivo. We previously showed that rat platelets are a major source of PS-PLA1 (11Sato T. Aoki J. Nagai Y. Dohmae N. Takio K. Doi T. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2192-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and that PS-PLA1 is detected in various human tissues (14Nagai Y. Aoki J. Sato T. Amano K. Matsuda Y. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11053-11059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, preliminary experiments in our laboratory have shown that expression of PS-PLA1 can be induced in inflammatory sites and in several tissues by various inflammatory stimuli. 3Y. Nagai, J. Aoki, H. Arai, and K. Inoue, unpublished data. Our preliminary results show that the concentrations of PS-PLA1 in the supernatant of activated rat platelets, rat plasma, and the peritoneal cavity of rats injected intraperitoneally with casein are 400, 5, and 150 ng/ml, respectively. Thus the amount of PS-PLA1 used in this study is close to the physiological levels, and it is possible that the enzyme stimulates mast cells in vivo. We showed that PS-PLA1, which has an affinity for heparin, completely lost its ability to stimulate mast cells in the presence of heparin (Fig. 7). Many lipases, such as hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase, have an affinity for heparin and function on the cell surface of hepatocyte or adipocyte by interacting with heparan sulfate proteoglycan. It has been also demonstrated that sPLA2-IIA is attached to the cell surfaces by its C-terminal heparin-binding domain and that the attachment is essential for prostaglandin biosynthesis (29Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30041-30051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This may be also the case with PS-PLA1. From the data presented here, we assume that sPLA2-IIA is less potent than PS-PLA1 in producing lyso-PS (Fig. 8). Living cells are normally resistant but become susceptible during apoptosis to the enzyme. Unlike PS-PLA1, sPLA2-IIA acts on other phospholipids than PS. This is a possible reason why sPLA2-IIA is less potent than PS-PLA1 in producing lyso-PS. sPLA2-IIA alone has been reported to stimulate histamine release from RPMC provided that the concentration of the enzyme is high enough (30Murakami M. Hara N. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5675-5684PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a concentration of sPLA2-IIA >20 µg/ml was required to induce histamine release from RPMC by sPLA2-IIA alone. Conversely, the effect of PS-PLA1 was observed at a concentration of about 50 ng/ml in the presence of FcεRI cross-linker (Fig. 8). The effect of sPLA2-IIA has also been reported to be independent of lyso-PS, because histamine release triggered by sPLA2-IIA can be observed in the absence of FcεRI cross-linkers (30Murakami M. Hara N. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5675-5684PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the two PLAs act against mast cells in a very different manner, although we cannot exclude the involvement of another secretory PLA2that has recently been identified (31Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In summary, PS-PLA1 was found to stimulate histamine release from RPMC. PS is normally present on the inner leaflet of lipid bilayers, and there is evidence to suggest that PS is exposed to the outer surface of apoptotic cells, dead cells, and cytokine-stimulated cells. PS-PLA1 hydrolyzes PS on the outer membrane of such cells producing 2-acyl-1-lyso-PS, a lipid messenger of mast cells. The synthetic pathways for lipid mediators such as lysophosphatidic acid, platelet-activating factor, and sphingosine-1-phosphate have not been fully solved yet. In this sense it can be said that PS-PLA1is the first enzyme that has been shown to produce bioactive lysophospholipid, although further studies are definitely required to demonstrate the role of this enzyme in vivo.

However, caspase cleavage of APP also results in loss of its endocytosis signal (YENP), an event that would predict a decline in internalization and a concomitant decrease, not an increase, in Aβ generation. In the present work, we examined whether caspase cleavage of APP is relevant to amyloidogenesis. We found that 1) caspase cleavage of APP results in reduced internalization and, accordingly, a decline in Aβ secretion; 2) masking of the caspase site in APP did not affect Aβ levels and, 3) caspase activation in cells by serum withdrawal did not increase Aβ secretion.

Two major species of amyloid β-protein (Aβ), differing by two amino acids in length (Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42)) at the C terminus, have been characterized. Aβ-(1–42), the longer Aβ isoform, readily aggregates in vitro and appears to be the more amyloidogenic and hence pathogenic species (reviewed in Ref. 1Selkoe D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism by which Aβ is generated from its precursor, the amyloid precursor protein (APP),1 is not well understood, internalization of APP from the cell surface with subsequent processing in the endocytic pathway is a major route for generation and secretion of both Aβ isoforms (2Koo E.H.

Accordingly, deletion or site-directed mutagenesis of the endocytosis motif in APP abrogates secretion of Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) (3Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J.

Two reports have shown that neurons undergoing apoptotic cell death secrete approximately 2- to 3-fold more Aβ than healthy neurons (5LeBlanc A. J.

Because Aβ is neurotoxic and contributes to apoptosis in a variety of cultured cells, it has been proposed that increased Aβ secretion, due to genetic predisposition or to other factors, causes increased cell death in susceptible neurons. This initiates a cycle in which dying neurons release more Aβ, which in turn causes more cell death to account for death of neurons seen in Alzheimer's disease (6Galli C. Piccini A. Ciotti M.T.

Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S.

Bredesen D.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The consequences of this cleavage event in the C-terminal domain, as well as those in the lumenal domain, are unclear. One hypothesis suggests that following cleavage in the cytoplasmic region, a toxic fragment, coined C31, is released and contributes to neuronal death (12Lu D.C. Rabizadeh S. Chandra S. Shayya R.F. Ellerby L.M. Ye X. Salvesen G.S. Koo E.H. Bredesen D.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that caspase cleavage of APP directly contributes to the increased Aβ secretion seen in apoptotic cells (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Evidence for this hypothesis was obtained from B103 neuroblastoma cells where expression of APPΔC31 resulted in a ∼5-fold increase of Aβ secretion. Because caspase activation and hence cleavage of APP follows an apoptotic signal, this model is consistent with the observation that more Aβ is secreted from neurons undergoing apoptosis. A corollary to this model is that increased Aβ secretion may induce further neuronal apoptosis, thereby propagating this cycle of caspase cleavage, Aβ release, and apoptosis. Although provocative, this hypothesis is inconsistent with previous observations that the APP cytoplasmic region contains a tetrapeptide motif (683YENP686) that functions as a signal for endocytosis (3Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Accordingly, loss of this endocytic signal by deletion or alanine mutagenesis abrogates processing of cell surface APP in the endocytic pathway and severely impairs Aβ production and secretion. Because caspase-cleaved APP lacks the endocytic signal, the truncated APPΔC31 should in theory release less, rather than more, Aβ unless cleavage at this particular position leads to an APP molecule that behaves differently from other internalization deficient mutants. In the present study, we have addressed this issue by characterizing both Aβ secretion and internalization rates, from a mutant that is not recognized by caspases (APP(D664A)) and from APPΔC31, in cells of both neural and non-neural origin. Our previous studies did not specifically examine APP cleaved at this position (APP664), and it is possible that caspase cleavage, as suggested by the earlier report, alters APP processing differently. In addition, we explored whether caspase activation modulates Aβ secretion. We show, in agreement with the endocytosis-requirement hypothesis, that APPΔC31 is not efficiently internalized and, accordingly, Aβ secretion decreases dramatically. Conversely, Aβ secretion from APP(D664A), the APP mutant that is not a caspase substrate, remains unaltered. Finally, we show that caspase cleavage of wild type APP does not result in increased Aβ secretion. Thus, caspases are unlikely to contribute to the generation and secretion of Aβ peptide under these culture conditions. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) and B103 (rat neuronal-derived) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.).

CHO or B103 cells expressing comparable amounts of the indicated APP constructs were seeded in duplicate on six-well tissue culture plates at an initial confluence of ∼80%. Cells were incubated for 24 h, medium (900 µl) was harvested and immunoprecipitated with antibody R3134 (1:200 dilution), and samples were separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Aβ bands were visualized on immunoblots using antibody 26D6 in conjunction with ECL (Pierce) either on film or by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for quantitation. Cell lysates were immunoblotted in parallel to monitor APP expression. Measurements of Aβ and fragment p3 levels from [35S]methionine metabolically labeled cells were performed as described (2Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

Triplicate cultures of CHO or B103 cells were grown to confluence in six-well tissue culture plates. Internalization of cell surface APP was then performed as described (3Perez R.G. Soriano S.

Briefly, iodinated whole 1G7 monoclonal antibody (of a specific activity of ∼3–6 µCi/µg) was diluted in binding medium (BM; RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mm Hepes + 0.2% bovine serum albumin), applied to triplicate confluent layers of CHO cells and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were then chilled on ice and washed once with BM and extensively with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. 1G7 antibody bound to cell-surface APP was uncoupled by two 5-min washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 2.5, followed by cell lysis with 0.2 m NaOH. Radioactivity from the pooled acid washes and the cell lysates was determined in a γ counter. The ratio of radioactivity of acid-resistant to acid-labile fractions represents a measure of internalized versuscell-surface pool of APP. B103 cells stably expressing APP, APP(D664A), and APPΔC31 were cultured to 70% confluence in six-well plates. The medium was then replaced with 500 µl/well of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 18 h. The cells were then lysed and analyzed for APP levels and APP cleavage by caspases, and medium was collected and analyzed for Aβ secretion. Endocytosis of APP truncated after amino acid Asp664, APPΔC31, corresponding to the product of caspase cleavage, was assessed using a well established protocol in which internalization of APP is monitored by uptake of radioiodinated 1G7 antibody (against the mid-region of APP; see diagram in Fig.1) (2Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports, APP mutants lacking either the complete cytosolic tail (APPΔC) or the C-terminal 15-amino acids (APPΔC15), both of which lack the YENP endocytosis motif (3Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), were unable to internalize efficiently in CHO cells (Fig. 2,CHO panel). The YENP motif is also absent in the APP form truncated at the caspase cleavage site (APPΔC31; see Fig. 1). Accordingly, its internalization is also severely impaired (Fig. 2). Identical experiments performed using B103 cells (Fig. 2, B103 panel) showed that neither APPΔC15 nor APPΔC31 could be efficiently endocytosed in these cells. The decrease in internalization of APP endocytosis mutants was less pronounced in B103 than in CHO cells. It should be noted, however, that constitutive APP internalization from B103 cells is less efficient (59.3% ± 4.05 of total APP) than from CHO cells (82.3% ± 1.26%), indicating that the level of internalization of APP is different between cell lines. Nevertheless, our results clearly show that deletion of the YENP motif in APP significantly impairs its internalization, both in CHO and B103 cells. It has been shown that secretion of both Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) tightly correlates with internalization of APP (3Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, we anticipated that secretion of Aβ would be impaired in cells expressing APPΔC31 because endocytosis is impaired by loss of the internalization signal. To test this hypothesis, we measured total Aβ levels in conditioned medium from CHO cells expressing wild type or endocytosis-deficient, C-terminally truncated APP mutants. As expected, Aβ secretion from APPΔC and APPΔC15 (Fig.3 A) was reduced dramatically. Significantly, APPΔC31 showed levels of secreted Aβ comparable with those from APPΔC and APPΔC15 (Fig. 3 A), indicating that, as with other C-terminally truncated APP forms, absence of the YENP motif in APPΔC31 resulted in a drastic reduction in Aβ secretion. Quantitation analysis revealed a decline of ∼80% in cells expressing all endocytosis mutants, consistent with previous reports (3Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar)(Fig.3 B). In contrast with these results, a recent report showed that B103 neuroblastoma cells secreted significantly higher amounts of Aβ when expressing APPΔC31 as compared with cells expressing wild type APP (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). One obvious explanation for the apparent discrepancy is the use of different cell lines. To determine whether this was the case, we also measured Aβ secretion from B103 cells expressing either wild type or endocytosis-deficient APP695 forms. As shown (Fig.4, lanes 1–3), the level of Aβ from medium of B103 cells expressing APPΔC31 was severely impaired, again demonstrating that cleavage of APP at the Asp664 caspase site behaved similarly to other internalization deficient mutants (2Koo E.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that cells expressing endocytosis-deficient APP secrete higher levels of the peptide generated by α and γ secretases, known as the p3 fragment. Thus, it is possible that the apparent increase in secreted Aβ levels from APPΔC31 seen by Gervais et al. (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) may have corresponded instead to an increase in p3 levels. The antibody used by these authors was directed against the sequence Aβ-(x-40) thus potentially recognizing p3 although further details were not provided (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these authors tested APPΔC31 derived from APP751 (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W.

We addressed both issues by measuring directly the levels of Aβ and p3 secreted from cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. Fig.5 shows that both B103 and CHO cells expressing APPΔC31 secreted higher levels of p3 concomitantly with a decrease in Aβ, similarly to other endocytosis mutants including the point mutation Y738A, which disrupts the YENP motif and results in decreased internalization (2Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3021-3024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the pattern of Aβ and p3 secretion from APPΔC31 in B103 cells was identical whether derived from APP695 or from APP751 (Fig. 5,B103 panel), further confirming that the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain of APP is not involved in the regulation of APP endocytosis and therefore has little influence on secretion of Aβ and p3 fragments. Thus, our results showed that caspase cleavage of APP resulted in elevated levels of p3, as well as in reduced secretion of Aβ, independently of either the APP isoforms or the cell line. Our results so far demonstrated that caspase cleavage at the Asp664 site did not result in a more amyloidogenic processing of APP, as has been hypothesized (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Rather, it appeared that Aβ secretion from caspase-truncated APP follows the well established model in which Aβ secretion is closely correlated with the rate of internalization of APP from the cell surface. To confirm the preceding finding, we examined the role of caspase cleavage of APP in Aβ secretion using a mutated form of APP that cannot be cleaved by caspases (APP(D664A)). We reasoned that, if cleavage at the Asp664 site is involved in the generation of Aβ, removal of the caspase site should result in decreased Aβ levels. As shown in Fig. 4, this was not the case. No difference in Aβ secretion was found between cells expressing wild type APP and those expressing APP(D664A) in B103 (Fig. 4, lanes 1,4). Moreover, ratios of Aβ42/total Aβ measured in N2a cells were not altered after expression of the APP(D664A) mutant (Fig.6) whether derived from wild type APP or the familial Alzheimer's disease APPV642F mutation, the latter selectively increasing the level of Aβ42. To further test a possible role of caspase activation in the generation of Aβ, we induced apoptosis in B103 cells expressing wild type APP, APP(D664A), or APPΔC31 by serum withdrawal. In B103 cells, serum withdrawal led to caspase activation and caspase cleavage of APP to generate APPΔC31 (Fig. 7, middle panel). Polyclonal antibody α664 directed against amino acids 657–664 (by 695 numbering; 713–720 by 751 numbering) of APP was used to monitor caspase cleavage. This antibody constitutes an ideal tool to monitor levels of caspase-generated APP because it is end-specific and only recognizes APP when it has been cleaved after residue 664 (see Fig. 1).2 As expected, serum withdrawal led to caspase cleavage of wild type APP but not of APP(D664A), indicating that caspases were activated in response to the treatment and that APP(D664A) mutant was not a substrate for caspase cleavage. Levels of Aβ were not significantly different in cells expressing APP or APP(D664A), whereas levels from APPΔC31-expressing cells were dramatically reduced (Fig. 7, lower panel, lanes 1, 3, 5), as expected from inefficient APP internalization (Fig. 2). Upon serum starvation, the level of Aβ in medium was unchanged as compared with basal conditions (Fig. 7,lower panel, lanes 2, 4,6), regardless of whether APP was a substrate for caspases (i.e. wild type APP) or not, i.e. APP(D664A). Thus, the levels of Aβ mirrored those of the APP forms susceptible to internalization, i.e. steady state levels of wild type APP and APP(D664A) (Fig. 7, upper panel), and not those of caspase cleavage of APP. A wide variety of cell lines, including neurons, undergo apoptosis when exposed to Aβ peptides, whereas apoptotic cells in turn have been shown in some cases to generate enhanced levels of Aβ. This has led to the hypothesis that elevated levels of Aβ seen in both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease contribute to cell death, which in turn secretes more Aβ leading to a propagating cycle of cell death (6Galli C. Piccini A. Ciotti M.T. Castellani L. Calissano P. Zaccheo D. Tabaton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Whether enhanced Aβ secretion in response to cell insult is a common phenomenon or occurs in vivo is unknown. It was recently proposed that caspase-3 cleavage of APP at amino acid Asp664 generates a truncated APP molecule (APPΔC31) that is then processed in a more amyloidogenic pathway, an intriguing notion that feeds into the amyloid/cell death hypothesis (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the findings that B103 cells expressing APPΔC31 secrete significantly higher amounts of Aβ than control cells expressing wild type APP. However, these observations are in apparent contradiction with the hypothesis that the endocytic compartment is involved in generation and secretion of both Aβ-(1–40) and Aβ-(1–42) (2Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Because caspase-cleaved APP lacks the endocytosis motif YENP, one would predict that caspase cleavage of APP would result in impaired internalization of APP and therefore in significantly lower levels of Aβ secretion from the truncated APP precursors. In this study, we explored the role of caspase cleavage of APP on Aβ generation by analyzing internalization of cell surface APP and levels of Aβ in both caspase cleaved APP and by the non-cleavable mutant APP(D664A). We showed that 1) caspase cleavage of APP resulted in impaired internalization of the C-terminal-truncated APP molecule, similar to other YENPTY trafficking APP mutants; 2) as with other endocytosis-deficient APP forms, Aβ secretion from caspase-cleaved APP was drastically reduced, whereas secretion of the p3 fragment, generated by α and γ secretases, was increased; 3) masking of the caspase site in APP did not affect Aβ levels; and 4) caspase activation in cells did not increase Aβ secretion. Importantly, these results were observed in cell types of both neural and non-neural origin. Thus, loss of the C-terminal 31 residues, which contain the internalization signal in the APP cytosolic domain, inhibits internalization and subsequent Aβ generation. In other words, caspase cleavage at position 664, generating APPΔC31, does not result in an APP molecule that behaves differently from the other endocytic mutants with regards to either APP processing or Aβ and p3 production. Furthermore, one form of cell injury by serum withdrawal did not correspond to increased levels of Aβ in B103 cells (Fig. 7) despite the fact that APP was cleaved by activated caspases (Fig. 7) (12Lu D.C. Rabizadeh S. Chandra S. Shayya R.F. Ellerby L.M. Ye X. Salvesen G.S. Koo E.H. Bredesen D.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Thus, our results clearly showed that generation and secretion of Aβ can be uncoupled from caspase activation and caspase cleavage of APP. This interpretation is also consistent with the findings from the APP caspase mutant, APP(D664A), where loss of the caspase cleavage site did not alter the amount of Aβ secretion (Figs. 4 and 7). Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that caspase cleavage of APP results in more Aβ secretion, leading to further cell death and even more Aβ secretion. In this study, we were careful to examine not only CHO cells, as we have analyzed in the past, but also the same B103 neuroblastoma cell line used in both studies as well as N2a cells. We used APP695 and APP751 and both deletion (ΔC, ΔC15, and ΔC31) and single point (Y738A) mutants to demonstrate a correlation between internalization of APP and Aβ secretion. At present we cannot explain the differences between our findings and those reported by Gervais et al. (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). One possibility, however, may reside in the method chosen to measure Aβ levels. While we directly visualized Aβ as well as the fragment generated by α and γ secretases, known as the p3 fragment (2Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see diagram in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5), Gervais et al. made use of an antibody directed against the sequence Aβ-(x-40), which would potentially recognize p3. Because the method used (ELISA) may not be able to differentiate between p3 and Aβ fragments, and no evidence was presented to the contrary, it is possible that what Gervais and colleagues interpreted as an increase in Aβ-(1–40) from APPΔC31 corresponded in fact to an increase in p3 generation, as we have shown in the present work. In summary, our studies provided evidence that caspases are unlikely to be involved in the amyloidogenic processing of APP. In this context, it is noteworthy that caspase-6 was proposed to represent the β-secretase activity, especially in the case of the Swedish APP mutation, where the mutant APP was shown to be an improved caspase substrate in in vitro assays (7Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). This is one possible explanation for the increased Aβ production associated with this mutation, a finding that places caspases as potentially important in amyloidogenesis under pathological conditions. However, cleavage by caspase-6 generates an Aβ peptide that is truncated of the N-terminal aspartate residue because caspase cleavage occurs after rather than before the aspartate at the P1 position (14Tanzi R.E. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 585-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The most compelling evidence that caspases do not contribute to Aβ generation through β secretase activity is the recent reports that mice lacking BACE1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1) do not produce any measurable amounts of Aβ (15Luo Y. Bolon B. Kahn S. Bennett B.D. Babu-Khan S. Denis P. Fan W. Kha H. Zhang J. Gong Y. Martin L. Louis J.C. Yan Q. Richards W.G. Citron M. Vassar R. Nat.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 233-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Thus, the concept that caspases play an important role in amyloidogenesis, though provocative, is not substantiated by current evidence, including our present work. Finally, it is important to note that this study did not address the question of whether some apoptotic signals may exacerbate Aβ secretion under certain circumstances, as has been reported by two laboratories (5LeBlanc A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7837-7846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Galli C. Piccini A. Ciotti M.T. Castellani L. Calissano P. Zaccheo D. Tabaton M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although we did not see an increase in Aβ secretion in response to serum withdrawal and caspase activation, differences in mode of cell death induction and in the cell lines used may explain the outcomes. Clearly, it remains possible that apoptosis may eventually lead to enhanced Aβ secretion in some cell types. However, it is also clear from our present work that caspase-cleaved APP per se is not a major contributor to Aβ generation, and therefore a scenario in which caspase-cleaved APP actively contributes to Aβ secretion remains unlikely. Thus, the possibility remains that cytotoxic effects derived from caspase cleavage of APP may result from the generation of new APP-derived C-terminal peptides (10Pellegrini L. Passer B.J. Tabaton M.

Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The arsA and arsB genes of the operon encode, respectively, the catalytic subunit ArsA1 (ATPase) and the membrane subunit ArsB of a pump that extrudes arsenite (As(III)) and antimonite (Sb(III)) ions from the cytosol (2Chen C.M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arsenic efflux in bacteria is catalyzed by either ArsB alone, functioning as a secondary transporter, or by the ArsAB complex, functioning as a transport ATPase (3Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli can utilize either mode physiologically; however, the ATP-coupled pump is more efficient, capable of producing concentration gradients as high as 106, equivalent to a concentration of 1 nmintracellular arsenite at 1 mm external arsenite. Although bound to ArsB in vivo, ArsA can be expressed and purified as a soluble protein (4Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whose ATPase activity is stimulated by As(III) or Sb(III) (5Hsu C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ArsA is composed of two homologous domains, designated A1 and A2, connected by a linker of 23 amino acids; each domain contains a consensus sequence for a nucleotide binding site (NBS) (see Fig. 1 A). We have recently determined the crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with Mg·ADP (6Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The A1 and A2 halves of the protein are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis of symmetry. The two NBSs are located at the interface between A1 and A2, in close proximity of each other. Both NBSs are formed by residues from both A1 and A2. However, one NBS is contributed mostly by A1 residues and is thereby named A1 NBS; the other NBS is contributed mostly by A2 residues and is named A2 NBS. Also at the interface between A1 and A2, but at the opposite end of the molecule with respect to the NBSs, is a site in which three distinct As(III) or Sb(III) ions bind (6Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Three cysteines (Cys113, Cys172, Cys422), two histidines (His148, His453), and one serine (Ser420) ligate the ions. Each As/Sb(III) is coordinated by one residue from A1 and one residue from A2. Thus, binding of each of the three metalloids tightens the interaction between A1 and A2, possibly triggering ATP hydrolysis. One of the major unanswered questions in the ArsA mechanism is how the two NBSs work together to provide the energy necessary for ion transfer. It is clear that both NBSs bind nucleotides (7Karkaria C.E. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pre-steady-state analyses of ATP hydrolysis by ArsA in the absence or presence of arsenite or antimonite show that both NBSs are catalytic, although not equivalent (8Walmsley A.R.

These kinetic data are consistent with binding studies using the ATP analog 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, which suggest that nucleotides can be easily exchanged at the A2 NBS but not at the A1 NBS (10Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A possible basis for these observations is found in the structure of ArsA in complex with Mg·ADP, which shows the A1 NBS in a “closed” conformation, while the A2 NBS is in an “open” conformation (6Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). ArsA is structurally similar to NifH, the Fe-protein of bacterial nitrogenases (11; see also sequence alignment in Fig. 1 Abelow). Like ArsA, NifH has two NBSs facing each other and its iron-sulfur center is almost coincident with the As/Sb(III) cluster of ArsA. Because NifH has long been recognized as a relative of G-proteins (12Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Ryle M.J. Seefeldt L.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4766-4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Jang S.B. Seefeldt L.C. Peters J.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14745-14752Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it has become customary to identify specific regions of ArsA with definitions borrowed from G-protein terminology. For example, in G-proteins, as well as in ArsA, Mg2+ is coordinated (directly or via a water molecule) by an aspartic acid located in a strand-loop-helix structure that is referred to as the Switch I region (15Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Likewise, the DTAPTGH signature sequence of ArsA (6Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Rosen B.P. Bhattacharjee H. Zhou T. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) has an exact counterpart in NifH (Fig.1 A) and is believed to correspond to the Switch II region of G-proteins (14Jang S.B. Seefeldt L.C. Peters J.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14745-14752Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The terms Switch I and Switch II are commonly used in reference to these regions throughout this report. To elucidate the structural basis of ATP hydrolysis at the NBSs of ArsA, we have determined the crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with ATP, the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, and the transition state analog of ATP hydrolysis, ADP·AlF3. The results presented here in conjunction with previous studies of the pre-steady-state kinetics of ATP binding and hydrolysis (8Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16153-16161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Walmsley A.R. Zhou T. Borges-Walmsley M.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6378-6391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) suggest that the enzyme may function as a reciprocating engine. Crystals of ArsA in complex with Mg·ADP were prepared by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at 30 °C (18Zhou T. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Drops were prepared by mixing equal amounts of a solution containing 20 mg/ml ArsA protein, 2 mm ADP, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaAsO2, 1 mm CdCl2, 10 mm Bis-Tris-propane (pH 8.0) with the reservoir solution containing 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, 100 mmBis-Tris-Propane (pH 8.0). Crystals were harvested from the crystallization tray in a holding solution consisting of 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, 5 mm ADP, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 4 mm NaAsO2, 2 mm CdCl2, 100 mm Bis-Tris-propane (pH 8.0), and 15% glycerol (v/v) as cryoprotectant. Crystals of ArsA in complex with Mg·ATP were initially obtained by soaking crystals of the Mg·ADP enzyme in the presence of 5 mm ATP and 2.5 mm MgCl2. Under these conditions the crystals undergo a space group change from I222 (a ≅ 73 Å,b ≅ 76 Å, c ≅ 223 Å) to P21212 (a ≅ 76.7 Å, b≅ 222.2 Å, c ≅ 74.0 Å.). The new unit cell is only apparently different from the original as shown by the observation that the choice of the unconventional space group P22121 instead of P21212 would be associated with essentially unchanged unit cell dimensions (a ≅ 74 Å, b≅ 77 Å, c ≅ 222 Å) with respect to the original I222 space group. The asymmetric unit of P21212 crystals contains two molecules related by a 2-fold axis of local symmetry. De novo crystallization of the enzyme, using ATP instead of ADP, also yielded crystals of space group P21212, which were indistinguishable from those obtained by soaking I222 crystals in the presence of MgCl2and ATP. Crystals of the enzyme with AMP-PNP also belong to space group P21212 and could be obtained by incubating crystals of the ADP complex with AMP-PNP but not by de novocrystallization in the presence of this ATP analog. Crystals of the ADP·AlF3 enzyme were obtained using the same conditions that yield ADP crystals, except for the addition of 8 mmNaF and 2 mm AlCl3. Crystals of the ADP·AlF4 enzyme were obtained by incubating crystals of the ADP·AlF3 enzyme in a mother liquor at pH 6.2 containing MES as buffer instead of Bis-Tris-propane. Data sets were collected at 100 K with a R axis IV image plate detector (Table I) and processed with HKL (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 2276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The structure of ArsA in complex with Mg·ATP was determined by molecular replacement using the enzyme from space group I222 (6Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) as the starting model. All the steps of the molecular replacement procedure were carried out using the CNS v. 1.0 suite of crystallographic programs (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Self-rotation and cross-rotation function analyses clearly identified the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by a 2-fold axis of local symmetry. Correct placement of the molecules was obtained with two consecutive translation searches. Model refinement was also carried out with CNS v. 1.0 using cross-validated maximum likelihood as the target function (21Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were added during the final stages of refinement after the protein model had stabilized. Because crystals of the ADP·AlF3 enzyme are isomorphous to crystals of the Mg·ADP enzyme, the structure of the former was obtained by simple crystallographic refinement.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsATPAMP-PMPADP · AIF3Data collectionSpace groupP21212P21212I222Cell dimensions (a/b/c) (Å)76.7/222.2/74.176.6/222.5/74.073.9/75.9/222.6Resolution range (Å)28.6–2.437–2.625.7–2.15Measurements316,955198,246213,945Unique reflections46,95237,26534,275〈Redundancy〉6.85.26.2Completeness (%)90.093.594.1〈I〉/ς〈I〉16.95.517.5R merge1-aRmerge = ΣhΣd‖I(h)i − 〈I(h)〉‖/ΣhΣd I(h)i, where I(h)i is the ith measurement.(%)7.66.27.7RefinementR cryst1-bRcryst = Σ‖F obs −F calc‖/Σ‖F obs‖.R free was calculated on 10% of the data omitted from refinement. ςA coordinate error was calculated with CNS v. 1.0 (20).

Least-square fits were carried out with LSQMAN written by Gerard Kleywegt. When ArsA is crystallized in the presence of ATP, or when crystals containing Mg·ADP are soaked with ATP, the resulting crystals belong to space group P21212 and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table I). Several choices of a dimer are consistent with crystal symmetry: The dimer with the largest buried surface is shown in Fig.2. It should be emphasized that, although there is some suggestion that ArsA may be a dimer in vivo(22Ching M.H. Kaur P. Karkaria C.E. Steiner R.F. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2327-2332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the crystallographic dimer shown in Fig. 2 may not reflect the actual structure of the enzyme when it is part of the ArsAB complex. In both monomers, the A1 NBS is occupied by Mg·ADP, while the A2 NBS is occupied by Mg·ATP. The local 2-fold axis that relates the monomers corresponds to a crystallographic 2-fold axis in the crystal of the I222 space group described previously (6Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which contains ADP at both the A1 and A2 NBSs. A superposition of the A2 NBS with bound ADP (I222 crystals) and of the same site with bound ATP (P21212 crystals, Molecule B) is shown in Fig. 3. The most striking difference is observed in the region corresponding to residues 567–573. Throughout this report we adopt the convention that corresponding structural elements of A1 and A2 are referred to by a single denomination as helix H# or strand S# of A1 or A2, respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, for example, residues 567–573 form a small loop between strand S8 and helix H16 of A2, which wraps around the adenine moiety of the nucleotide. The equivalent loop between strand S8 and helix H16 of A1 encompasses residues 277–283 (see sequence alignment of Fig. 1 A). We refer to this loop as the “adenine loop” or “A-loop.” The A-loop was shown to form a photo-adduct with [α-32P]ATP (23Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP the A-loop is displaced producing a wider opening of the A2 NBS cavity (Fig. 3). The view presented in Fig. 3 clearly shows how Mg2+ is located at the crossroad of the P-loop (green trace), the Switch I region (pink trace), and the Switch II region (cyan trace). When ADP is bound at the A2 NBS, Mg2+ displays a distorted octahedral geometry with six ligands, two axial and four equatorial (Fig.4 A). The two axial ligands are a water molecule hydrogen bonded to a β-phosphate oxygen and the hydroxyl of Thr341. The four equatorial ligands are a β-phosphate oxygen, a water molecule that is also hydrogen-bonded to an α-phosphate oxygen and to the carboxylate of Asp364(Switch I), a water molecule that is also hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of Asp447 (Switch II) and to the hydroxyl of Ser363 (Switch I), and a water molecule that is also hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl of Asp447. By virtue of these interactions, the P-loop, the Switch I, and the Switch II elements are held tightly together around the Mg2+ ion. When ATP binds at the A2 NBS, one of the γ-phosphate oxygens replaces water as an axial ligand to Mg2+, such that the metal now bridges the β- and γ-phosphates (Fig. 4, B andC). However, there are differences between the two ArsA monomers in the equatorial coordination of Mg2+. In one monomer (Molecule B) one of the water molecules that coordinates Mg2+ is hydrogen-bonded to another more distant solvent, which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to Ser363 and Asp447 (Fig. 4 B). In the other monomer (Molecule A) the equatorial coordination of Mg2+ resembles more closely that observed in the presence of ADP, with a water ligand forming a direct hydrogen bond with Ser363 and Asp447 (Fig. 4 C). In molecule B, Mg2+ displays a perfect octahedral coordination (Fig.4 B), while in molecule A the coordination geometry is slightly distorted (Fig. 4 C). In these various configurations of the A2 NBS with ADP or ATP bound, Mg2+appears to move back and forth among the nucleotide, the Switch I, and the Switch II elements. This motion is reflected by changes in the distance between Mg2+ and nearby residues of the P-loop, the Switch I, and the Switch II region (TableII).Figure 4Mg2+ coordination at the A2 NBS.

Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar. The Switch II region contains the signature sequence447DTAPTGH453, whose N-terminal end, Asp447, is involved in Mg2+ coordination, and whose C-terminal end, His453, is one of the As/Sb(III) ligands (Fig. 1 A). It has been proposed that this sequence may act as a signal transduction element connecting events at the NBS with changes in metal binding (6Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Zhou T. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19731-19737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no significant changes in the conformation of the DTAPTGH element are observed between the ADP- and the ATP-complexed enzymes. The geometry of As/Sb(III) ligation at the metal binding site is also essentially unchanged in the two structures. In contrast, a large change is observed in the region of A1 that provides one of the cysteine ligands (Cys172), represented by helices H9–H10 and by the intervening loop. This loop is disordered in the ADP enzyme but becomes well ordered when ATP binds at the A2 NBS (Fig. 1 B, gold trace). Although all the crystals analyzed in this report were obtained by incubating the enzyme in the presence of As(III), difference Fourier maps show residual positive density at the positions of the bound metal, suggesting it should be modeled as an element heavier than arsenic. One possible interpretation of this observation is that Cd(II) ions, which may assume a coordination similar to that of As(III), and whose presence in the crystallization medium is necessary for crystal formation (see “Materials and Methods”), slowly replace As(III) at the metal binding site. A structure essentially indistinguishable from that of ArsA in complex with ATP was observed when crystals obtained in the presence of ADP were incubated with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP. In this experiment AMP-PNP exchanged with ADP at the A2 NBS (data not shown). However, if AMP-PNP was added prior to crystallization, no crystals were obtained. The structure of the enzyme in complex with ADP·AlF3 is much more similar to that of the ADP complex than to that of the ATP complex. This is also evident in the fact that crystals of both the ADP and ADP·AlF3 complex belong to the same space group I222 (Table I). However, as was the case for ATP and AMP-PNP, ADP·AlF3 binds only at the A2 NBS. At this site the aluminate is clearly recognizable as a planar trigonal molecule occupying a position equivalent to that of the γ-phosphate of ATP (Fig. 4 D). Consequently, the hydroxyl moiety of the β-phosphate of ADP corresponding to the bridging oxygen between the β- and γ-phosphate of ATP is only 2.3 Å from aluminum. Mg2+ is 1.9 Å from one of the fluorine atoms and bridges the latter to one of the β-phosphate hydroxyls. On the other side of the aluminum atom, a water molecule occupies a position almost symmetrical with respect to the β-phosphate hydroxyl (Fig.4 D). This water molecule is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to another solvent molecule, which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl of Ser363 (Switch I). There is no water near the γ-phosphate in the structures of the enzyme with ATP bound at the A2 NBS. As previously mentioned, the structure of the enzyme in complex with ADP·AlF3 at the A2 NBS is very similar to that of the ADP complex. In particular, the position of the A-loop (residues 567–573) is similar to that observed in the ADP complex, and the loop between helices H9 and H10, which is disordered in the ADP enzyme but visible when ATP binds at the A2 NBS, is also disordered in the ADP·AlF3 complex. It is worth emphasizing that the ADP·AlFx complex described above is of the ADP·AlF3 form rather than of the ADP·AlF4 form observed in similar experiments with other enzymes (24Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 25Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G.

Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Because the coordination number of the AlFxin transition state analogs of phosphoryl transfer is pH-dependent and the probability of the aluminate to be in the AlF4 form increases with decreasing pH (27Schlichting I. Reinstein J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 721-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we have sought to determine whether lowering the pH of the mother liquor of ArsA crystals would affect the aluminum coordination. In fact, when crystals of the ADP·AlFx complex are incubated at pH 6.2, four fluoride ions are present as square-plane ligands of the aluminum ion (not shown), suggesting that the aluminum coordination number has changed from 5 to 6 (including water and the β-phosphate hydroxyl as axial ligands). It is widely accepted that hydrolysis of ATP proceeds by attack of a water molecule on the γ-phosphorus (28Sleep J.A. Hackney D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4094-4099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Webb M.R. Trentham D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10910-10916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dale M.P. Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8365-8372Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with formation of a trigonal bipyramidal transition state (31Lindquist R.N. Lynn Jr., J.L. Lienhard G.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 8762-8768Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 32Westheimer F.H. Science. 1987; 235: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Thus, the ADP·AlF3 complex (trigonal coordination) observed at pH 8.0 represents a better structural analog of the transition state of ATP hydrolysis than the ADP·AlF4 complex (square-planar coordination) observed at pH 6.2. A quantitative analysis of the differences between structures can be achieved through the use of difference distance matrices (33Richards F.M. Kundrot C.E. Proteins. 1988; 3: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In a distance matrix, the differences between the coordinates of each Cα of a protein and every other Cα of the same protein are utilized to build a density plot in which residues that are close in space are represented as a point of high density. In a difference distance matrix the distance matrix of a first structure is subtracted from the distance matrix of a second structure. If the distance A n −A m between two residuesA n and A m of the A structure changes in the B structure, then the distance B n − B m between the same two residues in the B structure will be either > A n − A m or < A n − A m . In the first case a positive value will be associated with those two residues in the difference distance matrix between B and A; in the second case a negative value will be obtained. Thus, to evaluate whether changes have occurred between two structures, it is informative to look at both positive and negative values of the difference distance matrix. These values are represented in Fig. 5 as density plots for the structure pairs of ArsA in complex with ADP·AlF3 versus ADP (row 1), molecule A (row 2), or molecule B (row 3) of ArsA in complex with ATP versus ADP·AlF3 and for molecule A versus molecule B of ArsA in complex with ATP (row 4). Darker pixels in the density plots indicate larger changes in the distance between two residues. Altogether, there are only a few regions of ArsA that undergo the same or very similar conformational changes in all pair-wise comparisons in response to the binding of different nucleotides at the A2 NBS. The smallest differences are observed between the structures of ArsA in complex with ADP·AlF3 versus ADP (Fig. 5,row 1), whereas the largest values of both positive and negative differences occur between the two molecules of ArsA with ATP bound (Fig. 5, row 4). It is important to notice that these differences cannot be interpreted as trivial consequence of the variation in crystal contacts between the two molecules of ArsA in the asymmetric unit. On the contrary, it is the addition of ATP to crystals of space group I222 that produces the change to space group P21212 by forcing the establishment of new crystal contacts to accommodate the conformational changes in the enzyme. These conformational changes involve primarily (a) helices H4–H5 (pink rhombus; residues 75–105 of A1 or 385–415 of A2), (b) helices H9–H10 (cyan circle; residues 155–180 of A1), (c) helices H13–H15 and the A-loop (red triangle; residues 235–280 of A1 or 535–570 of A2), (d) a loop and strand located at the end of the Switch I region of A1 (yel"

Myc-associated zinc finger protein nucleotide chloramphenicol acetyl transferase glutathione S-transferase polymerase chain reaction The regulation of gene expression is mediated by the binding of transcription factors to cis-elements in promoter regions. The promoter regions of many eukaryotic genes contain GC-rich sequences (1Courey A.J. Tjian R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar), and some of the most widely distributed promoter elements are GC boxes and related motifs. The zinc finger proteins Sp1 and Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ)1 are transcription factors that bind to GC-rich sequences, namely GGGCGG and GGGAGGG, respectively, to regulate the expression of various target genes. Sp1 was originally characterized as a ubiquitous transcription factor of 778 amino acids that recognized GC-rich sequences in the early promoter of simian virus 40 (2Dynan W.S. Tjian R.

The DNA-binding domain of Sp1 consists of three contiguous C2H2-type zinc fingers (4Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar).

The carboxyl-terminal domain of Sp1 is involved in synergistic activation and interactions with other transcription factors. Sp1 is considered to be a constitutively expressed transcription factor and has been implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of housekeeping genes, tissue-specific genes, and genes involved in the regulation of growth (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It interacts with many factors, such as YY1 (7Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), E2F (8Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2872-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sp1-null mouse embryos exhibit severely retarded growth and die within 10 days after displaying a wide range of abnormalities (10Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). MAZ was first identified as a transcription factor that bound to a GA box (GGGAGGG) at the ME1a1 site of the c-myc promoter and to the CT-element of the c-myc gene (11Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7452-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). It is a zinc finger protein with six C2H2-type zinc fingers at the carboxyl terminus, a proline-rich region, and three alanine repeats. It is expressed ubiquitously, albeit at different levels in different tissues (12Song J. Murakami H. Tsutsui H. Tang X. Matsumura M. Itakura K. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K. J. Biol.

The sequences of the binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ are very similar, and they are often present in the same gene. However, the details of the interactions of Sp1 and MAZ with GC-rich cis-elements remain unknown. We report here that Sp1 and MAZ share DNA-binding sites with each other and that the specific binding of Sp1 and of MAZ to the DNA-binding sites depends on pairs of consecutive zinc fingers. A DNA fragment (from nucleotide (nt) −383 to minus]70) from the MAZ promoter was obtained by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, filled in, and inserted into theHindIII site of pSV00CAT (18Araki E. Shimada F. Shichiri M. Mori M. Ebina Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), via a pHindIII linker, to generate pMAZCAT. pCMV-Sp1 and pGEX-Sp1 were kindly provided by Dr. R. Chiu (UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angelos, CA). We constructed pGEX-MAZ-ΔF12, pGEX-MAZ-ΔF3, pGEX-MAZ-ΔF4, pGEX-MAZ-ΔF34, pGEX-MAZ-ΔF56, pGEX-Sp1-ΔF1, pGEX-Sp1-ΔF2, pGEX-Sp1-ΔF3, and pGEX-Sp1-ΔF23 by subcloning the appropriate DNA fragments that had been amplified by the PCR into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pGEX-MAZ-X and pGEX-Sp1-X were constructed by amplification of inserted DNA by PCR with exchange of the respective zinc finger domains of Sp1 and/or MAZ and subcloning into pGEX-2T. The inserts of pGEX-MAZ-ΔF34, pGEX-Sp1-ΔF23, pGEX-MAZ-X, and pGEX-Sp1-X were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to generate pCMV-MAZ-ΔF34, pCMV-Sp1-ΔF23, pCMV-MAZ-X, and pCMV-Sp1-X. HeLa cells, 293 cells, and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and NCI-H460 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium that contained 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using the FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The assay of CAT activity was performed as described elsewhere (12Song J. Murakami H. Tsutsui H. Tang X. Matsumura M. Itakura K. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20603-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Song J. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Murata T. Yokoyama K.K. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The DNA probes (nt −383 to −70) were radiolabeled by the Klenow large fragment of DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) using [α-32P]dCTP. The reaction was performed in 50 µl of buffer that contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, and a radiolabeled DNA probe with an extract of HeLa cells, GST-Sp1, GST-MAZ, and GST (glutathione S-transferase), respectively. The reaction mixture was first chilled on ice for 30 min and then 0.1 unit of DNase I (TAKARA, Kyoto, Japan) was added. The incubation was continued on ice for 4 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 µl of buffer that contained 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 250 µg/ml tRNA as a carrier. The reaction products were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and were then subjected to electrophoresis on a DNA sequencing gel. Gel shift assays were performed as described elsewhere (6Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 20Keller E.T. Chang C. Evshler W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26267-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The sequences of the DNA-binding sites of Sp1 and MAZ are very similar. To investigate whether Sp1 and MAZ might bind to the same cis-elements, we prepared DNA probes from the GC-rich promoter of the human gene for MAZ (from nt −383 to −70), which contains multiple putative binding sites for both Sp1 and MAZ, for gel shift assays using the nuclear extract of HeLa cells (12Song J. Murakami H. Tsutsui H. Tang X. Matsumura M. Itakura K. Kanazawa I. Sun K. Yokoyama K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20603-20614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We prepared three probes: the SM probe, nt −313 to −284, which contained one putative Sp1-binding site and one putative MAZ-binding site that partially overlapped (Fig.1 A); the M probe, nt −232 to −216, which contained one putative MAZ-binding site (Fig.1 B); and the S probe, nt −153 to −137, which contained one putative Sp1-binding site (Fig. 1 C). We detected one major and one minor DNA-protein complex (B1 and B2) with the SM probe that included the overlapping binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ (Fig.1 A). Addition of unlabeled oligodeoxynucleotides to reaction mixtures revealed competition by the unlabeled wild-type SM probe (lanes 5–7), but not by the mutant SM probe, for binding to MAZ and Sp1 (lanes 2–4). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the retarded bands corresponding to B1 and B2 were shifted still further upon addition of the antibodies against Sp1 and MAZ (lanes 9 and 11). Control antibodies did not affect the mobilities of the complexes (lanes 12 and13). These results indicated that Sp1 and MAZ specifically recognized overlapping sites in the same cis-element. Similarly, we detected supershifted bands when antibodies against MAZ or Sp1 were added to reaction mixtures with the M probe or S probe (Figs. 1, B and C, lanes 2 and4). The results indicated that both Sp1 and MAZ interacted with the putative MAZ-binding sites and the putative Sp1-binding sites in all three probes. We also examined other GC-richcis-elements in the MAZ promoter and found that the DNA-binding sites were recognized similarly by Sp1 or by MAZ or by both (data not shown). We next performed DNase I footprinting assays to determine whether the factors did, in fact, bind to these putative cis-elements in cells. We used a nuclear extract of HeLa cells for the assays. All of the putative binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ were protected from nucleolytic digestion (Fig.2 A). In an attempt to identify whether Sp1 and MAZ could bind to these sites, we used purified GST-Sp1 and GST-MAZ fusion proteins in DNase I footprinting assays. As shown in Fig. 2 B, all of the sixteen putative binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ were protected from nucleolytic digestion by GST-MAZ (lanes 8–10), and 13 of the 16 putative binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ were protected by GST-Sp1 (lanes 3–5). Nocis-elements were protected when we used GST alone as a negative control (Fig. 2 C). The patterns of protection obtained with purified GST-Sp1 were almost the same as those obtained with purified GST-MAZ. Thus, both fusion proteins bound to almost the same cis-elements as the respective binding proteins in a nuclear extract of HeLa cells. These results indicated that Sp1 and MAZ could bind to the same cis-elements and suggested, moreover, that Sp1 and MAZ might share DNA-binding sites. We found that the second and third zinc fingers of Sp1 are strongly homologous to the fourth and third zinc fingers of MAZ, respectively (Fig.3 A). To identify whether these zinc fingers are necessary for interaction with GC-rich sequences, we generated mutant GST-Sp1 and GST-MAZ fusion proteins with deletions of the zinc finger motifs (Figs. 3, B and C), and we examined the DNA binding abilities of these fusion proteins in gel shift assays. The DNA binding activity of the GST-Sp1 fusion protein decreased significantly when either the second or the third zinc finger motif had been deleted (GST-Sp1-ΔF2 and GST-Sp1-ΔF3; Fig.3 B). No DNA binding activity of the GST-Sp1 fusion protein was detected when both zinc fingers had been deleted (GST-Sp1-ΔF23; Fig. 3 B). These results clearly indicated that the second and third zinc fingers of Sp1 were essential for its DNA binding ability. Similarly, the DNA binding activity of the GST-MAZ fusion protein decreased when the third and/or the fourth zinc finger of MAZ had been deleted (GST-MAZ-ΔF3, GST-MAZ-ΔF4, and GST-MAZ-ΔF34; Fig. 3 C). The DNA binding ability of MAZ was not affected when the first two zinc fingers or the last two zinc fingers had been deleted (GST-MAZ-ΔF12 and GST-MAZ-ΔF56, Fig. 3 C). These results indicated that the third and fourth zinc fingers of MAZ were essential for its DNA binding activity. Because two consecutive zinc fingers in both Sp1 and MAZ were required for binding to GC-rich DNA sequences, we exchanged the two pairs of consecutive zinc fingers between GST-Sp1 and GST-MAZ (Fig.3 D). The chimeric fusion proteins bound both to Sp1- and to MAZ-binding sites after the pairs of consecutive zinc fingers had been exchanged with one another (GST-Sp1-X and GST-MAZ-X, Fig.3 D). This result confirmed the involvement of the pairs of consecutive zinc fingers in Sp1 and MAZ in the binding to GC-rich sequences in vitro. We transfected HeLa cells with MAZ-CAT reporter constructs in the presence or absence of an Sp1- or a MAZ-expression vector. The CAT reporter activity was inhibited significantly in the presence of Sp1 and of MAZ (Fig. 4 A), whereas the ectopic expression of Sp1 and MAZ had no effect on the transcription of pRSVCAT, the control plasmid. These results indicated that both Sp1 and MAZ repressed transcription of the MAZ gene. We also examined the inhibitory effects of Sp1 and MAZ on the MAZ promoter in other cell lines, namely 293 cells, NCI-H460 cells, and NIH3T3 cells. Both Sp1 and MAZ repressed the activity of the MAZ promoter in these cell lines, albeit to different extents in different cell lines (Fig.4 B). The effects of repression by Sp1 and MAZ were clearly in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4 C). Using the minimum effective dose of ectopically expressed Sp1, we examined the effect of increasing amounts of the MAZ expression vector and found that MAZ can replace Sp1 to repress the reporter activity of MAZ-CAT (Fig. 4 D). This repression was also dose-dependent. Similar repression was detected when we examined the ability of Sp1 to replace MAZ in transcriptional repression of the MAZ-CAT reporter gene (data not shown). These results indicate that repression of transcription by Sp1 and by MAZ does not involve cooperation between the two proteins. The binding of Sp1 and MAZ to the GC-rich elements seemed to be independent since we failed to detect any cooperation between Sp1 and MAZ in the repression of gene expression. These observations might reflect the competition for DNA-binding sites. We next studied the effects of the two consecutive zinc fingers of Sp1 and MAZ on the expression of MAZ. Plasmids expressing the wild-type protein, the deletion mutant that lacked the two consecutive zinc fingers, and a chimera with consecutive zinc fingers from MAZ or Sp1 were constructed and used to transfect HeLa cells. Repression of the MAZ promoter was reversed in the absence of the two consecutive zinc fingers of Sp1 or of MAZ (pCMV-MAZ-ΔF34 and pCMV-Sp1-ΔF23 in Fig.4 E). Furthermore, the dose-dependent repression by the chimera encoded by pCMV-Sp1-X, in which two consecutive zinc fingers of Sp1 had been replaced by those of MAZ, was similar to that by wild-type Sp1 (Fig. 4 F). We observed similar repression in the case of pCMV-MAZ-X (Fig. 4 F). These data indicate that the respective pairs of consecutive zinc fingers can substitute for one another. Many transcription factors, including Sp1 and MAZ, have zinc finger motifs and can bind to the GC-rich cis-elements that are widely distributed in the promoters, enhancers, and locus-control regions of housekeeping genes as well as tissue-specific genes (21Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence of Sp1-binding sites is very similar to that of MAZ-binding sites, and both types of sites are often present in the same gene. We examined the DNA binding activities of the two factors in gel shift assays (Fig. 1) and found that Sp1 bound to consensus Sp1-binding sites as well as to consensus MAZ-binding sites. Similarly, MAZ bound to the consensus binding sites for both MAZ and Sp1. The results of the gel shift assays indicated that both Sp1 and MAZ recognized the same cis-elements. We also performed DNase I footprinting assays to determine whether Sp1 and MAZ might share DNA-binding sites. We used a nuclear extract of HeLa cells, purified GST-Sp1, and purified GST-MAZ for these assays. All of the sixteen putative binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ in the probe were protected from nucleolytic digestion by the GST-MAZ fusion protein, and 13 of the 16 putative binding sites for Sp1 and MAZ were protected by the GST-Sp1 fusion protein (Fig. 2 B). The patterns of protection obtained with purified GST-Sp1 and GST-MAZ were almost the same as that obtained with a nuclear extract of HeLa cells (Fig. 2 A), indicating that Sp1 and MAZ shared the same DNA-binding sites. It has been reported that a number of transcription factors can bind to the same GC-rich DNA-binding sites, and functional interference by Sp1 with NF-κB at the same DNA-binding site has been reported (22Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Sp1 binds to a variety of GC-rich nucleotide sequences as well as to the consensus Sp1-binding site (23Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our observations that MAZ and Sp1 share binding sites indicate that the regulatory activity associated with some GC-rich elements is consistent with cooperative interactions by multiple transcription factors, such as zinc finger proteins, at the same or overlapping DNA motifs. The numbers of zinc finger motifs in zinc finger proteins vary from only two to more than a dozen (24VanderHeyden T.C Wojtkiewicz P.W. Voss T.C. Mangin T.M. Harrelson Z. Ahlers K.M. Phelps C.J. Hurley D.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Li X.A. Kokame K. Okubo K. Shimokado K. Tsukamoto Y. Miyata T. Kato H. Yutani C. Biochim. Biophys.

Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is possible that some but not all of the multiple zinc fingers are required for the binding tocis-elements. In view of the physical space available atcis-elements and the size of a zinc finger motif, it seems reasonable to postulate that two consecutive zinc fingers might be essential for direct interaction with a cis-element while additional zinc fingers might play an auxiliary role in the interaction or might be involved in cooperation with other factors. For example, the Ikaros protein contains six zinc fingers; the first four zinc fingers are involved in interactions with a cis-element, while the two carboxyl-terminal zinc fingers are involved in homodimerization of the protein itself (24VanderHeyden T.C Wojtkiewicz P.W. Voss T.C. Mangin T.M. Harrelson Z. Ahlers K.M. Phelps C.J. Hurley D.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We observed similar results for transcription factors Sas3 (29Houchens C.R. Montigny W. Zeltser L. Dailey L. Gilbert J.M. Heintz N.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 570-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RIP60 (30Takechi S. Nakayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There are three and six C2H2-type zinc finger motifs in the carboxyl-terminal regions of Sp1 and MAZ, respectively. Despite the difference in the number of zinc finger motifs between Sp1 and MAZ, the DNA binding abilities of the two proteins are very similar. The second and third zinc fingers of Sp1 are strongly homologous to the fourth and third zinc fingers of MAZ, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In our analysis by gel shift assays of mutant GST-Sp1 and GST-MAZ fusion proteins with deletions of zinc fingers, we found that GST-Sp1 no longer bound to the Sp1-binding site or to the MAZ-binding site when the second and third zinc fingers had been deleted (Fig.3 B). Similarly, the DNA binding activity of the GST-MAZ fusion protein decreased when the third and/or the fourth zinc finger of MAZ had been deleted (Fig. 3 C). These results indicated that the second and third zinc fingers of Sp1 and the third and fourth zinc fingers of MAZ were necessary for the DNA binding activity of the respective proteins. Because two adjacent zinc fingers in both Sp1 and MAZ were required for binding to GC-rich DNA sequences, we exchanged the pairs of consecutive zinc fingers between GST-Sp1 and GST-MAZ (Figs. 3 D, 4, E and F). The binding of the chimera GST-Sp1/MAZ to both Sp1- and MAZ-binding sites was unchanged after the pairs of zinc fingers had been exchanged with one another, indicating that the pairs of consecutive zinc finger motifs could substitute for one another. Moreover, the extent of the repression of the MAZ-CAT reporter was similar with the reciprocal combination of Sp1 and MAZ expression vectors (Fig. 4 D). These results confirmed that the pairs of adjacent zinc fingers in Sp1 and MAZ were essential for the binding to GC-rich sequences. Our data suggest that two consecutive zinc fingers might be essential for interactions with cis-elements and might play a critical role in the regulation of expression of genes with GC-rich elements. The high resolution structures of complexes of the zinc finger proteins Zif268 and GLI with DNA provide a basis for the modeling of other zinc finger proteins (31Elrod-Erickson M. Benson T.E. Pabo C.O. Structure. 1998; 6: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 32Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Computer analysis revealed that Sp1 and MAZ most closely resemble Zif268 and GLI, respectively, so we generated models of Sp1-DNA and MAZ-DNA complexes that were based on the structures of the Zif268-DNA and GLI-DNA complexes (Fig.5). The model of the Sp1-DNA complex suggests that the Sp1 protein has at least seven residues, namely Lys-550, Ser-552, Arg-580, Glu-583, Arg-586, Asp-610, and His-611, that make direct contact with bases in the DNA. Furthermore, Lys-535, Arg-555, His-557, Arg-559, Arg-565, Lys-576, Thr-579, Gln-585, Lys-595, and Lys-604 appear to make contact with the backbone of the DNA (Figs.5, A–C). In the model of the MAZ-DNA complex, Arg-318, Arg-321, Arg-357, Lys-378, Arg-380, Arg-382, Tyr-405, and Asp-408 make contact with bases, whereas Lys-317, Lys-319, Asp-320, Lys-344, Ser-347, Arg-348, His-351, Gln-358, Arg-364, His-384, Arg-387, Lys-391, Lys-399, and Lys-411 make contact with the backbone of the DNA (Figs.5, D–F). The model structures indicate, furthermore, that the second and third zinc fingers of Sp1 and the third and fourth zinc fingers of MAZ are more important than the other zinc fingers in recognition of the DNA-binding site. We also examined mutant Sp1 and MAZ proteins, in which pairs of zinc fingers had been exchanged with another, to determine whether the details of resultant contacts with DNA might differ from those of the wild-type proteins. The models indicated that the DNA binding features of the chimeric constructs, namely Sp1-X (Fig. 5 A) and MAZ-X (Fig. 5 D), were not significantly different from those of the wild-type proteins. These observations are supported by our studies of DNA binding activities (Fig. 3 D) and the regulation of gene expression (Figs. 4,D and F). Although the amino-terminal transactivation domains of the two proteins exhibit less extensive homology, the DNA binding abilities of Sp1 and MAZ are very similar. In fact, two consecutive zinc fingers of Sp1 and MAZ can be interchanged without loss of the ability to repress transcription (Figs. 4, E andF). We do not know the exact roles in vivo of Sp1 and MAZ in the control of transcription of the target genes with GC-rich elements. Our transcription experiments indicated that the extent of regulation of expression of a target gene with GC-rich elements by Sp1 and MAZ is dose-dependent. We cannot rule out the possibility that each factor might function at different stages of the cell cycle and might recruit different cofactors to the samecis-elements. Further studies are required for a full understanding the molecular mechanism of action of Sp1 and MAZ in vivo, but it is clear that two consecutive zinc finger motifs in Sp1 and in MAZ are essential for the binding of these proteins to DNA and for the coordinated repression of transcription.

Phenoxybenzamine (PB) is an irreversible, subtype-nonselective α-AR antagonist. PB has been used as a pharmacological tool to study α-AR subpopulations in tissue preparations. PB was also the first α-AR antagonist to be therapeutically evaluated in humans. It produces long lasting α-AR blockade and reduces blood pressure, but its clinical use was limited by severe side effects (10Hoffman B. Lefkowitz R.J. Hardman J. Limbird L.

Chem. 1995; 38: 3681-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although the pharmacology of PB has been studied quite extensively, the molecular basis of its interaction with α-ARs has not been examined in detail. It is known that β-haloalkylamines, such as PB, cyclize in aqueous solution to form an unstable aziridinium ion, which can bind to target proteins with a strong ionic bond. The aziridinium ion then opens to create a reactive intermediate, with the consequence that a covalent bond between the drug molecule and the binding site can be formed. Side chains of amino acid residues that can be alkylated by haloalkylamines include –SH, –OH, =NH, and -COOH (13Jenkinson D. Foreman J. Johansen T. Textbook of Receptor Pharmacology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 3-62Google Scholar). Of the susceptible amino acid residues, cysteine (–SH) is the most reactive (14Shulman-Roskes E.M. Noe D.A. Gamcsik M.P. Marlow A.L. Hilton J. Hausheer F.H. Colvin O.M. Ludeman S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 515-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The helical arrangement of the TM domains indicated by receptor modeling (15Cockcroft V. Frang H. Pihlavisto M. Marjamäki A. Scheinin M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1705-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 16Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in conjunction with analysis of sequence alignments (see Fig. 1), suggested to us an interaction between PB and the TM3 region of the α-ARs. The amino acid sequence alignment of TM3 of adrenergic receptors presented in Fig. 1is validated by the position of the conserved aspartate residue (D3.32 according to the nomenclature of Ballesteros and Weinstein (17Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. Receptor Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 366-427Google Scholar) or position 113 in the α2A-AR), known to be crucial for binding the charged nitrogen present in adrenergic phenethylamine ligands (7Kobilka B.K. Pharmacol. Commun. 1995; 6: 119-124Google Scholar, 9Wang C.D. Buck M.A. Fraser C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 168-179PubMed Google Scholar). According to our hypothesis, the reactive aziridinium derivative of PB forms a covalent bond with C3.36 in TM3 of the α2A-, α2B- and α2C-AR (Fig. 2) (corresponding to amino acid residues 117, 96 and 135, respectively). Also the three α1-AR subtypes have a cysteine in this position, but the three β-AR subtypes have a valine residue in its place (Fig. 1). To test our hypothesis, we determined the irreversible binding of PB to the three human α2-AR subtypes and constructed and tested an α2A-AR mutant lacking the Cys117 (Cys117 was substituted with valine; α2A-C117V). We also tested the effect of PB on the human β2-AR, which has a valine (V3.36) in the position corresponding to Cys117 in α2A-AR and a cysteine (C3.35) in the preceding position (Fig. 1). The wild-type recombinant β2-AR was resistant to the alkylating effect of PB, which indicated that this position is not exposed in the cavity. To confirm the structural orientation of TM3, α2A-AR was mutated to resemble β2-AR (α2A-F116C/C117V) and vice versa (β2-V117C). The α2A-F116C/C117V mutant was resistant to the alkylating effect of PB, whereas β2-V117C was irreversibly inactivated by PB treatment, confirming that a cysteine in position 3.36 is required for alkylation of adrenergic receptors by PB and that position 3.35 is unreachable by ligands in the binding crevice and probably points toward another TM helix or the lipid bilayer.Figure 2Stereoview of the hypothetical molecular model of the binary complex of phenoxybenzamine covalently coupled to Cys117 (C3.36) of the α2A-AR.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed utilizing the Altered Sites II in vitromutagenesis system (Promega). Mutated α2-AR cDNAs were subcloned into the KpnI/BamHI sites of the expression vector pREP4 (Invitrogen). The wild-type β2- and mutated β2-AR cDNAs were subcloned into thePvuII site of the vector pREP4. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing wild-type α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-AR were established as described earlier (19Pohjanoksa K. Jansson C.C. Luomala K. Marjamäki A. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 335: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Adherent CHO cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured as reported previously (16Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pREP4-based expression constructs were transfected into cells using the Lipofectin reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-resistant (450 µg/ml) cell cultures expressing wild-type and mutated α2A- and β2-ARs were tested for their ability to bind the radioligands [ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 or [3H]CGP-12177. The transfected cells chosen for further experiments were subsequently maintained in 150 µg/ml hygromycin B. Cells were harvested into chilled phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, washed, suspended in ice-cold 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 at 25 °C), and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer (model T25; Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany; 9500 rpm, twice for 10 s). The homogenate was used for saturation and competition binding assays or receptor inactivation experiments. Saturation binding assays were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer as described previously (20Halme M. Sjöholm B. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whole-cell homogenates containing 20–50 µg of protein were incubated in 250 µl of buffer with radioligand (0.125–8 nm) at 25 °C. Specificity of binding was defined with 10 µm phentolamine or 10 µm propranolol (for α2- or β2-ARs, respectively). Competition binding assays were carried out essentially as reported previously (20Halme M. Sjöholm B. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using [ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 or [3H]CGP-12177 concentrations close to their affinity constants (K d) at each receptor and 14 concentrations of PB or phentolamine. For receptor inactivation assays, cell homogenates were incubated with PB (10 pm-10 µm) in 2.5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer for 30 or 60 min at 37 °C. The protein concentration was 0.6–0.9 mg/ml during PB treatment. Next, membranes were pelleted at 40,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed twice with 2.5 ml of ice-cold K+-phosphate buffer, and rehomogenized. Control samples were treated in an identical manner but without PB. Residual receptor binding capacity in the membranes was assessed by incubation (0.2–0.4 mg protein/assay tube) with 2 nm [ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 or [3H]CGP-12177. Nonspecific radioligand binding was again determined by including 10 µm phentolamine or propranolol in parallel assays. A model of the human α2A-AR was built as described earlier (15Cockcroft V. Frang H. Pihlavisto M. Marjamäki A. Scheinin M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1705-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Phenoxybenzamine was manually docked into the binding cavity. A covalent bond was introduced between the terminal carbon of theN-chloroethylene group of the ligand and the sulfur atom of the Cys117 side chain. Two 9-mer oligopeptides, Val-Leu-Phe-Cys-Thr-Ser-Ser-Ile-Val corresponding to residues 114–122 of the wild-type α2A-AR and Val-Leu-Phe-Val-Thr-Ser-Ser-Ile-Val representing the same region of the α2A-C117V mutant receptor, were synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl) techniques. To 0.2 mm oligopeptide in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.4, at 24 °C), 1.2 molar equivalents of 5 mmPB were added. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, 1 volume of acetonitrile was added to dissolve the precipitated product, and the reaction mixture was analyzed with high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (PE Sciex API 365). To investigate the orientation of a cysteine residue in position 117 in TM3 of the α2A-AR (C3.36) and a valine in this position in the β2-AR (V3.36) and to study the α-helical orientation of this region, the following three receptor variants were generated: α2A-C117V, α2A-F116C/C117V, and β2-V117C. The introduced mutations and the absence of secondary mutations were confirmed with an ABI377 automated sequencer. Mutated and wild-type receptors were expressed in CHO cells. Hygromycin B-resistant cell cultures were tested for their ability to bind the α2-AR antagonist [ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 or the β2-AR antagonist [3H]CGP-12177. The transfected cells chosen for further experiments (TableI) were maintained in 150 µg/ml hygromycin B. Saturation isotherms of [ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 and [3H]CGP-12177 binding and LIGAND- derivedK d (receptor affinity) andB max (receptor density) values were determined for each cell line. The binding affinities of the receptor mutants α2A-C117V, α2A-F116C/C117V, and β2-V117C for the employed radioligands were comparable with the wild-type receptors (Table I).Table ICharacterization of wild-type and mutated α2A- and β2-ARs expressed in CHO cellsReceptorSaturation assay with [ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 or [3H]CGP-12177Competition assayPBPhentolamineB max (fmol/mg of protein)K d(nm)Apparent K i(µm)Apparent K i(µm)α2B-wt1740 ± 1330.17 ± 0.030.01 ± 0NDα2C-wt3610 ± 1930.61 ± 0.110.06 ± 0.09NDα2A-wt (Cys117)4340 ± 610.21 ± 0.010.06 ± 00.01 ± 0α2A-C117V410 ± 70.25 ± 0.011.05 ± 0.070.45 ± 0.01α2A-F116C/C117V441 ± 20.30 ± 0.021.27 ± 0.040.28 ± 0β2-wt (Val117)896 ± 40.11 ± 0.0136.3 ± 2.651940 ± 1250β2-V117C187 ± 50.16 ± 01.54 ± 0.06740 ± 270Results from saturation and competition binding assays are shown.

Results are means ± S.E. from three to six separate experiments performed in duplicate. ND, not determined; wt, wild-type. To validate the experimental conditions in the PB inactivation assay, we first compared the effect of PB treatment (10 pm-10 µm) with two incubation times (30 or 60 min) on the capacity of [ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 and [3H]CGP-12177 binding in CHO cell homogenates expressing wild-type α2- and β2-ARs (data not shown). In subsequent experiments, PB was used at concentrations of 30, 60, and 90 nm for α2-ARs and 1 and 10 µm for β2-ARs. The incubation of cell homogenates for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence (control) and presence of PB was chosen as optimal for inactivation assays. We first tested the alkylating effect of PB on the three human α2-AR subtypes (α2A, α2B, and α2C) expressed in CHO cells. PB treatment (90 nm, 30 min) reduced the binding capacity of α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-AR by 81, 96, and 77%, respectively (Fig. 3). This was in agreement with the involvement of an exposed cysteine in TM3 of the α2-ARs in the alkylating effect of PB (C3.36 or positions 117, 96, and 135 in subtypes A, B, and C, respectively). We also demonstrated in separate saturation binding experiments that after irreversible PB treatment the number of available α2A-AR binding sites was decreased with no effect on [ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 binding affinity (B max = 4640 ± 255 nmand K d = 0.23 ± 0.06 fmol/mg protein before and B max = 447 ± 22 nm andK d = 0.21 ± 0.06 fmol/mg protein after PB treatment). To further characterize the interaction of PB with TM3 cysteines, we compared the effects of PB treatment on α2A- and β2-ARs. Instead of a cysteine, the human β2-AR contains a valine in the corresponding position (V3.36). Incubation with PB (90 nm, 30 min) inactivated 81% of α2A-AR, but β2-AR binding was not affected (inactivation 0%). When C3.36 of α2A-AR was mutated to valine, the mutated receptor α2A-C117V became relatively resistant to the alkylating effect of PB (inactivation 10% at 90 nm, 30 min). Also an α2A-AR mutant containing a cysteine in the preceding position (α2A-F116C/C117V), resembling the β2-AR, was resistant to alkylation by PB (inactivation 7%) (Fig. 4). As the expression level of the wild-type α2A-AR in these experiments was about 10-fold higher than the expression levels of the α2A-C117V and α2A-F116C/C117V receptor mutants (Table I), we later performed PB inactivation experiments with another batch of cells expressing wild-type α2A-AR at only 284 ± 5 fmol/mg total cellular protein. These receptor inactivation results were similar to those in Table I (inactivation 73%). However, the inactivation was dependent on the concentration of PB. We tested the α2A-AR wild-type (Fig.5) and mutated receptors also with 1 and 10 µm PB. All three receptors were potently inactivated by these high concentrations of PB (inactivation with 1/10 µm PB was 89.3/99.5%, 41.5/98.3%, and 62.8/97.5% for wild-type α2A-AR, α2A-C117V, and α2A-F116C/C117V, respectively).Figure 5Effect of preincubation with PB on ligand binding capacity of wild-type (wt) human α2A-AR and human β2-AR and the mutant β2-V117C receptor with a cysteine introduced into position 117. The receptors were incubated in the absence (control) and presence of PB (1 and 10 µm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Residual α2A- and β2-AR binding was determined by incubation with 2 nm[ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 or [3H]CGP-12177. For experimental details, see the legend of Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After the opposite mutation in β2-AR (V3.36to cysteine, to resemble the α2A-AR), this receptor became susceptible to the alkylating effect of 10 µm PB (inactivation 93%). The wild-type β2-AR was relatively resistant to PB alkylation even with such a high PB concentration (inactivation 26%) (Fig. 5). This confirmed our hypothesis of a structure-activity relationship between the alkylating effect of PB and an exposed cysteine residue in position 3.36 (117 in α2A-AR and β2-V117C) in TM3 of adrenergic receptors. This also indicated that the preceding position (F3.35 in α2A- and C3.35 in β2-AR) is not exposed in the binding pocket and thus not accessible for PB and other receptor ligands. To confirm the covalent bonding of PB to Cys117 in TM3 of α2A-AR, PB was reacted in aqueous solution with a synthetic 9-mer peptide corresponding to residues 114–122 of TM3 of the receptor. After 2 h of incubation, mass spectroscopic analysis revealed that all PB had hydrolyzed (M+H+ m/z 286.4), acetylated in the employed acetate buffer (M+H+ m/z 328.5), or reacted with the thiol group of the peptide (M+2(H+) m/z 619.0, M+H+ m/z 1236.1). The reference peptide with a valine substituted for the cysteine in position 117 did not react with PB. The identified reaction products are illustrated in Fig. 6. All wild-type and mutated receptors were tested with PB also under competition binding assay conditions (Table I). At all receptor variants, PB inhibited specific binding of 2 nm[ethyl-3H]RS79948–197 or [3H]CGP-12177 in the competitive assays with steep monophasic competition curves, indicating that the lack of alkylation by PB was not because of lack of binding affinity but rather because of the absence of an accessible cysteine in the binding cavity. The three PB-resistant receptors, α2A-C117V, α2A-F116C/C117V and β2-AR, were also capable of binding PB, although with lower apparent affinity than the PB-sensitive receptors (Table I). Competition binding assays were also performed with phentolamine, another subtype-nonselective α2-AR antagonist. The substitution of Cys117of α2A-AR with valine resulted in 28–45-fold decreases in the affinity of the receptor for phentolamine (Table I). Phentolamine was bound with low affinity to both wild-type β2-AR and the β2-V117C mutant receptor. We have here demonstrated that an exposed cysteine residue, C3.36, in position 117/96/135 in the binding cavity of α2A/α2B/α2C-AR is required for the alkylating effect of the irreversible α-AR antagonist, PB. The present work also shows that the depth of the ligand binding cavity extends to at least one helical turn below the conserved D3.32 in the adrenergic receptors. Introduction of a valine into position 3.36 makes the α2A-AR resistant to PB (α2A-C117V). The β2-AR has a valine in this position and a cysteine in the preceding position and is resistant to the alkylating effect of PB. However, when V3.36 was substituted by cysteine, the β2-V117C receptor mutant became susceptible to irreversible inactivation by PB. It has been reported previously that position 116 in β2-AR, i.e. C3.35, is not involved in recognition and binding of β-AR antagonists (21Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis and modeling of the α1B-AR has also clearly indicated that the residue in position 3.35 points toward TM2 and is not exposed in the cavity (22Perez D.M. Hwa J. Gaivin R. Mathur M. Brown F. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 112-122PubMed Google Scholar,23Porter J.E. Perez D.M. J. Biol.

Our second PB-resistant α2A-AR mutant, α2A-F116C/C117V, also supports a hypothetical structural orientation of TM3, where position 116 (3.35) is not exposed in the binding cavity and is unreachable by PB. Position 3.36 in the middle of the TM3 segment has also been shown to be exposed in the receptor binding-site crevice of other non-adrenergic monoamine receptors, such as the dopamine D2 receptor (Cys118) (25Javitch J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14672-14675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the PB-resistant α2A-AR mutants with high PB concentrations indicated that there must be other sites in the receptor protein in addition to the investigated TM3 cysteine that are susceptible to alkylation by PB. Mass spectroscopic analysis of the reaction products obtained from incubation of PB with a synthetic peptide corresponding to this region of TM3 verified that PB indeed forms a covalent bond with the cysteine residue. No reaction product was generated when PB was incubated with a control peptide with a valine in place of the cysteine. In the inactivation assay with 10 µm PB, [3H]CGP-12177 binding to the wild-type β2-AR was inhibited by 26%, indicating that PB might have interactions with other sites in the β2-AR binding cavity, lacking a cysteine in position 3.36. However, Gether et al. (21Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown previously that none of the five cysteines located in the TM domains of the β2-AR (Cys77, Cys116, Cys125, Cys285, and Cys327) are essential for β2-antagonist binding. Indeed, studies with the cysteine-reactive reagent 2-aminoethyl methane thiosulfnate indicated that none of these cysteines is exposed in the water-accessible binding site crevice (29Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The observed effect of the employed high PB concentration may thus represent interactions with other reactive amino acid side chains than –SH of an exposed cysteine. The mutant receptors bound the employed radioligands with similar affinities compared with the wild-type receptors, which verified the proper expression and folding of the modified proteins. Competition binding assays showed that the PB-resistant receptors α2A-C117V, α2A-F116C/C117V, and β2-AR were also capable of binding PB, although with reduced apparent affinity, indicating that the lack of alkylation by PB was not because of lack of binding affinity. It should be noted that the true affinity of an irreversible ligand cannot be determined reliably in competition binding assays, and the apparent affinity of PB determined in this way actually represents both reversible and irreversible binding and grossly overestimates the affinity of the PB-susceptible receptors (16Marjamäki A. Pihlavisto M. Cockcroft V. Heinonen P. Savola J.-M. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Michel M.C. Kerker J. Branchek T.A. Forray C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1165-1170PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine substitutions in the binding cavity can, however, have structure-dependent selective effects on ligand binding affinities. That this indeed is the case for α2A-AR was indicated by our preliminary experiments with another α2-AR radioligand, [3H]RX821002. No specific binding was detected for this radioligand at α2-C117V and α2-F116C/C117V (results not shown), despite adequate receptor expression levels as determined in assays with [3H]RS79948–197. RX821002 is an imidazoline derivative that interacts with TM3 of α2-ARs, and we therefore wanted to test another widely used imidazoline derivative, phentolamine, as a reference compound. Phentolamine does not bind irreversibly to adrenoreceptors, and its true affinity can be determined in competition binding assays. The affinity of phentolamine at mutated α2A-ARs lacking C3.36 was clearly lower than at the wild-type receptor. This indicates that C3.36 is important for binding of imidazoline derivatives and further supports the location of this residue in the binding cavity. PB is not an imidazoline, and its binding mode in the α2A-AR binding cavity is different from phentolamine and RX821002. Our subsequent competition binding assays with structurally diverse α2-AR ligands indicate that the effects of the C3.36 substitution are specific for imidazoline and imidazole derivatives. 2H. Frang, A.-M. Hoffrén, A. Marjamäki, and M. Scheinen, manuscript in preparation. Using irreversible binding of the α-AR antagonist PB as a criterion for identifying a sulfhydryl side chain of an endogenous or introduced cysteine as being exposed in the ligand-accessible binding cavity of the receptor, we have demonstrated that C3.36(Cys117) in the TM3 domain of the α2A-AR is responsible for binding PB. This cysteine also appears to be important in interactions with other receptor antagonists, as indicated by the observed decrease in the affinity for the imidazoline derivative phentolamine when C3.36 was substituted with valine. The structural orientation of the TM3 domain of α2A-AR, where amino acid residues D3.32 and C3.36 point into the binding cavity, and F3.35 is not exposed in the cavity, may, however, represent only one receptor conformation. All G-protein-coupled receptors are thought to exist in an equilibrium between two or more conformations or allosteric states, R and R* (29Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol.

As we approach two decades since the first identification of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), currently, only one subunit vaccine candidate has reached phase 3 of clinical trials.

Intensive attempts at producing a subunit-based, particle vaccine have led to only one vaccine candidate of this type to reach phase 3 clinical trial. Indeed, it is even unclear that subunit vaccines could inherently provide sufficient protection against HIV-1 (1Altman, L. K. (1998) in New York Times, New York.Google Scholar). In the macaque model of AIDS, subunit particles have consistently failed to induce protective immunity (reviewed in Ref. 2Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the same macaque model, a live attenuated virus approach has worked efficaciously. Several investigators have shown that macaques inoculated with replication-competent SIV, attenuated by virtue of deletions in the viral genome, developed an immune response, which protected the animals from subsequent challenge with wild-type virus (3Daniel M.D. Kirchhoff F.

Paradoxically the same attenuated SIV inocula, which induced protective immunity in most animals, could cause disease in a minority of other animals (5Connor R.I. Montefiori D.C. Binley J.M. Moore J.P. Bonhoeffer S. Gettie A. Fenamore E.A. Sheridan K.E. Ho D.D. Dailey P.J. Marx P.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7501-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Baba T.W. Jeong Y.S. Pennick D. Bronson R.

Thus, these live SIV vaccine results highlight a paramount concern, which confronts the development of a live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine: the potential for vaccine-induced “breakthrough” infections.Extant findings in humans suggest that such safety concern is more than academic. An Australian cohort infected with HIV-1 via blood product transfusion from a single donor (9Deacon N.J. Tsykin A. Solomon A. Smith K. Ludford-Menting M. Hooker D.J. McPhee D.A. Greenway A.L. Ellett A. Chatfield C. Lawson V.A. Crowe S. Maerz A. Sonza S. Learmont J. Sullivan J.S. Cunningham A. Dwyer D. Dowton D. Mills J. Science. 1995; 270: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) serves as an illustration. Initially, these individuals maintained stable CD4 lymphocyte counts and showed no overt clinical progression for 10–14 years (the donor gave blood over a 3.5-year period). When the infecting HIV-1 was characterized, it was found to contain deletions in U3 LTR- andnef-coding regions, suggesting such changes sufficiently attenuated pathogenicity potentially creating a safe vaccine virus. However, subsequent follow-up (∼16 years after infection) data were instructive: CD4 lymphocyte decline and increasing HIV-1 loads did become evident in the original blood donor and two sero-converted recipients (10Learmont J.C. Geczy A.F. Mills J. Ashton L.J. Raynes-Greenow C.H. Garsia R.J. Dyer W.B. McIntyre L. Oelrichs R.B. Rhodes D.I. Deacon N.J. Sullivan J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, this cohort testifies to a very real safety concern for live HIV vaccine: the potential evolution of an attenuated live virus to virulence.Current state of live HIV vaccine development is framed by two competing observations: 1) live attenuated SIV vaccine can be fully protective in vivo (3Daniel M.D. Kirchhoff F. Czajak S.C. Sehgal P.K. Desrosiers R.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1938-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 4Almond N. Kent K. Cranage M. Rud E. Clarke B. Stott E.J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 3724-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 2) uncontrolled replication of a live attenuated retrovirus has a finite risk for emergence of virulence as a result of genetic errors produced over time by reverse-transcriptase (11Coffin J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 12Berkhout B. Verhoef K. van Wamel J.L. Back N.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within this context, a live attenuated HIV-1 whose replication is not constitutive but is instead conditionally regulated (such that rounds of reverse transcription with accompanying potential for error are strictly limited) might yield a paradigm that minimizes evolution to virulence. Previously, we and others (13Smith S.M. Markham R.B. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Chakrabarti B.K. Maitra R.K. Ma X.Z. Kestler H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9810-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have broached the concept of conditional control of HIV-1 and SIV through gain-of-function. Here, we describe the design for a constitutively dead HIV-1, which can be conditionally resuscitated to live by tetracycline.DISCUSSIONVaccines have been one of the most important medical achievements for infectious diseases. Over the past century, successful implementation of vaccines has led to the control of smallpox, measles, rubella, tetanus, and diphtheria among many other pathogens. In the face of the modern HIV/AIDS pandemic in which 15,000 new infections occur each day, 21.8 million individuals cumulatively have succumbed to AIDS, 13 million children have been orphaned by this scourge, and 34 million people are currently infected with HIV, it is glaringly regrettable that no effective and safe AIDS vaccine is yet within sight. Indeed, it is sobering that after 15 years of research and development only one vaccine concept, a recombinant gp120 subunit protein, has reached phase III clinical trial. Even more disappointing is the fact that the gp120 subunit approach, at best, solely elicits antibody immunity to HIV. The natural course of HIV-1 infectionin vivo suggests that the virus can effectively evade humoral immunity, and few vaccinologists currently believe that a vaccine, which induces only antibodies without a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, has any real chance for success against HIV-1 (30Nathanson N. Mathieson B.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).All current vaccines fall within two broad concepts, live or dead. Live vaccines encompass attenuated natural microbes (viruses, bacteria, etc.) as well as recombinant vectors, which provide immunogenicity at reduced pathogenicity (reviewed in Ref. 31Liljeqvist S. Stahl S. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 73: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Dead vaccines include inactivated whole pathogens and protein subunits of pathogens. Both live and dead vaccines elicit antibody responses. However, only live vaccines can utilize efficiently the intracellular major histocompatibility class I pathway to induce CTL. Dead vaccines, on the other hand, are generally safe with no potential for reversion from avirulence to virulence. Considering the attributes of both live and dead vaccines, one might reason that a dead/live hybrid HIV vaccine could offer adequate immunogenicity with an acceptable safety profile.No vaccine is entirely risk-free. Extant data from SIV vaccine research support the notion that a live attenuated virus can be sufficiently protective in vivo against disease development, albeit currently with an unacceptable risk of reversion to virulence (6Wyand M.S. Manson K.H. Garcia-Moll M. Montefiori D. Desrosiers R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3724-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Baba T.W. Jeong Y.S. Pennick D. Bronson R. Greene M.F. Ruprecht R.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 8Baba T.W. Liska V. Khimani A.H. Ray N.B. Dailey P.J. Pennick D. Bronson R. Greene M.F. McClure H.M. Martin L.N. Ruprecht R.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). With the aim of a safer live attenuated virus, we have constructed two forms of HIV-1 (pHIV-DoxT and pHIV-DoxSp) that marry the dead + live concepts of vaccine design. Thus pHIV-DoxT and pHIV-DoxSp are constitutively dead by virtue of being TAR(−). Each can, however, be conditionally resuscitated to live for expression of proteins, replication of genome, and assembly of mature viral particles. Indeed, upon provision of doxycycline, both genomes compare favorably to wild-type HIV-1 in robustness of expression, synthesizing all viral proteins except Nef (Fig. 3, A and B). The Nef deletion in these genomes provides an additional safety feature, since various in vivo findings have verified nef(−)HIV-1 to be highly attenuated in pathogenicity when compared with its wild-type counterpart (9Deacon N.J. Tsykin A. Solomon A. Smith K. Ludford-Menting M. Hooker D.J. McPhee D.A. Greenway A.L. Ellett A. Chatfield C. Lawson V.A. Crowe S. Maerz A. Sonza S. Learmont J. Sullivan J.S. Cunningham A. Dwyer D. Dowton D. Mills J. Science. 1995; 270: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 10Learmont J.C. Geczy A.F. Mills J. Ashton L.J. Raynes-Greenow C.H. Garsia R.J. Dyer W.B. McIntyre L. Oelrichs R.B. Rhodes D.I. Deacon N.J. Sullivan J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 32Kirchhoff F. Greenough T.C. Brettler D.B. Sullivan J.L. Desrosiers R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 33Salvi R. Garbuglia A.R. Di Caro A. Pulciani S. Montella F. Benedetto A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3646-3657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is our persuasion, supported in part by experimental findings (Fig. 5), that pHIV-DoxT and pHIV-DoxSp have highly attenuated replication such that while these viruses can infect cells, actively synthesize viral antigens, and replicate in vivo, they do so with an efficiency unlikely to cause disease.A recent International AIDS Vaccine Initiative report (34International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2000) AIDS Vaccines for the World: Preparing Now to Assure Access: an IAVI Blueprint, July 9, 2000, New York.Google Scholar) criticizes the absence of better vaccine designs as a basic research barrier to successful vaccine development. International AIDS Vaccine Initiative recommended that “it is imperative that new and innovative vaccine designs capable of eliciting the broadest and most robust immune responses against HIV be considered” (35International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2000) IAVI Scientific Blueprint 2000, Accelerating Global Efforts in AIDS Vaccine Development, July 2000, New York.Google Scholar). How might HIV-Dox fulfill this recommendation? We note that all reading frames (except Nef) are intact in HIV-Dox, and viral protein expression in the presence of doxycycline is to wild-type levels. Currently, it is not known which HIV proteins are the best immunogens. While most vectors have been designed to express structural proteins, such as Gag and Env, new animal studies indicate that accessory proteins, such as Tat, may elicit more protective immune responses (36Cafaro A. Caputo A. Fracasso C. Maggiorella M.T. Goletti D. Baroncelli S. Pace M. Sernicola L. Koanga-Mogtomo M.L. Betti M. Borsetti A. Belli R. Akerblom L. Corrias F. Butto S. Heeney J. Verani P. Titti F. Ensoli B. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Consequently, a vector such as HIV-Dox, which produces the full complement of HIV-1 proteins except Nef, offers perhaps the best opportunity for broad immunity. Furthermore, the conditionally live aspect of HIV-Dox provides for CTL induction, an option not effectively achievable with protein subunit inoculation.Perhaps the most significant concept introduced by the CDCL genomes is that the constitutive ability of live attenuated viruses to autonomously evolve is now subject to interruption. It is well established that the propensity of attenuated precursor viruses to evolve to virulent progenies correlates directly with the number of replicative opportunities the former is afforded in vivo(37Kelly J.K. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 180: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 38Editorial J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 277: 525-526Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Some rounds of intracellular replication of HIV-1 are clearly required for CTL elicitation; however, beyond that, each additional round presents incremental opportunity for acquisition of genome changes with attendant risks of increased virulence. Conventional live attenuated HIV-1 approach offers no control against this process of virulent evolution. By contrast the CDCL approach mandates a cessation to replication unless demanded by provision of doxycycline. Hence, unlike the conventional default, which drives replication, the CDCL default is entirely opposite. Thus CDCL can be superior to live in offering an otherwise unavailable possibility for fine-tuning replication only to the extent beneficial for CTL creation.The CDCL genomes introduce a new safety feature yet considered in current live HIV vaccine designs. Presumably, this concept extends beyond tetracycline regulation to other yet anticipated means for producing constitutively dead conditionally live phenotypes. To the extent that live vaccines might ultimately be a viable solution for AIDS in developing (as well as developed) countries, we and others (39Verhoef K. Marzio G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggest that CDCL vaccines represent an incremental refinement which merit discussion and further experimental investigation.We suggest that the CDCL genomes provide improved safety profiles when compared with constitutively replicating live attenuated genomes. Our findings, which are independently supported by observations from others (39Verhoef K. Marzio G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), indicate that the replication of HIV-DoxT and HIV-DoxSp are completely doxycycline-dependent. It is not fully understood as to what are the many determinants that govern kinetically the reversion of the various attenuating changes that have been experimentally engineered into replication competent HIV-1 proviruses. Empirically, some changes revert quickly (13Smith S.M. Markham R.B. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Liang C. Rong L. Russell R.S. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6251-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Guan Y. Whitney J.B. Diallo K. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8854-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), while others are durable (42Quinto I. Mallardo M. Baldassarre F. Scala G. Englund G. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17567-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Currently, we have no evidence for (although we do not exclude a formal possibility of) the HIV-DoxSp or HIV-DoxT genome to revert to virulence during doxycycline-dependent replication. When uninterrupted replication was examined over 89 days (Fig. 6) to 6 months (data not shown), no changes were seen in our engineered mutation in TAR. Based on our experience, the 9-base pair mutation in TAR cannot be compensated by second site changes elsewhere in the HIV-1 genome. Hence, within that context, these tar(−) doxycycline-dependent proviruses remain fully attenuated.Our current study suggests that in ex vivo tissue culture setting, the CDCL concept as embodied by the HIV-DoxT and HIV-DoxSp genomes presents a highly regulated and stably attenuated virus/cell model, consistent with that desired for an in vivo vaccine. We stress that proof-of-concept ex vivo does not implyin vivo applicability. Nevertheless, comprehensive and open discussion of such concepts is in keeping with the urgency for “new and innovative vaccine design” at the basic science level (IAVI recommendation; Refs. 34International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2000) AIDS Vaccines for the World: Preparing Now to Assure Access: an IAVI Blueprint, July 9, 2000, New York.Google Scholar and 35International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2000) IAVI Scientific Blueprint 2000, Accelerating Global Efforts in AIDS Vaccine Development, July 2000, New York.Google Scholar) and cannot but help spur in vivo vaccine refinements. Indeed, in vivo testing by us (P. Marx) of Dox-regulated viral genomes in macaques is underway. A protective vaccine against HIV-11 remains elusive. Intensive attempts at producing a subunit-based, particle vaccine have led to only one vaccine candidate of this type to reach phase 3 clinical trial. Indeed, it is even unclear that subunit vaccines could inherently provide sufficient protection against HIV-1 (1Altman, L. K. (1998) in New York Times, New York.Google Scholar). In the macaque model of AIDS, subunit particles have consistently failed to induce protective immunity (reviewed in Ref. 2Johnson R.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the same macaque model, a live attenuated virus approach has worked efficaciously. Several investigators have shown that macaques inoculated with replication-competent SIV, attenuated by virtue of deletions in the viral genome, developed an immune response, which protected the animals from subsequent challenge with wild-type virus (3Daniel M.D. Kirchhoff F. Czajak S.C. Sehgal P.K. Desrosiers R.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1938-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 4Almond N. Kent K. Cranage M. Rud E. Clarke B. Stott E.J.

Paradoxically the same attenuated SIV inocula, which induced protective immunity in most animals, could cause disease in a minority of other animals (5Connor R.I. Montefiori D.C. Binley J.M. Moore J.P. Bonhoeffer S. Gettie A. Fenamore E.A. Sheridan K.E. Ho D.D. Dailey P.J. Marx P.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7501-7509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Baba T.W. Jeong Y.S. Pennick D. Bronson R.

Thus, these live SIV vaccine results highlight a paramount concern, which confronts the development of a live attenuated HIV-1 vaccine: the potential for vaccine-induced “breakthrough” infections. Extant findings in humans suggest that such safety concern is more than academic. An Australian cohort infected with HIV-1 via blood product transfusion from a single donor (9Deacon N.J. Tsykin A. Solomon A. Smith K. Ludford-Menting M. Hooker D.J. McPhee D.A. Greenway A.L. Ellett A. Chatfield C. Lawson V.A. Crowe S. Maerz A. Sonza S. Learmont J. Sullivan J.S. Cunningham A. Dwyer D. Dowton D. Mills J. Science. 1995; 270: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) serves as an illustration. Initially, these individuals maintained stable CD4 lymphocyte counts and showed no overt clinical progression for 10–14 years (the donor gave blood over a 3.5-year period). When the infecting HIV-1 was characterized, it was found to contain deletions in U3 LTR- andnef-coding regions, suggesting such changes sufficiently attenuated pathogenicity potentially creating a safe vaccine virus. However, subsequent follow-up (∼16 years after infection) data were instructive: CD4 lymphocyte decline and increasing HIV-1 loads did become evident in the original blood donor and two sero-converted recipients (10Learmont J.C. Geczy A.F. Mills J. Ashton L.J. Raynes-Greenow C.H. Garsia R.J. Dyer W.B. McIntyre L. Oelrichs R.B. Rhodes D.I. Deacon N.J. Sullivan J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, this cohort testifies to a very real safety concern for live HIV vaccine: the potential evolution of an attenuated live virus to virulence. Current state of live HIV vaccine development is framed by two competing observations: 1) live attenuated SIV vaccine can be fully protective in vivo (3Daniel M.D. Kirchhoff F. Czajak S.C. Sehgal P.K. Desrosiers R.C. Science. 1992; 258: 1938-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 4Almond N. Kent K. Cranage M. Rud E. Clarke B. Stott E.J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 3724-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 2) uncontrolled replication of a live attenuated retrovirus has a finite risk for emergence of virulence as a result of genetic errors produced over time by reverse-transcriptase (11Coffin J.M. Science. 1995; 267: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 12Berkhout B. Verhoef K. van Wamel J.L. Back N.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within this context, a live attenuated HIV-1 whose replication is not constitutive but is instead conditionally regulated (such that rounds of reverse transcription with accompanying potential for error are strictly limited) might yield a paradigm that minimizes evolution to virulence. Previously, we and others (13Smith S.M. Markham R.B. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Chakrabarti B.K. Maitra R.K. Ma X.Z. Kestler H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9810-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have broached the concept of conditional control of HIV-1 and SIV through gain-of-function. Here, we describe the design for a constitutively dead HIV-1, which can be conditionally resuscitated to live by tetracycline. DISCUSSIONVaccines have been one of the most important medical achievements for infectious diseases. Over the past century, successful implementation of vaccines has led to the control of smallpox, measles, rubella, tetanus, and diphtheria among many other pathogens. In the face of the modern HIV/AIDS pandemic in which 15,000 new infections occur each day, 21.8 million individuals cumulatively have succumbed to AIDS, 13 million children have been orphaned by this scourge, and 34 million people are currently infected with HIV, it is glaringly regrettable that no effective and safe AIDS vaccine is yet within sight. Indeed, it is sobering that after 15 years of research and development only one vaccine concept, a recombinant gp120 subunit protein, has reached phase III clinical trial. Even more disappointing is the fact that the gp120 subunit approach, at best, solely elicits antibody immunity to HIV. The natural course of HIV-1 infectionin vivo suggests that the virus can effectively evade humoral immunity, and few vaccinologists currently believe that a vaccine, which induces only antibodies without a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, has any real chance for success against HIV-1 (30Nathanson N. Mathieson B.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).All current vaccines fall within two broad concepts, live or dead. Live vaccines encompass attenuated natural microbes (viruses, bacteria, etc.) as well as recombinant vectors, which provide immunogenicity at reduced pathogenicity (reviewed in Ref. 31Liljeqvist S. Stahl S. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 73: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Dead vaccines include inactivated whole pathogens and protein subunits of pathogens. Both live and dead vaccines elicit antibody responses. However, only live vaccines can utilize efficiently the intracellular major histocompatibility class I pathway to induce CTL. Dead vaccines, on the other hand, are generally safe with no potential for reversion from avirulence to virulence. Considering the attributes of both live and dead vaccines, one might reason that a dead/live hybrid HIV vaccine could offer adequate immunogenicity with an acceptable safety profile.No vaccine is entirely risk-free. Extant data from SIV vaccine research support the notion that a live attenuated virus can be sufficiently protective in vivo against disease development, albeit currently with an unacceptable risk of reversion to virulence (6Wyand M.S. Manson K.H. Garcia-Moll M. Montefiori D. Desrosiers R.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3724-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Baba T.W. Jeong Y.S. Pennick D. Bronson R. Greene M.F. Ruprecht R.M.

Ruprecht R.M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). With the aim of a safer live attenuated virus, we have constructed two forms of HIV-1 (pHIV-DoxT and pHIV-DoxSp) that marry the dead + live concepts of vaccine design. Thus pHIV-DoxT and pHIV-DoxSp are constitutively dead by virtue of being TAR(−). Each can, however, be conditionally resuscitated to live for expression of proteins, replication of genome, and assembly of mature viral particles. Indeed, upon provision of doxycycline, both genomes compare favorably to wild-type HIV-1 in robustness of expression, synthesizing all viral proteins except Nef (Fig. 3, A and B). The Nef deletion in these genomes provides an additional safety feature, since various in vivo findings have verified nef(−)HIV-1 to be highly attenuated in pathogenicity when compared with its wild-type counterpart (9Deacon N.J. Tsykin A. Solomon A. Smith K. Ludford-Menting M. Hooker D.J. McPhee D.A. Greenway A.L. Ellett A. Chatfield C. Lawson V.A. Crowe S. Maerz A. Sonza S. Learmont J. Sullivan J.S. Cunningham A. Dwyer D. Dowton D. Mills J. Science. 1995; 270: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 10Learmont J.C. Geczy A.F. Mills J. Ashton L.J. Raynes-Greenow C.H. Garsia R.J. Dyer W.B. McIntyre L.

Virol. 1998; 72: 3646-3657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is our persuasion, supported in part by experimental findings (Fig. 5), that pHIV-DoxT and pHIV-DoxSp have highly attenuated replication such that while these viruses can infect cells, actively synthesize viral antigens, and replicate in vivo, they do so with an efficiency unlikely to cause disease.A recent International AIDS Vaccine Initiative report (34International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2000) AIDS Vaccines for the World: Preparing Now to Assure Access: an IAVI Blueprint, July 9, 2000, New York.Google Scholar) criticizes the absence of better vaccine designs as a basic research barrier to successful vaccine development. International AIDS Vaccine Initiative recommended that “it is imperative that new and innovative vaccine designs capable of eliciting the broadest and most robust immune responses against HIV be considered” (35International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2000) IAVI Scientific Blueprint 2000, Accelerating Global Efforts in AIDS Vaccine Development, July 2000, New York.Google Scholar). How might HIV-Dox fulfill this recommendation? We note that all reading frames (except Nef) are intact in HIV-Dox, and viral protein expression in the presence of doxycycline is to wild-type levels. Currently, it is not known which HIV proteins are the best immunogens. While most vectors have been designed to express structural proteins, such as Gag and Env, new animal studies indicate that accessory proteins, such as Tat, may elicit more protective immune responses (36Cafaro A. Caputo A. Fracasso C. Maggiorella M.T. Goletti D. Baroncelli S. Pace M. Sernicola L. Koanga-Mogtomo M.L. Betti M. Borsetti A. Belli R. Akerblom L. Corrias F. Butto S. Heeney J. Verani P. Titti F. Ensoli B. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Consequently, a vector such as HIV-Dox, which produces the full complement of HIV-1 proteins except Nef, offers perhaps the best opportunity for broad immunity. Furthermore, the conditionally live aspect of HIV-Dox provides for CTL induction, an option not effectively achievable with protein subunit inoculation.Perhaps the most significant concept introduced by the CDCL genomes is that the constitutive ability of live attenuated viruses to autonomously evolve is now subject to interruption. It is well established that the propensity of attenuated precursor viruses to evolve to virulent progenies correlates directly with the number of replicative opportunities the former is afforded in vivo(37Kelly J.K. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 180: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 38Editorial J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 277: 525-526Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Some rounds of intracellular replication of HIV-1 are clearly required for CTL elicitation; however, beyond that, each additional round presents incremental opportunity for acquisition of genome changes with attendant risks of increased virulence. Conventional live attenuated HIV-1 approach offers no control against this process of virulent evolution. By contrast the CDCL approach mandates a cessation to replication unless demanded by provision of doxycycline. Hence, unlike the conventional default, which drives replication, the CDCL default is entirely opposite. Thus CDCL can be superior to live in offering an otherwise unavailable possibility for fine-tuning replication only to the extent beneficial for CTL creation.The CDCL genomes introduce a new safety feature yet considered in current live HIV vaccine designs. Presumably, this concept extends beyond tetracycline regulation to other yet anticipated means for producing constitutively dead conditionally live phenotypes. To the extent that live vaccines might ultimately be a viable solution for AIDS in developing (as well as developed) countries, we and others (39Verhoef K. Marzio G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggest that CDCL vaccines represent an incremental refinement which merit discussion and further experimental investigation.We suggest that the CDCL genomes provide improved safety profiles when compared with constitutively replicating live attenuated genomes. Our findings, which are independently supported by observations from others (39Verhoef K. Marzio G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), indicate that the replication of HIV-DoxT and HIV-DoxSp are completely doxycycline-dependent. It is not fully understood as to what are the many determinants that govern kinetically the reversion of the various attenuating changes that have been experimentally engineered into replication competent HIV-1 proviruses. Empirically, some changes revert quickly (13Smith S.M. Markham R.B. Jeang K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7955-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Liang C. Rong L.

Virol. 2000; 74: 8854-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), while others are durable (42Quinto I. Mallardo M. Baldassarre F. Scala G. Englund G. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17567-17572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Currently, we have no evidence for (although we do not exclude a formal possibility of) the HIV-DoxSp or HIV-DoxT genome to revert to virulence during doxycycline-dependent replication. When uninterrupted replication was examined over 89 days (Fig. 6) to 6 months (data not shown), no changes were seen in our engineered mutation in TAR. Based on our experience, the 9-base pair mutation in TAR cannot be compensated by second site changes elsewhere in the HIV-1 genome. Hence, within that context, these tar(−) doxycycline-dependent proviruses remain fully attenuated.Our current study suggests that in ex vivo tissue culture setting, the CDCL concept as embodied by the HIV-DoxT and HIV-DoxSp genomes presents a highly regulated and stably attenuated virus/cell model, consistent with that desired for an in vivo vaccine. We stress that proof-of-concept ex vivo does not implyin vivo applicability. Nevertheless, comprehensive and open discussion of such concepts is in keeping with the urgency for “new and innovative vaccine design” at the basic science level (IAVI recommendation; Refs. 34International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2000) AIDS Vaccines for the World: Preparing Now to Assure Access: an IAVI Blueprint, July 9, 2000, New York.Google Scholar and 35International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2000) IAVI Scientific Blueprint 2000, Accelerating Global Efforts in AIDS Vaccine Development, July 2000, New York.Google Scholar) and cannot but help spur in vivo vaccine refinements.

Because peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is one of the few membrane-spanning proteins concentrated in secretory granules and is a known effector of regulated secretion, we examined its sensitivity to pH. Based on antibody binding experiments, the noncatalytic linker regions between the two enzymatic domains of PAM show pH-dependent conformational changes; these changes occur in the presence or absence of a transmembrane domain. Integral membrane PAM-1 solubilized from rat anterior pituitary or from transfected AtT-20 cells aggregates reversibly at pH 5.5 while retaining enzyme activity. Over 35% of the PAM-1 in anterior pituitary extracts aggregates at pH 5.5, whereas only about 5% aggregates at pH 7.5. PAM-1 recovered from secretory granules and endosomes is highly responsive to low pH-induced aggregation, whereas PAM-1 recovered from a light, intracellular recycling compartment is not. Mutagenesis studies indicate that a transmembrane domain is necessary but not sufficient for low pH-induced aggregation and reveal a short lumenal, juxtamembrane segment that also contributes to pH-dependent aggregation.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that several properties of membrane PAM serve as indicators of granule pH in neuroendocrine cells. trans-Golgi network peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase peptidyl-α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase approximately 70-kDa membrane-bound PAL peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase interleukin-2 receptor α chain large dense core vesicle transmembrane domain COOH-terminal domain of PAM, rPAM-1(900–976) antibody monoclonal antibody interleukin-2 receptor α 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid complete serum-free medium 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polyvinylidene difluoride 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Tac-PAM-PAM PAM-PAM-Tac PAM-Tac-Tac Maturation of bioactive peptides in the nervous and endocrine systems involves a series of post-translational processing steps that occur as precursor proteins and their products traverse the secretory pathway (1Seidah N.G.

Nature. 1973; 243: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) each demonstrate reversible, low pH, high calcium-dependent aggregation. Peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) has also been found among the group of proteins that form aggregates (13Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This tendency to aggregate appears to be specific to proteins belonging to the regulated secretory pathway, because constitutively secreted proteins, such as immunoglobulin, albumin, and angiotensinogen, remain soluble at low pH, even in the presence of calcium (13Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the exact function of protein aggregation is unknown, it is postulated that this process contributes to the sorting of secretory proteins (5Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Most of the processing of peptides and proteins in the secretory pathway occurs during formation of the immature and mature secretory granules, and acidification appears to play an important role in restricting proteolytic processing to late secretory compartments. Proopiomelanocortin, the precursor to several bioactive peptides, is cleaved and stored in large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) of select endocrine cells and neurons (6Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Siegel G.R. Agranoff B.W. Albers R.W. Fisher S.K. Uhler M.D. Basic Neurochemistry. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1999: 363-382Google Scholar). Acidification to approximately pH 6.0 promotes proopiomelanocortin processing (14Schmidt W.K. Moore H.P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1271-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is consistent with evidence demonstrating that peptide processing enzymes targeted to secretory vesicles require acidic conditions for activation. Furin and prohormone convertases such as prohormone convertase 2 require low pH for activation (4Muller L. Lindberg I. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 69-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Lindberg I. van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Furin, for example, must be exposed to a low enough pH to release its cleaved but tightly bound prosequence (27Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is therefore evident that a number of secretory granule proteins exhibit physiologically relevant sensitivities to the changes in pH that occur in the secretory pathway. PAM is found in nearly all cells with LDCVs and is one of the few peptide processing enzymes that spans the vesicle membrane (28Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). PAM, a bifunctional enzyme, first catalyzes the hydroxylation of glycine-extended peptides through its hydroxylation domain (PHM) and subsequently catalyzes α-amidation through its lyase domain (PAL) (2Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar,28Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Like other peptide processing enzymes, PAM is most active at low pH. In addition to its enzymatic role, a significant body of evidence suggests a role for integral membrane PAM in mediating regulated secretion through its effects on cytoskeletal organization; these effects on regulated secretion and the cytoskeleton are not observed when soluble PAM constructs are expressed (29Ciccotosto G.D. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Mains R.E. Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Back N. Hand T.A. Eipper B.A. J.

The PAM cytosolic domain interacts with and affects the localization of several cytoskeletal-associated cytosolic proteins (30Mains R.E. Alam M.R. Johnson R.C. Darlington D.N. Back N. Hand T.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12667-12675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Expression of PAM-1 in AtT-20 cells leads to rearrangement of both actin and intermediate filament components of the cytoskeleton and results in a significant decrease in regulated secretion (29Ciccotosto G.D. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because regulated secretion is affected by molecules in and on the LDCV, it stands to reason that there is some level of communication between the lumen of the LDCV and the cytosol. Lumenal proteins such as carboxypeptidase E and the chromogranins display pH-dependent protein-protein interactions, conformational changes, and membrane association (17Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1558-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Song L. Fricker L.D.

Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Although some of these proteins are membrane-associated, none actually spans the vesicle membrane. Because PAM was known to exhibit pH-sensitive changes in catalytic rate, we explored the possibility that PAM, like other proteins in the regulated secretory pathway, exhibited additional pH-sensitive properties. In this study we explored the possibility that PAM could serve in a signal transduction system linking the lumenal environment to cytosolic factors that regulate the cytoskeleton or other cellular functions. We employed subcellular fractionation, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and immunoprecipitation to explore the sensitivity of PAM to changes in pH. Our results demonstrate that PAM is highly responsive to the pH changes that characterize granule maturation and support the possibility that PAM acts as a pH sensor within LDCVs. AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1, PAM-1/899, PAM-2, PAM-3, TPP (35Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol.

Although Ab 475 was generated to rPAM-1(37–382), it fails to detect rPAM-1(37–369) and will be referred to as an Exon 15 (rPAM-1(369–392)) antibody (41Eipper B.A. Quon A.S.W. Mains R.E. Boswell J.S.

The expression vectors pCIS.PPT, pCIS.PTT, and pCDM.Tac were generously provided by Dr. Sharon Milgram (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Transfected cell lines were plated onto tissue culture dishes or slides pretreated with poly-lysine and NuSerum and kept in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA), and antibiotics) containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. Triton X-100, CHAPS, Sarkosyl, and octyl-β-glucopyranoside were from Calbiochem. Complete serum-free medium (CSFM) is Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing insulin and transferrin; CSFM-Air has HEPES buffer substituted for the bicarbonate (42Ratovitski E.A.

To express soluble, cytosolic CD, pBS.KrPAM-1 was used to amplify the appropriate fragment with 5′ SalI and 3′ BamHI restriction sites (43Husten E.J. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem.

For expression ofmyc-CD (pRK.myc-CD), PAM/Tac chimeras (pCIS.PTT or pCIS.PPT), and Tac (pCDM.Tac), AtT-20 cells were co-transfected with expression vector (20 µg) and pCI.neo (5 µg) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected lines were selected and maintained in growth medium plus 0.5 mg/ml G418. For each cell line, two clones with similar expression levels were analyzed (35Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17526-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Stably transfected AtT-20 or HEK293 cells were kept for 2 days in growth medium. The cells of one confluent well of a 12-well dish were preincubated in 500 µl of CSFM-Air for 5 min at 37 °C. Warm medium was replaced with ice-cold co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm PIPES, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, and 1 mm Na3VO4, pH 7.5) with protease inhibitors (30 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 16 µg/ml benzamidine, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor) and 1% Triton X-100 (unless otherwise specified) (250 µl), and the cells were incubated on ice for 15 min (42Ratovitski E.A. Alam M.R. Quick R.A. McMillan A. Bao C. Hand T.A. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Lowenstein C.J. J. Biol.

The cells were subsequently scraped from the dish, and the suspension (representing total PAM) was centrifuged for 20 min at 250,000 ×g at 4 °C. For extraction of PAM-1 from rat pituitaries, two whole adult, male, Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pituitaries were homogenized in 500 µl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitors and 1% Triton X-100 using a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a Teflon pestle at 4 °C. Homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 250,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant (100 µl/gradient) was used for sucrose gradient sedimentation studies. Detergent-soluble PAM-1 (S) was recovered in the supernatant and used to perform most of the experiments described. Detergent-insoluble PAM (I) was recovered by suspending the pellet in 250 µl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer, pH 7.5. For comparison of extraction efficiencies, equal volumes (20 µl) of the soluble (S) and insoluble (I) fractions were analyzed, along with 20 µl of cell extract (T). Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membranes, PAM was visualized using Exon 16 Ab 629 and chemiluminescence;ScionImage (NIH) was used to quantify images. Each of two confluent wells of a 12-well dish of AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-2 or PAM-1/899 was infected with PAM-1 adenovirus (44Marx R. El Meskini R. Johns D.C. Mains R.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8300-8311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and extracted into 150 µl of ice-cold co-immunoprecipitation buffer following a brief rinse in warm medium as described above. Solubilized protein from the two wells was pooled, and 25 µl was incubated in 500 µl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer titrated to pH 5.5 or to 7.5 and containing 10 µl of the specified polyclonal antibody. Antibody binding proceeded for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) were preblocked with 2.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then equilibrated with pH 5.5 or 7.5 co-immunoprecipitation buffer. Following antibody binding, the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 rpm at 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge, and the supernatant (200 µl for each pH) was incubated with pretreated Protein A beads (60 µl of a 33% slurry) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed twice with co-immunoprecipitation buffer of the same pH. Proteins eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (1% SDS (w/v), 8m urea, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were visualized using PAM CD mAb 6E6 ot the PHM Ab. Multiple aliquots of an AtT-20 PAM-1 cell extract prepared as described above were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Following transfer, the PVDF membrane was cut into strips of two lanes each for antibody binding so that each antibody and pH was tested in duplicate. All membranes were initially blocked for 45 min with 5% milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) and rinsed with TTBS at pH 7.5. Membrane strips were incubated for 2 h with Exon 16 Ab, Exon 15 Ab, or PAM CD mAb diluted into either TTBS, pH 7.5 or 50 mm Na-MES, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 5.5. Subsequent rinses and secondary antibody binding used TTBS, pH 7.5. Protein was visualized and quantified as described above. AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/899 were plated onto poly-lysine treated 4-well glass slides and grown for at least 36 h. Prior to antibody binding, cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in CSFM-Air. Polyclonal antibodies to Exon 15 or PHM were diluted 1:50 into CSFM-Air with the pH adjusted to 7.3 or 5.7 using NaOH. The cells were incubated with antibody for 1 h at 4 °C to permit binding. This incubation was followed by a brief rinse with 4 °C CSFM-Air medium of the same pH. The cells were then fixed by incubation in ice-cold 100% methanol for 10 min. Bound antibody was visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody followed by fluorescence microscopy. Sucrose (5%, 20%, and 50% (w/v)) was dissolved in co-immunoprecipitation buffer adjusted to pH 5.5 or pH 7.5 (42Ratovitski E.A. Alam M.R. Quick R.A. McMillan A. Bao C. Hand T.A. Johnson R.C.

Gradients consisted of a 2.0-ml linear 5–20% sucrose gradient with a 50% sucrose “pad” (169 µl) beneath. Molecular mass markers (50–250 µg of apoferritin, catalase, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and cytochrome c) dissolved in co-immunoprecipitation buffer were used as internal or external standards. Samples (up to 200 µl) loaded on top of the sucrose gradients were centrifuged for 5 h at 4 °C, 50,000 rpm (214,000 × g) in a Ti-55 swinging bucket rotor in a TL100 centrifuge (Beckman). Fractions (169 µl) from each gradient were collected from the top down. Particulate matter that remained on the bottom of the tube was recovered by adding Laemmli sample buffer (169 µl) and heating for 10 min at 37 °C or by adding immunoprecipitation buffer (169 µl), pH 7.5, with detergent (as specified). This final fraction was collected and labeled “Particulate.” Gradient fractions were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide, 0.25%N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide/SDS gels. Following transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corp.), PAM proteins were visualized with Exon A antibody (1:1000) or CD mAb (1:20) using theAmersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL kit. Tac (IL-2Rα) was detected using a COOH-terminal rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000; IL-2Rα (C-20) sc-664, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total protein was visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Pituitaries from 15–20 adult male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were homogenized using a motor-driven PotterElvehjem homogenizer with a Teflon pestle at 4 °C in 10 volumes (w/v) of 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (46Oyarce A.M.

Differential centrifugation yielded pellets enriched in membranous structures, secretory granules, and endosomes (referred to as P2, P3 and P4, respectively) (46Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pellets were homogenized in 200 µl of homogenization buffer at 4 °C and loaded onto discontinuous sucrose gradients to further separate organelles (46Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The appropriate fractions from each gradient were pooled to obtain preparations enriched in light vesicles (P2, Pool A), secretory granules (P3, Pool C), and endosomes (P4, Pool B) (46Oyarce A.M. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 287-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These pooled fractions (500 µl) were diluted to 3.0 ml with homogenization buffer so that organelles could be pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 350,000 ×g. Each of these pellets was then resuspended in 400 µl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer, pH 7.5, for solubilization of membranes and extraction of PAM. Finally, 175-µl aliquots of each resuspended fraction were loaded onto each of two separate 2.0-ml 5–20% linear sucrose gradients, one at pH 5.5 and one at pH 7.5. These gradients were centrifuged, separated, and analyzed as described above. To investigate the possibility of pH-dependent structural changes in PAM, extracts of AtT-20 cells expressing full-length PAM-1 were immunoprecipitated under pH conditions mimicking those in the Golgi or in mature secretory granules; antibodies to discrete domains of the PAM protein were used (Fig. 1 A). Most of the PAM antibodies were comparable in their ability to immunoprecipitate PAM-1 at pH 5.5 and 7.5 (Fig. 1 B). Two of the antibodies examined (to Exon 15 and Exon 16) successfully immunoprecipitated PAM-1 from extracts at pH 7.5, but their capacities for immunoprecipitating PAM-1 at pH 5.5 were greatly diminished. The inability of these antibodies to recognize PAM-1 at pH 5.5 could reflect the properties of PAM-1 or properties of the antibodies. To distinguish between these possibilities, we asked whether the Exon 16 antibody and/or a control antibody (CD mAb) exhibited pH-sensitive binding to PAM-1 that had been reduced and denatured, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Fig. 1 C). Neither of these antibodies showed a pH-dependent interaction with denatured PAM. Thus the inability of the Exon 16 antibody to recognize native PAM-1 at pH 5.5 reflects a pH-dependent change in PAM-1 rather than a pH sensitivity of the antibody. Similarly, the Exon 15 antibody detected PAM-1 equally well at pH 7.5 and at pH 5.5 on Western blots (not shown). Alternative splicing generates isoforms of PAM lacking the transmembrane domain and/or Exon 16 (Fig.2 A). To delineate the contribution of these domains to the observed pH sensitivity, natural isoforms lacking these domains were exposed to antibody at pH 5.5 and at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2 B). The ability of the Exon 15 antibody to recognize both PAM-2 (which lacks Exon 16) and PAM-3 (which lacks both the transmembrane domain and Exon 16) was greatly reduced at pH 5.5. In contrast, the ability of the CD polyclonal antibody to immunoprecipitate PAM-2 and PAM-3 was not pH-dependent (Fig. 2 B). From these results, we conclude that sequences contained within Exons 15 and 16 exhibit pH-dependent changes in conformation. Additionally, based on the response of PAM-3, it appears that the transmembrane domain is not required for this pH-responsive change in antibody reactivity. Immunoprecipitation of membrane PAM requires its solubilization. We carried out additional antibody binding experiments with live cells to determine whether PAM embedded in the lipid bilayer still exhibited pH-sensitive epitope masking.

The former is caused by a direct interaction of Ca2+channel α1 subunits with Gβγ, whereas the latter has not been characterized well. Here, we show that the N terminus of Gαo is critical for the interaction with the C terminus of the α1A channel subunit, and that the binding induces the voltage-resistant inhibition. An α1A C-terminal peptide, an antiserum raised against Gαo N terminus, and a Gαo N-terminal peptide all attenuated the voltage-resistant inhibition of α1A currents. Furthermore, the N terminus of Gαo bound to the C terminus of α1A in vitro, which was prevented either by the α1A channel C-terminal or GαoN-terminal peptide. Although the C-terminal domain of the α1B channel showed similar ability in the binding with Gαo N terminus, the above mentioned treatments were ineffective in the α1B channel current. These findings demonstrate that the voltage-resistant inhibition of the P/Q-type, α1A channel is caused by the interaction between the C-terminal domain of Ca2+ channel α1A subunit and the N-terminal region of Gαo.

The Ca2+ influx through this subclass of VDCC, pharmacologically designated as N-, P/Q-, and R-type, is negatively regulated by neurotransmitters via G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The modulation of α1B (N-type, Cav2.2) channels by GPCRs has been extensively studied using exogenously expressed cell models as well as native neurons, in which GPCR-mediated inhibition is accompanied by a kinetic slowing of activation and can be largely relieved by application of a strong depolarizing prepulse. The voltage-dependent component of inhibition is caused by direct interaction with Gβγ (1Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 2Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The well characterized site for the interaction of Gβγ is the cytosolic linker connecting domains I and II of the α1B subunit (3DeWaard M. Liu H. Walker D. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), where Gβγ binds to the region in an exclusive manner with binding of the VDCC β subunit (4Pragnell M. DeWaard M. Mori Y.

A. 1997; 94: 8866-8871Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) intracellular domains of the α1B subunit are also critical sites for the binding and regulatory action of Gβγ. Some forms of long-lasting, voltage-insensitive modulation of α1B channel current are mediated by more complex signaling pathways involving kinase-dependent phosphorylation (10Diversé-Pierluissi M.A. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. Dunlap K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5417-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). On the GPCR-mediated regulation of α1A (P/Q-type, Cav2.1) channels, although biochemical studies have demonstrated a similarity with respect to the binding domain of Gβγ and the affinity with α1B channels, there are many qualitative and quantitative differences in the modes of channel current regulation (11Kaneko S. Akaike A. Satoh M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 81: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both in native and expressed cells, α1A channels are less strongly modulated by GPCRs than α1B channels (5Bourinet E. Soong T.H. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 8Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W.

According to the willing reluctant model of Gβγ-mediated and voltage-dependent inhibition (13Bean B.P. Nature. 1989; 340: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), α1B channels accept strong depolarization for opening, whereas α1A channels appear to remain closed over the physiological voltages (14Colecraft H.M. Patil P.G. Yue D.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 175-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, a marked characteristic of GPCR-mediated inhibition of α1A channels in neurons is the dominance of “voltage-resistant” inhibition, which is not relieved by a depolarization prepulse (12Currie K.P.M. Fox A.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4570-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun Q.-Q. Dale N. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the voltage-resistant inhibition being mediated by GPCRs and also its presence in α1B channels, the molecular mechanism underlying the different mode of VDCC regulation remains unclear. Recently, Furukawaet al. (16Furukawa T. Nukada T. Mori Y. Wakamori M. Fujita Y. Ishida H. Fukuda K. Kato S. Yoshii M. J. Biol.

They also found that a voltage-resistant inhibition of the α1A channel was increased by coexpression of a Gαi/o family protein, and that the inhibition was prevented by a synthetic peptide PPQT1 with a α1A C-terminal sequence, implying a relation between Gαi/o binding and the voltage-resistant inhibition of α1A channels. To clarify the molecular mechanism of voltage-resistant inhibition of the α1A channel current, we used function-blocking anti-Gαi/o antisera and synthetic “decoy” peptides targeting a small region of Gαi/o proteins in the present study. One of the anti-Gαi/o antisera has been shown to disrupt the negative regulation of VDCC by GPCRs both in native neurons (18Wiley J.W. Moises H.C. Gross R.A. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and Xenopus oocytes coexpressing GPCRs with VDCCs (19Kaneko S. Yada N. Fukuda K. Kikuwaka M. Akaike A. Satoh M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our electrophysiological and biochemical results demonstrate that direct interaction between the C-terminal domain of the α1A channel and the N-terminal region of Gαo is responsible for the voltage-resistant inhibition of α1A channel current, but not for that of α1B channels. The 1.1-kilobaseNcoI/HincII fragment excised, containing the entire coding region of the bovine Gαo1 subunit was from pGoα3 (20Takao K. Yoshii M. Kanda A. Kokubun S. Nukada T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), blunted and ligated to a BamHI adapter. The resulting BamHI/BamHI fragment was ligated into the BamHI site of pSP64poly(A) (Promega, Madison, WI) to obtain pGαoSP64poly(A). Recombinant plasmids pSPCBI-2 (rabbit BI-2 α1A subunit; GenBankTM accession number X57689), pKCRB2 (rabbit BIII α1B subunit; D14157), pHCaB (human VDCC β1b subunit; AB054985), pGαoSP64poly(A) and pKOPR (rat κ-opioid receptor;D16829) were linearized by XbaI, SalI, EcoRV, EcoRI, and BstXI, respectively. cRNAs specific for the α1A, α1B, and Gαo1 subunits were synthesized in vitro by SP6 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). cRNAs for β1b subunit and κ-opioid receptor were synthesized using T3 and T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), respectively. Purified Gαo was obtained from bovine brains as descried previously (21Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dissolved in 20 mm Hepes, 60 mm PO4-NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.6% sodium cholate and stored at −80 °C. Antisera raised against the Gαo N terminus (GC/2) and C terminus (EC/2) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA) and represented in this study as anti-Gαo(N) and anti-Gαo(C), respectively. Synthetic peptides PPQT1 (CHEDGLKDSPSWVTQRAQEM) and PB3T4 (CQESGIKESVSWGTQRTQDV) (17Furukawa T. Miura R. Mori Y. Strobeck M. Suzuki K. Ogihara Y. Asano T. Morishita R. Hashii M. Higashida H.

Miura R. Mori Y. Strobeck M. Suzuki K. Ogihara Y. Asano T. Morishita R. Hashii M. Higashida H. Yoshii M. Nukada T. J. Biol.

The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α by inducing with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside and prepared according to the procedure described previously (22Grieco F. Hay J.M. Hull R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 856-858PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 1–88 and 7–88 of Gαo were inserted into pMAL-c2X vector (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) to produce MBP fusion proteins of the Gαo N-terminal domain, MBP-Gαo-(1–88) and MBP-Gαo-(7–88), respectively. The MBP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli DH5α by induction with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for 3 h and purified according to the instruction manual for the vector. Small pieces of ovarian lobe were dissected out from anesthetized Xenopus laevis and shaken gently at 22 °C for 90 min in a solution (88 mmNaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 7.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) containing 1.1 mg/ml collagenase (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Denuded, healthy looking oocytes more than 1 mm in diameter were selected and injected in a volume of 50 nl/cell with either RNA for the α1A (0.2 µg/µl) or α1B (0.2 µg/µl) subunit, in combination with RNAs for VDCC β1b (0.2 µg/µl), Gαo1 (0.05 µg/µl), and κ-opioid receptor (0.4 µg/µl). The injected oocytes were incubated at 22 °C for 1–2 days in sterile Barth's saline (88 mmNaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 7.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, supplemented with 20 units/ml penicillin, and 20 µg/ml streptomycin). An oocyte was placed in a 50-µl chamber which was perfused with Ba50 solution containing (50 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm KOH, neutralized with methanesulfonic acid and adjusted to pH 7.4) for isolation and recording of Ba2+ current, I Ba. The cell was impaled with two intracellular glass electrodes filled with 3m KCl (for voltage monitor) and 3 m potassium acetate (for current injection) connected to an amplifier (CA-1a; Dagan, New York). Unless otherwise noted, the oocytes were clamped at −60 mV and depolarized to +20 mV for 200 ms at an interval of every 30 s, with or without a preceding 100-ms prepulse to +100 mV. The duration between the prepulse and the test pulse was 20 ms. The maximum inward deflection of the current was measured as the peak amplitude. In some experiments, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide complementary toXenopus Gαo mRNA (5′-cccatgactgctcggggggg-3′) was injected 12–16 h prior to electrophysiological measurements. Injection of 50 nl of 10 µm PPQT1, 10 µm PB3T4, 100 µmPGON1, and 100 µm PGOC1 was carried out 12–16 h prior to measurements. The antisera anti-Gαo(N) and anti-Gαo(C) were diluted to 1:50 with water and injected in a volume of 50 nl into the oocytes. Following injection, oocytes were incubated at 22 °C for 2–3 h prior to electrophysiological recording. GTPγS (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) and U50488H (trans-(±)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-[1-pyrrolidinyl]cyclohexyl)benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate salt, a gift from Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, MI) were prepared daily from frozen stock solution of 50 and 1 mm, respectively. Competition of anti-Gαoantisera against the binding of Gαo with VDCC C termini was evaluated as follows. The solubilized proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 5 h and washed five times with 40 volumes (per bed volume of resin) of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. The beads were equilibrated with a buffer (0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0) including protease inhibitors (2.5 µg/ml pepstatin, 2 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm benzamidine). Approximately 30 µl of suspension of equilibrated beads was incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with 4 µg of GST or GST fusion proteins, 4 µg of purified bovine brain Gαo in a total volume of 500 µl. Simultaneously, 20 µl of anti-Gαo(N) or anti-Gαo(C) was added to the reaction mixture. The beads were washed five times with 40 volumes of the same buffer solutions and denatured by heating to 100 °C for 5 min with 20 µl of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer. Denaturated proteins (20 µl) were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide gel) and transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for immunoblotting. The primary antibody against Gαo (K-20; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) were diluted at 1:4,000 and incubated for 1 h. The second antibody (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit goat IgG, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was diluted at 1:2,000 and incubated for 1 h. The detection was done by the ECL plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The binding of the N terminus of Gαo to the VDCC C terminus was evaluated as follows. The beads were equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium azide) including the above protease inhibitors. Approximately 5 µg of GST fusion proteins bound to beads were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 5 µg of MBP fusion proteins. The beads were washed with 10 volumes of the same buffer solutions after incubation. Proteins were eluted by 30 µl of elution buffer (buffer solutions added in 10 mm glutathione) and denatured by heating to 100 °C for 5 min in 30 µl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Each 20 µl of protein was loaded onto a lane of SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred to an Immobilon membrane. The primary antibody anti-MBP serum (New England Biolab) was diluted at 1:10,000 and incubated for 1 h. The second antibody (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was diluted at 1:4,000 and incubated for 1 h. The immunoblot was detected by the ECL plus detection system. Values were represented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated using ANOVA andpost-hoc Turkey test using Prism 3.01 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). In a previous study (17Furukawa T. Miura R. Mori Y. Strobeck M. Suzuki K. Ogihara Y. Asano T. Morishita R. Hashii M. Higashida H. Yoshii M. Nukada T. J. Biol.

In our first attempt to discriminate the voltage dependence of regulation between the αlA and α1B channels and to characterize the specificity of decoy peptides, we examined the effects of PPQT1 and PB3T4 on the GPCR-mediated regulation of VDCCs under equivalent conditions using oocytes coexpressing either the α1A or α1Bsubunit together with the β1b subunit, Gαo1and κ-opioid receptor (Fig. 1). In this experiment, anti-Xenopus Gαo antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (5 µg) was injected 12–16 h prior to the recording for minimizing the contribution of endogenous Gαo, which reduced the magnitude of the inhibition in the control oocytes less than those in the following experiments (cf. Figs. 2, 3, and 5).Figure 2Effects of the anti-Gαo N-terminal antiserum, GC/2, and the anti-Gαo C-terminal antiserum, EC/2, on the κ-opioid receptor-mediated inhibition of α1Aand α1B channel currents.

The slowing was evaluated by a delay in the time to peak of the amplitude, as shown by the horizontal difference between upward and downward triangles in the typical trace (see Fig. 1 A, 48.1 ± 6.2 ms). When a large depolarizing prepulse (+100 mV, 100 ms duration) had been applied 20 ms before the test pulse, the agonist-induced inhibition was slightly diminished to 13.0 ± 2.0%, whereas the delay in the time to peak was no longer observed (0.7 ± 1.2 ms), indicating that the depolarizing prepulse eliminated the kinetic slowing of activation which is accompanied by the Gβγ-mediated, voltage-dependent inhibition. The decrease in the inhibition of the amplitude by a prepulse suggested the dominance (87% on the amplitude base) of voltage-resistant and kinetically unaffected inhibition in the regulation of α1A channels in this condition. In oocytes preinjected with the 20-amino acid peptide PPQT1 which includes a part of predicted α1A C-terminal domain sequence at amino acids 2028–2046, the agonist-evoked inhibition was significantly (p < 0.05) diminished either in the presence or absence of prepulses. The agonist-induced delay in the time to peak was also decreased to 12.4 ± 5.7 ms in the absence of the prepulse. In oocytes preinjected with peptide PB3T4, which corresponded to an equivalent topological position in the C-terminal domain of α1B subunit (amino acids 1931–1949), no effect was observed on the magnitude of agonist-induced inhibition of the amplitude or delay in the time to peak of α1A channel currents, whichever prepulse protocol was used. In the α1B channels (Fig. 1, C andD), U50488H-evoked inhibition of I Ba(44.8 ± 8.5%, n = 4) was greater than in α1A channels and accompanied with a marked slowing of activation when a large depolarizing prepulse had not been applied. The delay in the time to the peak amplitude was 93.0 ± 12.8 ms, which was also significantly larger than that in α1A channel currents. With prepulse, the agonist-induced inhibition was decreased to 27.3 ± 5.8%, reflecting a larger (40%) portion of voltage-dependent, Gβγ-mediated inhibition in α1B channels than in α1A channels. When the prepulse was applied in the presence of the agonist, the delay in the time to peak was completely abolished to −5.9 ± 0.6 ms. In addition, the finding that the prepulse potentiated the amplitude of αlB currents without stimulation of κ-receptors by the agonist (i.e. prepulse facilitation, 1.28 ± 0.06) indicated that α1B channels were tonically inhibited by intrinsically active Gβγ in the oocytes. On the inhibitory regulation of α1B channel currents, neither the α1B C-terminal peptide PB3T4 nor the equivalent α1A peptide PPQT1 exerted a significant effect in terms of the peak amplitude or delay in the time to peak. Taken together, these findings indicate that the blocking effect of the α1A C-terminal peptide PPQT1 was preferential to the Gαo-mediated, voltage-resistant inhibition of the α1A channel current. The anti-Gαo-N-terminal antiserum, GC/2, has been shown to decrease the inhibition of N-type channel currents by κ-opioid receptor stimulation in rat primary afferent neurons (18Wiley J.W.

Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study we compared the effects of two kinds of the anti-Gαo-antisera, GC/2 and EC/2, on the κ-agonist-induced inhibition of α1A and α1B channel currents, as examined by separating voltage-dependent and -resistant components using the prepulse protocol (Fig. 2). GC/2 and EC/2 were previously shown to bind to the Gαo N-terminal and C-terminal, respectively (24Padrell E. Carty D.J. Moriarty T.M. Hildebrandt J.D. Landau E.M. Iyengar R. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, intracellular application of GC/2 (anti-Gαo(N), 1:50-diluted, 50 nl/oocyte, 2 h before recording) attenuated the U50488H-induced inhibition in the amplitude of the α1A channel currents. Although the inhibition in the absence of a prepulse was not significantly reduced, the reduction was significant (p< 0.001) when prepulse was applied, showing that the voltage-resistant component was more selectively suppressed. Similarly, the agonist-induced slowing of the activation in the absence of a prepulse was decreased but not fully abolished by the antiserum (delay in the time to peak: 31.5 ± 12.8 ms in controls, 11.4 ± 7.9 ms in anti-Gαo(N)-injected cells, n = 4). After preinjection of a heat-inactivated anti-Gαo(N) antiserum at the same dose, there was no effect on the inhibition of the amplitude or delay in the time to peak (data not shown). An anti-Gαo-C-terminal antiserum EC/2 (anti-Gαo(C)), which was originally raised against the Gαi3 C-terminal polypeptide but showed an equivalent cross-reactivity to Gαo1 (25Simonds M.F.

A. 1989; 86: 7809-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), showed a smaller effect on the agonist-induced inhibition of α1A channel currents than anti-Gαo(N). Without a prepulse, neither the effect on the inhibition of the peak amplitude nor on the delay in the time to the peak amplitude (35.2 ± 15.5 ms, n = 4) was significant. However, there was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the voltage-resistant inhibition by pretreatment with anti-Gαo(C) in α1A channel current, which may indicate that heterotrimeric G-protein as well as free Gαo may be immobilized by binding of the antibody. On α1B channel currents (Fig. 2, C andD), preinjection of anti-Gαo(N) significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the agonist-induced inhibition ofI Ba either in the presence or absence of prepulse, showing that both voltage-dependent and -resistant components of inhibition were simultaneously attenuated. The agonist-induced delay in the time to peak was also decreased to 12.6 ± 4.3 ms (n = 6). The effects of anti-Gαo(N) on the voltage-dependent inhibition of α1B channel currents were in good keeping with those in former studies using native neurons (18Wiley J.W. Moises H.C. Gross R.A.

If the homogenization buffer contains a [Ca2+] similar to that seen in unstimulated cells, the majority of PLA2 activity is found in the cytosolic fraction.

The mechanism for [Ca2+]-dependent translocation is entirely contained within an amino-terminal 134-amino acid residue fragment, which is homologous to C2 domains found in phospholipase C and protein kinase C (PKC) (7Clark J.D.

The mutation of any of five putative [Ca2+]-binding residues results in a greater [Ca2+] requirement for both binding of cPLA2 to phosphatidylcholine substrate and for cPLA2 activity (33Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Ca2+ enables cPLA2 to associate with its membrane substrate rather than for catalysis. A critical duration of [Ca2+] elevation is required for persistent membrane localization and full cPLA2activation. Whereas a brief increase in [Ca2+]iresults in translocation of cPLA2 without an increase in arachidonic acid (AA), a [Ca2+] increase of longer duration results in prolonged translocation and AA release even after [Ca2+] has returned to basal levels (34Hirabayashi T.

It is not clear whether an increase in [Ca2+]i is the only requirement for cPLA2 translocation to and association with the membrane, because mutations of hydrophobic residues in calcium-binding regions inhibit the association of cPLA2with the membrane, despite the intact ability of the mutated cPLA2 to bind calcium (31Perisic O.

In addition, agents that do not cause an increase in [Ca2+] have recently been shown to increase AA release in wild type mouse peritoneal macrophages but not those derived from cPLA2 knock-out mice, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms in addition to, or in place of, [Ca2+] may play a role in cPLA2 translocation (21Qiu Z.H.

The exposure of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to 5 mm cyanide and 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose, in the absence of metabolic substrates, results in a reduction of cellular ATP content to less than 5% of control values within 5 min and a striking increase in AA release (2Sheridan A.M. Schwartz J.H. Kroshian V.M. Tercyak A.T. Laraia J. Masino S. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F342-F350PubMed Google Scholar). We have studied the response of cPLA2 to ATP depletion in MDCK cells using this established model of chemical anoxia. We have found that ATP depletion results in a shift in PLA2 activity from soluble to insoluble fractions of cell lysates. cPLA2 translocates to nuclei of ATP-depleted cells as demonstrated by both Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. This shift in enzyme mass and activity is partially blocked with okadaic acid, a phosphatase 2A inhibitor, and persists despite a reduction in [Ca2+] with 2 mm EGTA, indicating that mechanisms other than an increase in [Ca2+] alone are responsible for the translocation of cPLA2. MDCK cells (no. CCL 34; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and used at confluence. Chemical anoxia was induced by incubating cell monolayers for various time points with 5 mm cyanide and 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose, in the absence of glucose. Cell monolayers were incubated in either a Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) containing (in mm) 115 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 1.3 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO or HEPES-based buffer containing (in mm) 130 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 20 HEPES, pH 7.4. KHB buffer was used for experiments in which the S100 and insoluble fractions were isolated. HEPES buffer was used for experiments in which cellular pH was determined and for all nuclear isolation and immunofluorescence experiments. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 95% air-5% CO2 incubator. Control monolayers were incubated in the presence of 10 mm dextrose without metabolic inhibitors. In experiments designed to study the effect of ATP depletion followed by recovery of ATP levels, cells were exposed to cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose for 1 h as described, after which buffer was replaced with fresh KHB buffer containing 10 mm dextrose. This maneuver partially restores cellular ATP levels (36Kroshian V.M. Sheridan A.M. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F21-F30PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were exposed to 5 mm cyanide in the presence of 10 mm dextrose. This has been shown to result in a negligible reduction of cellular ATP in MDCK cells (2Sheridan A.M. Schwartz J.H. Kroshian V.M. Tercyak A.T. Laraia J. Masino S. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F342-F350PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the period of exposure to chemical anoxia or to A23187, cells from each group were washed twice with 1× PBS with 2 mm EGTA. Cells were harvested into 0.5 ml of homogenization buffer containing 2 mm EGTA, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 µm PMSF, 10 µm leupeptin. Cells were sonicated at 4 °C at 40-watt output and 40% duty cycle. Proteins were measured by the Coomassie dye method (Bio-Rad, Richmond, VA). The resulting homogenates were adjusted for protein and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant represents the soluble fraction. Pellets were washed twice with 1 × PBS/2 mm EGTA and resuspended in homogenization buffer with 0.01% Triton X-100. In certain experiments, in which cPLA2 activity was measured in the insoluble or pellet fraction, pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer, which contained 1 m KCl and centrifuged a second time to optimize dissociation of cPLA2 from the membrane fraction (29Kim D.K. Bonventre J.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In certain experiments pooled supernatants were applied to a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden), which had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA. After washing the column with the same buffer, PLA2 was eluted with a 50-ml linear NaCl gradient of 0.12 to 1.0 m in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA. 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed for PLA2 activity. Cells were washed with 1 × PBS/2 mm EGTA, harvested by scraping and Dounce-homogenized in a buffer containing 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 10 µmleupeptin. Lysate protein content was determined, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the nuclear fraction was resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 µm leupeptin. The supernatant is referred to as the cytosolic fraction. Equal amounts of protein from total cell lysates, nuclear and cytosolic fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. 1-Stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine and 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as substrates. The substrate was dried under N2 and resuspended in 100% ethanol and sonicated, thus forming liposomes. Approximately 30 µg of sample protein was incubated in 100 µl of buffer containing 75 mm Tris, 5 mm CaCl2, and 5.0 nmol of substrate at pH 9.0 for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 110 µl of H2O and 560 µl of modified Dole's solution containing isopropyl alcohol:n-heptane:1n H2SO4 (39:40:1) (38Dole V.P. Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were vortex-mixed for 2 min and centrifuged at 20,800 ×g for 2 min. 150 µl of the organic phase was transferred to an Eppendorf microcentrifuge containing 800 µl of heptane and 100 mg of silica gel, which was again vortex-mixed and centrifuged. 800 µl of supernatant was removed, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, MA). Membranes were blocked with 0.5% milk. Primary antibodies included a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits against an amino-terminal fragment of cPLA2, which included the CaLB domain and which was used at a dilution of 1:2000, and anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) at a dilution of 1:200. Secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. Membranes were developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LLC-PK1 were transfected with pEGFP or pEGFP-cPLA2 by DEAE dextran. Cells were plated onto coverslips 24 h prior to transfection. 200 µl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing DEAE-dextran (10 mg/ml), and chloroquine (2.5 mm) was added to 5 ml of DMEM containing 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). DNA (40 ng/ml) was added, and the chloroquine/DEAE dextran/DNA mixture was layered onto cells (1 ml/well). After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the chloroquine/DEAE dextran/DNA mixture was removed and cells were exposed to 10% Me2SO at room temperature for exactly 2 min. Cells were washed with 1 × PBS, and fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum was added. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.1% Triton. Lysate [Ca2+] was determined using the fluorescent probe, Calcium Green (Molecular Probes, OR) (39Hajjar R.J. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21589-21594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates of control and ATP-depleted cells were incubated with Calcium Green salt. Fluorescence was excited at 420 and 488 nm with a xenon arc lamp (Photon Technologies International, Inc. (PTI), Lawrenceville, NJ). Light output was measured at 531 nm with a photon-counting photomultiplier tube device detection system. [Ca2+] was calibrated with a 1 mm [Ca2+] solution (R max) and a 100 µm EGTA solution (R min). Data analysis was performed using PTI software. pHi was determined using the fluorescent probe BCECF (Molecular Probes, OR) (40Thomas J. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar, 41Selvaggio A.M. Schwartz J.H. Bengele H.H. Alexander E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C558-C562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were incubated with 10 µmBCECF-AM in HEPES buffer for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed to removed extracellular BCECF-AM, and coverslips were transferred to a water-jacketed cuvette maintained at 37 °C. Cells were alternatively excited at 490 and 440 nm, and emission was measured at 535 nm. pH was calibrated using nigericin (40Thomas J. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). After pH measurement, control MDCK cells were washed and incubated in buffer containing (in mm) 20 NaCl, 130 KCl, 1 MgCL2, 1 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 µm nigericin for 20 min. This buffer was replaced with fresh nigericin-containing buffer of pH 6.5, and fluorescence was measured after 20-min equilibration. Fluorescence measurements of six experiments were averaged to provide the calibration standard. Human cPLA2 cDNA (7Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N.

All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for the comparison of two groups of data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used when more than two groups were compared. Following the ANOVA, the Bonferroni correction was used. p < 0.01, obtained using Student'st test, was considered significant. PLA2 activity eluted as a single fraction on Mono Q anion exchange chromatography of MDCK cell supernatants (Fig.1 a). To exclude activity from co-eluting group I or group II PLA2 isoforms, we tested peak fractions for inhibition by dithiothreitol (DTT) using 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylethanolamine as substrate. There was no inhibition of activity of partially purified PLA2 from MDCK cells by DTT exposure for 30 min. By contrast, incubation of purified platelet Group II PLA2with 5 mm DTT markedly inhibited enzyme activity (Fig.1 b). Cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose resulted in a decrease in total cell lysate PLA2 activity to 45.5% of control (Fig.2 a). Western blot analysis using an anti-cPLA2 antibody showed no obvious decrease in total cPLA2 mass (Fig. 2 c). Most of the enzyme appeared as the faster migrating form in lysates of ATP-depleted compared with control cells, suggesting dephosphorylation of the enzyme (Fig. 2 c). Exposure of cells to cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose resulted in elution of cytosolic PLA2 activity off the Mono Q column at a lower NaCl concentration (Fig. 2 b), possibly because of dephosphorylation of the enzyme (37Rossomando E.F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because cPLA2 activity is up-regulated by phosphorylation (14Lin L.L. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31693-31700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these data suggest that dephosphorylation of cPLA2, due to ATP depletion, decreases intrinsic enzyme activity. To determine whether the observed effect of cyanide and deoxyglucose on PLA2 activity is due to ATP depletion or to a direct toxic effect of cyanide, we exposed cells to cyanide in the presence of 10 mm dextrose. Exposure of MDCK cells to cyanide in the presence of dextrose has been shown to reduce cellular ATP to 40–45% of control. This degree of ATP depletion does not result in cell injury in MDCK cells (2Sheridan A.M. Schwartz J.H. Kroshian V.M. Tercyak A.T. Laraia J. Masino S. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F342-F350PubMed Google Scholar). There is no change in soluble or membrane PLA2 activity in cells exposed to cyanide in the presence of dextrose (20 ± 6 pmol/mg/min) compared with control (18 ± 4 pmol/mg/min)(data not shown). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g, resulting in a cytosolic fraction and an insoluble pellet that includes total cell membrane. Soluble, or S100, PLA2 activity in untreated cells was 18 ± 3 pmol/mg of protein/min. After 15 min of exposure to cyanide and deoxyglucose, S100 PLA2 activity was decreased to 62 ± 9% of control with a further decrease to 36 ± 7% by 120 min of exposure (p < 0.01%) (Fig. 3 a). This decrease in S100 PLA2 activity, enriched in cPLA2, in ATP-depleted cells was greater than the decrease observed in total cell lysates. To determine whether this observed decrease in soluble cPLA2 activity was partially due to translocation of the enzyme to membrane or entirely to dephosphorylation of the enzyme, we measured activity in the insoluble fraction of cell lysates. PLA2 activity in the 100,000 × g pellet, representing the membrane fraction, was considerably lower than that measured in supernatants under all conditions studied. In membranes from control cells PLA2 activity was 3 ± 0.6 pmol/mg/min. The markedly low membrane activity compared with soluble PLA2 activity may be partly due to dilution of labeled substrate by the excess of unlabeled phospholipid in the membrane as suggested by Channon (28Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which would result in an apparent decrease in overall activity. There was an increase in activity to 228 ± 33% of control in the insoluble fractions of cells after 15 min of exposure to cyanide and deoxyglucose (p < 0.01) (Fig.3 b). There was no further increase at 30, 60, 120, or 240 min. These data suggested that the striking decrease in soluble cPLA2 activity is at least partly due to a shift in enzyme activity from the soluble to insoluble fraction of cell lysates. To determine whether a shift in enzyme mass from soluble to insoluble fractions occurred, we performed immunoblot analysis of soluble and insoluble fractions from control cells and from ATP-depleted cells. Western blot analysis of soluble and insoluble fractions is shown in Fig. 4 a. There is a decrease in cPLA2 protein in the S100 fraction of ATP-depleted cells when compared with control cells. In contrast, there is an increase in total cPLA2 mass in the insoluble fractions of ATP-depleted cells compared with insoluble fractions from control cells. The shift in cPLA2 enzyme mass from soluble to insoluble fraction is not reversed by the addition of exogenous ATP to cell lysates. Thus cPLA2 enzyme mass shifts from soluble to insoluble fractions of lysates of ATP-depleted cells. To determine if translocation resulting from ATP depletion is reversible, we exposed cells to cyanide and deoxyglucose for 2 h, then removed the metabolic inhibitors and added 10 mmdextrose. Although 2 h of exposure to cyanide and deoxyglucose decreased soluble PLA2 activity to 27 ± 5% of control (p < .01), subsequent exposure to dextrose for 1 h, after metabolic inhibitors were remo"

https://openalex.org/W1984795154,"Contact with bone marrow stromal cells maintains normal and leukemic hematopoietic progenitors in an undifferentiated state. Recently, stromal contact has been shown to diminish the yield of megakaryocytes in cultures of primary human hematopoietic stem cells. This inhibition may explain the poor megakaryocytic engraftment frequently observed after bone marrow transplantation. In the current study, stromal co-culture is shown to render K562 cells refractory to megakaryocytic induction. This stromal inhibition correlated with the selective down-regulation in K562 cells of protein kinase C-ε (PKC-ε), which has recently been implicated in regulation of megakaryocytic lineage commitment. In addition, the stromal inhibition correlated with inactivation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, which has also been implicated in promoting megakaryocytic development. Forced expression of PKC-ε by retroviral transduction was insufficient to reverse the stromal blockade of ERK/MAPK signaling or of megakaryocytic induction. Thus stromal interruption of ERK/MAPK signaling occurred independently of PKC-ε levels and correlated more closely with megakaryocytic blockade. These findings provide potential mechanisms for stromal inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation and possibly for the poor megakaryocytic engraftment seen after bone marrow transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1971886704,"The in vitro folding of rhodanese involves a competition between formation of properly folded enzyme and off-pathway inactive species. Co-solvents like glycerol or low temperature, e.g. refolding at 10 °C, successfully retard the off-pathway formation of large inactive aggregates, but the process does not yield 100% active enzyme. These data suggest that mis-folded species are formed from early folding intermediates. GroEL can capture early folding intermediates, and it loses the ability to capture and reactivate rhodanese if the enzyme is allowed first to spontaneously fold for longer times before it is presented to GroEL, a process that leads to the formation of unproductive intermediates. In addition, GroEL cannot reverse large aggregates once they are formed, but it could capture some folding intermediates and activate them, even though they are not capable of forming active enzyme if left to spontaneous refolding. The interaction between GroEL and rhodanese substantially but not completely inhibits intra-protein inactivation, which is responsible for incomplete activation during unassisted refolding. Thus, GroEL not only decreases aggregation, but it gives the highest reactivation of any method of assistance. The results are interpreted using a previously suggested model based on studies of the spontaneous folding of rhodanese (Gorovits, B. M., McGee, W. A., and Horowitz, P. M. (1998) Biochim. Biophys.

Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 1-33Google Scholar). Aggregation is one of the most important side reactions that kinetically competes with proper folding, and it often results from interactions among partially folded intermediates (5Mitraki A. King J.

Therefore, controlling aggregation can assist successful renaturation. The enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) is difficult to fold in vitro, and it has become an interesting model system for assisted folding. Rhodanese is monomeric, folded into two almost equal size domains, and its crystal structure is available (9Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The inter-domain interface is strongly hydrophobic, giving rise to strong interactions between domains. In the active enzyme, all four of the rhodanese cysteine residues are reduced (9Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The successful refolding of rhodanese after denaturation requires conditions that both reduce aggregation and limit very facile sulfhydryl oxidation among residues far apart in the primary sequence (10Horowitz P.M.

Even under these conditions, some inactive, monomeric species are formed, so that 100% reactivation is never achieved. Urea-induced denaturation of rhodanese involves steps that include domain separation followed by complete denaturation of the protein (1Gorovits B.M. McGee W.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys.

The domain-dissociated intermediate contains a high degree of secondary structure, and it displays extensive hydrophobic exposure (14Bhattacharyya A.M. Horowitz P. J. Biol.

Aggregation of rhodanese can be slowed by limiting the collision among interactive intermediates by lowering the protein concentration (13Mendoza J.A. Rogers E. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

Also, the addition of co-solvents can reduce the formation of aggregates both by slowing the diffusion of intermediates, thereby reducing their interactions (25Chrunyk B.A. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2149-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), as well as having an effect on preferential hydration (26Timasheff S.N. Shirley B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995: 253-269Google Scholar). For example, the addition of glycerol is very effective at preventing the formation of large rhodanese aggregates (2Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chaperonin-assisted folding of rhodanese has a kinetic advantage over aggregation (27Mendoza J.A. Lorimer G.H. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16973-16976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that, even under conditions where the formation of large aggregates is largely prevented, the recovery of rhodanese is not complete. This indicates that rhodanese can mis-fold even from intermediates that are too small to scatter light significantly more than the native enzyme. Furthermore, the results suggest that GroEL can capture early folding intermediates of rhodanese, which are in equilibrium with both on-pathway and off-pathway forms. Formation of mis-folded species from monomeric or small associated folding intermediates removes early folding intermediates from solution, which would explain the substantial but still incomplete reactivation by GroEL/GroES/ATP, even at low temperatures. GroEL can also bind and reactivate some folding intermediates, which otherwise would not fold to give active protein. A model for the spontaneous folding of rhodanese has been proposed previously (1Gorovits B.M. McGee W.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We use and extend this model to interpret the present studies. In the present study, we have provided additional experimental support for some of the pathways postulated in our earlier investigations. Urea was of electrophoresis purity (Bio-Rad), and BCA was purchased from Pierce. Other chemicals were from Sigma. Recombinant bovine rhodanese was purified as described previously and stored at −70 °C as a crystalline suspension in 1.8 m ammonium sulfate containing 1 mm sodium thiosulfate (28Miller D.M. Delgado R. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4686-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodanese was desalted on a G-50 column before use. Rhodanese concentrations were determined using a value of A 0.1%, 280 nm = 1.75 (29Sorbo B.H. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1129-1136Crossref Google Scholar). Rhodanese activity was measured using a colorimetric method based on the absorbance at 460 nm of the complex formed between the reaction product, thiocyanate, and ferric ion (29Sorbo B.H. Acta Chem.

For unfolding, 0.3 mg/ml rhodanese was denatured for at least 2 h at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, containing 8 m urea. For spontaneous folding, unfolded rhodanese was diluted to 3.6 µg/ml in 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, containing 50 mmthiosulfate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 m β mercaptoethanol (folding buffer) preincubated at the desired temperature. For binding to GroEL, rhodanese was allowed to refold spontaneously in the folding buffer preincubated at a specific temperature. Aliquots were removed at different times and added to folding buffer containing 0.15 mg/ml GroEL preincubated at a desired temperature and incubated at that temperature for an additional 15 min. For reactivation from the rhodanese-GroEL complex, first 0.025 mg/ml GroES and then 2 mm ATP were added, and the incubation was continued for at least 1.5 h at 25 °C. Where indicated, additional GroEL was added, and/or additional incubation time was allowed to ensure that the chaperonin-assisted folding had come to completion. To assay the successful reactivation, 100 µl of the incubation mix were added to 1 ml of rhodanese assay mix and incubated for 10 min. The assay reaction was stopped by the addition of formaldehyde. The percent reactivation was calculated based on the activity of native enzyme that had been subjected to the same folding conditions. To control for inactivation or other effects due to surface adsorption that might influence results, refolding experiments were performed for samples of different volumes and in vessels with different surfaces including glass, plastic, quartz, and siliconized plastic. These conditions led to no significant differences in the results shown. All light scattering measurements were performed using a Fluorolog-3 (Jobin Yvon-Spex) spectrofluorimeter. Both excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 340 nm with 0.5-nm slit widths. All scattering values were corrected using appropriate buffer blanks. The reported scattering values are given in photon counts/s (cps).1 A model has been proposed for the spontaneous folding of rhodanese (1Gorovits B.M. McGee W.A. Horowitz P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present work, we use this model to interpret our data, and for convenience, it is presented in Scheme FS1. According to this model, an early folding intermediate, I′, forms rapidly when refolding is initiated for denatured rhodanese (U). This I′ partitions to two intermediates I′ ′ and I′′′. The form I′′′ is capable of folding to the native state (N). I′′ is prone to form oligomeric species (I n) that ultimately lead to large aggregates (Aglarge). Aglarge refers to all species that are large enough to scatter light significantly more than monomeric rhodanese. All of these early folding intermediates I′,I′′, and I′′′ are in equilibria with each other. Since complete suppression of observable aggregates does not yield 100% active protein, it is suggested that mis-folded species can form even from the monomeric early folding intermediates. GroEL can bind early folding intermediates, and the results presented below suggest that formation of these complexes inhibits much of the intra-protein processes that would lead to inactive species. The data suggest that GroEL binds not only the early folding intermediates, but also binds some of the intermediates such as I n, which are not capable of forming active enzyme without the aid of the chaperonin. Fig. 1 Ashows the effect of temperature on the unassisted folding of rhodanese monitored by the regain of enzyme activity. At 37 °C (▴), there is almost no recovery of active rhodanese, whereas the maximum recovery is ∼30% at 10 °C (●) and ∼10% at 25 °C (▪). At the lower temperatures, the rates of activity regain are lower, and the yields are higher. This result is consistent with the idea that at lower temperatures the rates of formation of inactive species are low. Aggregate formation is a temperature-dependent process. Fig. 1 B shows via light scattering the formation of large aggregated species at different temperatures during unassisted folding. At 37 °C (▴), aggregated species are formed rapidly and extensively. The light scattering reaches a maximum within 20 s (∼50 × 103 cps). At 25 °C (▪), the final value (∼22 × 103 cps) is lower than that at 37 °C and requires a longer time, ∼ 200 s, to reach equilibrium. The light scattering value at 10 °C (●) does not show any apparent time dependence, and it is only slightly higher than that of native rhodanese measured under identical conditions (6 × 103 versus 3.5 × 103 cps). The small final value of the light scattering at 10 °C may reflect the formation of small oligomeric species during spontaneous folding. Therefore, by lowering the temperature, the step I′ [dharrow] I′′ [dharrow] I n → Aglarge can be limited to I′ [dharrow]I′′ [dharrow] I n. In that case, more active rhodanese would be expected to form through the partition ofI′′ to I′, which would finally produce native enzyme. ∼30% active rhodanese is formed at 10 °C compared with 10% at 25 °C (Fig. 1 A). At lower temperature, more time is required to reach the equilibrium activity values. The longer time to reach the maximum activity at lower temperature is consistent with the suggestion that there is less formation of large irreversible species. Although at higher temperature, e.g. at 25 °C, the rate of reactivation of rhodanese (Fig. 1 A, ▪) is faster than that at 10 °C (Fig. 1 A, ●), the extent of reactivation is higher at 10 °C (Fig. 1 A, ●). According to Scheme FS1, the extent of reactivation is controlled by the irreversible formation of large inactive species that are formed at a higher rate at higher temperature (Fig. 1 B). The poor yield of active enzyme at higher temperature is directly proportional to the formation of large aggregated species (compare Fig.2 C with Fig. 1 B). So suppression of the formation of large aggregates has a direct impact on the final yield of active rhodanese, as it retards the effectively irreversible step: I n → Aglarge. These data indicate that formation of large aggregates primarily determines the final yield of the active rhodanese through the formation ofI′. It has been shown that glycerol inhibits the formation of large aggregates, which form irreversibly from the smaller one during rhodanese folding (2Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 1 B (▾) show that, in keeping with this expectation, no significant scattering occurs during spontaneous folding in the presence of 4 mglycerol.Figure 2Effect of spontaneous folding on the reactivation of rhodanese by GroEL/GroES/ATP. Rhodanese was denatured and spontaneously folded for the indicated times as described in “Methods.” ■, aliquots of spontaneously folded rhodanese were added to folding buffer containing GroEL that had been preincubated at the required temperature. The complexes were incubated at that temperature for 15 min. GroES and ATP were added and incubated at 25 °C for 1.5 h. The value at t = 0 is explained in the text. The samples designated as (▪) are described in the legend of Fig. 1 A. The spontaneous folding of rhodanese was done at 25 (A), 10 (B), and at 37 °C (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As seen in Fig.1, lower temperatures retard the formation of large aggregates. If that favors the formation of more early folding intermediates throughI n → I′′ → I′, GroEL would be able to capture them and then subsequently release more active rhodanese upon the addition of GroES and ATP. The recovery of rhodanese activity when GroEL is added to denatured rhodanese, which has first been allowed to fold spontaneously for the specified time before the addition of GroEL, is shown in Fig. 2. After the preincubation, GroES and ATP are added to release active rhodanese. The t = 0 point at each of the three temperatures indicates a recovery of rhodanese activity of 65–75%, and it corresponds to the case where unfolded rhodanese is added to folding buffer containing GroEL that has been preincubated at the desired temperature. The complex is incubated at that temperature for 15 min. GroES and ATP are added and incubated at 25 °C for an additional 1.5 h. During spontaneous refolding, temperature plays a vital role in forming inactive species (Fig. 1), which increases with increasing temperature. But once the complex has been formed, formation of mis-folded species is inhibited for bound rhodanese, as is demonstrated by the fact that, at t = 0, recovery of active rhodanese at 10, 25, and 37 °C (Fig. 2) is in the same range. Again, if the incubation for the release of active rhodanese is continued, a maximum of 80% active enzyme is recovered. Therefore, within the GroEL-rhodanese complex, intra protein inactivation is limited, such as that from I′ to mis-folded species. Fig. 2 A shows the reactivation of rhodanese at 25 °C. The extent of reactivation with the GroEL system is inversely proportional to the time allowed for spontaneous folding of rhodanese before GroEL captures it. There is a rapid drop in the formation of active species followed by slower steps. In the first phase, there is a 30% loss in the production of active enzyme (i.e. rhodanese activity ∼70% at t = 0) and reaches a plateau value of ∼10% by 200 s. This activity after 200 s is similar to that obtained during unassisted folding (▪). This indicates that after 200 s of preincubation, there are no early folding intermediates present in the solution that can be captured successfully by GroEL and released as active rhodanese by addition of GroES and ATP. The rate of loss of reactivation of rhodanese by GroEL/GroES/ATP (k = 0.0054 ± 0.0006 s−1) is similar to the rate of formation of active species in the unassisted process (0.0072 ± 0.00012 s−1). This suggests that as spontaneous folding proceeds, the population of early folding intermediates, I′, I′′, and I′′′, which can either form active rhodanese through formation ofI′′′ or can be captured and released by GroEL/GroES/ATP, decreases. Fig. 2 B shows the same experiment at 10 °C. As we have already seen, lower temperature inhibits the formation of large aggregates (Fig. 1 B, ●), so one may expect a higher yield of active rhodanese by GroEL/GroES/ATP as unassisted folding proceeds. As expected, the loss of early folding intermediates that can be captured by GroEL is very slow at 10 °C. Even after 3600 s of spontaneous folding, capturable and reactivatable intermediates are present in solution. The final yield of active rhodanese at 10 °C in assisted folding is much higher than that obtained in the unassisted process (Fig. 2 B, 50%, ■, compared with 30%, ▪). This result suggests that at the lower temperature there are some intermediates present in the solution that during unassisted refolding do not form the active protein. But GroEL can capture them and allow them to successfully fold to active enzyme upon the addition of GroES and ATP. So GroEL can also bind and reactivate some species that will not spontaneously form active enzyme. This is demonstrated by the observation in Fig. 2 B that the plateau values for spontaneous and GroEL folding are not coincident, i.e. 20% more active rhodanese is formed at 10 °C with the chaperonin system. Although large aggregated species are not formed at 10 °C, we still do not achieve 100% reactivation either by assisted or by unassisted folding. At 10 °C, the maximum reactivation of active rhodanese from GroEL/GroES/ATP is ∼80%. This suggests that monomeric or small folding intermediates can also form mis-folded species, which removes early folding intermediates and leads to incomplete recovery of the active protein (Scheme FS1). Results from identical experiments at 37 °C are shown in Fig. 2C. There is almost no active rhodanese formed during unassisted folding, which may be due to fast formation of irreversible aggregates. The loss of early folding intermediates is very fast, as there is a large drop in reactivation of rhodanese from ∼75 to ∼7% within 20 s. Fig. 1 B shows that at 37 °C, light scattering reaches a maximum during this time. The loss in reactivation of rhodanese as spontaneous folding proceeds at 37 °C is not due to inactivity of GroEL at 37 °C because the t = 0 value corresponds to GroEL that has been preincubated at this temperature and yields ∼75% reactivation (t = 0 point in Fig.2 C), a value similar to those observed at 25 °C (Fig.2 A) and 10 °C (Fig. 2 B). Native rhodanese is stable at 37 °C under these buffer conditions, so inactivity of the protein is due to processes involving the intermediates and not to inactivation of properly folded rhodanese. The high light scattering value and formation of inactive rhodanese during both assisted and unassisted folding suggest that at 37 °C, the reaction I′ → I′′ → I n→ Aglarge is very rapid. In all experiments, additional incubation of the GroEL samples gave no increase in reactivation. Similarly, introduction of additional GroEL to all samples at 3600 s gave no increased reactivation. Thus, the plateau values shown are taken as the equilibrium values. It has been shown that glycerol inhibits the formation of large aggregates (Fig. 1 B, ▾), which form irreversibly from smaller ones during rhodanese folding (2Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then glycerol should show similar effects on the reactivation of rhodanese as that observed at 10 °C. Fig. 3shows the effect of 4 m glycerol on the unassisted folding of rhodanese (●) at 25 °C. The rate of formation and the final yield of active enzyme is similar to that found at 10 °C (Fig.2 B), ∼30%, which is considerably higher than value obtained at 25 °C (Fig. 2 A, ∼10%). The absence of irreversible, nonproductive aggregates makes more I′ available, which can form active rhodanese through I′′′ (Scheme FS1). So one may expect higher reactivation of rhodanese by the chaperonin system. The loss of reactivation of active rhodanese from GroEL/GroES/ATP (▪) shows very slow time dependence, as spontaneous folding proceeds in the presence of 4 m glycerol. GroEL itself is less efficient in releasing active rhodanese in 4m glycerol (see the t = 0 point in Fig. 3). Since GroEL and rhodanese were incubated together for 15 min before the addition of GroES and ATP, the reduced efficiency of GroEL is not due to slower diffusion of rhodanese onto GroEL. The maximum reactivation of rhodanese obtained is in the range of 40%, when denatured rhodanese is added to folding solution containing GroEL and 4 mglycerol. In the absence of glycerol, the maximum reactivation is ∼70%. The higher yield of active rhodanese during unassisted folding and the slow loss of early folding intermediates that can be captured by GroEL may indicate that in the presence of glycerol, there is partitioning of I′ between I′′ andI′′′ as we observed at 25 °C, but glycerol retards the formation of irreversible aggregated species and maintains the equilibrium among early folding intermediates. Beyond ∼800 s of spontaneous refolding, no early folding intermediates are present that can be captured by GroEL, as there is no further reactivation of rhodanese by GroEL/GroES/ATP. Since glycerol appears to inhibit the formation of large aggregates, the lack of capturable intermediates beyond 800 s may be due to formation of mis-folded species from monomeric intermediates such as I′, I′′, andI′′′ (Scheme FS1). It appears then that the presence of intermediates like I′ ultimately determines the higher reactivation during folding either through the formation ofI′′′ or by being captured by GroEL. At lower temperatures or in the presence of a high concentration of glycerol formation of active rhodanese is the predominant pathway during unassisted folding, as there is no appreciable formation of large, irreversible aggregates. However, the suppression of aggregation still does not yield 100% active rhodanese as we get only a maximum yield of 30% at 10 °C and in the presence of 4 m glycerol during unassisted folding. These data suggest that I′, I′′, andI′′′ form mis-folded species, which lead to incomplete recovery of active rhodanese during spontaneous folding. The incomplete recovery of active hen lysozyme has been reported (33Klibanov A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 97-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). It has been shown that spontaneous folding in buffer produced 38% active protein, whereas in 3.44 m glycerol, the activity regained was 42%. Therefore, competition among off-pathway aggregation, formation of mis-folded species from folding intermediates, and interconversion of species such as I′′ to I′ dictate the final yield of the active rhodanese. According to SchemeFS1, irreversible formation of large, unproductive aggregated species during folding is a major contributor to the inefficient reactivation of rhodanese during both assisted and unassisted folding. If GroEL could reverse the large aggregated species, one should expect lower light scattering in the presence of GroEL. Fig.4 shows the light scattering of the species formed by spontaneous folding that was allowed to proceed for the noted times at different temperatures and then followed by the addition of GroEL. The shapes of the profiles for the light-scattering values of spontaneously folded rhodanese in Figs. 1 B and 4are similar. At 10 °C, there is no time-dependent increase in the scattering (●), and the value is close to that of native rhodanese under identical conditions. This result is consistent with the idea that at low temperature, intermediates are formed that are not large enough to scatter light. The addition of GroEL does not have any effect on the scattering values. At 37 °C, there is very fast formation of large aggregates, which is irreversible under the conditions used here. Aggregation favors removal of folding intermediates through the process I′ → I′ →I n → Aglarge. If GroEL could capture these large aggregates through the formation of monomeric intermediates, the scattering value in the presence of GroEL should be lower. But at 37 °C, the rapidly enhanced light scattering remains unchanged in the presence of GroEL (compare Fig. 1 B with Fig. 4, ▴). The profile at 25 °C (▪) shows time-dependent increase in the scattering values as spontaneous folding proceeds. It reaches a maximum value by 400 s. By this time, the release of active rhodanese by GroEL/GroES/ATP reaches its minimum level (Fig. 2 A). This time dependence of the light scattering may reflect the fact that in the initial stages of spontaneous folding (less than 400 s) early folding intermediates are present that could be captured by GroEL. But at the later stage large aggregates predominate (Scheme FS1). Thus, constant light-scattering values in the presence of GroEL (Fig. 4) indicate that GroEL cannot reverse large aggregates once they have formed. From our data, we suggest that GroEL can bind folding intermediates like I′, I′′, and I′′′. Even in the absence of the aggregate-forming pathway, mis-folding can occur. These processes remove productive folding intermediates from solution, which results in incomplete recovery of active rhodanese either during unassisted folding or from GroEL/GroES/ATP even at lower temperatures. GroEL can reverse some species, which themselves would not form active protein if left to the spontaneous process. Binding to GroEL significantly inhibits intra protein inactivation of rhodanese."

We report here that some mutants in the p53 hinge domain, a short linker between the DNA binding and tetramerization domains, differentially activated the promoters of p53 target genes and possessed an impaired apoptotic function. Our results indicate that the hinge domain may play an important role in differentially regulating p53 cell cycle arrest and apoptotic functions. However, the mechanisms by which p53 hinge domain mutants differentially activate its target genes, e.g. p21 WAF1/CIP1 and Bax, remain unknown. To investigate the possible mechanisms, recombinant p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax promoters were constructed, resulting in rearrangement of the existing p53 binding sites within a given promoter or actually swapping p53 binding sites between the two promoters. Our results suggest that multiple mechanisms of differential transactivation occur, depending on the molecular nature of the relevant hinge domain mutant, such as the possibility that dual separate DNA binding sites in the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter are responsible for the selective transactivation activity of p53 hinge domain mutant del300–327, which has a large deletion in the hinge domain. Lack of ideal p53 binding sites in the Bax promoter results in less potent activation than that seen with the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter when it is transactivated by hinge domain point mutant mutR306P or short deletion mutant del300–308 proteins.

The cell cycle arrest is mediated, at least in part, by the induction by p53 of p21WAF1/CIP1 (7el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W.

Some tumor-derived p53 point mutants within the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain show specific loss of apoptotic function despite retaining wild type cell cycle arrest activities (15Rowan S.

We have previously reported that two germline-derived hinge domain p53 mutants have lost apoptotic but not cell cycle arrest functions (19Aurelio O.N. Cajot J.F. Hua M.L. Khwaja Z. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2190-2195PubMed Google Scholar,20Aurelio O.N. Kong X.T. Gupta S. Stanbridge E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The hinge domain is a small short linker between the specific DNA-binding domain and the tetramerization domain. Other investigators demonstrated that a mutant p53 with a deleted hinge domain exhibited novel DNA binding properties consistent with an inability to recognize four contiguous DNA repeats of a p53 consensus binding site, suggesting that this domain may be involved in allosteric regulation of DNA binding (21Waterman J.L. Shenk J.L. Halazonetis T.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To futher elucidate the biological functions of the p53 hinge domain, we investigated additional p53 hinge domain mutants with sporadic point mutations and deletions within this domain to determine whether they have impaired functions. We found that certain p53 hinge domain mutants differentially activated the promoters of p53 target genes p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax and possessed an impaired apoptotic function. To understand the possible mechanisms by which the hinge domain mutants selectively use the promoters of p53 target genes, we swapped the p53 binding sites between the promoters of p21WAF1/CIP1 andBax and further rearranged the p53 binding sites in the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter to observe whether the transactivation activities of the hinge domain mutants would alter accordingly. Plasmids pGEMhp53wtB, pGEMhp53del300–308, pGEMhp53del300–327, and pGEMhp53del324–332 were generous gifts from T. D. Halazonetis (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). The mutations P300S and R306P and the deletion at residues 324–325 were introduced into the context of pGEMhp53wtB by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (19Aurelio O.N. Cajot J.F. Hua M.L. Khwaja Z. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2190-2195PubMed Google Scholar). These constructs are termed pGEMhp53mutP300S, pGEMhp53mutR306P, and pGEMhp53del324–325, respectively. The wild type and various mutant p53 inserts from the above corresponding PGEM4 plasmids were subcloned into thePvuII and HindIII sites of the pREP4 (Invitrogen), a Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven expression vector with an episomal origin of replication. A DNA-binding domain mutant, mutV143A, was used as a negative control in this study. It lacks all transactivating and apoptosis-inducing functions that were analyzed in this study (19Aurelio O.N. Cajot J.F. Hua M.L. Khwaja Z. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2190-2195PubMed Google Scholar). The p53-null human tumor cell line Saos-2 was obtained from Dr. W. H. Lee (University of Texas, San Antonio, TX) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Two firefly luciferase reporter constructs, the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter (WWP-luc) and the Bax promoter (Bax-luc) were gifts from Drs. B. Vogelstein (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and J. C. Reed (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA), respectively. Saos-2 cells (2.0 × 105) were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate. The following day, 1 µg of either WWP-luc or Bax-luc was cotransfected with 0.2 µg of a p53-expressing plasmid and 0.02 µg of a Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid, pCMV-RL (Promega), using the Effectene procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Germany). Each transfection of the different p53 expression plasmids was done in duplicate for each experiment, and the experiment was repeated three to four times with the indicated wild type or mutant p53. The cell lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection for luciferase assays. The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase was calculated for each transfection, and the results were expressed as the fold transactivation relative to wild type p53 averaged over the set of the experiments. Western blotting was performed as described previously (19Aurelio O.N. Cajot J.F. Hua M.L. Khwaja Z. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2190-2195PubMed Google Scholar, 20Aurelio O.N. Kong X.T. Gupta S. Stanbridge E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (15 µg) of cell lysates were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then were transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The proteins were detected with human p53 monoclonal mouse antibody DO-1 (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz), p21WAF1/CIP1 polyclonal rabbit antibody C-19 (1:300; Santa Cruz), and monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:5000; Sigma). Secondary antibodies were either anti-mouse Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or anti-rabbit-Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (both antibodies at 1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz). Saos-2 cells (2.0 × 105) were seeded into each well of a 6-well plate. The next day, cells were transfected with 1 µg of the indicated p53 wild type or mutant expression plasmids. The cells were placed under hygromycin selection (100 units/ml) 48 h post-transfection. After 12–14 days of selection, hygromycin-resistant colonies were fixed and stained with 0.3% crystal violet in ethanol, and the colonies were counted. The day before transfection, 7.5 × 105 cells were seeded into a 100-mm-diameter Petri dish. The cells were transfected with 2 µg of each p53 expression plasmid the next day. Total populations of transfected cells, including floating and adherent cells, were harvested at the indicated times and fixed in 75% ethanol for at least 2 h at −20 °C. The cells were then rehydrated in cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted and incubated with 20 µl (for 1 × 106 cells) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated p53 antibody (Pharmagen) overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Following phosphate-buffered saline washes, the cells were treated with 150 µg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with 1 µg/ml propidium iodide for 15 min. The cells were analyzed in a FACScan cell scanner (Becton Dickinson) for their fluorescein isothiocyanate intensity (green channel) and propidium iodide intensity (red channel). Total populations were gated to remove doublets and very small debris. Background levels of fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence were established with the untransfected cells. The cells in p53 transfected populations with high fluorescence were gated and analyzed as the p53-expressing population. Apoptosis analysis was performed with the CellQuest analysis software (Becton Dickinson). Apoptosis induced by each p53 protein was expressed as the percentage of the cells with a sub-G1 DNA content in excess of that seen in the vector-only transfected population. The p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter contains two p53 binding sites (p21BS1 and p21BS2) separated by 870 bp1 of intervening DNA sequence (22el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Waldman T. Oliner J.D. Velculescu V.E. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Healy E. Rees J.L. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2910-2919PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the Bax promoter contains a single p53 binding site (BaxBS) (10Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The consensus p53 BSs were swapped between WWP-luc and Bax-luc by using a three-step polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis procedure (23Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The new constructs containing BaxBS within the p21WAF1/CIP1 core promoter reporter (WWP-luc) were named WWP(BaxBS)-lucs, including WWP(BaxBS1)-luc (BaxBS replacing p21BS1 and removing p21BS2), WWP(BaxBS+p21BS2)-luc (BaxBS replacing p21BS1 but retaining p21BS2), WWP(BaxBS2)-luc (BaxBS replacing p21BS2 and removing p21BS1), WWP(p21BS1+ BaxBS)-luc (BaxBS replacing p21BS2 but retaining p21BS1), and WWP(BaxBS+BaxBS)-luc (two BaxBSs replacing both BS1 and BS2 of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter) (see Table Iand Fig. 1A). The plasmid constructs in which p21BSs replace BaxBS within the Bax core promoter reporter (Bax-luc) were named Bax(p21BS)-lucs. They included Bax(p21BS1)-luc, Bax(p21BS2)-luc, Bax(p21BS1/BS2)-luc (there are no nucleotides between the two binding sites), and Bax(p21BS1+BS2)-luc (between the two binding sites, there are 870 bp of intervening DNA sequence retained from the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter) (see Table I and Fig.1 B).Table IConsensus p53 binding sites in the wild type and the recombinant p21WAP1/CIP1 and Bax promoter reportersPromoter reportersSequence in the position of p21-p53 binding site 1 (p21BS1)Intervening DNA sequenceSequence in the position of p21-p53 binding site 2 (p21BS2)Binding sitesWWP-luc1-aRef. 7.GAACATGTCC cAACATGTTg870 bpAGACTgGgCA tGtCTgGgCAp21BS1 and BS2WWP(p21BS1)-lucGAACATGTCC cAACATGTTgp21BS1WWP(p21BS2)-lucAGACTgGgCA tGtCTgGgCAp21BS2WWP(p21BS1/BS2)-lucGAACATGTCC cAACATGTTg0 bpAGACTgGgCA tGtCTgGgCAp21BS1/BS2WWP(BaxBS1)-luc1-bBaxBS1 and BaxBS2 are both BaxBS but located in the positions of p21BS1 and p21BS2 separately.TcACAAGTTag AGACAAGCCTBaxBSGGGCgTGggCWWP(BaxBS2)-luc1-bBaxBS1 and BaxBS2 are both BaxBS but located in the positions of p21BS1 and p21BS2 separately.TcACAAGTTag AGACAAGCCTBaxBSGGGCgTGggCWWP(BaxBS+BaxBS)-lucTcACAAGTTag AGACAAGCCT870 bpTcACAAGTTag AGACAAGCCTBaxBSsGGGCgTGggCGGGCgTGggCWWP(BaxBS+p21BS2)-lucTcACAAGTTag AGACAAGCCT870 bpAGACTgGgCA tGtCTgGgCABaxBS andGGGCgTGggCp21BS2WWP(p21BS1+BaxBS)-lucGAACATGTCC cAACATGTTg870 bpTcACAAGTTag AGACAAGCCTp21BS1 andGGGCgTGggCBaxBSPromoter reportersSequence in the position of Bax-p53 binding site (BaxBS)Binding sitesBax-luc1-cRef. 10.TcACAAGTTag AGACAAGCCT GGGCgTGggCBaxBSBax(p21BS1)-lucGAACATGTCC cAACATGTTgp21BS1Bax(p21BS2)-lucAGACTgGgCA tGtCTgGgCAp21BS2Bax(p21BS1/BS2)-lucGAACATGTCC cAACATGTT gAGACTgGgCA tGtCTgGgCAp21BS1/BS2Bax(p21BS1+BS2)-lucGAACATGTCC cAACATGTTg870 bpAGACTgGgCA tGtCTgGgCAp21BS1 and BS2Sequences that compromise the consensus p53 binding site (27el-Deiry W.S.

A lowercase italic letter between the half-sites of the Bax-p53 binding elements refers to the nucleotide that does not belong to the consensus binding site, p21, p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter Bax, Bax promoter. By using the three-step polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis protocol (23Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), BS1 and BS2 were individually removed from the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter reporter, WWP-luc, forming the new plasmid constructs WWP(p21BS2)-luc and WWP(p21BS1)-luc, respectively. The WWP(p21BS1/BS2)-luc was constructed by eliminating the intervening nucleotides between BS1 and BS2 in the WWP-luc (see Table I and Fig.1 C). The hinge domain is a short linker that links the p53 DNA-binding domain (spanning amino acids 102–297) to the tetramerization domain (encompassing amino acids 326–354) (24Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar, 25Jeffrey P.D. Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, the hinge domain is positioned between amino acids 298 and 325 (19Aurelio O.N. Cajot J.F. Hua M.L. Khwaja Z. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2190-2195PubMed Google Scholar). Six p53 hinge domain mutants were analyzed for their ability to activate transcription from two important p53-responsive promoters, p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax, in this study. The mutants included two spontaneous point mutation (mutP300S, mutR306P) and four deletion mutants. Two of these four deletion mutants have deleted amino acids from only the hinge domain (del324–325 and del300–308), and the other two also lack two or more amino acids from the tetramerization domain, in addition to the hinge domain (del300–327 and del324–332). Also included in this study was mutV143A, a well studied p53 missense mutant with a mutation at codon 143 within the p53-specific DNA-binding domain. This mutant has no ability to induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis at 37 °C (19Aurelio O.N. Cajot J.F. Hua M.L. Khwaja Z. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2190-2195PubMed Google Scholar, 26Friedlander P. Haupt Y. Prives C. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4961-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mutants for the ability to transactivate the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter in the p53 null human Saos-2 cell line showed that almost all of the hinge domain mutants retained their ability to transactivate the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter to a level comparable with or even higher than that exhibited by wild type p53 protein (Fig. 2A). Only one mutant, del324–332, which has two amino acids (amino acids 324 and 325) from the hinge domain and seven amino acids (amino acids 326–332) from the tetramerization domain deleted, was unable to transactivate the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter (Fig. 2 A). Because the mutant del324–325 retained the ability to transactivate the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter, we assume that the defect in the transactivation of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter by del324–332 was most likely due to its deletion of amino acids 326–332 within the tetramerization domain. Thus, del324–332 is considered to be a tetramerization domain mutant. This tetramerization domain mutant has lost all transactivation, growth suppression, and apoptosis-inducing functions (data not shown), similar to muta143v, and was not analyzed further in this paper. Consistent with the observation from transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter, endogenous p21WAF1/CIP1 protein expression was activated by all of the hinge domain mutants to levels comparable with that of the wild type p53 protein (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to the transactivation of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter, three hinge domain mutants (mutR306P, del300–308, and del300–327) were partly defective in activating the transcription from the Bax promoter (Fig.2 C). They displayed an average transactivation of 26, 30, and 24% of wild type p53, respectively. By contrast, the mutants, mutP300S and del324–325 retained the wild type ability to transactivate the Bax promoter. To investigate whether the hinge domain mutants that retained the ability to transactivate the p21WAF1/CIP1promoter could induce an overall arrest of cell growth, we performed growth suppression assays with p53-transfected Saos-2 cells. Expression vectors for the various p53 cDNAs bearing a hygromycin resistance gene were transfected into Saos-2 cells. After ∼2 weeks of selection in medium containing hygromycin, the vector control transfection yielded an average of 145 colonies (this experiment was repeated three times, with each experiment done in duplicate). Consistent with the transcriptional activation of p21WAF1/CIP1 promoters, the hinge domain mutants retained all of the growth-suppressing activity of wild type p53 (Fig. 3). Because Bax is one of the obvious candidates for a p53-responsive gene involved in wild type p53 induction of apoptosis, and our previous (19Aurelio O.N. Cajot J.F. Hua M.L. Khwaja Z. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2190-2195PubMed Google Scholar) and current studies have demonstrated that some hinge domain mutants have reduced the ability to transactivate the Bax promoter, we therefore sought to test their ability to induce apoptosis in Saos-2 cells. Various p53 wild type or mutant expression plasmids were transfected into Saos-2 cells. The samples were fixed 48 and 72 h post-transfection. The cells were then subjected to FACS analysis. We found that the mutants (mutR306P, del300–308, and del300–327) that had a reduced ability to transactivate the Bax promoter exhibited more than 50% loss of apoptosis induction compared with wild type p53. mutP300S and del324–325 induced the same level of apoptosis as wild type p53, and mutV143A had very little apoptotic function (Fig.4, A and B). In agreement with our earlier report (19Aurelio O.N. Cajot J.F. Hua M.L. Khwaja Z. Stanbridge E.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2190-2195PubMed Google Scholar), more Saos-2 cells had undergone apoptosis at 72 h than 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 4,A and B). Examples of the FACS analyses are shown in Fig. 4 C. Original and various recombinant p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax luciferase reporter plasmids were cotransfected with wild type p53 and the Renilla luciferase internal control, pCMV-RL (Promega) into Saos-2 cells. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cell lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activities were measured with a luminometer. The results were expressed as the percentages of transactivation relative to the original WWP-luc or Bax-luc reporter. Substituting BaxBS within Bax-luc with p21BS1 or p21BS2, as well as p21BS1/BS2 or p21(BS1+BS2), increased the transcriptional activities by 5–10-fold compared with Bax-luc and 1.5–3-fold compared with WWP-luc (Fig. 5A). The transactivation levels of Bax(p21BS1)-luc and Bax(p21BS2)-luc are almost same, demonstrating that these two binding sites have similar affinities for p53 binding, although the p21BS2 is less ideal than p21BS1 (TableI) according to the definition of an optimal p53 BS (27el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the idealness of a binding site is not the only factor that affects the affinity for the wild type p53 binding. Inserting the BaxBS into the p21WAF1/CIP1promoter significantly diminished the transcriptional activities (Fig.5 B), which, together with the data shown in Fig.5 A, supports the notion that the p21BS has a stronger affinity than the BaxBS (28Friedlander P. Legros Y. Soussi T. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25468-25478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Replacing p21BS1 with BaxBS but retaining p21BS2 in the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter (WWP(BaxBS+p21BS2)-luc) had little effect on the transcriptional activity. However, replacing the p21BS2 with the BaxBS while retaining p21BS1 (WWP(p21BS1+BaxBS)-luc) showed an approximately 80% decrease in comparison with WWP-luc (Fig. 5 B). Compared with WWP-luc, WWP- (p21BS1)-luc and WWP(p21BS2)-luc showed significantly reduced luciferase activities (Fig. 5 C). Retaining p21BS1 in the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter (WWP(p21BS1)-luc) resulted in lower luciferase activity than retaining p21BS2 (WWP(p21BS2)-luc). The data of Fig. 5 (B and C) suggest that the p21BS2 position in WWP-luc, which is closer to the TATA box of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter, might be the dominant site in response to p53 transactivation. Deleting the intervening nucleotides between these two binding sites (WWP(p21BS1/BS2)-luc) did not significantly affect the transcriptional activity compared with WWP-luc. (Fig. 5 C), indicating that the intervening sequence does not significantly affect the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter activation activity. Wild type p53 more efficiently transactivated the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter compared with the Bax promoter (Fig.5, A and B). Other groups have speculated that this is due to the fact that p53 binds more efficiently to the binding sites in the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter than in the Bax promoter (28Friedlander P. Legros Y. Soussi T. Prives C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25468-25478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this is the mechanism by which the p53 hinge domain mutants differentially transactivated the p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax promoters, we swapped the consensus p53 BSs between the p21WAF1/CIP1 and Bax promoters. The p21BS-inserted Bax promoter plasmids, including Bax(p21BS1)-luc, Bax(p21BS2)-luc, Bax(p21BS1/BS2)-luc, and Bax(p21BS1+BS2)-luc (TableI), were cotransfected with wild type p53 and the various p53 mutants. Of the three hinge domain mutants that had defects in transactivating the Bax-luc (Fig. 2 C), mutR306P and del300–308 had almost the same ability to activate the transcriptions from Bax(p21BS1)-luc, Bax(p21BS1/BS2-luc), and Bax(p21BS1+BS2)-luc as wild type p53 (Fig.6, A, C, andD), whereas they showed a 25–30% reduction in the ability to transactivate Bax(p21BS2)-luc (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the unidealness of a binding site (BaxBS or p21BS2) in a promoter may reduce the transactivation of the promoter by these two hinge domain mutation. Unlike mutR306P and del300–308, the del300–327 mutant showed about 50–80% reduction in the ability to transactivate Bax(p21BS1)-luc, Bax(p21BS2)-luc, and Baxp21BS1/BS2-luc (Fig. 6,A–C). This indicates that a single p53 binding site or two binding sites without a spacer may greatly reduce the transcriptional responsiveness to thi"

The signature feature of this enzyme family is the ability to hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates and inorganic phosphate in the presence of either manganese or cobalt. The defining structural elements of the family are two glutamate-rich motifs (strands β1 and β11 in Fig.1) that are required for catalysis.The crystal structure of Cet1 illuminates surprising structural complexity for an enzyme that catalyzes a mundane phosphohydrolase reaction (13Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cet1 adopts a novel active site fold whereby an antiparallel eight-strand β barrel forms a topologically closed “triphosphate tunnel” (Fig.2). The hydrophilic tunnel contained a single sulfate coordinated by multiple basic side chains projecting into the cavity. It was proposed that the side chain interactions of the sulfate reflect contacts made by the enzyme with the γ-phosphate of the triphosphate-terminated RNA or nucleoside triphosphate substrates (13Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A manganese ion within the tunnel cavity is coordinated with octahedral geometry to the sulfate, to the side chain carboxylates of the two glutamates in β1, and to a glutamate in β11.Figure 2The triphosphate tunnel and the hydrophobic back surface of the tunnel floor. Stereo view of a cross-section of the tunnel of S. cerevisiae Cet1. The figure highlights the elaborate network of bonding interactions, especially those that coordinate sulfate (γ-phosphate) and manganese. The manganese (blue sphere) interacts with octahedral geometry with the sulfate, three glutamates, and two waters (red spheres). The putative nucleophilic water is coordinated by Glu433, which is posited to act as a general base catalyst. The tunnel rests on a globular pedestal domain (not shown). The hydrophobic side chains (Ile304, Leu306, Met308, Phe310, Val493, Leu495) on the back side of the β strands of the tunnel floor that comprise the tunnel-pedestal interface are illustrated.

Alanine scanning mutagenesis has identified 15 individual side chains within the tunnel that are important for Cet1 function in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1). Moreover, each of the eight strands of the β barrel contributes at least one functional constituent of the active site. The relevant structural features of the 15 key amino acids have been determined through the analysis of conservative mutational effects (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have grouped the active site residues into three functional classes. Class I residues participate directly in catalysis via coordination of the γ-phosphate (Arg393, Lys456, Arg458) or the essential metal (Glu305, Glu307, Glu496). Class II residues make water-mediated contacts with the γ-phosphate (Asp377, Glu433) or the metal (Asp471, Glu494). Class III residues function indirectly in catalysis via their interactions with other essential side chains and/or their stabilization of the tunnel architecture (Lys409, Arg454, Arg469, Thr473, Glu492).Based on the structure of the putative product complex and the mutational results, we have proposed a one-step in-line mechanism whereby the metal ion (coordinated by acidic residues on the tunnel floor) plus the Arg393, Arg458, and Lys456 side chains (emanating from the walls and roof) activate the γ-phosphate for attack by water and stabilize a pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state in which the attacking water is apical to the β-phosphate leaving group (14Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We further speculated that the Glu433 side chain coordinates the nucleophilic water molecule (Fig. 2) and serves as general base catalyst.Mutational studies have also identified several functionally important hydrophobic residues located on the “outward” face of the β strands of the tunnel (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Lehman K. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For example, alanine substitutions for Leu306 (in β1) and Val493 or Leu495 (in β11) result in temperature-sensitive yeast growth and thermolability of catalytic activity in vitro(4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These hydrophobic residues are in no position to participate directly in catalysis (Fig. 2). It is therefore thought that the deleterious effects of mutating these residues reflects the importance of their hydrophobic interactions with the globular protein core that serves as a pedestal upon which the tunnel floor rests (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Lehman K. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).To embellish the picture of the enzyme mechanism and the interactions supporting the tunnel structure, we have extended the mutational analysis to 17 new amino acids denoted by dots in Fig. 1. We thereby identified two important side chains (Arg321 and Asp425) that stabilize Cet1 via their interaction to form a buried salt bridge within the pedestal. A third residue Ser429 stabilizes Cet1 when the protein is synthesized at reduced temperature.DISCUSSIONThe unique fold of Cet1 and the complex, delicate architecture of its active site provide the impetus for a comprehensive mutational analysis of both the catalytic mechanism and the interactions that stabilize the fold. Here we have probed the function of 17 individual side chains by alanine scanning. The mutated residues were either located in the triphosphate tunnel (Ser373, Thr375, Gln405, His411, Ser429, Glu488, Thr490), on the tunnel's outer surface (Ser378, Ser487, Thr489, His491), at the tunnel-pedestal interface (Ile304, Met308), or in the pedestal itself (Asp315, Lys317, Arg321, Asp425). Alanine mutations at 14/17 positions had no significant effect on Cet1 phosphohydrolase activity in vitro and had no effect on Cet1 function in vivo. These negative results are instructive when taken together with prior mutational analyses and the crystal structure of Cet1.We have now mutated all of the hydrophilic amino acids that project into the triphosphate tunnel. Three of the six tunnel residues found here to be nonessential for Cet1 function (Ser373 and Thr375 in β5 and Glu488 in β11) make no contacts in the crystal structure with the metal cofactor, the γ-phosphate, or other amino acid side chains in the tunnel. Thus, it is sensible that these three residues are unimportant for Cet1 function; indeed they are not conserved in other family members (Fig.1). However, the four other tunnel residues analyzed presently do participate in the elaborate network of side chain interactions in the tunnel cavity (Fig. 2). Gln405(Oε) engages in a hydrogen bond with Arg393(Nζ). Arg393 is an essential catalytic residue (14Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that makes a bidentate interaction with the γ-phosphate (Fig. 2). The hydrogen bond with Gln405 is apparently not required to correctly orient Arg393 for catalysis by Cet1, which is consistent with the lack of conservation of the Gln405 position in other family members (Fig. 1). His411(Nδ) forms a hydrogen bond with Asn431(Oδ), while Asn431(Nδ) interacts Glu305(Oε) and Glu307(Oε) (Fig. 2). Glu305 and Glu307 directly coordinate the metal and are essential for catalysis (3Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Asn431 is not important for Cet1 function in vivo or in vitro (14Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); thus it is sensible that His411, which contacts only Asn431, is also nonessential. Thr490(Oγ) forms a hydrogen bond to Glu492(Oε). Glu492 is an essential side chain that forms a salt bridge with Arg454 in β9 (Fig. 2). Arg454 is itself essential for Cet1 function, and it has been suggested that Arg454 contacts the α- or β-phosphate of the substrate (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Apparently, the contact of Thr490 with Glu492 is not required for the essential interaction of Glu492 with Arg454.Ser378 in β5 and Ser487, Thr489, and His491 in β11 are located on the outer solvent-exposed surface of the tunnel and are noncontributory to Cet1 function. Ser378, Ser487, and His491 make no contacts with other residues in the crystal structure (Fig. 3). Thr489(Oγ) engages in a hydrogen bond with Glu476(Oε), but this interaction is apparently not important.Studies performed prior to solving the Cet1 structure showed that hydrophobic residues Leu306, Phe310, Val493, and Leu495 play important roles in Cet1 function and stability (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is now apparent from the crystal structure that these side chains are part of a rich network of hydrophobic interactions between residues on the “back” sides of the β strands of the tunnel floor (Fig. 2) and amino acids in the globular pedestal that supports the tunnel. For example, Phe310, which is essential for Cet1 function in vivo and in vitro, makes extensive van der Waals interactions with Val426, with Val493 and Leu495 in β11 (both of which are important for activityin vitro and for thermal stability of Cet1), and with Ile530. Val493 interacts with Ile343 and Leu351 in addition to its contact to Phe310. Leu306(β1), which is also important for triphosphatase activity and thermal stability (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), interacts with Val289. Here we found that two other hydrophobic residues in β1, Ile304 and Met308, that comprise part of the tunnel-pedestal interface, are not important for Cet1 stabilityin vivo or activity in vitro. Ile304projects into the hydrophobic core of the pedestal and makes van der Waals interactions with Ile296, Leu430, and Leu423. Met308 interacts with Val426 and Phe523.The present study highlights the importance of a buried salt bridge between Arg321 and Asp425 for the stability of Cet1 in vivo and in vitro. The Arg and Asp of this ion pair are strictly conserved in other fungal RNA triphosphatases (CaCet1, Cth1, Pct1) and in P. falciparumPrt1 (Fig. 1), yet neither the Arg nor the Asp are found inChlorella virus RNA triphosphatase cvRtp1. cvRtp1 has an asparagine in lieu of the Arg321 side chain and a glycine instead of the Asp (Fig. 1). We surmise that: (i) there is tight co-evolution of both members of the ion pair, and (ii) theChlorella virus enzyme, which is the smallest member of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family (193-amino acids), has developed alternative strategies to stabilize an active conformation.The Arg321-Asp425 ion pair is part of a wider local network of interactions within the pedestal (Fig. 7). These include hydrogen bonds between Arg321(Nζ) and the main chain carbonyl oxygens of Ser419 and Asp422, which are located in the loop that connects strands β7 and β8. Also, Asp425(Oδ) engages in a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Ser419. We infer that the salt bridge and associated backbone contacts stabilize the inferior portions of the β7 and β8 strands and the intervening loop as they project down from the wall of the triphosphatase tunnel deep into the pedestal.The crystal structure provides no immediate explanation for the cold-sensitive folding defects elicited by mutations of Ser429 to Ala and Val and the partial defect of the S429T mutant. Ser429 projects upward from the tunnel floor into the tunnel cavity, yet it makes no direct contact with other amino acids in the crystal. Ser429(Oγ) is pointing toward Nζ of Lys309 (a nonessential side chain), but the interatomic distance of 3.9 Å is too long for a standard hydrogen bond. It is conceivable that the distance to Lys309 is closer in solution. Ser429 might also make water-mediated contacts, either with other amino acids or with the 5′-triphosphate substrate, that are not apparent from the crystal structure of the product complex and that assist in the folding of the protein when it is synthesized at low temperatures in vivo. Ser429 is conserved in all of the other metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases except cvRtp1, which has an alanine instead (Fig. 1). Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cet1 is an essential enzyme that performs the first step of mRNA cap formation: the hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of nascent pre-mRNA to form a 5′-diphosphate end (1Tsukamoto T.

Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cet1 exemplifies a distinctive family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that includes other fungal RNA triphosphatases (e.g. Candida albicansCaCet1, S. cerevisiae Cth1, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pct1) and the RNA triphosphatase components of the poxvirus, baculovirus, Chlorella virus, and Plasmodium falciparum RNA capping enzymes (3Ho C.K.

The signature feature of this enzyme family is the ability to hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates and inorganic phosphate in the presence of either manganese or cobalt. The defining structural elements of the family are two glutamate-rich motifs (strands β1 and β11 in Fig.1) that are required for catalysis. The crystal structure of Cet1 illuminates surprising structural complexity for an enzyme that catalyzes a mundane phosphohydrolase reaction (13Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cet1 adopts a novel active site fold whereby an antiparallel eight-strand β barrel forms a topologically closed “triphosphate tunnel” (Fig.2). The hydrophilic tunnel contained a single sulfate coordinated by multiple basic side chains projecting into the cavity. It was proposed that the side chain interactions of the sulfate reflect contacts made by the enzyme with the γ-phosphate of the triphosphate-terminated RNA or nucleoside triphosphate substrates (13Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A manganese ion within the tunnel cavity is coordinated with octahedral geometry to the sulfate, to the side chain carboxylates of the two glutamates in β1, and to a glutamate in β11. The interior of the tunnel has a distinctively baroque architecture supported by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, of which a surprisingly high proportion are required for enzyme activity (3Ho C.K.

Class I residues participate directly in catalysis via coordination of the γ-phosphate (Arg393, Lys456, Arg458) or the essential metal (Glu305, Glu307, Glu496). Class II residues make water-mediated contacts with the γ-phosphate (Asp377, Glu433) or the metal (Asp471, Glu494). Class III residues function indirectly in catalysis via their interactions with other essential side chains and/or their stabilization of the tunnel architecture (Lys409, Arg454, Arg469, Thr473, Glu492).

We further speculated that the Glu433 side chain coordinates the nucleophilic water molecule (Fig. 2) and serves as general base catalyst. Mutational studies have also identified several functionally important hydrophobic residues located on the “outward” face of the β strands of the tunnel (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol.

For example, alanine substitutions for Leu306 (in β1) and Val493 or Leu495 (in β11) result in temperature-sensitive yeast growth and thermolability of catalytic activity in vitro(4Pei Y. Ho C.K.

Alanine mutations at 14/17 positions had no significant effect on Cet1 phosphohydrolase activity in vitro and had no effect on Cet1 function in vivo.

The hydrogen bond with Gln405 is apparently not required to correctly orient Arg393 for catalysis by Cet1, which is consistent with the lack of conservation of the Gln405 position in other family members (Fig. 1). His411(Nδ) forms a hydrogen bond with Asn431(Oδ), while Asn431(Nδ) interacts Glu305(Oε) and Glu307(Oε) (Fig. 2). Glu305 and Glu307 directly coordinate the metal and are essential for catalysis (3Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Thr490(Oγ) forms a hydrogen bond to Glu492(Oε). Glu492 is an essential side chain that forms a salt bridge with Arg454 in β9 (Fig. 2). Arg454 is itself essential for Cet1 function, and it has been suggested that Arg454 contacts the α- or β-phosphate of the substrate (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Apparently, the contact of Thr490 with Glu492 is not required for the essential interaction of Glu492 with Arg454.Ser378 in β5 and Ser487, Thr489, and His491 in β11 are located on the outer solvent-exposed surface of the tunnel and are noncontributory to Cet1 function. Ser378, Ser487, and His491 make no contacts with other residues in the crystal structure (Fig. 3). Thr489(Oγ) engages in a hydrogen bond with Glu476(Oε), but this interaction is apparently not important.Studies performed prior to solving the Cet1 structure showed that hydrophobic residues Leu306, Phe310, Val493, and Leu495 play important roles in Cet1 function and stability (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is now apparent from the crystal structure that these side chains are part of a rich network of hydrophobic interactions between residues on the “back” sides of the β strands of the tunnel floor (Fig. 2) and amino acids in the globular pedestal that supports the tunnel. For example, Phe310, which is essential for Cet1 function in vivo and in vitro, makes extensive van der Waals interactions with Val426, with Val493 and Leu495 in β11 (both of which are important for activityin vitro and for thermal stability of Cet1), and with Ile530. Val493 interacts with Ile343 and Leu351 in addition to its contact to Phe310. Leu306(β1), which is also important for triphosphatase activity and thermal stability (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), interacts with Val289. Here we found that two other hydrophobic residues in β1, Ile304 and Met308, that comprise part of the tunnel-pedestal interface, are not important for Cet1 stabilityin vivo or activity in vitro. Ile304projects into the hydrophobic core of the pedestal and makes van der Waals interactions with Ile296, Leu430, and Leu423. Met308 interacts with Val426 and Phe523.The present study highlights the importance of a buried salt bridge between Arg321 and Asp425 for the stability of Cet1 in vivo and in vitro. The Arg and Asp of this ion pair are strictly conserved in other fungal RNA triphosphatases (CaCet1, Cth1, Pct1) and in P. falciparumPrt1 (Fig. 1), yet neither the Arg nor the Asp are found inChlorella virus RNA triphosphatase cvRtp1. cvRtp1 has an asparagine in lieu of the Arg321 side chain and a glycine instead of the Asp (Fig. 1). We surmise that: (i) there is tight co-evolution of both members of the ion pair, and (ii) theChlorella virus enzyme, which is the smallest member of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatase family (193-amino acids), has developed alternative strategies to stabilize an active conformation.The Arg321-Asp425 ion pair is part of a wider local network of interactions within the pedestal (Fig. 7). These include hydrogen bonds between Arg321(Nζ) and the main chain carbonyl oxygens of Ser419 and Asp422, which are located in the loop that connects strands β7 and β8. Also, Asp425(Oδ) engages in a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Ser419. We infer that the salt bridge and associated backbone contacts stabilize the inferior portions of the β7 and β8 strands and the intervening loop as they project down from the wall of the triphosphatase tunnel deep into the pedestal.The crystal structure provides no immediate explanation for the cold-sensitive folding defects elicited by mutations of Ser429 to Ala and Val and the partial defect of the S429T mutant. Ser429 projects upward from the tunnel floor into the tunnel cavity, yet it makes no direct contact with other amino acids in the crystal. Ser429(Oγ) is pointing toward Nζ of Lys309 (a nonessential side chain), but the interatomic distance of 3.9 Å is too long for a standard hydrogen bond. It is conceivable that the distance to Lys309 is closer in solution. Ser429 might also make water-mediated contacts, either with other amino acids or with the 5′-triphosphate substrate, that are not apparent from the crystal structure of the product complex and that assist in the folding of the protein when it is synthesized at low temperatures in vivo. Ser429 is conserved in all of the other metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases except cvRtp1, which has an alanine instead (Fig. 1). The unique fold of Cet1 and the complex, delicate architecture of its active site provide the impetus for a comprehensive mutational analysis of both the catalytic mechanism and the interactions that stabilize the fold. Here we have probed the function of 17 individual side chains by alanine scanning. The mutated residues were either located in the triphosphate tunnel (Ser373, Thr375, Gln405, His411, Ser429, Glu488, Thr490), on the tunnel's outer surface (Ser378, Ser487, Thr489, His491), at the tunnel-pedestal interface (Ile304, Met308), or in the pedestal itself (Asp315, Lys317, Arg321, Asp425). Alanine mutations at 14/17 positions had no significant effect on Cet1 phosphohydrolase activity in vitro and had no effect on Cet1 function in vivo. These negative results are instructive when taken together with prior mutational analyses and the crystal structure of Cet1. We have now mutated all of the hydrophilic amino acids that project into the triphosphate tunnel. Three of the six tunnel residues found here to be nonessential for Cet1 function (Ser373 and Thr375 in β5 and Glu488 in β11) make no contacts in the crystal structure with the metal cofactor, the γ-phosphate, or other amino acid side chains in the tunnel. Thus, it is sensible that these three residues are unimportant for Cet1 function; indeed they are not conserved in other family members (Fig.1). However, the four other tunnel residues analyzed presently do participate in the elaborate network of side chain interactions in the tunnel cavity (Fig. 2). Gln405(Oε) engages in a hydrogen bond with Arg393(Nζ). Arg393 is an essential catalytic residue (14Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that makes a bidentate interaction with the γ-phosphate (Fig. 2). The hydrogen bond with Gln405 is apparently not required to correctly orient Arg393 for catalysis by Cet1, which is consistent with the lack of conservation of the Gln405 position in other family members (Fig. 1). His411(Nδ) forms a hydrogen bond with Asn431(Oδ), while Asn431(Nδ) interacts Glu305(Oε) and Glu307(Oε) (Fig. 2). Glu305 and Glu307 directly coordinate the metal and are essential for catalysis (3Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Asn431 is not important for Cet1 function in vivo or in vitro (14Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); thus it is sensible that His411, which contacts only Asn431, is also nonessential. Thr490(Oγ) forms a hydrogen bond to Glu492(Oε). Glu492 is an essential side chain that forms a salt bridge with Arg454 in β9 (Fig. 2). Arg454 is itself essential for Cet1 function, and it has been suggested that Arg454 contacts the α- or β-phosphate of the substrate (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Bisaillon M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Apparently, the contact of Thr490 with Glu492 is not required for the essential interaction of Glu492 with Arg454. Ser378 in β5 and Ser487, Thr489, and His491 in β11 are located on the outer solvent-exposed surface of the tunnel and are noncontributory to Cet1 function. Ser378, Ser487, and His491 make no contacts with other residues in the crystal structure (Fig. 3). Thr489(Oγ) engages in a hydrogen bond with Glu476(Oε), but this interaction is apparently not important. Studies performed prior to solving the Cet1 structure showed that hydrophobic residues Leu306, Phe310, Val493, and Leu495 play important roles in Cet1 function and stability (4Pei Y. Ho C.K.

It is now apparent from the crystal structure that these side chains are part of a rich network of hydrophobic interactions between residues on the “back” sides of the β strands of the tunnel floor (Fig. 2) and amino acids in the globular pedestal that supports the tunnel.

Val493 interacts with Ile343 and Leu351 in addition to its contact to Phe310. Leu306(β1), which is also important for triphosphatase activity and thermal stability (4Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28865-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), interacts with Val289. Here we found that two other hydrophobic residues in β1, Ile304 and Met308, that comprise part of the tunnel-pedestal interface, are not important for Cet1 stabilityin vivo or activity in vitro. Ile304projects into the hydrophobic core of the pedestal and makes van der Waals interactions with Ile296, Leu430, and Leu423. Met308 interacts with Val426 and Phe523.
