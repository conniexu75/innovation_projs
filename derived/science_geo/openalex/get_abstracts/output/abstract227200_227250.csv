https://openalex.org/W2061311574,"BRAUNSTEIN'S1 demonstration of the transaminase reaction as a mode of formation of ammo-acids has been broadened recently to include a wide variety of transaminases in bacteria2, animal tissues3 and plants4. In the present communication, we wish to report the formation of compounds other than amino-acids by the transaminase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2068312873,"THE anaphylactoid reaction caused by dextran in rats has recently been studied by several investigators1–3. We have found that after intradermal injections of dextran dissolved in physiological saline (in rats), Menkin's intravenous dye test4 shows a seepage of dye into the wheals when the concentration of commercial dextran (Macrodex, Pharmacia Inc.) is at least 10 µgm/ml. Moreover, it has been found that dextran preparations with highly branched molecular chains are more toxic than those with relatively unbranched chains. Dextran fractions of an average molecular weight of 10,000 cause a positive dye test only in concentrations of about 10 mgm./ml. Sulphuric acid esters of dextran5 do not cause increased capillary permeability. We have confirmed the previously reported increase in hæmatocrit values after intravenous injection of dextran3, and found that it is more or less completely prevented by antihistaminics, local anæsthetics and pretreatment with cortisone in high doses. The most potent inhibitor, however, is alloxan intravenously in a subdiabetogenic dose. 2,3-Dimercaptopropanol injected 30 min. before dextran has an inhibitory effect only in some experimental series. The factors causing these variations in the ‘antiphlogistic’ effect of BAL are under study."

https://openalex.org/W2007557236,"HUMAN and animal sera exist which agglutinate red blood cells of group O and A2 more strongly than those of other groups ; these have been known for many years as anti-O sera. In 1948 Morgan and Watkins1 divided such sera into two kinds: those which could be inhibited by saliva from secretors of all A1 A2 B O groups, anti-H, and those which could not be inhibited, anti-O. Both types are found in human serum."
https://openalex.org/W1995707418,"WHEN young cultures of wet tubercle bacilli are mildly extracted with petroleum ether, a small quantity of a lipid material (‘cord factor’) is obtained1. The most characteristic biological property of this material is a delayed type of toxicity. Mice injected at three- to four-day intervals with 0.1 mgm. of the crude extract die after ten to fourteen days, severely emaciated and with hæorrhages of the lungs. The crude material gives negative reactions for phosphorus2 (sensitivity < 0.1 per cent phosphorus) and for nitrogen3 (sensitivity < 0.4 per cent nitrogen)."

https://openalex.org/W2073040324,"FERRITIN has been isolated in the crystalline state from various organs of man, horse, pig, jackal, rat, mouse and guinea pig. On the other hand, the characteristic crystals have not been obtained from the tissues of the ox, sheep, deer and chicken. In the liver and spleen of the latter animals there is present some non-hæmin iron and some ferric iron bound to a protein component ; but no crystals of ferritin are obtained with cadmium sulphate. Data on the distribution of this protein on the zoological scale are not complete ; since it has an important function in the metabolism of iron, knowledge of its presence in other organisms would be very valuable."

https://openalex.org/W2080249695,"THE separation of the albumin, , , β− and γ-globulin fractions of serum protein can be accomplished by electrophoresis on filter paper1–3. The protein fractions are delineated as bands by drying the paper, and then staining with bromphenol blue. Cremer and Tiselius2 estimated the fractions by elution of 5-mm. strips of the filter paper, the concentration of the dye from each strip being determined colorimetrically. A curve is thus obtained, similar to that from the classical Tiselius electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W2049393390,"IT has been shown by Watson, Cameron and Witts1 that macrocytic anæmia develops in rats in which a blind self-filling intestinal pouch has previously been formed. They were unable2, however, to demonstrate any anatomical or histological lesion in the alimentary tract. Toon3 found that treatment with aureomycin prevented the appearance of anæmia in 100 per cent of rats, adding weight to Witt's suggestion that the anæmia might be due in some way to the bacterial content of the pouch. Nevertheless, Aitken, Badenoch and Spray4 found a deficiency in fat absorption in rats so operated, whether or not anæmia had developed."

https://openalex.org/W1964264485,"IT has already been observed1 that nitrites caused the production of virus in the body of the silkworm. It is thus to be expected that changes of cellular structure in the worm may be provoked by nitrites. For the purpose of confirming this assumption, I have now conducted several experiments and prepared a large number of specimens."

https://openalex.org/W2013046469,THE importance of the adrenal cortex in the regulation of the blood pressure has recently been emphasized by several authors. The effect of prolonged treatment with high doses of cortisone on the rat's blood pressure was therefore investigated.
https://openalex.org/W2025830298,"THE experimental results reported recently by Prof. C. H. Waddington1 seem to make explicit in an important way what some zoologists, not professional geneticists, may have felt for long as something unsatisfying in many of the translations of evolutionary problems into Mendelian terms with which we are all familiar. He has reminded us once more that artificial selection, and so by presumption natural selection, acts upon animals having qualities, such as crossveinlessness, and not upon genes. He has shown that there are more genetic ways than one of being a crossveinless fruit-fly, and that, if crossveinlessness is selected for, then crossveinlessness will become established in a relation to the underlying genetic structure about which it is not clear that anything can in principle be predicted."

https://openalex.org/W2054589566,THE apparatus devised by Dr. G. Protti for the kinetic study of cellular metabolism with radioactive isotopes1 lends itself to permeability studies of yeast. We are using it to study their permeability to different metals.
https://openalex.org/W2066977189,"IN studies on the production of antibodies to bacterial amino-acid decarboxylases, we have used lysine decarboxylase from a coliform organism as an antigen. This material was partially purified by a modification of the method of Gale and Epps1 in order to reduce its toxicity for animals. The antigen, containing approximately 1.5 mgm. protein/ml., was injected intravenously into rabbits over a period of a month, at the rate of three injections a week. The dosage was gradually increased from 0.2 ml. to 1 ml. The rabbits were bled ten days after the final injection."
