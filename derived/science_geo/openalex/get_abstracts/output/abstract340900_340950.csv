https://openalex.org/W2082983316,"The agricultural use of synthetic insecticides usually protects crops but imposes strong selection pressures that can result in the development of resistance. The most important resistance mechanisms are enhancement of the capacity to metabolically detoxify insecticides and alterations in target sites that prevent insecticides from binding to them. Insect control methods must incorporate strategies to minimize resistance development and preserve the utility of the insecticides. The most promising approach, integrated pest management, includes the use of chemical insecticides in combination with improved cultural and biologically based techniques."

This record reflects climatic changes over the last 140,000 years in northeastern France. The cold period initiating the Middle Weichselian, dated previously at 55,000 years, is dated at 70,000 years before the present (B.P.) at Grande Pile. This event is marked by the disappearance of deciduous forests at this site. The Early Weichselian is placed before 70,000 years B.P. A correlation with the oxygen isotope stages from oceanic records is demonstrated until 70,000 years B.P. and attempted beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2085825896,"Brome mosaic virus (BMV) is a plant virus whose genome consists of three RNA components. A previously described viral complementary DNA expression system has been used to express both wild-type and altered genomic RNA's in barley protoplasts. Variants of BMV RNA3 were constructed in which the coat gene had been removed or replaced with sequences encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). CAT sequences were also inserted near the 5' end of the intact coat gene. When inoculated on protoplasts together with transcripts of BMV RNA's 1 and 2, all of these RNA3 derivatives were replicated and produced subgenomic RNA's analogous to the normal subgenomic coat protein messenger RNA. RNA3 derivatives in which the CAT coding sequences were oriented with the same polarity as viral genes produced significant CAT activity in protoplasts. CAT expression was improved by inserting the CAT gene in frame with the upstream coat protein initiation codon, and exceeded expression in plant cells transformed with Ti plasmid-based vectors."

Specific recognition of a protein by antibodies to P-450E in an immunoblot assay further indicated xenobiotic-induced cytochrome P-450 in these animals. Levels of apparently induced cytochrome P-450 and monooxygenase activity correlated positively with the tissue content of chlorobiphenyls of known inducing activity, implicating such compounds in biochemical effects occurring in the deep ocean."

C-banding techniques confirm that the two chromosomes of workers are homologous. Males are haploid, as in other Hymenoptera, and their somatic cells contain only a single chromosome. This new species is potentially of great importance in both laboratory and field studies on gene organization."
https://openalex.org/W2002949081,"Catalytic coal gasification is being developed as a more efficient and less costly approach to producing methane from coal. With a potassium catalyst all the reactions can take place at one temperature, so that endothermic and exothermic reactions can be integrated in a single reactor. A key aspect of the concept involves continuous recycling of product carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the gasifier following separation of methane. Development of the process has advanced steadily since the basic concept was proposed in 1971. A 23-day demonstration run was recently completed in a process development unit with a coal feed rate of 1 ton per day. The next major step in the program will be to design and construct a large pilot plant to bring the technology to commercial readiness in the late 1980's."

In the process of forming the new eddy, the subsurface isothermal-isohaline ""signature"" layer of one eddy was uplifted and somewhat depleted while that of the other was depressed."
https://openalex.org/W2057488650,"Living organisms are used as biological pest control agents in (i) classical biological control, primarily for permanent control of introduced perennial weed pests or introduced pests of perennial crops; (ii) augmentative biological control, for temporary control of native or introduced pests of annual crops grown in monoculture; and (iii) conservative or natural control, in which the agroecosystem is managed to maximize the effect of native or introduced biological control agents. The effectiveness of biological control can be improved if it is based on adequate ecological information and theory, and if it is integrated with other pest management practices."
https://openalex.org/W2123945816,"Modern microbial mats and stromatolites exhibiting a preferred orientation toward specular sunlight were found at two sites. In Hamelin Pool of Shark Bay, Western Australia, subtidal decimeter-sized columns and intertidal centimeter-sized tufts were found pointing north. In thermal spring effluents and pools of Yellowstone National Park, mats were found with columnar and conical centimeter-sized structures inclined to the south. These examples of heliotropism in modern stromatolites are each built by a different community of photosynthetic microbes under markedly different environmental conditions. These new observations support the proposal that stromatolites can orient themselves toward the sun."

A new technique is used to measure this interaction when one of the bodies has colloidal dimensions. The potential energy profile of interactions between a 15-micrometer polystyrene sphere and a glass plate is determined by observing the distribution of separation distances (0.2 to 0.4 micrometer) that the particle samples by Brownian motion. Measurements of the speed with which the sphere is carried by linear shear flow along the wall are used to calculate separation distance. Although evidence for hydrodynamic lift is found, it is not included in the potential profile."

Carey, Executive Officer and Publisher of Science, criticized statements by the Department of Defense concerning scientific exchanges, conferences, and the unclassified, open scientific literature. Mr. Carey's letter and the reply he received from Mr. Carlucci are printed here verbatim."

A reinterpretation suggests that it may have instead been a Neptune arc similar to one observed in 1984. The 1981 object, however, did not occult the star during simultaneous observations at Flagstaff, Arizona. This result constrains possible arc geometries."

https://openalex.org/W2047073523,"On the basis of ribosomal morphology, it has been proposed that the sulfur-metabolizing archaebacteria constitute a group (the eocytes) with a phylogenetic importance equal to that of the eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes. It has been further proposed that eocytes should be given kingdom status. Ribosomal subunits from the methanogenic archaebacterium Methanococcus vannielii were examined by electron microscopy, and their structures were compared to those of other archaebacterial, eubacterial, and eukaryotic ribosomes. 30S subunits from M. vannielii showed the elongated contour and the one-third to two-thirds partition characteristic of such subunits. In addition, the angled asymmetric projections of those subunits showed a squarish base and a beak on the head. 50S subunits from M. vannielii were seen in both crown and kidney views. In crown views, the L1 protuberance was frequently pronounced and split; an incision below this protuberance and a protrusion at the base of the particle were also observed. Although previous studies suggested that certain of these structural features were found exclusively in ribosomes from sulfur-metabolizing archaebacteria, these new results indicate that such features also occur in ribosomes from a typical methanogenic archaebacterium and thus may not be reliable phylogenetic markers."

This report presents the results of the radar mapping of the Maxwell Montes region, one of the most interesting features of Venus' surface. A radar mosaic map and contour map have been compiled."
https://openalex.org/W1991938166,"Some exploding stars (supernovae) are powerful emitters of centimeter radio radiation. Detailed observations have shown that these supernovae quickly become detectable in the radio range, first at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) and later at progressively longer and longer wavelengths (lower frequencies). This part of the phenomenon appears to be well explained by a monotonic decrease in the amount of ionized material surrounding the radio-emitting regions as the shock from the explosion travels outward. The radio emission itself is of a nonthermal, synchrotron origin, as is the case in most bright cosmic radio sources. Once the absorption effects become negligible, the radio intensity declines with time until reaching the detection limit of the telescope. Models suggest that the absorbing material originates in a dense wind of matter lost by the supernova progenitor star, or by its companion if it is in a binary system, in the last stages of evolution before the explosion. The synchrotron radio emission can be generated either externally by the shock wave from the explosion propagating through this same high density stellar wind or internally by a rapidly rotating neutron star, which is the collapsed core of the exploded star. Present results appear to favor the former model for at least the first several years after the supernova explosion, although the latter model remains viable."

https://openalex.org/W2020647875,"Atmospheric scientists are emphasizing the role of trace gases as important factors in a future substantial global increase in temperature. They estimate that, in 1980, trace gases contributed more than half as much to a greenhouse effect as did increased carbon dioxide. From 1880 to 1980, CO/sub 2/ increased from about 275 parts per million (ppm) to 339 ppm. The principal relevant trace gases in 1980 were Ch/sub 4/, 1.6 ppm; N/sub 2/O, 0.3 ppm; CCl/sub 2/F/sub 2/, 0.00028 ppm. CCl/sub 3/F, 0.00018 ppm, and O/sub 3/, which increased in the troposphere substantially over earlier values. Methane (CH/sub 4/) is at present the most effective greenhouse trace gas. Its concentration has been increasing about 1% per year since 1950. The total content in the atmosphere is about 5000 million tons. Methane is destroyed slowly, mainly in the trophosphere, by the reactive OH. Residence time for CH/sub 4/ is 5 to 10 years. This implies an annual addition of at least 500 million tons to hold the level constant. Growth of 1% per year requires an extra addition on the order of 50 million tons. Principal sources of CH/sub 4/ appear to be ruminant animals, organic-rich sediments, and rice paddies. Amore » complicating factor in estimating trends in CH/sub 4/ distribution is the competition of CO for OH. Emissions of CO have been increasing, and they destroy OH that otherwise might react with CH/sub 4/.« less"

https://openalex.org/W154596852,"A proposal to reduce DOE's advanced civilian reactor research and expand military work worries nuclear industry. The Reagan Administration has emphasized high-risk, long term research over applied research and demonstrations on the grounds that industry should be responsible for technology development. The proposed fiscal year 1987 budget for civilian reactor research is $222.5 million, a deep cut below this year's budget of $319.7 million. Funding for advanced reactor research and development alone shows a 61.5% reduction to $49.5 million. With this grim budget outlook, funding restorations may have to be gotten from other nuclear research programs."

https://openalex.org/W2017200603,"Western governments have been criticized by the Paris-based International Energy Agency for not spending enough money on research into ways of reducing the environmental damage caused by burning coal to produce electricity. In the report on the energy research policies of its 20 member-countries - which include all the major Western industrialized nations apart from France - the agency says that there is still a substantial disparity between the declared policy of many governments of giving greatly increased emphasis to environmentally acceptable ways of using coal, and the modest sums devoted nationally to developing the appropriate technology. In particular, it points out that research into the use of coal to produce energy receives about the same amount of money as research into renewable energy sources - in each case, about 9% of the overall energy research budget of the IEA countries - despite the great difference in the present and short- to medium-term future contributions from these two broad energy options. ''Continuation of this situation is bound to erode the credibility of the recent re-endorsement by (IEA) Energy Ministers of a more vigorous drive towards the clean use of coal,'' the report says."
