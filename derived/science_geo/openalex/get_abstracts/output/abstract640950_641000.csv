https://openalex.org/W2979960321,"Endometriosis has a significant cost of illness burden in Europe, UK and the USA, with the majority of costs coming from reductions in productivity. However, information is scarce on if there is a differing impact between endometriosis and other causes of chronic pelvic pain, and if there are modifiable factors, such as pain severity, that may be significant contributors to the overall burden.An online survey was hosted by SurveyMonkey and the link was active between February to April 2017. Women aged 18-45, currently living in Australia, who had either a confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis via laparoscopy or chronic pelvic pain without a diagnosis of endometriosis were included. The retrospective component of the WERF EndoCost tool was used to determine direct healthcare costs, direct non-healthcare costs (carers) and indirect costs due to productivity loss. Estimates were extrapolated to the Australian population using published prevalence estimates.407 valid responses were received. The cost of illness burden was significant in women with chronic pelvic pain (Int $16,970 to $ 20,898 per woman per year) irrespective of whether they had a diagnosis of endometriosis. The majority of costs (75-84%) were due to productivity loss. Both absolute and relative productivity costs in Australia were higher than previous estimates based on data from Europe, UK and USA. Pain scores showed the strongest relationship to productivity costs, a 12.5-fold increase in costs between minimal to severe pain. The total economic burden per year in Australia in the reproductive aged population (at 10% prevalence) was 6.50 billion Int $.Similar to studies in European, British and American populations, productivity costs are the greatest contributor to overall costs. Given pain is the most significant contributor, priority should be given to improving pain control in women with pelvic pain."

In this study, 10 CsSOD genes were identified in tea plant genome, including 7 Cu/Zn-SODs (CSDs), 2 Fe-SODs (FSDs) and one Mn-SOD (MSD), and phylogenetically classified in three subgroups, respectively. Physico-chemical characteristic, conserved motifs and potential protein interaction analyses about CsSOD proteins were carried out. Exon-intron structures and codon usage bias about CsSOD genes were also examined. Exon-intron structures analysis revealed that different CsSOD genes contained various number of introns. On the basis of the prediction of regulatory miRNAs of CsSODs, a modification 5’ RNA ligase-mediated (RLM)-RACE was performed and validated that csn-miR398a-3p-1 directly cleaves CsCSD4. By prediction of cis-acting elements, the expression patterns of 10 CsSOD genes and their regulatory miRNAs were detected under cold, drought, exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and gibberellin (GA3) treatments. The results showed that most of CsSODs except for CsFSD2 were induced under cold stress and CsCSDs may play primary roles under drought stress; exogenous GA3 and MeJA could also stimulated/inhibited distinct CsSODs at different stages. In addition, we found that csn-miR398a-3p-1 negatively regulated the expression of CsCSD4 may be a crucial regulatory mechanism under cold stress. This study provides a certain basis for the studies about stress resistance in tea plants, even provide insight into comprehending the classification, evolution, diverse functions and influencing factors of expression patterns for CsSOD genes."

Subsequently, the detected antibiotics were identified as azithromycin and tetracycline, by high-performance liquid chromatography, further both the antibiotics detected in the cow milk samples were found to be at high concentration (9708.7 and 5460 μg kg-1, respectively). We then investigated the effects of temperature and pH on the stabilities of azithromycin and tetracycline to determine the degradation rate constant k using first-order kinetic equation. Results indicated that significant reduction in stability and antibacterial activity of azithromycin solution when subjected to 70 and 100°C for 24 h. While stability of tetracycline was significantly reduced when subjected to 70 and 100°C for 24 h. However no significant reduction in antibacterial activity of tetracycline was observed at respective temperatures when compared with that of control. In addition, the stabilities of azithromycin and tetracycline were found to be decreased in acidic pH 4-5. The results of the present study revealed the high risk of contamination of milk sample with veterinary antibiotics and also demonstrated the effect of temperature and pH on stability of antibiotics. Therefore the study suggest that the qualitative and quantitative screening of milk for the presence of antibiotics need to be strictly performed to ensure safe drinking milk for consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2980074063,"'Huangguogan' (Citrus reticulata × C. sinensis) is a new cultivar of mandarin citrus in China, and the research on fertilization of 'Huangguogan' is very limited. In this study, the effect of N fertilization on 'Huangguogan' fruit quality was determined at ripening. Sugars (sucrose, fructose, and glucose), organic acids (pyruvic, oxalic, citric acid, etc.), and vitamin components were measured at six stages of fruit development, and eight enzymes related to the glycolytic and Krebs cycle were assessed. The 1.81 kg N y-1 treatment group showed the highest total soluble solids concentration and total soluble solids/titratable acidity ratio but the lowest titratable acidity (acid content) at ripening, while the N1 treatment (0 kg N y-1) showed the opposite trend. Sucrose and citric acid accumulated to the largest extent during fruit development. Sucrose and ascorbic acid content increased (8.46 to 50.97 mg g-1 and 8.16 to 27.39 mg g-1, respectively), while citric acid content decreased (90.81 to 0.02 mg g-1). Aconitase was the key enzyme responsible for the observed changes in citric acid. The N concentrations in ripening fruit ranged from 2.25% to 4.15%. Curve estimation and principal component analysis revealed that fruit N was positively correlated with the sugars and vitamin components and negatively correlated with the organic acids. The accumulation of these metabolites seemed closely related to the dynamic changes in fruit N concentration at the five N levels tested. In conclusion, we suggest that the 1.81 kg N y-1 treatment represents the most suitable N fertilizer treatment for 'Huangguogan' citrus fruit."
https://openalex.org/W2980245048,"Background Previous studies have assessed the incremental economic burden of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) versus non-treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (i.e., non-TRD MDD) in commercially-insured and Medicaid-insured patients, but none have focused on Medicare-insured patients. Objective To assess healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs of patients with TRD versus non-TRD MDD or without major depressive disorder (MDD; i.e., non-MDD) in a Medicare-insured population. Methods Adult patients were retrospectively identified from the Chronic Condition Warehouse de-identified 100% Medicare database (01/2010-12/2016). MDD was defined as ≥1 MDD diagnosis and ≥1 claim for an antidepressant. Patients initiated on a third antidepressant following two antidepressant treatment regimens of adequate dose and duration were considered to have TRD. The index date was defined as the date of the first antidepressant claim for the TRD and non-TRD MDD cohorts, and as a randomly imputed date for the non-MDD cohort. Patients with TRD were matched 1:1 to non-TRD MDD patients and randomly selected non-MDD patients based on propensity scores. Analyses were also performed for a subset of patients aged ≥65. Results Of 29,543 patients with MDD, 3,225 (10.9%) met the study definition of TRD; 157,611 were included in the non-MDD cohort. Matched patients with TRD and non-TRD MDD were, on average, 58.9 and 59.0 years old, respectively. The TRD cohort had higher per-patient-per-year (PPPY) HRU than the non-TRD MDD (e.g., inpatient visits: incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.36) and non-MDD cohorts (e.g., inpatient visits: IRR = 1.84, all P<0.001). The TRD cohort had significantly higher total PPPY healthcare costs than the non-TRD MDD cohort ($25,517 vs. $20,425, adjusted cost difference = $3,385) and non-MDD cohort ($25,517 vs. $14,542, adjusted cost difference = $4,015, all P<0.001). Similar results were found for the subset of patients ≥65. Conclusion Among Medicare-insured patients, those with TRD had higher HRU and costs compared to those with non-TRD MDD and non-MDD."
https://openalex.org/W2979850911,"We study the relationship between the performance of firms and their technological portfolios using tools borrowed from complexity science. In particular, we ask whether the accumulation of knowledge and capabilities associated with a coherent set of technologies leads firms to experience advantages in terms of productive efficiency. To this end, we analyze both the balance sheets and the patenting activity of about 70 thousand firms that have filed at least one patent over the period 2004-2013. We define a measure of corporate coherent diversification, based on the bipartite network linking companies with the technological fields in which they patent, and relate it to firm performance in terms of labor productivity. Our measure favors technological portfolios that can be decomposed into large blocks of closely related fields over portfolios with the same breadth of scope, but a more scattered diversification structure. We find that the coherent diversification of firms is quantitatively related with their economic performance and captures relevant information about their productive structure. In particular, we prove on a statistical basis that a naive definition of technological diversification can explain labor productivity only as a proxy of size and coherent diversification. This approach can be used to investigate possible synergies within firms and to recommend viable partners for mergers and acquisitions."
https://openalex.org/W2979912804,"Honey bees, Apis mellifera, are a globally significant pollinator species and are currently in decline, with losses attributed to an array of interacting environmental stressors. Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) are a lesser-known abiotic environmental factor that are emitted from a variety of anthropogenic sources, including power lines, and have recently been shown to have a significant impact on the cognitive abilities and behaviour of honey bees. Here we have investigated the effects of field-realistic levels of ELF EMFs on aversive learning and aggression levels, which are critical factors for bees to maintain colony strength. Bees were exposed for 17 h to 100 μT or 1000 μT ELF EMFs, or a sham control. A sting extension response (SER) assay was conducted to determine the effects of ELF EMFs on aversive learning, while an intruder assay was conducted to determine the effects of ELF EMFs on aggression levels. Exposure to both 100 μT and 1000 μT ELF EMF reduced aversive learning performance by over 20%. Exposure to 100 μT ELF EMFs also increased aggression scores by 60%, in response to intruder bees from foreign hives. These results indicate that short-term exposure to ELF EMFs, at levels that could be encountered in bee hives placed under power lines, reduced aversive learning and increased aggression levels. These behavioural changes could have wider ecological implications in terms of the ability of bees to interact with, and respond appropriately to, threats and negative environmental stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2980114306,"Peripheral Blood gene expression is widely used in the discovery of biomarkers and development of therapeutics. Recently, a spate of commercial blood collection and preservation systems have been introduced with proprietary variations that may differentially impact the transcriptomic profiles. Comparative analysis of these collection platforms will help optimize protocols to detect, identify, and reproducibly validate true biological variance among subjects. In the current study, we tested two recently introduced whole blood collection methods, RNAgard® and PAXgene® RNA, in addition to the traditional method of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) separated from whole blood and preserved in Trizol reagent. Study results revealed striking differences in the transcriptomic profiles from the three different methods that imply ex vivo changes in gene expression occurred during the blood collection, preservation, and mRNA extraction processes. When comparing the ability of the three preservation methods to accurately capture individuals' expression differences, RNAgard® outperformed PAXgene® RNA, and both showed better individual separation of transcriptomic profiles than PBMCs. Hence, our study recommends using a single blood collection platform, and strongly cautions against combining methods during the course of a defined study."
https://openalex.org/W2980219860,"There is growing awareness within the scientific community of the strong connection between the inflammation in the intestine and the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In previous studies we developed a PD animal model exposing pup rats to permethrin (PERM) pesticide. Here, we intended to explore whether in our animal model there were changes in gut permeability, fecal microbiota and hepatic injury. Moreover, we tested if the co-treatment with an electrolyzed reduced (ERW) was effective to protect against alterations induced by PERM. Rats (from postnatal day 6 to 21) were gavaged daily with PERM, PERM+ERW or vehicle and gut, liver and feces were analyzed in 2-months-old rats. Increased gut permeability, measured by FITC-dextran assay, was detected in PERM group compared to control and PERM+ERW groups. In duodenum and ileum, concentration of occludin was higher in control group than those measured in PERM group, whereas only in duodenum ZO-1 was higher in control than those measured in PERM and PERM+ERW groups. Number of inflammatory focis and neutrophils as well as iNOS protein levels were higher in livers of PERM-treated rats than in those of PERM+ERW and control rats. Fecal microbiota analysis revealed that Lachnospira was less abundant and Defluviitaleaceae more abundant in the PERM group, whereas the co-treatment with ERW was protective against PERM treatment since the abundances in Lachnospira and Defluviitaleaceae were similar to those in the control group. Higher abundances of butyrate- producing bacteria such as Blautia, U.m. of Lachnospiraceae family, U.m. of Ruminococcaceae family, Papillibacter, Roseburia, Intestinimonas, Shuttleworthia together with higher butyric acid levels were detected in PERM+ERW group compared to the other groups. In conclusion, the PD animal model showed increased intestinal permeability together with hepatic inflammation correlated with altered gut microbiota. The positive effects of ERW co-treatment observed in gut, liver and brain of rats were linked to changes on gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2980226541,"A detailed characterization of the chemical composition of complex substances, such as products of petroleum refining and environmental mixtures, is greatly needed in exposure assessment and manufacturing. The inherent complexity and variability in the composition of complex substances obfuscate the choices for their detailed analytical characterization. Yet, in lieu of exact chemical composition of complex substances, evaluation of the degree of similarity is a sensible path toward decision-making in environmental health regulations. Grouping of similar complex substances is a challenge that can be addressed via advanced analytical methods and streamlined data analysis and visualization techniques. Here, we propose a framework with unsupervised and supervised analyses to optimally group complex substances based on their analytical features. We test two data sets of complex oil-derived substances. The first data set is from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of 20 Standard Reference Materials representing crude oils and oil refining products. The second data set consists of 15 samples of various gas oils analyzed using three analytical techniques: GC-MS, GC×GC-flame ionization detection (FID), and ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IM-MS). We use hierarchical clustering using Pearson correlation as a similarity metric for the unsupervised analysis and build classification models using the Random Forest algorithm for the supervised analysis. We present a quantitative comparative assessment of clustering results via Fowlkes–Mallows index, and classification results via model accuracies in predicting the group of an unknown complex substance. We demonstrate the effect of (i) different grouping methodologies, (ii) data set size, and (iii) dimensionality reduction on the grouping quality, and (iv) different analytical techniques on the characterization of the complex substances. While the complexity and variability in chemical composition are an inherent feature of complex substances, we demonstrate how the choices of the data analysis and visualization methods can impact the communication of their characteristics to delineate sufficient similarity."
https://openalex.org/W2979956323,"MitraClip is the sole percutaneous device approved for functional mitral regurgitation (MR; FMR) but MR recurs in over one third of patients. As device-induced mechanical effects are a potential cause for MR recurrence, we tested the hypothesis that MitraClip increases leaflet stress and procedure-related strain in sub-valvular left ventricular (LV) myocardium in FMR associated with coronary disease (FMR-CAD).Simulations were performed using finite element models of the LV + mitral valve based on MRI of 5 sheep with FMR-CAD. Models were modified to have a 20% increase in LV volume (↑LV_VOLUME) and MitraClip was simulated with contracting beam elements (virtual sutures) placed between nodes in the center edge of the anterior (AL) and posterior (PL) mitral leaflets. Effects of MitraClip on leaflet stress in the peri-MitraClip region of AL and PL, septo-lateral annular diameter (SLAD), and procedure-related radial strain (Err) in the sub-valvular myocardium were calculated.MitraClip increased peri-MitraClip leaflet stress at end-diastole (ED) by 22.3±7.1 kPa (p<0.0001) in AL and 14.8±1.2 kPa (p<0.0001) in PL. MitraClip decreased SLAD by 6.1±2.2 mm (p<0.0001) and increased Err in the sub-valvular lateral LV myocardium at ED by 0.09±0.04 (p<0.0001)). Furthermore, MitraClip in ↑LV_VOLUME was associated with persistent effects at ED but also at end-systole where peri-MitraClip leaflet stress was increased in AL by 31.9±14.4 kPa (p = 0.0268) and in PL by 22.5±23.7 kPa (p = 0.0101).MitraClip for FMR-CAD increases mitral leaflet stress and radial strain in LV sub-valvular myocardium. Mechanical effects of MitraClip are augmented by LV enlargement."
https://openalex.org/W2979622358,"Background In patients with left heart failure, micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be of diagnostic and prognostic value. The present study aims to identify those miRNAs in patients with univentricular heart (UVH) disease that may be associated with overt heart failure. Methods A large panel of human miRNA arrays were used to determine miRNA expression profiles in the blood of 48 UVH patients and 32 healthy controls. For further selection, the most abundantly expressed miRNA arrays were related to clinical measures of heart failure and selected miRNAs validated by polymerase chain reaction were used for the prediction of overt heart failure and all-cause mortality. Results According to microarray analysis, 50 miRNAs were found to be significantly abundant in UVH patients of which miR-150-5p was best related to heart failure parameters. According to ROC analysis, NT-proBNP levels (AUC 0.940, 95% CI 0.873–1.000; p = 0.001), miR-150-5p (AUC 0.905, 95% CI 0.779–1.000; p = 0.001) and a higher NYHA class ≥ III (AUC 0.893, 95% CI 0.713–1.000; p = 0.002) were the 3 most significant predictors of overt heart failure. Using a combined biomarker model, AUC increased to 0.980 indicating an additive value of miR-150-5p. Moreover, in the multivariate analysis, a higher NYHA class ≥ III (p = 0.005) and miR-150-5p (p = 0.006) turned out to be independent predictors of overt heart failure. Conclusion In patients with UVH, miR-150-5p is an independent predictor of overt heart failure and thus may be used in the risk assessment of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2979738933,"Women's reproductive health decision-making is indispensable for improving their reproductive health and achieving Sustainable Development Goal three. This study explored the association between reproductive health decision-making capacity and unintended pregnancy among women in Ghana.We used data from the 2014 version of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. The unit of analysis for this study was pregnant women at the time of the survey (679). Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted using Pearson chi-square tests and binary logistic regression respectively.We found that women who had the capacity to make reproductive health decision [AOR = 0.61; CI = 0.51-0.89] were less likely to experience unintended pregnancies, compared to those who did not have the capacity. Age was found to have a statistically significant influence on unintended pregnancy, with women aged 25-29 years [AOR = 0.29; CI = 0.13-0.63], 30-34 years [AOR = 0.18; CI = 0.08-0.45], and 35-39 years [AOR = 0.26; CI = 0.10-0.68] being less likely to experience unintended pregnancy compared to those aged 15-19 years. Women with primary level of education were more likely to have unintended pregnancies, compared to those with no education [AOR = 2.07; CI = 1.12-3.84].This study has filled the gap in the already existing literature on the association between reproductive health decision making capacity and unintended pregnancy in Ghana and has created a room for specific interventions geared towards reducing unintended pregnancies, especially among women who are not capable of making reproductive health decisions, women aged 15-19 years, those with primary education, Traditionalists and unmarried women."
https://openalex.org/W2979940987,"In this research, climate classification maps over the Korean Peninsula at 1 km resolution were generated using the satellite-based climatic variables of monthly temperature and precipitation based on machine learning approaches. Random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM) were used to develop models. Training and validation of these models were conducted using in-situ observations from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) from 2001 to 2016. The rule of the traditional Köppen-Geiger (K-G) climate classification was used to classify climate regions. The input variables were land surface temperature (LST) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 product, and the Digital Elevation Map (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The overall accuracy (OA) based on validation data from 2001 to 2016 for all models was high over 95%. DEM and minimum winter temperature were two distinct variables over the study area with particularly high relative importance. ANN produced more realistic spatial distribution of the classified climates despite having a slightly lower OA than the others. The accuracy of the models using high altitudinal in-situ data of the Mountain Meteorology Observation System (MMOS) was also assessed. Although the data length of the MMOS data was relatively short (2013 to 2017), it proved that the snowy, dry and cold winter and cool summer class (Dwc) is widely located in the eastern coastal region of South Korea. Temporal shifting of climate was examined through a comparison of climate maps produced by period: from 1950 to 2000, from 1983 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2013. A shrinking trend of snow classes (D) over the Korean Peninsula was clearly observed from the ANN-based climate classification results. Shifting trends of climate with the decrease/increase of snow (D)/temperate (C) classes were clearly shown in the maps produced using the proposed approaches, consistent with the results from the reanalysis data of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC)."
https://openalex.org/W2980014847,"Vitamin B-12 deficiency is often considered synonymous with pernicious anemia, a rare condition in which severe malabsorption of the vitamin requires high-dose parenteral treatment. In developing countries such as India, inadequate dietary intake of B-12 due to socio-cultural factors leads to widely prevalent asymptomatic low B-12 status. In this scenario, lower doses of oral B-12 may be effective, safer and more affordable.To examine the effects of oral B-12 treatment at physiological doses on hematological and biochemical indices and peripheral nerve function in B-12 deficient rural Indian adolescent women.Thirty-nine women with B-12 deficiency who were excluded from a community based B-12 supplementation trial (Pune Rural Intervention in Young Adolescents (PRIYA)) received oral B-12 2μg/day, either alone (n = 19) or with multiple micronutrients (UNIMAPP formula + 20gm milk powder, n = 20) for 11 months. Hematological indices, nutrients (B-12, folate), metabolites (homocysteine) and peripheral nerve function (SUDOSCAN, Impetomedical, Paris and sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) of median and sural nerves) were assessed at baseline and after 11 months of B-12 treatment.Results were similar in the two treatment allocation groups, which were therefore combined. At baseline, all women had B-12 concentration <100pmol/L, 79% were anemic and 33% had macrocytosis, but none had neuropathy. After 11 months of treatment, B-12 levels increased, while folate did not change. The prevalence of anemia fell to 59% and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and plasma homocysteine concentrations decreased. Sudomotor nerve function in the feet improved by an average of 14.7%, and sensory conduction velocity in median and sural nerves increased by 16.2% and 29.4% respectively.We document clinically beneficial effects of supplementation with a physiological dose of oral B-12 in asymptomatic rural Indian adolescent women with very low B-12 status. These findings support a public health approach to tackle the widely prevalent low B-12 status in young Indians."

Their genome sizes (3.89, 4.04 and 4.04 Mb) were comparable to those of other Elizabethkingia species and strains, and exhibited open pan-genome characteristics, with two strains being nearly identical and the third divergent. These strains were susceptible only to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin amongst 16 antibiotics in minimum inhibitory tests. The resistome exhibited a high diversity of resistance genes, including 5 different lactamase- and 18 efflux protein- encoding genes. Forty-four genes encoding virulence factors were conserved among the strains. Sialic acid transporters and curli synthesis genes were well conserved in E. meningoseptica but absent in E. anophelis and E. miricola. E. meningoseptica carried several genes contributing to biofilm formation. 58 glycoside hydrolases (GH) and 25 putative polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) were found. The strains carried numerous genes encoding two-component system proteins (56), transcription factor proteins (187~191), and DNA-binding proteins (6~7).

https://openalex.org/W2979448042,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-related vessel relaxation is a highly coordinated process that regulates blood flow and pressure and is dependent on caveolae. Here, we investigated the role of caveolar plasma membrane stabilization by the dynamin-related ATPase EHD2 on eNOS-nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vessel relaxation. Loss of EHD2 in small arteries led to increased numbers of caveolae that were detached from the plasma membrane. Concomitantly, impaired relaxation of mesenteric arteries and reduced running wheel activity were observed in EHD2 knockout mice. EHD2 deletion or knockdown led to decreased production of nitric oxide (NO) although eNOS expression levels were not changed. Super-resolution imaging revealed that eNOS was redistributed from the plasma membrane to internalized detached caveolae in EHD2-lacking tissue or cells. Following an ATP stimulus, reduced cytosolic Ca2+ peaks were recorded in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) lacking EHD2. Our data suggest that EHD2-controlled caveolar dynamics orchestrates the activity and regulation of eNOS/NO and Ca2+ channel localization at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2979862733,"Chiropractic maintenance care is effective as secondary/tertiary prevention of non-specific low back pain (LBP), but the potential effect moderation by psychological characteristics is unknown. The objective was to investigate whether patients in specific psychological sub-groups had different responses to MC with regard to the total number of days with bothersome pain and the number of treatments.Data from a two-arm randomized pragmatic multicenter trial with a 12-month follow up, designed to investigate the effectiveness of maintenance care, was used. Consecutive patients, 18-65 years of age, with recurrent and persistent LBP seeking chiropractic care with a good effect of the initial treatment were included. Eligible subjects were randomized to either maintenance care (prescheduled care) or to the control intervention, symptom-guided care. The primary outcome of the trial was the total number of days with bothersome LBP collected weekly for 12 months using an automated SMS system. Data used to classify patients according to psychological subgroups defined by the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (adaptive copers, interpersonally distressed and dysfunctional) were collected at the screening visit.A total of 252 subjects were analyzed using a generalized estimating equations linear regression framework. Patients in the dysfunctional subgroup who received maintenance care reported fewer days with pain (-30.0; 95% CI: -36.6, -23.4) and equal number of treatments compared to the control intervention. In the adaptive coper subgroup, patients who received maintenance care reported more days with pain (10.7; 95% CI: 4.0, 17.5) and more treatments (3.9; 95% CI: 3.5, 4.2). Patients in the interpersonally distressed subgroup reported equal number of days with pain (-0.3; 95% CI: -8.7, 8.1) and more treatments (1.5; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.1) on maintenance care.Psychological and behavioral characteristics modify the effect of MC and should be considered when recommending long-term preventive management of patients with recurrent and persistent LBP."
https://openalex.org/W2979777688,"For early breast cancer detection, mammography is nowadays the commonly used standard imaging approach, offering a valuable clinical tool for visualization of suspicious findings like microcalcifications and tumors within the breast. However, due to the superposition of anatomical structures, the sensitivity of mammography screening is limited. Within the last couple of years, the implementation of contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) based on K-edge subtraction (KES) imaging helped to improve the identification and classification of uncertain findings. In this study, we introduce another approach for CESM based on a two-material decomposition, with which we expect fundamental improvements compared to the clinical procedure. We demonstrate the potential of our proposed method using the quasi-monochromatic radiation of a compact synchrotron source—the Munich Compact Light Source (MuCLS)—and a modified mammographic accreditation phantom. For direct comparison with the clinical CESM approach, we also performed a standard dual-energy KES at the MuCLS, which outperformed the clinical CESM images in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and spatial resolution. However, the dual-energy-based two-material decomposition approach achieved even higher CNR values. Our experimental results with quasi-monochromatic radiation show a significant improvement of the image quality at lower mean glandular dose (MGD) than the clinical CESM. At the same time, our study indicates the great potential for the material-decomposition instead of clinically used KES to improve the quantitative outcome of CESM."
https://openalex.org/W2980042533,"Pectus excavatum, thoracic spine deformities, tracheal hypoplasia and lateral heart displacement are frequently described in brachycephalic dog breeds. Pectus carinatum is described sporadically, although the authors' observations demonstrate that it may occur in certain brachycephalic dog breeds. It was hypothesised that dogs of screw-tailed brachycephalic breeds carry a greater risk of these anomalies than normal-tailed brachycephalic breeds, and that there could a relation between the presence of pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum and thoracic spine deformities, tracheal hypoplasia and lateral heart displacement. During retrospective studies, these anomalies were identified in lateral and dorso-ventral radiographs of the thorax in brachycephalic dog breeds. A statistical analysis revealed that the frequency of pectus excavatum occurrence in screw-tailed and normal-tailed brachycephalic dog breeds is similar. The greatest risk of pectus excavatum occurrence is carried by two breeds: Maltese (60%) and English Bulldog (58%), while for pectus carinatum: Pug (41%) and French Bulldog (18%). Dogs of screw-tailed brachycephalic breeds carry a greater risk of kyphosis (p < 0.0001), tracheal hypoplasia occurrence (p < 0.0001), compared to ""normal-tailed"" breeds. The hypothesis concerning a relation between the presence of pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum and the other anomalies studied was not confirmed (p > 0.05). It was demonstrated that in dogs of brachycephalic breeds there was a greater risk of co-incidence between kyphosis of the thoracic spine and lateral heart displacement (p = 0.038), as well as kyphosis of the thoracic spine and tracheal hypoplasia (p = 0.003)."
https://openalex.org/W2979670150,"The practice of early marriage, although acknowledged as a human rights violation, continues to occur in many countries. Different studies have identified the associated factors in many developing countries. However, these factors often assume no geographical variation in these factors within countries. Again, cultural practices and beliefs which strongly influence the acceptance and practices of early marriage vary geographically. In addition, geographic clusters of high rates of early marriage and union formation are also unknown. Thus, area specific correlates of early child marriage are required for the development of location specific policies to aid the eradication of early child marriage. Using data from the 2010 Ghana Population and Housing Census, this study examines the extent of geospatial clustering in early marriage amongst girls and their spatially-varying associated factors at the district level. The findings reveal strong clustering of high early marriage amongst districts in the Upper West, Northern and Volta regions. Nationally, 6.96% (CI = 6.83, 7.08) of girls are married or in union before their 18th birthday. The estimates range from 2.7% in the Jaman North district in Brong Ahafo region to 19.0% in the Gushiegu district in Northern region. Economic factors were observed as important spatially-varying associated factors. The findings suggest that targeted interventions are required in the effort to eradicate the practice in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2979644250,"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the human blood circulation has been under investigation since its initial observation in 1948. Plasma cfDNA is known to be significantly elevated in diseased people. Due to possible variation in the population, evaluating cfDNA as a non-invasive biomarker at disease onset alone may not be sensitive enough to accurately diagnose diseases, particularly early stage cancers on a personal level. To understand the factors that define the cfDNA levels on the personal level and for better use as a non-invasive biomarker, we isolated cfDNA from the plasma of healthy individuals with varying degrees of genetic and/or environmental similarities (monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, sibling pairs, and unrelated individuals) as well as from patients with varying stages of breast and ovarian cancer undergoing treatment. Cell-free DNA levels were quantified by a fluorometer (ng/ml) and/or real-time PCR (copies/ml). The associations between individuals with various degrees of genetic and/or environmental similarities and their plasma cfDNA levels were evaluated. The ACE model (A = additive genetic, C = common environment, and E = specific environmental factors) was used to determine the proportion of each factor on the cfDNA levels. We found a high correlation (r = 0.77; p < 0.0001) in plasma cfDNA levels between monozygotic twins (n = 39). However, the correlation was gradually reduced to moderate (r = 0.47; p = 0.016) between dizygotic twins (n = 13) and low correlation (r = 0.28; p = 0.043) between sibling pairs (n = 26). The ACE model analysis showed that the plasma cfDNA level of a given healthy individual is influenced both by genetic and the environmental components in similar proportions (53% and 47%, respectively; A = 53%, C = 22.5%, E = 24.5%). Moreover, while age had no effect, gender significantly influenced the individual's plasma cfDNA level. As expected, cfDNA levels were significantly higher in both breast (n = 26) (p<0.0001) and ovarian (n = 64) (p<0.0001) cancer patients compared to the healthy individuals. Our study demonstrated that both genome and environmental factors modulate the individual's cfDNA level suggesting that its diagnostic sensitivity may be improved only if the person's cfDNA level is known prior to disease presentation."
https://openalex.org/W2980040143,"In many low- and middle-income countries, data on the prevalence of surgical diseases have been derived primarily from hospital-based studies, which may lead to an underestimation of disease burden within the community. Community-based prevalence studies may provide better estimates of surgical need to enable proper resource allocation and prioritization of needs. This study aims to assess the prevalence of common surgical conditions among children in a diverse rural and urban population in Nigeria.Descriptive cross-sectional, community-based study to determine the prevalence of congenital and acquired surgical conditions among children in a diverse rural-urban area of Nigeria was conducted. Households, defined as one or more persons 'who eat from the same pot' or slept under the same roof the night before the interview, were randomized for inclusion in the study. Data was collected using an adapted and modified version of the interviewer-administered questionnaire-Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey tool and analysed using the REDCap web-based analytic application.Eight-hundred-and-fifty-six households were surveyed, comprising 1,883 children. Eighty-one conditions were identified, the most common being umbilical hernias (20), inguinal hernias (13), and wound injuries to the extremities (9). The prevalence per 10,000 children was 85 for umbilical hernias (95% CI: 47, 123), and 61 for inguinal hernias (95% CI: 34, 88). The prevalence of hydroceles and undescended testes was comparable at 22 and 26 per 10,000 children, respectively. Children with surgical conditions had similar sociodemographic characteristics to healthy children in the study population.The most common congenital surgical conditions in our setting were umbilical hernias, while injuries were the most common acquired conditions. From our study, it is estimated that there will be about 2.9 million children with surgically correctable conditions in the nation. This suggests an acute need for training more paediatric surgeons."
https://openalex.org/W2980225977,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, as well as cartilage and bone destruction. Several proteins are associated with the pathogenesis of the disease. Galectin-9 belongs to the family of lectins that are involved in various biological processes and have anti-inflammatory activity.To investigate associations between the SNPs of the GAL-9 gene (LGALS9) and serum levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients. We extracted DNA from 356 subjects, 156 RA patients and 200 healthy controls from northeastern Brazil. Three polymorphisms (rs4795835, rs3763959, and rs4239242) in the LGALS9 gene were selected and genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Serum concentrations of galectin-9 were analyzed by ELISA.The rs4239242 TT genotype showed a positive association with RA (p = 0.0032, odds ratio = 0.28), and heterozygous TC were prevalent in the control group compared to RA patients (p = 0.0001, odds ratio = 7.99). Galectin-9 serum levels were significantly increased in RA patients compared to the control group (p<0.0001). Patients in remission had high levels of galectin compared to the moderate activity group (p<0.0001). Regarding the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), patients in remission or low activity presented high levels of galectin when compared to patients in severity (p<0.0001). Patients performing moderate activity had a significant value compared to patients who were in high disease severity (p = 0.0064). Interestingly, the AG genotype (rs3763959) has been associated with a higher presence of bone erosion in RA patients (p = 0.0436). The SNP rs4239242 TT genotype showed a positive association with RA in comparison to the control group. The AG genotype (rs3763959) has been associated with a higher presence of bone erosion in RA patients."
https://openalex.org/W2979676709,"The objectives of this study were: 1) to classify animals into groups of high and low feed efficiency using two feed efficiency indexes (Residual feed intake (RFI) and residual feed intake and body weight gain (RIG)), and 2) to evaluate if pre-weaning heifer calves divergent for feed efficiency indexes exhibit differences in performance, body measurements, digestibility, energy partitioning, and nitrogen partitioning. A total of 32 Gyr heifer calves were enrolled in a 63-d trial and classified into two feed efficiency (FE) groups based on RFI and RIG (mean ± 0.5 SD). The groups were classified as high efficiency (HE) RFI (HE RFI, n = 9; HE RIG, n = 10), and low efficiency (LE) RFI (LE RFI, n = 10; LE RIG, n = 11). The remaining animals were classified as intermediate (n = 13 (RFI) and n = 11 (RIG)). HE and LE calves had RFI values of—0.052 and 0.049 kg/d (P < 0.05), respectively. The HE RFI group consumed 8.9% less solid diet than the LE RFI group. HE RFI animals exhibited an increased digestibility of crude protein and ether extract and tended to have greater total dry and organic matter digestibility. LE RFI animals had greater gross energy and nitrogen intake, though greater fecal losses resulted in a tendency to reduce energy and nitrogen use efficiency. HE and LE calves had RIG values of 0.080 and -0.077kg/d (P ≤ 0.01), respectively. HE RIG animals exhibited greater average daily gain (9.4%), body weight (BW), and heart girth, though HE RIG group exhibited narrower hip width. HE RIG animals tended to have greater ether extract digestibility but greater methane losses (% of gross energy). HE RFI in pre-weaning heifers seems to be related to differences in digestibility. Divergent animals for RIG during the assessed phase appear to differ in body measurements, which may be related to differences in the composition of the gain."
https://openalex.org/W2979812832,"Physical inactivity is high within the Qatari population, particularly within females, and school-based environments, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. School-based physical activity (PA) outcomes may be mediated by physical self-concept. Low physical self-concept may negatively impact PA engagement, compromising childhood and adolescent physical fitness, which may translate into adulthood. Normative physical fitness data for the Qatari population is unavailable. Stratifying normative physical fitness appears prudent, to not only allow comparisons to be made worldwide, but enable informed decisions for public health policy and future interventions in the Qatari population.To establish the physical fitness of young adults in Qatar, and examine differences between males and females for physical self-concept, and engagement in school-based and extra-curricular PA.186 (females n = 85) healthy participants [median (minimum-maximum) age: males = 21 (18-26), females = 21 (18-24) y; height: males = 1.74 (1.57-1.99), females = 1.61 (1.46-1.76) m; body mass: males = 71.9 (49.3-145.0), females = 56.8 (35.7-96.4) kg] completed the ALPHA-FIT test battery for adults (one leg stand, figure of eight run, handgrip strength, jump and reach, modified push-up, dynamic sit-up and 2 km walk), physical self-description questionnaire (measuring physical self-concept), and were asked to answer 'yes' or 'no' to whether they participated in school-based and extra-curricular PA.Data is reported as effect size; ±90% confidence limit. Males compared to females most likely performed better for dynamic sit-up (2.2; ±0.76), very likely better for the figure of eight run (0.86; ±0.42) and likely better for handgrip strength (2.1; ±0.75). Males likely had higher physical self-concept for coordination (0.78; ±0.37) and endurance (0.66; ±0.27) compared to females. There were no differences for school-based PA (p ≥ 0.78) or for extra-curricular PA for males (p ≥ 0.26) or females (p ≥ 0.21).The data suggests that the young Qatari adult population has variable, yet generally low, physical fitness traits compared to individuals worldwide, likely due to their low PA. The precise aetiology for this is not well documented, yet such data may be prudent to evidence-inform strategies to improve physical fitness through increased PA (synergistic relationship), given the strong association between physical activity/fitness and morbidity/mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2980033109,"In patients with chronic disorders, control self-efficacy is the confidence with managing symptoms and coping with the demands of illness. Can do treatment (CDT) is an intensive, 3-day, social cognitive theory-based, multidisciplinary treatment that focuses on identification of stressors, goal setting, exploration of boundaries, and establishment of new boundaries. An uncontrolled study showed that patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and low-disability had improved control self-efficacy six months after CDT. Hence, in a 6-month, single-centre, randomized (1:1), unmasked, controlled trial in RRMS patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤4.0, we compared CDT with no intervention and the option to receive CDT after completion of study participation. Follow-up assessments were at one, three and six months. Primary endpoint was control self-efficacy (Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale Control [MSSES-C] (minimum 90, maximum 900) at six months. Secondary endpoints were functional self-efficacy (MSSES-F), participation and autonomy (Impact on Participation and Autonomy questionnaire [IPA]), health-related quality of life (MS Quality of Life-54 Items questionnaire [MSQoL-54]), anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]) and coping skills (Utrecht Coping List [UCL]) at six months. Tertiary endpoint was care-related strain on support partners (Caregiver Strain Index) at six months. Of the 158 patients that were included, 79 were assigned to CDT and 79 to the control group. Two CDT patients discontinued treatment prematurely. Sixty-one (77%) control patients chose to receive CDT after study participation. Intention-to-treat ANCOVA analyses were performed with follow-up values as dependent, and condition, baseline values, disease duration and gender as independent variables. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) MSSES-C score in the CDT group vs. control group at baseline was 468 (162) vs. 477 (136), and at six months 578 (166) vs. 540 (135) (p = 0.100). Secondary and tertiary endpoints did not differ between groups, except for the UCL palliative reaction score being slightly higher in the CDT group (p = 0.039). On post hoc analyses the MSSES-C score at one and three months was higher in the CDT vs. control group: 597 (114) vs. 491 (131) (p<0.0001) and 561 (160) vs. 514 (143) (p = 0.018), respectively; and at one month the MSSES-F, IPA Limitations, HADS Anxiety and Depression, and MSQoL-54 Mental and Physical scores were also in favour of the CDT group. We conclude that in low-disability RRMS patients, the intensive 3-day social cognitive theory-based CDT did not improve control self-efficacy at six months follow-up compared to waitlist controls. The absence of a between-group difference at six months relates to a gradual improvement in the control group. In all, this social cognitive theory-based approach for improving self-efficacy needs further investigation before being broadly applied in RRMS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2979726860,"Activated platelets release adenosine trisphosphate (ATP) and bioluminescence analysis of ATP release is usually used to monitor activation of platelets induced by various stimulants. However, bioluminescence analysis of ATP possesses poor linearity, the signal is quickly attenuated, and the accuracy of ATP release from platelets is hard to determine accurately enough to be used in a high throughput screening of platelet inhibitors. The present study was designed to optimize bioluminescence analysis of ATP released by platelets and expand its application in high throughput screening of platelet inhibitors. The results showed that accuracy of ATP analysis was significantly improved by adding coenzyme A (CoA) and signal attenuation of ATP analysis was greatly postponed by adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) both in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) and Tyrode’s buffer. Furthermore, ATP release of activated platelets and inhibitory effects of Ly294002 and Staurosporine on platelet activation were accurately determined by our optimized bioluminescence analysis of ATP. Thus, we have successfully constructed an optimized bioluminescence analysis of ATP which can be used in high throughput screening of platelet inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2979523354,"Fricative consonants are known to be pronounced by controlling turbulent flow inside a vocal tract. In this study, a simplified vocal tract model was proposed to investigate the characteristics of flow and sound during production of the fricative [s] in a word context. By controlling the inlet flow rate and tongue speed, the acoustic characteristics of [s] were reproduced by the model. The measurements with a microphone and a hot-wire anemometer showed that the flow velocity at the teeth gap and far-field sound pressure started oscillating before the tongue reached the /s/ position, and continued during tongue descent. This behaviour was not affected by the changes of the tongue speed. These results indicate that there is a time shift between source generation and tongue movement. This time shift can be a physical constraint in the articulation of words which include /s/. With the proposed model, we could investigate the effects of tongue speed on the flow and sound generation in a parametric way. The proposed methodology is applicable for other phonemes to further explore the aeroacoustics of phonation."
https://openalex.org/W2979776548,"Climate warming and organic matter decomposition are connected in a recursive manner; this recursion can be described by temperature sensitivity. We conducted a multifactorial laboratory experiment to quantify the temperature sensitivity of organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) decomposition processes of common boreal organic soils. We incubated 36 mor and 36 slightly decomposed Carex-Sphagnum peat samples in a constant moisture and ambient temperature for 6 months. The experiment included three temperature and two moisture levels and two food web manipulations (samples with and without fungivore enchytraeid worms). We determined the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seven molecular size classes together with ammonium N and dissolved organic N in low molecular weight and high molecular weight fractions. The temperature sensitivity function Q10 was fit to the data. The C and N release rate was almost an order of magnitude higher in mor than in peat. Soil fauna increased the temperature sensitivity of C release. Soil fauna played a key role in N release; when fauna was absent in peat, the N release was ceased. The wide range of the studied C and N compounds and treatments (68 Q10 datasets) allowed us to recognize five different temperature sensitivity patterns. The most common pattern (37 out of 68) was a positive upwards temperature response, which was observed for CO2 and DOC release. A negative downward pattern was observed for extractable organic nitrogen and microbial C. Sixteen temperature sensitivity patterns represented a mixed type, where the Q10function was not applicable, as this does not allow changing the sign storage change rate with increasing or decreasing temperature. The mixed pattern was typically connected to intermediate decomposition products, where input and output fluxes with different temperature sensitivities may simultaneously change the storage. Mixed type was typical for N processes. Our results provide useful parameterization for ecosystem models that describe the feedback loop between climate warming, organic matter decomposition, and productivity of N-limited vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2979499501,"Studies conducted in time series could be far more informative than those that only capture a specific moment in time. However, when it comes to transcriptomic data, time points are sparse creating the need for a constant search for methods capable of extracting information out of experiments of this kind. We propose a feature selection algorithm embedded in a hidden Markov model applied to gene expression time course data on either single or even multiple biological conditions. For the latter, in a simple case-control study features or genes are selected under the assumption of no change over time for the control samples, while the case group must have at least one change. The proposed model reduces the feature space according to a two-state hidden Markov model. The two states define change/no-change in gene expression. Features are ranked in consonance with three scores: number of changes across time, magnitude of such changes and quality of replicates as a measure of how much they deviate from the mean. An important highlight is that this strategy overcomes the few samples limitation, common in transcriptome experiments through a process of data transformation and rearrangement. To prove this method, our strategy was applied to three publicly available data sets. Results show that feature domain is reduced by up to 90% leaving only few but relevant features yet with findings consistent to those previously reported. Moreover, our strategy proved to be robust, stable and working on studies where sample size is an issue otherwise. Hence, even with two biological replicates and/or three time points our method proves to work well."
https://openalex.org/W2979537370,"The adaptation of crops to acid soils is needed for the maintenance of food security in a sustainable way, as decreasing fertilizers use and mechanical interventions in the soil would favor the reduction of agricultural practices' environmental impact. Phosphate deficiency and the presence of reactive aluminum affect vital processes to the plant in this soil, mostly water and nutrient absorption. From this, the understanding of the molecular response to these stresses can foster strategies for genetic improvement, so the aim was to broadly analyze the transcriptional variations in Poupulus spp. in response to these abiotic stresses, as a plant model for woody crops. A co-expression network was constructed among 3,180 genes differentially expressed in aluminum-stressed plants with 34,988 connections. Of this total, 344 genes presented two-fold transcriptional variation and the group of genes associated with those regulated after 246 hours of stress had higher number of connections per gene, with some already characterized genes related to this stress as main hubs. Another co-expression network was made up of 8,380 connections between 550 genes regulated by aluminum stress and phosphate deficiency, in which 380 genes had similar profile in both stresses and only eight with transcriptional variation higher than 20%. All the transcriptomic data are presented here with functional enrichment and homology comparisons with already characterized genes in another species that are related to the explored stresses, in order to provide a broad analysis of the co-opted responses for both the stresses as well as some specificity. This approach improves our understanding regarding the plants adaptation to acid soils and may contribute to strategies of crop genetic improvement for this condition that is widely present in regions of high agricultural activity."
https://openalex.org/W2979660294,"The neural representation and perceptual salience of tonal signals presented in different noise maskers were investigated. The properties of the maskers and signals were varied such that they produced different amounts of either monaural masking release, binaural masking release, or a combination of both. The signals were then presented at different levels above their corresponding masked thresholds and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were measured. It was found that, independent of the masking condition, the amplitude of the P2 component of the AEP was similar for the same stimulus levels above masked threshold, suggesting that both monaural and binaural effects of masking release were represented at the level of the auditory pathway where P2 is generated. The perceptual salience of the signal was evaluated at equal levels above masked threshold using a rating task. In contrast to the electrophysiological findings, the subjective ratings of the perceptual signal salience were less consistent with the signal level above masked threshold and varied strongly across listeners and masking conditions. Overall, the results from the present study suggest that the P2 amplitude of the AEP represents an objective indicator of the audibility of a target signal in the presence of complex acoustic maskers."
https://openalex.org/W2979790134,"Background Dietary management is highly important for the maintenance of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was reportedly associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and cognitive function. However, data concerning the association between cerebral rSO2 and dietary intake of CKD patients is limited. Methods This was a single-center observational study. We recruited 67 CKD patients not undergoing dialysis. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored using the INVOS 5100c oxygen saturation monitor. Energy intake was evaluated by dietitians based on 3-day meal records. Daily protein and salt intakes were calculated from 24-h urine collection. Results Multivariable regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with energy intake (standardized coefficient: 0.370) and serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.236) in Model 1 using parameters with p < 0.10 in simple linear regression analysis (body mass index, Hb level, serum albumin concentration, salt and energy intake) and confounding factors (eGFR, serum sodium concentration, protein intake), and the energy/salt index (standardized coefficient: 0.343) and Hb level (standardized coefficient: 0.284) in Model 2 using energy/protein index as indicated by energy intake/protein intake and energy/salt index by energy intake/salt intake in place of salt, protein and energy intake. Conclusions Cerebral rSO2 is affected by energy intake, energy/salt index, serum albumin concentration and Hb level. Sufficient energy intake and adequate salt restriction is important to prevent deterioration of cerebral oxygenation, which might contribute to the maintenance of cognitive function in addition to the prevention of renal dysfunction in CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2979446425,"Abortion is uniquely connected to women's experiences yet women's attitudes towards legal abortion vary across the pro-choice/anti-abortion spectrum. Existing research has focused on sociodemographic characteristics to explain women's levels of abortion support. Here, we argue that abortion attitudes vary with women's perceptions of gender linked fate, or the extent to which some women see their fates as tied to other women. Drawing upon existing research showing that married white women report lower levels of gender linked fate than their non-married counterparts, we assess these relationships for abortion attitudes applying the 2012 American National Election Survey (n = 2,173). Using mediation analysis, we show that lower levels of gender linked fate among married white women (vs. non-married white women) explain their stronger opposition to abortion. As many state governments are increasingly legislating restricted access to legal abortion, understanding factors explaining opposition to legal abortion is urgently important."

Most of these concerns are based on theoretical considerations and there exists little data on the attitudes of stakeholders in these countries. This study examines the view of researchers and REC members in Thailand regarding the design and conduct of challenge studies in the country. A questionnaire was developed based on ethical frameworks for human challenge studies. The target respondents included those who had experience with health-related research at universities, non-university hospitals, and research institutes. A total of 240 respondents completed the on-line survey. In general, the respondents felt that the ethical issues raised by human challenge studies in LMICS do not differ significantly from those in high income countries, including: scientific rationale, safety, appropriate risks, and robust informed consent process. In contrast, issues that have been described as important for human challenge studies in LMICs were rated as having lower importance, including: a publicly available rationale, national priority, and community engagement. Responses did not vary significantly between researchers in different fields, nor between researchers and REC members. These findings provide an important perspective for assessing existing frameworks for human challenges studies in LMICs."

We determined the structure of these membrane-encircled protein aggregates using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and observed the dissolution of protein aggregates after starvation. Electron tomography (ET) as an extension of transmission electron microscopy revealed that these aggregates were comprised of granular subunits having a diameter of 20 nm aligned into highly ordered structures in all three dimensions. The three dimensional (3D) lattice of hIAPP granules were constructed of two unit cells, a body centered tetragonal (BCT) and a triclinic unit cell. A 5-fold twinned structure was observed consisting of the cyclic twinning of the BCT and triclinic unit cells. The interaction between the two nearest hIAPP granules in both unit cells is not only governed by the van der Waals forces and the dipole-dipole interaction but potentially also by filament-like structures that can connect the nearest neighbors. Hence, our 3D structural analysis provides novel insight into the aggregation process of hIAPP in the fat body tissue of Drosophila melanogaster."

https://openalex.org/W2979399065,"Introduction While extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is effective in preventing further hypoxemia and maintains blood flow in endotoxin-induced shock, ECMO alone does not reverse the hypotension. In this study, we tested whether concurrent vasopressor use with ECMO would provide increased circulatory support and blood flow, and characterized regional blood flow distribution to vital organs. Methods Endotoxic shock was induced in piglets to achieve a 30% decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Measurements of untreated pigs were compared to pigs treated with ECMO alone or ECMO and vasopressors. Results ECMO provided cardiac support during vasodilatory endotoxic shock and improved oxygen delivery, but vasopressor therapy was required to return MAP to normotensive levels. Increased blood pressure with vasopressors did not alter oxygen consumption or extraction compared to ECMO alone. Regional microcirculatory blood flow (RBF) to the brain, kidney, and liver were maintained or increased during ECMO with and without vasopressors. Conclusion ECMO support and concurrent vasopressor use improve regional blood flow and oxygen delivery even in the absence of full blood pressure restoration. Vasopressor-induced selective distribution of blood flow to vital organs is retained when vasopressors are administered with ECMO."

Studies have reported an association between this cell subset and malaria symptoms and severity. Profiles of Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells in bigger cohorts with different levels of clinical severity have not been described. Proportion, numbers, and activation status of Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells were measured by flow cytometry in 59 healthy controls (HCs), 58 children with uncomplicated malaria (UM) and 67 with cerebral malaria (CM,) during acute malaria and in convalescence 28 days later. Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cell were lower in children presenting with UM and CM than in HCs. Cell counts did not vary with malaria severity (CM median counts 40 x 103 cells/μL, IQR [23–103]; UM median counts 30 x 103 cells/μL [10–90], P = 0.224). Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cell counts increased during convalescence for UM (70 [40–60] x 103 cells/μL and CM (90 [60–140] x 103 cells/μL), to levels similar to those in HCs (70 [50–140] x 103 cells/μL), p = 0.70 and p = 0.40 respectively. Expression of the activation markers CD69 and HLA-DR on Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells was higher in malaria cases than in controls (HCs vs UM or CM, p < 0.0001) but was similar between UM and CM. HLA-DR expression remained elevated at 28 days, suggesting sustained activation of Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells during recovery. Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cell proportions and cells counts were suppressed in acute disease and normalized in convalescence, a phenomenon previously hypothesized to be due to transient migration of the cells to secondary lymphoid tissue. The presence of highly activated Vγ9Vδ2 γδ T cells suggests that this T cell subset plays a specific role in response to malaria infection."
https://openalex.org/W2979442573,"Many real systems can be described by a set of interacting entities forming a complex network. To some surprise, these have been shown to share a number of structural properties regardless of their type or origin. It is thus of vital importance to design simple and intuitive models that can explain their intrinsic structure and dynamics. These can, for instance, be used to study networks analytically or to construct networks not observed in real life. Most models proposed in the literature are of two types. A model can be either static, where edges are added between a fixed set of nodes according to some predefined rule, or evolving, where the number of nodes or edges increases over time. However, some real networks do not grow but rather shrink, meaning that the number of nodes or edges decreases over time. We here propose a simple model of shrinking networks called the war pact model. We show that networks generated in such a way exhibit common structural properties of real networks. Furthermore, compared to classical models, these resemble international trade, correlates of war, Bitcoin transactions and other networks more closely. Network shrinking may therefore represent a reasonable explanation of the evolution of some networks and greater emphasis should be put on such models in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2979519472,"H3N2 canine influenza viruses are prevalent in Asian and North American countries. During circulation of the viruses in dogs, these viruses are occasionally transmitted to cats. If this canine virus causes an epidemic in cats too, sporadic infections may occur in humans because of the close contact between these companion animals and humans, possibly triggering an emergence of mutant viruses with a pandemic potential. In this study, we aimed to gain an insight into the mutations responsible for inter-species transmission of H3N2 virus from dogs to cats. We found that feline CRFK cell-adapted viruses acquired several mutations in multiple genome segments. Among them, HA1-K299R, HA2-T107I, NA-L35R, and M2-W41C mutations individually increased virus growth in CRFK cells. With a combination of these mutations, virus growth further increased not only in CRFK cells but also in other feline fcwf-4 cells. Both HA1-K299R and HA2-T107I mutations increased thermal resistance of the viruses. In addition, HA2-T107I increased the pH requirement for membrane fusion. These findings suggest that the mutations, especially the two HA mutations, identified in this study, might be responsible for adaptation of H3N2 canine influenza viruses in cats."
https://openalex.org/W2979949947,"Geographic isolation is an important yet underappreciated factor affecting marine reserve performance. Isolation, in combination with other factors, may preclude recruit subsidies, thus slowing recovery when base populations are small and causing a mismatch between performance and stakeholder expectations. Mona Island is a small, oceanic island located within a partial biogeographic barrier-44 km from the Puerto Rico shelf. We investigated if Mona Island's no-take zone (MNTZ), the largest in the U.S. Caribbean, was successful in increasing mean size and density of a suite of snapper and grouper species 14 years after designation. The La Parguera Natural Reserve (LPNR) was chosen for evaluation of temporal trends at a fished location. Despite indications of fishing within the no-take area, a reserve effect at Mona Island was evidenced from increasing mean sizes and densities of some taxa and mean total density 36% greater relative to 2005. However, the largest predatory species remained rare at Mona, preventing meaningful analysis of population trends. In the LPNR, most commercial species (e.g., Lutjanus synagris, Lutjanus apodus, Lutjanus mahogoni) did not change significantly in biomass or abundance, but some (Ocyurus chrysurus, Lachnolaimus maximus), increased in abundance owing to strong recent recruitment. This study documents slow recovery in the MNTZ that is limited to smaller sized species, highlighting both the need for better compliance and the substantial recovery time required by commercially valuable, coral reef fishes in isolated marine reserves."
https://openalex.org/W2980292546,"Mutualistic plant-microbe associations are widespread in natural ecosystems and have made major contributions throughout the evolutionary history of terrestrial plants. Amongst the most remarkable of these are the so-called root endosymbioses, resulting from the intracellular colonization of host tissues by either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or nitrogen-fixing bacteria that both provide key nutrients to the host in exchange for energy-rich photosynthates. Actinorhizal host plants, members of the Eurosid 1 clade, are able to associate with both AM fungi and nitrogen-fixing actinomycetes known as Frankia. Currently, little is known about the molecular signaling that allows these plants to recognize their fungal and bacterial partners. In this article, we describe the use of an in vivo Ca2+ reporter to identify symbiotic signaling responses to AM fungi in roots of both Casuarina glauca and Discaria trinervis, actinorhizal species with contrasting modes of Frankia colonization. This approach has revealed that, for both actinorhizal hosts, the short-chain chitin oligomer chitotetraose is able to mimic AM fungal exudates in activating the conserved symbiosis signaling pathway (CSSP) in epidermal root cells targeted by AM fungi. These results mirror findings in other AM host plants including legumes and the monocot rice. In addition, we show that chitotetraose is a more efficient elicitor of CSSP activation compared to AM fungal lipo-chitooligosaccharides. These findings reinforce the likely role of short-chain chitin oligomers during the initial stages of the AM association, and are discussed in relation to both our current knowledge about molecular signaling during Frankia recognition as well as the different microsymbiont root colonization mechanisms employed by actinorhizal hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2980314021,"Recent experimental work has revealed unusual features of the effect of certain drugs on cardiac inwardly rectifying potassium currents, including the constitutively active and acetylcholine-induced components of acetylcholine-sensitive current (IKAch). These unusual features have included alternating susceptibility of the current components to activation and inhibition induced by ethanol or nicotine applied at various concentrations, and significant correlation between the drug effect and the current magnitude measured under drug-free conditions. To explain these complex drug effects, we have developed a new type of quantitative model to offer a possible interpretation of the effect of ethanol and nicotine on the IKAch channels. The model is based on a description of IKAch as a sum of particular currents related to the populations of channels formed by identical assemblies of different α-subunits. Assuming two different channel populations in agreement with the two reported functional IKAch-channels (GIRK1/4 and GIRK4), the model was able to simulate all the above-mentioned characteristic features of drug-channel interactions and also the dispersion of the current measured in different cells. The formulation of our model equations allows the model to be incorporated easily into the existing integrative models of electrical activity of cardiac cells involving quantitative description of IKAch. We suppose that the model could also help make sense of certain observations related to the channels that do not show inward rectification. This new ionic channel model, based on a concept we call population type, may allow for the interpretation of complex interactions of drugs with ionic channels of various types, which cannot be done using the ionic channel models available so far."
https://openalex.org/W2979533055,"Fetal monitoring based on electrocardiographic (ECG) morphology is obtained from a single unipolar fetal scalp electrode. Ideally, it should be obtained from multiple leads, as ECG waveform depends on alignment between electrode and electrical heart axis. This alignment is unknown in fetuses. Besides, fetuses are surrounded by conductive media, which may influence ECG waveform. We explored the influence of electrode position and head orientation on ECG waveforms of unipolar and bipolar scalp ECGs recorded in air and in conductive medium.We recorded ECGs in one adult subject at five different scalp positions in five different head orientations both in dry and immersed conditions. The ratio between T-amplitude and QRS-amplitude (T/QRS ratio) of unipolar and bipolar scalp ECGs was determined and compared between all conditions.In the dry condition, we observed in the unipolar leads little to no difference between different electrode positions (maximal T/QRS difference 0.00-0.01) and minor differences between head orientations (0.02-0.03), whereas bipolar leads showed no recognizable ECG signal at all. During the immersed condition, we found variation in the unipolar leads, both between electrode positions (maximal T/QRS difference 0.02-0.05) and between head orientations (0.03-0.06). Bipolar leads showed different ECG signals in contrasting head orientations.Both unipolar and bipolar scalp lead-derived ECG waveforms are influenced by electrode position and head orientation when the subject is submerged in a conductive medium. Fetal monitoring based on single scalp lead ECG waveform might be suboptimal, as it lacks correction for fetal head orientation and electrode position."
https://openalex.org/W2980011017,"Forecasting extremely rare events is a pressing problem, but efforts to model such outcomes are often limited by the presence of multiple causes within classes of events, insufficient observations of the outcome to assess fit, and biased estimates due to insufficient observations of the outcome. We introduce a novel approach for analyzing rare event data that addresses these challenges by turning attention to the conditions under which rare outcomes do not occur. We detail how configurational methods can be used to identify conditions or sets of conditions that would preclude the occurrence of a rare outcome. Results from Monte Carlo experiments show that our approach can be used to systematically preclude up to 78.6% of observations, and application to ground-truth data coupled with a bootstrap inferential test illustrates how our approach can also yield novel substantive insights that are obscured by standard statistical analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2979423967,"Malignant gliomas remain incurable with a poor prognosis despite of aggressive treatment. We have been studying the development of brain tumors in a glioma rat model, where rats develop brain tumors after prenatal exposure to ethylnitrosourea (ENU), and there is a sizable interval between when the first pathological changes are noted and tumors become detectable with MRI. Our aim to define a molecular timeline through proteomic profiling of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) such that brain tumor commitment can be revealed earlier than at the presymptomatic stage. A comparative proteomic approach was applied to profile CSF collected serially either before, at and after the time MRI becomes positive. Elastic net (EN) based models were developed to infer the timeline of normal or tumor development respectively, mirroring a chronology of precisely timed, ""clocked"", adaptations. These CSF changes were later quantified by longitudinal entropy analyses of the EN predictive metric. False discovery rates (FDR) were computed to control the expected proportion of the EN models that are due to multiple hypothesis testing. Our ENU rat brain tumor dating EN model indicated that protein content in CSF is programmed even before tumor MRI detection. The findings of the precisely timed CSF tumor microenvironment changes at presymptomatic stages, deviation from the normal development timeline, may provide the groundwork for the understanding of adaptation of the brain environment in tumorigenesis to devise effective brain tumor management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2979463939,"Slope one is a popular recommendation algorithm due to its simplicity and high efficiency for sparse data. However, it often suffers from under-fitting since the global information of all relevant users/items are considered. In this paper, we propose a new scheme called enhanced slope one recommendation through local information embedding. First, we employ clustering algorithms to obtain the user clusters as well as item clusters to represent local information. Second, we predict ratings using the local information of users and items in the same cluster. The local information can detect strong localized associations shared within clusters. Third, we design different fusion approaches based on the local information embedding. In this way, both under-fitting and over-fitting problems are alleviated. Experiment results on the real datasets show that our approaches defeats slope one in terms of both mean absolute error and root mean square error."
