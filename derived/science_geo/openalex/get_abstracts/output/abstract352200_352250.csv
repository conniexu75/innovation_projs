https://openalex.org/W2016022129,"Background Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) are potent negative regulators of gene expression in plants and animals. Artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs)–designed to target one or several genes of interest–provide a new and highly specific approach for effective post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants. Methodology We devised an amiRNA-based strategy for both japonica and indica type strains of cultivated rice, Oryza sativa. Using an endogenous rice miRNA precursor and customized 21mers, we designed amiRNA constructs targeting three different genes (Pds, Spl11, and Eui1/CYP714D1). Upon constitutive expression of these amiRNAs in the varieties Nipponbare (japonica) and IR64 (indica), the targeted genes are down-regulated by amiRNA-guided cleavage of the transcripts, resulting in the expected mutant phenotypes. The effects are highly specific to the target gene, the transgenes are stably inherited and they remain effective in the progeny. Conclusion/Significance Our results not only show that amiRNAs can efficiently trigger gene silencing in a monocot crop, but also that amiRNAs can effectively modulate agronomically important traits in varieties used in modern breeding programs. We provide all software tools and a protocol for the design of rice amiRNA constructs, which can be easily adapted to other crops. The approach is suited for candidate gene validation, comparative functional genomics between different varieties, and for improvement of agronomic performance and nutritional value."
https://openalex.org/W2158328957,"Type II hexokinase is overexpressed in most neoplastic cells, and it mainly localizes on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Hexokinase II dissociation from mitochondria triggers apoptosis. The prevailing model postulates that hexokinase II release from its mitochondrial interactor, the voltage-dependent anion channel, prompts outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the ensuing release of apoptogenic proteins, and that these events are inhibited by growth factor signalling. Here we show that a hexokinase II N-terminal peptide selectively detaches hexokinase II from mitochondria and activates apoptosis. These events are abrogated by inhibiting two established permeability transition pore modulators, the adenine nucleotide translocator or cyclophilin D, or in cyclophilin D knock-out cells. Conversely, insulin stimulation or genetic ablation of the voltage-dependent anion channel do not affect cell death induction by the hexokinase II peptide. Therefore, hexokinase II detachment from mitochondria transduces a permeability transition pore opening signal that results in cell death and does not require the voltage-dependent anion channel. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of the pathways of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and their inactivation in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2057012829,"Background There is growing interest in the nature of slow variations of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal observed in functional MRI resting-state studies. In humans, these slow BOLD variations are thought to reflect an underlying or intrinsic form of brain functional connectivity in discrete neuroanatomical systems. While these ‘resting-state networks’ may be relatively enduring phenomena, other evidence suggest that dynamic changes in their functional connectivity may also emerge depending on the brain state of subjects during scanning. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we examined healthy subjects (n = 24) with a mood induction paradigm during two continuous fMRI recordings to assess the effects of a change in self-generated mood state (neutral to sad) on the functional connectivity of these resting-state networks (n = 24). Using independent component analysis, we identified five networks that were common to both experimental states, each showing dominant signal fluctuations in the very low frequency domain (∼0.04 Hz). Between the two states, we observed apparent increases and decreases in the overall functional connectivity of these networks. Primary findings included increased connectivity strength of a paralimbic network involving the dorsal anterior cingulate and anterior insula cortices with subjects' increasing sadness and decreased functional connectivity of the ‘default mode network’. Conclusions/Significance These findings support recent studies that suggest the functional connectivity of certain resting-state networks may, in part, reflect a dynamic image of the current brain state. In our study, this was linked to changes in subjective mood."
https://openalex.org/W2127166394,"Genetically-encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) hold the promise of monitoring [Ca(2+)] in selected populations of neurons and in specific cellular compartments. Relating GECI fluorescence to neuronal activity requires quantitative characterization. We have characterized a promising new genetically-encoded calcium indicator-GCaMP2-in mammalian pyramidal neurons. Fluorescence changes in response to single action potentials (17+/-10% DeltaF/F [mean+/-SD]) could be detected in some, but not all, neurons. Trains of high-frequency action potentials yielded robust responses (302+/-50% for trains of 40 action potentials at 83 Hz). Responses were similar in acute brain slices from in utero electroporated mice, indicating that long-term expression did not interfere with GCaMP2 function. Membrane-targeted versions of GCaMP2 did not yield larger signals than their non-targeted counterparts. We further targeted GCaMP2 to dendritic spines to monitor Ca(2+) accumulations evoked by activation of synaptic NMDA receptors. We observed robust DeltaF/F responses (range: 37%-264%) to single spine uncaging stimuli that were correlated with NMDA receptor currents measured through a somatic patch pipette. One major drawback of GCaMP2 was its low baseline fluorescence. Our results show that GCaMP2 is improved from the previous versions of GCaMP and may be suited to detect bursts of high-frequency action potentials and synaptic currents in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2050963795,"Increased expression of the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), which controls blood calcium homeostasis, leads to a decrease in the extracellular calcium set-point, thereby reducing parathyroid hormone secretion and renal calcium reabsorption and increasing calcitonin secretion resulting in reduced circulating calcium levels. Critically ill patients with elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels commonly have hypocalcemia, although the mechanism is not known. After intraperitoneal injection of interleukin (IL)-6 in the rat, circulating levels of parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and calcium fell within hours and remained low at 24 h. Expression of CASR (mRNA and protein) increased within hours in parathyroid, thyroid, and kidney and remained elevated at 24 h. The CASR gene has two promoters (P1 and P2) yielding transcripts having alternative 5′-untranslated regions but encoding the same receptor protein. Activities of P1 and P2 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs were stimulated ∼2–3-fold by IL-6 in proximal tubule HKC cells and TT thyroid C-cells. Studies with P1 deleted and mutated promoter-reporter and Stat1 and/or Stat3 dominant-negative constructs showed that a Stat1/3 element downstream of the P1 start site accounted for the IL-6 induction. There are no Stat elements in the P2 promoter, but Sp1/3 elements are clustered at the transcription start site. A series of transfection P2 promoter-reporter analyses showed that Sp1 together with Stat1/3 was critical for IL-6 responsiveness of P2. By oligonucleotide precipitation assay, IL-6 rapidly promoted a complex containing both Sp1/3 and Stat1/3 on the Sp1/3 elements. In conclusion, Stat1/3 directly controls promoter P1, and the Stats indirectly regulate promoter P2 via Sp1/3 in response to IL-6. By this mechanism, the cytokine likely contributes to altered extracellular calcium homeostasis.

The CASR, a plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptor, senses small changes in circulating calcium concentration and modulates intracellular pathways that alter PTH and calcitonin secretion or renal cation handling, thereby playing an essential role in blood mineral ion homeostasis. The relationship between extracellular ionized calcium and PTH concentrations is represented by an inverse sigmoidal curve. The activity and/or expression level of the CASR dictates the extracellular calcium set point (defined as the extracellular calcium concentration at which PTH secretion from the parathyroid gland or calcium reabsorption across the kidney tubule is half-maximal). Increases in extracellular calcium directly stimulate calcitonin secretion. The importance of the CASR in orchestrating the endocrine control of blood calcium concentrations has been underscored by the identification of naturally occurring mutations in the CASR gene that cause human disease. Inactivating mutations result in hypercalcemia, and activating mutations result in hypocalcemia (1Pollak M.R. Brown E.M. Chou Y.-W.H. Hebert S.C. Marx S.J. Steinmann B. Levi T. Seidman C.E.

Several factors may be involved, including decreased secretion of PTH and resistance to the action of PTH in kidney and bone. The metabolism and function of vitamin D are impaired. Calcitonin precursors are increased in the circulation of critically ill patients with sepsis and could contribute to the hypocalcemia (6Lind L. Carlstedt F. Rastad J. Stiernstrom H. Stridsberg M.

Several studies of critically ill patients have shown that serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increase within hours of severe burns and infection and can rise to very high levels (8Caldwell Jr., F.T.

However, further analyses are required to more fully understand the mechanisms linking the raised IL-6 levels to altered calcium metabolism. Previously, we investigated the hypothesis that cytokines such as IL-1β increase CASR expression in those tissues important for the control of systemic calcium homeostasis thereby leading to hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism. We showed in vivo in the rat that parathyroid, thyroid, and kidney CASR mRNA and protein increased after intraperitoneal injection of IL-1β (19Canaff L. Hendy G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14177-14186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This was associated with decreased circulating PTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and calcium. The CASR gene has two promoters (P1 and P2) yielding alternative transcripts containing either exon 1A or exon 1B 5′-untranslated region sequences that splice to exon 2 containing the ATG translation start codon (20Garrett J.E.

We demonstrated that both the CASR gene promoters have functional κB elements that mediate up-regulation by IL-1β (19Canaff L. Hendy G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14177-14186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this study, we postulated that IL-6, by up-regulating CASR expression in parathyroid, thyroid C-cell, and kidney tubule, reducing PTH secretion and renal calcium reabsorption, and increasing calcitonin secretion, contributes to altered calcium homeostasis. Here we have demonstrated that IL-6 stimulates CASR expression in vivo and defined, for the first time, the mechanisms whereby the cytokine up-regulates CASR gene promoter activity. The resulting increases in CASR expression could be contributing to the hypocalcemia of critically ill patients. Materials—Recombinant IL-6 was from Sigma.

The deletion construct, P2(–341), was prepared by standard techniques (see Table 1 for primer sequences). P2(–459)Sp1Mut in which three Sp1 sites (one just before and two just after the transcription initiation site) are mutated was generated by the overlap extension site-specific mutagenesis method (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 77: 51-59Crossref Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using P2(–459) as template. The primers sets used were as follows: F1 (5′-AAGCGCCCTAAGCTTCTTTCCATCGCC-3′ with a HindIII site in boldface type), RM (5′-TCCCGGCCCTTTCCCCGGAGCTCTTTCCCTCTCCTGCTCCCCTTTCGCTTGCC-3′ with mutated residues in boldface type to generate product 1), and FM (5′-GGCAAGCGAAAGGGGAGCAGGAGAGGGAAAGAGCTCCGGGGAAAGGGCCGGGA-3′ with mutated residues in boldface type), and R2 (5′-TGCAAAGCTTGGTTCTGCCGTCTCTCCAGGGC-3′ with HindIII site in boldface type to generate product 2). The overlapping fragments were denatured and amplified with primers F1 and R2 to generate product 3 that was cleaved with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII-digested P2(–459) plasmid to create P2(–459)Sp1Mut. Cell Culture—HKC cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. TT cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS and 5% horse serum. All maintenance media contained 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B. For mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor studies, cells were grown in 6-well plates to 75–80% confluence and cotransfected with either pGL3 or P1 or P2 promoter constructs and the Renilla luciferase vector (internal control). Twelve to 15 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 8 h, then stimulated or not with 10 ng/ml IL-6, and harvested 9 h later. Ten μm of the MAPK inhibitor U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI) or 0.1% DMSO vehicle were added to the medium 30 min prior to stimulation. After cell lysis, supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity. Transfection and Reporter Assay—For transient transfection, cells were trypsinized, plated in 6-well dishes in DMEM, 10% FBS (1–4 × 105 cells per well), and incubated overnight. The next day, cells were transfected with 30 μg/well of Superfect reagent with 1 μg of CASR promoter construct and 0.5 μg of Renilla luciferase construct per well. The following day, cells were serum-starved in DMEM overnight and cultured with or without cytokine for 10 h. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 250 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) on ice. The lysates were vortexed for 30 s and supernatants collected by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C). Luciferase activity was measured in a Fluostar Optima luminometer (BMG Labtech) using 45 μl of cell lysate and D-Luciferin. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Nuclear Extracts of HKC Cells—Cells were stimulated with IL-6 (10 ng/ml) for 30 min, washed, scraped into 1 ml of PBS, and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were processed in a loose Dounce tissue homogenizer in 2 volumes of buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.3 mm DTT, 420 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors). Nuclear pellets were obtained by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and Dounce-homogenized. After a 20-min centrifugation at 25,000 × g, nuclear extracts (supernatants) were dialyzed for 5 h against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT. Protein content was determined, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Two micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated for 20 min on ice with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 15% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT). Antibodies were then added or not, and samples were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Five femtomoles of 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added and incubated for a further 20 min. Oligonucleotides used for EMSA are detailed in Table 2. Samples were electrophoresed at 8 V/cm through 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, which were then dried and autoradiographed.TABLE 2Oligonucleotides used for EMSA and/or oligo pulldown experimentsOligonucleotidesSequencesConsensus Sp15′-ATTCGATCGGGGGGGGGCGAGC-3′CASR promoters P1 Stat1-WT5′-CCCTGTATTTGAGGGAAAGGAAG-3′ 1A Stat1-WTaFor oligo pulldown experiments, a biotin moiety was present at the 5′ end.5′-TATTTTGTTCTGGAAATTTCCGCAAGGGTGG-3′ 1A Stat1-MutaFor oligo pulldown experiments, a biotin moiety was present at the 5′ end.5′-TATTTTGTTCTGGAAATTTAAACAAGAATGG-3′ P2 Sp1-WTaFor oligo pulldown experiments, a biotin moiety was present at the 5′ end.5′-GGCAAGCGGGCGGGGAGCAGGAGAGGGGCGGAGCTCCGGGGCCGGGGCCGGGA-3′ P2 Sp1-MutaFor oligo pulldown experiments, a biotin moiety was present at the 5′ end.5′-GGCAAGCGAAAGGGGAGCAGGAGAGGGAAAGAGCTCCGGGGAAAGGGCCGGGA-3′Other CgA-CRE-WTbCyclic AMP-response element sequence of the human chromogranin A gene is shown.5′-GATCCACCGCTGACGTCATTTCCAGATC-3′a For oligo pulldown experiments, a biotin moiety was present at the 5′ end.b Cyclic AMP-response element sequence of the human chromogranin A gene is shown.

Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (2 × 5 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type or mutated CASR P1 Stat1/3 or CASR P2 Sp1 elements (see Table 2 for sequences) for 16 h. DNA-protein complexes (1 μg of biotinylated oligo and 700 μg of protein) were added to Catch and Release Spin Columns (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) with anti-biotin antibody (1 μg, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and 10 μl of antibody capture affinity ligand with 1× wash buffer in a 500-μl total volume. The screw-cap columns were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged (2000 × g; 30 s). Columns were washed three times and eluted with denaturing buffer, and eluates were subjected to immunoblotting with either Stat1 or Stat3 or Sp1 or Sp3 antibodies. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The results from the in vivo IL-6 response studies were initially subjected to analysis of variance. The significance of differences from base line was then determined using Dunnett's multiple comparison test. For the nuclear run-on assays and luciferase transient transfection assays, comparisons were performed by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was taken to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Surprisingly, although DGAT1 is expressed in adipose tissue, DGAT1 does not catalyze retinyl ester synthesis in adipose tissue in vivo. Our data also establish that cellular retinol-binding protein, type II (CRBPII), which is expressed solely in the adult intestine, in vivo channels retinol to LRAT for retinyl ester synthesis.

Retinoids (vitamin A and its natural and synthetic analogs) are required for maintaining many essential physiological functions in vertebrates, including growth and differentiation, reproduction, embryogenesis, immune function, and vision (1Moore T.

The preformed retinoid is taken up from the intestinal lumen into mucosa cells as the free alcohol retinol. Proretinoid carotenoids like β-carotene are absorbed by the mucosa intact and enzymatically converted to retinaldehyde and subsequently to retinol within the cell. Within enterocytes, retinol is esterified with long-chain fatty acyl groups to form retinyl esters, which are packaged along with dietary lipids into nascent chylomicrons (4Blaner W.S. Olson J.A.

However, it is not clear whether DGAT1 has a physiological role in catalyzing retinyl ester formation in vivo. Because retinol is very hydrophobic, it is normally bound specifically to cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs) within cells (17Herr F.M. Ong D.E.

Based on in vitro studies, it has been proposed that LRAT utilizes preferentially retinol bound to CRBPI (expressed in most adult tissues with the exception of the small intestine) or retinol bound to CRBPII (expressed solely in the adult intestine) as substrates rather than unbound retinol.

Mice were sacrificed 4 h after dose administration, and serum and the intestine were collected for analysis. To study the distribution of newly absorbed retinoid in the chylomicron fraction, serum samples from individual mice were pooled according to gender and genotype (3–5 mice per pool). These pools (containing ∼1.5 ml of serum) were overlaid with ∼10 ml of PBS (PBS, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm sodium chloride) in an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged in an SW 40 rotor at 20 °C for 1 h at 39,000 rpm in a Beckman L8M ultracentrifuge. The chylomicrons floating at the top of the PBS layer were aspirated and washed again with PBS to minimize the contamination by a second centrifugation at the same conditions. Washed chylomicrons were used in our analyses. To assess the total [3H]retinoid in the washed chylomicrons, 10 μl of each washed chylomicron fraction was transferred to a scintillation vial and dissolved in 10 ml of Hydroflor liquid scintillation counting solution (National Diagnostics). To assess individual retinoids present in the washed chylomicrons, the chylomicron fractions were extracted and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, exactly as described below for tissue homogenates. Fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals throughout the entire HPLC run, and [3H]retinoid for each fraction was determined as described above. The 3H counts/min present in the fractions were measured in a Beckman LS 1800 liquid scintillation counter. For the pharmacological doses of retinol, each blood sample was collected, allowed to coagulate for 1 h on ice, and centrifuged at 4 °C to obtain serum. To determine retinoid contents present in the serum, the serum was extracted and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC as described below for tissue homogenates. Serum triglyceride levels were assessed using a kit following exactly the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To assess the proportion of the retinol dose (as either retinol or retinyl ester) remaining associated with the intestine after sacrifice of the mice, the first 5 cm of the small intestine was dissected and longitudinally opened. The intestine was then briefly immersed in a beaker containing PBS and subsequently blotted gently with absorbent paper. The washed intestine was then weighed, homogenized, and analyzed as described below under HPLC analysis. HPLC Analysis—Tissue and serum retinol and retinyl ester levels were determined by procedures described previously (11O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35647-35657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum, liver, intestine (consisting of the 5 cm most proximal to the stomach), and perigonadal (epididymal or ovarian) adipose tissue were flash-frozen in liquid N2 after dissection from the mice and stored immediately at –80 °C prior to analysis. Tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes of PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm sodium chloride) using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) set at half-maximal speed for 10 s. An aliquot of serum or tissue homogenate (200-μl aliquots of the total homogenate) was then treated with an equal volume of absolute ethanol containing a known amount of retinyl acetate as an internal standard, and the retinoids present in the homogenates were extracted into hexane. The extracted retinoids were separated on a 4.6 × 250 mm Ultrasphere C18 column (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) preceded by a C18 guard column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), using 70% acetonitrile, 15% methanol, 15% methylene chloride as the running solvent flowing at 1.8 ml/min. Retinol and retinyl esters (retinyl palmitate, oleate, linoleate, and stearate) were detected at 325 nm and identified by comparing the retention times and spectral data of experimental compounds with those of authentic standards. Concentrations of retinol and retinyl esters in the tissues were quantitated by comparing integrated peak areas for those of each retinoid against those of known amounts of purified standards. Loss during extraction was accounted for by adjusting for the recovery of the internal standard added immediately after homogenization of the tissues. Retinoic Acid Formation by Intestine Mucosal Scrapings—To assess the capacity of the intestinal mucosa of wild type and CrbpII–/– mice to synthesize retinoic acid from retinol or retinaldehyde, we employed experimental conditions previously described by Dew and Ong (26Dew S.E. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For this purpose 3-month-old male wild type and CrbpII–/– mice were fasted overnight. Sections of small intestine, 5 cm in length, most proximal to the stomach were dissected and longitudinally opened. The dissected material was washed with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 125 mm NaCl, 4.93 mm KCl, 1.23 mm MgSO4, 0.85 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose, pH 6.5) and gently blotted with absorbent paper to remove excess buffer. Mucosa cells were scraped from the luminal surface using a clean glass microscope slide, pooled for 4–5 mice of each strain, and placed into incubation buffer (Krebs-Ringer buffer containing taurocholate at a final concentration of 0.06 μm). Protein concentrations of mucosal scraping were determined by using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit according to the supplier's instructions. Retinol or retinaldehyde prepared in ethanol was added to mucosal scrapings so that the molar concentration of retinoid would be 50% of the concentration of CRBPII expected to be present in the wild type scrapings. The calculation of CRBPII concentration was based on the reported finding that CRBPII is present as 0.4–1% of total cytosolic protein in the small intestine (10Ong D.E. Newcomer M.E. Chytil F.

A. 1985; 82: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After adding retinol or retinaldehyde, the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a shaking incubator. Subsequent retinoic acid determinations were carried out by normal phase HPLC using procedures we have described earlier (11O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J. Baehr W.

In Vitro Assays of Retinyl Ester Formation—To assess the possibility that diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), or adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is able catalyze retinyl ester formation from retinol, we incubated whole cell homogenates prepared from McA-RH777 hepatocytes expressing either human DGAT2, HSL, ATGL, or an empty vector with retinol (200 μm, final concentration) for 1 or 2 h at 37 °C. The McA-RH777 homogenates were a kind gift of Dr. Li-Shin Huang of the Department of Medicine, Columbia University. The assay buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. The cells were homogenized in assay buffer supplemented with 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The assay was stopped through addition of an equal volume of 100% ethanol, and the retinoids were extracted into hexane. The resulting retinoid-containing hexane extract was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC as described above. Homogenates of cells expressing DGAT2 were able to catalyze triglyceride formation from exogenous diacylglycerol (25 μm, final concentration) and oleoyl-CoA (50 μm, final concentration). Similarly, homogenates expressing HSL or ATGL were catalytically active in catalyzing triglyceride hydrolysis (1.25 mm final triolein concentration). The homogenates of McA-RH777 cells expressing the empty vector were unable to catalyze either triglyceride formation or triglyceride/diglyceride hydrolysis. Statistical Analyses—All data were analyzed for statistically significant differences using standard procedures consisting of an unpaired t test or an analysis of variance followed by pairwise comparisons. DGAT1 Catalyzes Intestinal Retinyl Ester Formation in Vivo—Previous studies demonstrated that intestinal retinyl ester synthesis is markedly impaired but not completely abolished in Lrat–/– mice (11O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35647-35657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The synthesis of retinyl ester by Lrat–/– mice in response to a gavage dose of a physiological amount of retinol was less than 10% that of wild type mice given the same dose. The retinyl ester composition observed for chylomicrons isolated from Lrat–/– mice suggested that for these mice intestinal retinyl ester formation involves an acyl-CoA-dependent enzyme or an ARAT. DGAT1, an enzyme that is expressed by the intestine and catalyzes acyl-CoA-dependent formation of triglyceride from diglyceride, is able to catalyze acyl-CoA-dependent esterification of retinol in vitro (11O'Byrne S.M. Wongsiriroj N. Libien J. Vogel S. Goldberg I.J. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Blaner W.S. J. Biol.

To assess whether DGAT1 is responsible for intestinal synthesis of retinyl ester in Lrat–/– mice, we generated Lrat–/–/Dgat1–/– mice. These mutants were viable, and at 3 months of age showed no visible abnormalities. We investigated whether Lrat–/–/Dgat1–/– mice were able to esterify retinol to retinyl esters in response to a physiological challenge of retinol (6 μg containing 1 μCi of [3H]retinol; this is approximately the amount of retinol consumed by a mouse in 1 day when maintained on a standard rodent chow diet). For all of our studies, we employed the same experimental protocols that we used in our original investigations of Lrat–/– mice, including the use of the total lipase inhibitor P-407 to inhibit clearance of postprandial lipids, including retinoid, from the circulation (11O'Byrne S.M.

Consequently, our measure of postprandial retinoid levels provides an assessment of the total retinoid absorbed over the 4-h period after administration of a gavage dose of retinol in peanut oil. From fractions collected upon HPLC analysis, we detected retinyl esters in chylomicrons obtained from wild type, Dgat1–/–, and Lrat–/–mice, but not from Lrat–/–/Dgat1–/– mice (Fig. 1). For both Lrat–/– and Lrat–/–/Dgat1–/– mice compared with wild type and Dgat1–/– mice, we detected elevated levels of unesterified retinol in the isolated chylomicron fractions. For Lrat–/– mice, the majority of the 3H counts/min and retinoid mass appeared in the fractions corresponding to free retinol (Fig. 1, panel C) with a lesser amount of 3H counts/min and retinoid mass present as retinyl ester (primarily as retinyl linoleate and retinyl oleate). For Lrat–/–/Dgat1–/– mice, we were able to detect only 3H counts/min and retinoid mass corresponding to free (unesterified) retinol (Fig. 1, panel D). This same result was obtained from three independent experiments. Serum triglyceride levels, measured in response to the gavage dose of retinol given in peanut oil, were not different for wild type, Dgat1–/–, Lrat–/–, and Lrat–/–/Dgat1–/– mice. Moreover, when we examined the proximal 5 cm of the small intestines for their residual retinoid content, we did not observe stat"
https://openalex.org/W2077070575,"Background Endothelial E-selectin has been shown to play a pivotal role in mediating cell–cell interactions between breast cancer cells and endothelial monolayers during tumor cell metastasis. However, the counterreceptor for E-selectin and its role in mediating breast cancer cell transendothelial migration remain unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings By assessing migration of various breast cancer cells across TNF-α pre-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we found that breast cancer cells migrated across HUVEC monolayers differentially and that transmigration was E-selectin dependent. Cell surface labeling with the E-selectin extracellular domain/Fc chimera (exE-selectin/Fc) showed that the transmigration capacity of breast cancer cells was correlated to both the expression level and localization pattern of E-selectin binding protein(s) on the tumor cell surface. The exE-selectin/Fc strongly bound to metastatic MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-468 cells, but not non-metastatic MCF-7 and T47D cells. Binding of exE-selectin/Fc was abolished by removal of tumor cell surface sialyl lewis x (sLex) moieties. Employing an exE-selectin/Fc affinity column, we further purified the counterreceptor of E-selectin from metastatic breast cancer cells. The N-terminal protein sequence and cDNA sequence identified this E-selectin ligand as a ∼170 kD human CD44 variant 4 (CD44v4). Purified CD44v4 showed a high affinity for E-selectin via sLex moieties and, as expected, MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion to and migration across HUVEC monolayers were significantly reduced by down-regulation of tumor cell CD44v4 via CD44v4-specific siRNA. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated, for the first time, that breast cancer cell CD44v4 is a major E-selectin ligand in facilitating tumor cell migration across endothelial monolayers. This finding offers new insights into the molecular basis of E-selectin–dependent adhesive interactions that mediate breast cancer cell transendothelial metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2048566228,"Clostridium difficile is a leading infectious cause of health care associated diarrhoea. Several industrialised countries have reported increased C. difficile infections and outbreaks, which have been attributed to the emergent PCR ribotype 027 strain.We conducted a case-case study to compare severity of C. difficile disease for patients with 027 versus non-027 ribotypes. We retrospectively collected clinical information about 123/136 patients with C. difficile infections admitted to hospitals in the East of England region in 2006 and from whom stool isolates were cultured and ribotyped as part of an earlier national survey. We defined severe C. difficile disease as having one or more of shock, paralytic ileus, pseudo membranous colitis or toxic megacolon. Patient median age was 83 years old (range 3 to 98, interquartile range 75 to 89), 86% were prescribed antibiotics in the eight weeks before illness onset, 41% had ribotype 027 and 30-day all cause mortality during hospital admission was 21%. Severe disease occurred in 24% (95%CI 13% to 37%) and 17% (95%CI 9% to 27%) of patients with PCR ribotype 027 and non-027 ribotypes respectively. In a multivariable model, ribotype 027 was not associated with severe disease after adjusting for sex, discharge from hospital prior to 60 days of current admission, gastroenteritis on admission, number of initiator antibiotics for C. difficile disease, and hospital where the patient was admitted.Our study found no evidence to support previous assertions that ribotype 027 is more virulent than other PCR ribotypes. This finding raises questions about the contribution of this strain to the recent increase in C. difficile disease throughout North America and Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2010435378,"Most eukaryotic genomes have undergone whole genome duplications during their evolutionary history. Recent studies have shown that the function of these duplicated genes can diverge from the ancestral gene via neo- or sub-functionalization within single genotypes. An additional possibility is that gene duplicates may also undergo partitioning of function among different genotypes of a species leading to genetic differentiation. Finally, the ability of gene duplicates to diverge may be limited by their biological function.To test these hypotheses, I estimated the impact of gene duplication and metabolic function upon intraspecific gene expression variation of segmental and tandem duplicated genes within Arabidopsis thaliana. In all instances, the younger tandem duplicated genes showed higher intraspecific gene expression variation than the average Arabidopsis gene. Surprisingly, the older segmental duplicates also showed evidence of elevated intraspecific gene expression variation albeit typically lower than for the tandem duplicates. The specific biological function of the gene as defined by metabolic pathway also modulated the level of intraspecific gene expression variation. The major energy metabolism and biosynthetic pathways showed decreased variation, suggesting that they are constrained in their ability to accumulate gene expression variation. In contrast, a major herbivory defense pathway showed significantly elevated intraspecific variation suggesting that it may be under pressure to maintain and/or generate diversity in response to fluctuating insect herbivory pressures.These data show that intraspecific variation in gene expression is facilitated by an interaction of gene duplication and biological activity. Further, this plays a role in controlling diversity of plant metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2081325732,"The thioredoxin-dependent system is an essential regulator of cellular redox balance. Since oxidative stress has been linked with neurodegenerative disease, we studied the roles of thioredoxin reductases in brain using mice with nervous system (NS)-specific deletion of cytosolic (Txnrd1) and mitochondrial (Txnrd2) thioredoxin reductase. While NS-specific Txnrd2 null mice develop normally, mice lacking Txnrd1 in the NS were significantly smaller and displayed ataxia and tremor. A striking patterned cerebellar hypoplasia was observed. Proliferation of the external granular layer (EGL) was strongly reduced and fissure formation and laminar organisation of the cerebellar cortex was impaired in the rostral portion of the cerebellum. Purkinje cells were ectopically located and their dendrites stunted. The Bergmann glial network was disorganized and showed a pronounced reduction in fiber strength. Cerebellar hypoplasia did not result from increased apoptosis, but from decreased proliferation of granule cell precursors within the EGL. Of note, neuron-specific inactivation of Txnrd1 did not result in cerebellar hypoplasia, suggesting a vital role for Txnrd1 in Bergmann glia or neuronal precursor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2124728662,"Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) cross-reactivity is believed to play a pivotal role in generating immune responses but the extent and mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity remain largely unknown. Several studies suggest that CTL clones can recognize highly diverse peptides, some sharing no obvious sequence identity. The emerging realization in the field is that T cell receptors (TcR) recognize multiple distinct ligands.First, we analyzed peptide scans of the HIV epitope SLFNTVATL (SFL9) and found that TCR specificity is position dependent and that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition. Inspired by this, we developed a general model of TCR peptide recognition using amino acid similarity matrices and found that such a model was able to predict the cross-reactivity of a diverse set of CTL epitopes. With this model, we were able to demonstrate that seemingly distinct T cell epitopes, i.e., ones with low sequence identity, are in fact more biochemically similar than expected. Additionally, an analysis of HIV immunogenicity data with our model showed that CTLs have the tendency to respond mostly to peptides that do not resemble self-antigens.T cell cross-reactivity can thus, to an extent greater than earlier appreciated, be explained by amino acid similarity. The results presented in this paper will help resolving some of the long-lasting discussions in the field of T cell cross-reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1984617987,"The PhoP-PhoQ two-component system is a well studied bacterial signaling system that regulates virulence and stress response. Catalytic activity of the histidine kinase sensor protein PhoQ is activated by low extracellular concentrations of divalent cations such as Mg2+, and subsequently the response regulator PhoP is activated in turn through a classic phosphotransfer pathway that is typical in such systems. The PhoQ sensor domains of enteric bacteria contain an acidic cluster of residues (EDDDDAE) that has been implicated in direct binding to divalent cations. We have determined crystal structures of the wild-type Escherichia coli PhoQ periplasmic sensor domain and of a mutant variant in which the acidic cluster was neutralized to conservative uncharged residues (QNNNNAQ). The PhoQ domain structure is similar to that of DcuS and CitA sensor domains, and this PhoQ-DcuS-CitA (PDC) sensor fold is seen to be distinct from the superficially similar PAS domain fold. Analysis of the wild-type structure reveals a dimer that allows for the formation of a salt bridge across the dimer interface between Arg-50' and Asp-179 and with nickel ions bound to aspartate residues in the acidic cluster. The physiological importance of the salt bridge to in vivo PhoQ function has been confirmed by mutagenesis. The mutant structure has an alternative, non-physiological dimeric association."

Treatment was with standard antituberculous therapy and adjunctive dexamethasone; antiretroviral therapy was not routinely available. Patients were followed up until the end of TB treatment or death.The median symptom duration was 11 days (range 2-90 days), 21.8% had a past history of TB, and 41.4% had severe (grade 3) TBM. The median CD4 count was 32 cells/mm(3). CSF findings were as follows: median leucocyte count 438 x 10(9)cells/l (63% neutrophils), 69% smear positive and 87.9% culture positive. TB drug resistance rates were high (13% mono-resistance 32.6% poly-resistance 8.7% multidrug resistance). 17% patients developed further AIDS-defining illnesses. 67.2% died (median time to death 20 days). Three baseline variables were predictive of death by multivariate analysis: increased TBM grade [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.73, 95% CI 1.08-2.76, p = 0.02], lower serum sodium (AHR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98, p = 0.002) and decreased CSF lymphocyte percentage (AHR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99, p = 0.003).HIV-associated TBM is devastating disease with a dismal prognosis. CSF findings included CSF neutrophil predominance, high rates of smear and culture positivity, and high rates of antituberculous drug resistance. Three baseline variables were independently associated with death: increased TBM grade; low serum sodium and decreased CSF lymphocyte percentage."

We explored the potential of learned behaviours, specifically acoustic signals, to predict the persistence over time of fragmented bird populations. We found an association between male song diversity and the annual rate of population change, population productivity and population size, resulting in birds singing poor repertoires in populations more prone to extinction. This is the first demonstration that population viability can be predicted by a cultural trait (acquired via social learning). Our results emphasise that cultural attributes can reflect not only individual-level characteristics, but also the emergent population-level properties.

We previously demonstrated that mice lacking c-Met (Met-KO) in hepatocytes were hypersensitive to Fas-induced liver injury. In this study, we used primary hepatocytes isolated from Met-KO and control (Cre-Ctrl) mice to address more directly the protective effects of c-Met signaling. Loss of c-Met function increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Hepatocyte growth factor suppressed apoptosis in Cre-Ctrl but not Met-KO hepatocytes concurrently with up-regulation of NF-κB and major antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Intriguingly, Met-KO hepatocytes exhibited intrinsic activation of NF-κBas well as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, unchallenged Met-KO cells displayed oxidative stress as evidenced by overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which was associated with greater NADPH and Rac1 activities, was blocked by the known NADPH oxidase inhibitors, and was paralleled by increased lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. N-Acetylcysteine, an antioxidant and GSH precursor, significantly reduced Jo2-induced cell death. Conversely, the GSH-depleting agent buthionine sulfoximine completely abolished the protective effects of N-acetylcysteine in Met-KO hepatocytes.

Hinshaw J.A. Zaritskaya L. Williams M.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 648-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consequently, exposure to agents that increase cellular antioxidant defense or decrease the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was able to interrupt the signaling cascade and prevent hepatocyte apoptosis induced by Fas agonist (9Ding W.X. Ni H.M. DiFrancesca D. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Accumulating data suggest that HGF may function as an antioxidant factor able to protect against oxidative stress-mediated cell killing through modulation of intracellular levels of GSH, a major determinant of cellular redox potential, and cytoprotective enzymes (10Tsuboi S.

Furthermore, c-Met-triggered phosphoinositide 3-kinase(PI3K)/Akt activation, a key regulator of cell survival in adult and developing livers (12Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y.

Suzuki S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt signaling leads to the activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which in turn regulates expression of antioxidant and antiapoptotic target genes (16Gloire G. Legrand-Poels S. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar, 17Fan S. Gao M. Meng Q. Laterra J.J. Symons M.H. Coniglio S. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D.

Consistent with this, we have recently demonstrated that c-Met-deficient hepatocytes display increased basal expression of a distinct set of genes implicated in the ROS defense system thus connecting c-Met to control of ROS metabolism (18Kaposi-Novak P.

This study was undertaken to further characterize c-Met-triggered signaling pathways that regulate protection against Fas-induced apoptosis by using primary hepatocyte cultures established from liver-specific c-Met conditional knock-out mice. The data show that c-Met inactivation sensitizes hepatocytes to Fas-mediated apoptosis via mechanisms involving increased NADPH-dependent ROS generation and GSH depletion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Collagenase type I was obtained from Worthington). 6-Carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, di(acetoxymethyl ester) (DCFH-AM), and Hoechst 33342 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-mouse Fas monoclonal antibody (Jo2) was from Pharmingen. Recombinant human HGF was from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). STAT3 inhibitor peptide, wortmannin, LY294002, SN50, and PD98059 were from Calbiochem. All others chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Mice, Hepatocyte Isolation, and Culture—c-metfl/fl, AlbCre+/- (Met-KO), and control (w/w, AlbCre+/-) (Cre-Ctrl) mice were described previously (20Huh C.-G. Factor V.M. Sanchez A. Uchida K. Conner E.A. Thorgeirsson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4477-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Mice were maintained in pathogen-free housing and cared for in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Hepatocytes were isolated from 8- to 10-week-old male mice by a two-step collagenase perfusion technique followed by isodensity purification in a Percoll gradient, as described previously (21Kao C.Y. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and were >90% viable as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Hepatocytes were seeded at 5.3 × 104 cells per cm2 either in Lab-Tek chambered slides or 10-cm dishes (Nalge, Nunc) in the Ham’s F-12/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s basal hepatocyte growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (21Kao C.Y. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After a 4-h attachment, the medium was replaced to a serum-free basal hepatocyte growth medium. The following day, cells were exposed to Jo2 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) for 6 h, and as specified cells were pretreated with 40 ng/ml recombinant human HGF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) or with various inhibitors of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB signaling, including wortmannin, PD98059, LY294002, SN50, sulfasalazine, and STAT3 inhibitor peptide at indicated concentrations.Measurement of Apoptosis—Apoptotic cells were analyzed by staining with propidium iodine (PI) after fixation in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) as described previously (22Sánchez A. Factor V.M. Espinoza L.A. Schroeder I.S. Thorgeirsson S.S. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells with characteristic nuclear fragmentation were counted in randomly chosen fields from two duplicate cultures. At least 500 cells were counted, and the frequency of apoptosis (apoptotic index) was expressed as a percentage of the total cell counted.Analysis of Cellular Viability—Cell viability was assessed by the crystal violet-staining assay according to Nakagawa et al. (23Nakagawa T. Sawada M. Gonzalez F.J. Yokoi T. Kamataki T. Mutat. Res. 1996; 360: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells seeded at 1 × 105 into 12-well plates were treated with 30 μm SN50 for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h, washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and stained with 0.2% crystal violet. The absorbance of the 2% SDS extracts was measured at 620 nm. The cell viability was calculated as the percentage relative to untreated cells.Western Blot Analysis—Total and nuclear proteins were isolated from cultured cells with T-PER or NE-PER (Pierce) extraction reagents, respectively, containing 1% Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Pierce), 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 50 mm sodium orthovanadate according to the manufacturer's protocols. One hundred μg of total protein or 25 μg of nuclear protein measured using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen), and probed with anti-caspase 3, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-XL, anti-Mcl-1, anti-cytochrome c, anti-IκB-α, anti-gp91Phox (anti-Nox2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), anti-ERK1/2, anti-pERK1/2, anti-Akt, anti-pAkt, anti-PKC α/β II (Thr-638/641), anti-pPKC ζ/λ (Thr-410/403), anti-pPKC ϵ (Ser-729), anti-STAT3, and anti-pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) antibodies. Membranes were incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody depending on the origin of the primary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were identified with ECL-Plus Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Equal loading was demonstrated by probing the same membranes with actin antibody (NeoMarker, Fremont, CA).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared with Igepal CA-630 (0.58%) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm PMSF. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 0.4 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF. After mixing for 15 min at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was recovered and stored at -80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by bovine serum albumin assay. NF-κB DNA binding activity was assayed using a consensus oligonucleotide 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (Promega, Madison, WI) as a probe. Probe was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, MP Biomedical, Irving, CA) and purified using Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The reaction mixture contained nuclear protein extract (20 μg) in 5 μl of incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 1 μg of dI-dC and 32P-labeled probe. The reactions were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide native gels. In competition experiments, 100-fold molar excess of nonlabeled oligonucleotide was included in the reaction mixture 5 min before addition of the labeled probe. For supershift analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 15 min before addition of the labeled probe.Analysis of Cellular ROS Levels by Confocal Microscopy—Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined using the redox-sensitive dye DCFH-DA. Cells seeded at 2.13 × 105 cells/cm2 in Lab-Tek chambered cover glass were treated with 3 μm DCFH-AM for 30 min after overnight incubation in serum-free medium. Cells were washed two times with PBS, and the confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY).GSH Determination by HPLC—GSH and GSSG content was determined by HPLC as described by Fariss and Reed (24Fariss M.W. Reed D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were collected in 1 ml of 10% perchloric acid (Sigma), sonicated, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After removal of the supernatants, 100 mm iodoacetic acid (Sigma) in 0.2 mm m-cresol (Sigma) was added to each sample and GSH/GSSG solution standards, and the pH was adjusted to 9.0. Samples and standards were incubated in the dark for 1 h followed by the addition of 1 ml of 1% 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Sigma) in 100% HPLC grade ethanol. N-Dinitrophenyl derivatives were injected (100 μl) into the loop of the HPLC system (Waters), and separated on a 3-aminopropyl column (5 μm; 4.6 mm × 20 cm; Custom LC, Houston, TX). Eluted N-dinitrophenyl derivatives were measured by ultraviolet detection at 365 nm.Lipid Peroxidation Assay—Lipid peroxidation was assayed by the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive components using spectrophotometry as described by Buege and Aust (25Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10619) Google Scholar).Analysis of NADPH Oxidase Activity—Untreated Cre-Ctrl and Met-KO cells were harvested, pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in PBS. NADPH oxidase was analyzed as described by Herrera et al. (26Herrera B. Murillo M.M. Alvarez-Barrientos A. Beltran J. Fernandez M. Fabregat I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 250 μm NADPH. NADPH consumption was monitored by the decrease in absorbance at λ = 340 nm for 5 min. Specific NADPH oxidase activity was determined by monitoring the rate of consumption of NADPH inhibited by 10 μm DPI that was added 30 min before the assay. An aliquot of cells lysed with SDS was used to determine protein content. Results were expressed as picomoles of oxidized NADPH per min per mg of protein.Rac1 Activation Assay—The endogenous GTP-associated form of Rac1 was detected using Rac1 activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same samples used for GTP-Rac1 precipitation were used to assay total Rac1 by Western blot using Rac1 monoclonal antibody.Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Comparisons between groups were made using Student’s t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSLack of c-Met Function Increases Sensitivity of Mouse Hepatocytes to Jo2-mediated Apoptosis—Consistent with our in vivo study (20Huh C.-G. Factor V.M. Sanchez A. Uchida K. Conner E.A. Thorgeirsson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4477-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), hepatocytes isolated from liver-specific c-Met conditional knock-out mice (Met-KO) were more susceptible to Jo2-mediated cell death as judged by apoptotic index (Fig. 1, A and B) and caspase 3 cleavage (not shown). As expected, HGF pretreatment provided no protection in Met-KO cultures but significantly inhibited cell death in Cre-Ctrl hepatocytes (Fig. 1C). The anti-apoptotic effect of HGF was time-dependent, peaked at 6 h of HGF exposure, and correlated with a decrease in caspase 3 activation and cytochrome c release (Fig. 1, C–E). These results provide genetic evidence for essential role of HGF/c-Met signaling in protecting mouse hepatocytes against Jo2-mediated apoptotic cell death.PI3K/Akt Pathway Is Primarily Responsible for NF-κB Activation and Apoptosis Protection in Mouse Hepatocytes—To understand the molecular events underlying the increased rate of apoptosis in c-Met-deficient cells, we examined the activation of several survival pathways known to be involved in HGF-mediated cytoprotection (4Comoglio P.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E161-E162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2, and STAT3 was readily detectable in control hepatocytes within 5–60 min after HGF treatment and was abolished in Met-KO cultures (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Met-KO primary hepatocytes exhibit constitutive activation of NF-κB and antiapoptotic proteins. A, HGF activates Akt, Erk1/2, and STAT3 in Cre-Ctrl but not Met-KO cells. Whole cell lysates prepared from serum-starved (16 h) Cre-Ctrl and Met-KO cultures treated with 40 ng/ml HGF for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min were immunoblotted with anti-AKT, anti-Erk1/2, anti-Stat3, and phospho-specific antibodies against Akt Ser(P)-473, Erk1/2 Thr(P)-202/Tyr(P)-204, and Stat3 Ser(P)-727. The intensity of each protein was quantified by densitometry normalized to actin. The density value of total protein in untreated samples was designated as 1. Each bar represents the mean ± S.E. B, electromobility shift assay of NF-κB DNA binding activity in serum-starved (16 h) Cre-Ctrl and Met-KO hepatocytes treated with HGF (40 ng/ml) for the indicated time.

Whole cell lysates prepared from serum-starved (16 h) Cre-Ctrl and Met-KO hepatocytes treated with 40 ng/ml HGF for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min were immunoblotted with anti-IκB-α. D, expression of antiapoptotic proteins in Cre-Ctrl and Met-KO cultures. Cre-Ctrl and Met-KO hepatocytes were serum-starved for 16 h and incubated with HGF (40 ng/ml) for the indicated time.

A representative Western blot of three experiments is shown in A, C, and D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we determined which of these survival pathways played a major role in the protective effect of HGF in normal mouse hepatocytes. For this purpose, we used pharmacological and peptide inhibitors of PI3K, Erk1/2, and STAT3, and we assessed the activation of downstream transcription factor NF-κBby electrophoretic mobility shift assay. There is evidence that NF-κB protects mouse hepatocytes against Jo2-mediated apoptosis via subsequent induction of anti-apoptotic proteins (13Schulze-Bergkamen H. Brenner D. Krueger A. Suess D. Fas S.C. Frey C.R. Dax A. Zink D. Buchler P. Muller M. Krammer P.H. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Hatano E. Brenner D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1357-G1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In control cultures, HGF treatment rapidly increased NF-κB DNA binding activity that occurred in parallel with a time-dependent IκB-α degradation (Fig. 2, B and C). Maximum activity was achieved within 30 min and maintained for at least 2 h. In agreement with the biological response, HGF-induced activation of NF-κB was associated with up-regulation of the Bcl-2 family members. The protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were increased in whole cell lysates prepared from Cre-Ctrl hepatocytes after 3 h of HGF exposure and reached a maximum at 6–12 h (Fig. 2D). The expression of Mcl-1, which has been reported to be critical for the anti-apoptotic protection of human hepatocytes (13Schulze-Bergkamen H. Brenner D. Krueger A. Suess D. Fas S.C. Frey C.R. Dax A. Zink D. Buchler P. Muller M. Krammer P.H. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), was consistently high and increased to a lesser extent during the course of HGF treatment (Fig. 2D).Inhibition of the PI3K pathway by either wortmannin or LY294002 completely abolished HGF-induced NF-κB binding activity, induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and HGF-mediated protection against Jo2-induced apoptosis in Cre-Ctrl hepatocytes (Fig. 3, A–C). The protein levels of Mcl-1 were changed only modestly by these treatments (Fig. 3B). Conversely, in Met-KO cells that lacked HGF-mediated activation of the PI3K pathway (Fig. 2A), wortmannin and LY294002 did not affect expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Fig. 3D), whereas treatment with the NF-κB inhibitor sulfasalazine was very effective in down-regulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels and inducing apoptosis in both cell types (Fig. 3, B–D, and Fig. 5C). Suppression of Erk1/2 and STAT3 signaling affected neither NF-κB activation nor cell survival (data not shown).FIGURE 3NF-κB activation is required for the antiapoptotic effects of HGF in Cre-Ctrl hepatocytes.

Also, c-Met-deficient hepatocytes had higher basal levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, consistent with NF-κB electrophoretic mobility shift assay data, and comparable levels of Mcl-1. Nevertheless, abnormal activation of NF-κB and NF-κB-responsive genes was unable to protect c-Met-deficient hepatocytes against Jo2-induced apoptosis.Met Deletion Increases Oxidative Stress—It is well known that NF-κB may be activated under oxidative stress conditions (16Gloire G. Legrand-Poels S. Piette J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1493-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). Using microarray analysis, we have recently found dysregulation of genes involved in the oxidative stress response in c-Met-deficient primary hepatocytes (18Kaposi-Novak P. Lee J.S. Gomez-Quiroz L. Coulouarn C. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1582-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the lack of c-Met function could have contributed to the intracellular redox changes. We found that ROS production was markedly stimulated by c-met deletion as judged by the peroxide-activated fluorescence dye DCFH-DA (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2086826657,"Major depression in the elderly is associated with brain structural changes and vascular lesions. Changes in the subcortical regions of the limbic system have also been noted. Studies examining hippocampus volumetric differences in depression have shown variable results, possibly due to any volume differences being secondary to local shape changes rather than differences in the overall volume. Shape analysis offers the potential to detect such changes. The present study applied spherical harmonic (SPHARM) shape analysis to the left and right hippocampi of 61 elderly subjects with major depression and 43 non-depressed elderly subjects. Statistical models controlling for age, sex, and total cerebral volume showed a significant reduction in depressed compared with control subjects in the left hippocampus (F1,103 = 5.26; p = 0.0240) but not right hippocampus volume (F1,103 = 0.41; p = 0.5213). Shape analysis showed significant differences in the mid-body of the left (but not the right) hippocampus between depressed and controls. When the depressed group was dichotomized into those whose depression was remitted at time of imaging and those who were unremitted, the shape comparison showed remitted subjects to be indistinguishable from controls (both sides) while the unremitted subjects differed in the midbody and the lateral side near the head. Hippocampal volume showed no difference between controls and remitted subjects but nonremitted subjects had significantly smaller left hippocampal volumes with no significant group differences in the right hippocampus. These findings may provide support to other reports of neurogenic effects of antidepressants and their relation to successful treatment for depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2065817908,"We report a bioinformatic and functional characterization of Pb2, a 121-kDa multimeric protein that forms phage T5 straight fiber and is implicated in DNA transfer into the host. Pb2 was predicted to consist of three domains. Region I (residues 1–1030) was mainly organized in coiled coil and shared features of tape measure proteins. Region II (residues 1030–1076) contained two α-helical transmembrane segments. Region III (residues 1135–1148) included a metallopeptidase motif. A truncated version of Pb2 (Pb2-Cterm, residues 964–1148) was expressed and purified. Pb2-Cterm shared common features with fusogenic membrane polypeptides. It formed oligomeric structures and inserted into liposomes triggering their fusion. Pb2-Cterm caused β-galactosidase release from Escherichia coli cells and in vitro peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Based on these multifunctional properties, we propose that binding of phage T5 to its receptor triggers large conformational changes in Pb2. The coiled coil region would serve as a sensor for triggering the opening of the head-tail connector. The C-terminal region would gain access to the host envelope, permitting the local degradation of the peptidoglycan and the formation of the DNA pore by fusion of the two membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2016842303,"The emergence of neuraminidase inhibitor resistance has raised concerns about the prudent use of antiviral drugs in response to the next influenza pandemic. While resistant strains may initially emerge with compromised viral fitness, mutations that largely compensate for this impaired fitness can arise. Understanding the extent to which these mutations affect the spread of disease in the population can have important implications for developing pandemic plans.By employing a deterministic mathematical model, we investigate possible scenarios for the emergence of population-wide resistance in the presence of antiviral drugs. The results show that if the treatment level (the fraction of clinical infections which receives treatment) is maintained constant during the course of the outbreak, there is an optimal level that minimizes the final size of the pandemic. However, aggressive treatment above the optimal level can substantially promote the spread of highly transmissible resistant mutants and increase the total number of infections. We demonstrate that resistant outbreaks can occur more readily when the spread of disease is further delayed by applying other curtailing measures, even if treatment levels are kept modest. However, by changing treatment levels over the course of the pandemic, it is possible to reduce the final size of the pandemic below the minimum achieved at the optimal constant level. This reduction can occur with low treatment levels during the early stages of the pandemic, followed by a sharp increase in drug-use before the virus becomes widely spread.Our findings suggest that an adaptive antiviral strategy with conservative initial treatment levels, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, can minimize the final size of a pandemic while preventing large outbreaks of resistant infections."
https://openalex.org/W2091991954,"To assess and compare the prevalence, severity and prognosis of anti-TB drug induced hepatotoxicity (DIH) in HIV positive and HIV negative tuberculosis (TB) patients in Ethiopia.In this study, 103 HIV positive and 94 HIV negative TB patients were enrolled. All patients were evaluated for different risk factors and monitored biochemically and clinically for development of DIH. Sub-clinical hepatotoxicity was observed in 17.3% of the patients and 8 out of the 197 (4.1%) developed clinical hepatotoxicity. Seven of the 8 were HIV positive and 2 were positive for HBsAg.Sub-clinical hepatotoxicity was significantly associated with HIV co-infection (p = 0.002), concomitant drug intake (p = 0.008), and decrease in CD4 count (p = 0.001). Stepwise restarting of anti TB treatment was also successful in almost all the patients who developed clinical DIH. We therefore conclude that anti-TB DIH is a major problem in HIV-associated TB with a decline in immune status and that there is a need for a regular biochemical and clinical follow up for those patients who are at risk."
https://openalex.org/W2038843553,"Plant transgenic technology has been widely utilized for engineering crops for trait improvements and for production of high value proteins such as pharmaceuticals. However, the unintended spreading of commercial transgenic crops by pollination and seed dispersal is a major concern for environmental and food safety. Simple and reliable containment strategies for transgenes are highly desirable. Here we report a novel method for creating selectively terminable transgenic rice. In this method, the gene(s) of interest is tagged with a RNA interference cassette, which specifically suppresses the expression of the bentazon detoxification enzyme CYP81A6 and thus renders transgenic rice to be sensitive to bentazon, a herbicide used for rice weed control. We generated transgenic rice plants by this method using a new glyphosate resistant 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene from Pesudomonas putida as the gene of interest, and demonstrated that these transgenic rice plants were highly sensitive to bentazon but tolerant to glyphosate, which is exactly the opposite of conventional rice. Field trial of these transgenic rice plants further confirmed that they can be selectively killed at 100% by one spray of bentazon at a regular dose used for conventional rice weed control. Furthermore, we found that the terminable transgenic rice created in this study shows no difference in growth, development and yield compared to its non-transgenic control. Therefore, this method of creating transgenic rice constitutes a novel strategy of transgene containment, which appears simple, reliable and inexpensive for implementation."
https://openalex.org/W1966226755,"Background Scientific and public fascination with human language have included intensive scrutiny of language disorders as a new window onto the biological foundations of language and its evolutionary origins. Specific language impairment (SLI), which affects over 7% of children, is one such disorder. SLI has received robust scientific attention, in part because of its recent linkage to a specific gene and loci on chromosomes and in part because of the prevailing question regarding the scope of its language impairment: Does the disorder impact the general ability to segment and process language or a specific ability to compute grammar? Here we provide novel electrophysiological data showing a domain-specific deficit within the grammar of language that has been hitherto undetectable through behavioural data alone. Methods and Findings We presented participants with Grammatical(G)-SLI, age-matched controls, and younger child and adult controls, with questions containing syntactic violations and sentences containing semantic violations. Electrophysiological brain responses revealed a selective impairment to only neural circuitry that is specific to grammatical processing in G-SLI. Furthermore, the participants with G-SLI appeared to be partially compensating for their syntactic deficit by using neural circuitry associated with semantic processing and all non-grammar-specific and low-level auditory neural responses were normal. Conclusions The findings indicate that grammatical neural circuitry underlying language is a developmentally unique system in the functional architecture of the brain, and this complex higher cognitive system can be selectively impaired. The findings advance fundamental understanding about how cognitive systems develop and all human language is represented and processed in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1968864956,"Dynamic changes in chromatin structure through ATP-dependent remodeling and covalent modifications on histones play important roles in transcription regulation. Among the many chromatin modifiers identified, the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling histone deacetylase) complex is unique because it possesses both nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities. To understand the biological function of the NuRD complex, we generated a knock-out mouse model of the Mta2 (metastasis-associated protein 2) gene, which encodes a NuRD-specific component. Mta2 null mice exhibited partial embryonic lethality. The surviving mice developed lupus-like autoimmune symptoms including skin lesions, bodyweight loss, glomerulonephritis, liver inflammation, and production of autoantibodies. Transplantation of bone marrow cells from Mta2 null mice recapitulated some of the symptoms including skin lesion and bodyweight loss in the recipient mice. Mta2 null T lymphocytes showed normal development but hyperproliferation upon stimulation, which correlates with hyperinduction of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and interferon (IFN)-γ. T cell hyperproliferation, but not other autoimmune symptoms, was observed in T cell-specific Mta2 knock-out mice. Mta2 null T cells produced more IL-4 and IFN-γ under Th2 activation conditions, but normal levels of IL-4 and IFN-γ under Th1 activation conditions. Furthermore, we found that IL-4 is a direct target gene of Mta2. Our study suggests that Mta2/NuRD is involved in modulating IL-4 and IFN-γ expression in T cell immune responses, and gene expression in non-T cells plays an important role in controlling autoimmunity.

Dynamic changes in chromatin structure through ATP-dependent remodeling and covalent histone modifications play important roles in regulating gene expression. Studies in recent years have identified many ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and histone modifying enzymes (1Margueron R. Trojer P. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Among them, the NuRD (nucleosome remodeling histone deacetylase) complex is of special interest because it possesses both nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities (4Feng Q. Zhang Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 274: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). The major components of the mammalian NuRD complex include Mi-2β, Mta2 (metastasis-associated protein 2), HDAC1/2, 3The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; KO, knockout; WT, wild type; TKO, T cell-specific knockout; BMT, bone marrow transplantation; SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; TCR, T cell receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; LN, lymph node; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; dsDNA, double stranded DNA; ES cell, embryonic stem cell.

HDAC1/2 and RbAp46/48 form a deacetylase core complex that exists in both NuRD and the Sin3A histone deacetylase complex (6Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, Mi-2β, Mbd3, and Mta2 appear to be unique for the NuRD complex (4Feng Q. Zhang Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 274: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mi-2β is an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling enzyme (10Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that Mi-2β is involved in Hox gene silencing and somatic cell differentiation (11Kehle J. Beuchle D. Treuheit S. Christen B. Kennison J.A.

In mammalian cells, Mi-2β has been shown to interact with a master lymphocyte transcription factor Ikaros (13Hollander M.C. Sheikh M.S. Bulavin D.V. Lundgren K. Augeri-Henmueller L. Shehee R. Molinaro T.A. Kim K.E. Tolosa E. Ashwell J.D. Rosenberg M.P. Zhan Q. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Morgan W.F. Deng C.X. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Mbd3 is a member of the Mbd (methyl-CpG-binding domain) containing protein family. It interacts with Mbd2, which in turn can recruit the NuRD complex to repress transcription of methylated DNA (8Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (15Kaji K. Caballero I.M. Macleod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 16Kaji K. Nichols J. Hendrich B. Development. 2007; 134: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Mta2 belongs to the Mta protein family, which also includes Mta1 and Mta3. In vitro studies demonstrated that MTA2 positively regulates HDAC activity (8Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The C. elegans Mta2 homolog, egl-27 together with other NuRD component homologs have been shown to antagonize the Ras signaling pathway during vulval development (17Solari F. Ahringer J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 223-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition to Mta2, Mta3 has also been shown to form a complex with other NuRD components and play important roles in invasive growth of breast cancer cells through repressing Snail gene transcription, and in B cell differentiation through the Bcl-6 transcription repressor (9Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 18Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Mta1 gene overexpression has been associated with cancer metastasis (19Toh Y. Oki E. Oda S. Tokunaga E. Ohno S. Maehara Y. Nicolson G.L. Sugimachi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Toh Y. Kuwano H. Mori M. Nicolson G.L. Sugimachi K. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 1723-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), although whether it functions together with other NuRD components is not clear. Compared with Mta1 and Mta3, Mta2 is more ubiquitously expressed. It is likely that different Mta family members form different NuRD-like complexes with distinct functions. Chromatin remodeling and histone modifications have been shown to play crucial roles in transcription regulation in the immune system (21Smale S.T. Fisher A.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 427-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Previous studies have established that during T helper (Th) cell differentiation, expression of specific transcription factors, such as T-bet and GATA3, and cytokines, such as IFN-γ and IL-4, are regulated at the chromatin level (21Smale S.T. Fisher A.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 427-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22Ansel K.M. Lee D.U. Rao A. Nat.

Immunity. 2006; 24: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For example, histone hyperacetylation has been observed at the IFN-γ regulatory region in Th1 cells and at the IL-4 regulatory region in Th2 cells (24Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Messi M. Giacchetto I. Nagata K. Lanzavecchia A. Natoli G. Sallusto F. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). DNA demethylation at IL-4 promoters and the regulatory region have also been observed in Th2 differentiation (23Lee G.R. Kim S.T. Spilianakis C.G. Fields P.E. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2006; 24: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 26Fields P.E. Lee G.R. Kim S.T. Bartsevich V.V. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2004; 21: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Even though it is well established that histone modification and chromatin remodeling play important roles in lymphocyte differentiation and activation, little is known about the identity of the corresponding enzymes. Several recent reports have indicated a role of the NuRD complex in these processes. For example, deficiency in Mbd2, a NuRD-interacting methyl-CpG-binding protein, results in abnormal Th cell differentiation and abnormal IL-4 expression (27Hutchins A.S. Mullen A.C. Lee H.W. Sykes K.J. High F.A. Hendrich B.D. Bird A.P. Reiner S.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Another NuRD interacting protein, Ikaros, has been shown to set thresholds for T cell activation and TCR-mediated T cell differentiation (8Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, a direct link between NuRD and T cell function has yet to be established. To understand the in vivo function of Mta2/NuRD, we have generated Mta2 knock-out mice. Mta2 null mice exhibit multiple phenotypes including partial embryonic lethality, development defects, and more interestingly, a lupus-like autoimmune disease. This report focuses on characterizing the autoimmune phenotypes and T lymphocyte function in adult Mta2 null mice. Our data revealed the important role of Mta2/NuRD in regulating IL-4 and IFN-γ expression during Th2-prone immune response and in regulating gene expression in non-T cells to control autoimmunity. Generation of Mice Carrying Mta22lox and Mta21lox Alleles and Manipulation of Mice—The Mta2 targeting vector included PGK-Neo and MC1-tk expression cassettes for positive and negative selection, respectively. Two FRT sites were inserted to each side of the PGK-Neo minigene for future removal of the expression cassette by FLP recombinase. Two loxP sites were inserted in introns 3 and 11, respectively, to flank the region including the PGK-Neo cassette and the genomic sequence from exons 4 to 11. Linearized Mta2 targeting vector was electroporated into J1 ES cells (129SvJ) and selected in the presence of G418 and FIAU (1-(2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5′-iodouracil). Correctly targeted ES cell clones identified by PCR screens were expanded and injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts to obtain chimeric mice, which were then bred to C57Bl/6 to produce C57Bl/6/129SvJ hybrid F1 progeny carrying the Mta22lox allele. Mice heterozygous for the Mta22lox allele were crossed with EIIa Cre transgenic mice to generate mice carrying the Mta21lox allele in which Cre recombinase-mediated loxP recombination had occurred and removed the PGK-Neo cassette as well as the genomic sequence from exons 4 to 11. The primers (set a in Fig. 1B) for genotyping Mta2 wild-type (WT) and Mta22lox alleles are the 5′ sequence 5′-GCTGAAGCAGACAGCAAAC-3′ and 3′ sequence, 5′-CATGCCAGGTTTTGAACCC-3′. PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C at 3 min followed by 35 cycles of: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and then one cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. A 390-bp fragment is derived from the mutant allele and a 335-bp fragment is derived from the wild-type allele. The primers (set b in Fig. 1B) for genotyping the Mta21lox allele are the 5′ sequence, 5′-GCTGACAGTAATGCTCGTGAGT-3′ and the 3′ sequence, 5′-ATGCTTCTCACTGAGCTACAGC-3′, and the fragment is 1.2-kb. PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles of: 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and then one cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. A 1.5-kb fragment is derived from the Mta21lox allele. The Mta2 null and control mice described in this report were on a mixed genetic background (129SvJ and C57Bl/6). EIIa-Cre (28Lakso M. Pichel J.G. Gorman J.R. Sauer B. Okamoto Y. Lee E. Alt F.W. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) transgenic mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and the LckCre transgenic mice were obtained from the laboratory of Zhuang Yuan at Duke University (24Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse maintenance and experiments were done following the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols. The skin and liver tissues from control and Mta2 knock-out mice were fixed in formalin for 20–24 h and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for morphological examination. ELISA—Serum was collected from Mta2 null and control mice of different ages. Serum anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB antibodies levels were measured using ELISA kits from Alpha Diagnostics International Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Flow Cytometry Analysis of Lymphoid Population—Age-matched conventional Mta2 null, T cell-specific null, and age- and sex-matched control mice were used for analysis. Single cell suspensions of thymocytes, spleen cells, and lymph node (LN) cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, phycoerythrin (PE)-, peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP)-, and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated monoclonal antibodies and analyzed with FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). All the antibodies used for immunostaining were purchased from BD Biosciences. Data were analyzed using SUMMIT software. T Cell Proliferation, Th Polarization, and Cytokine Assay—T cell proliferation assay was performed using a previously described protocol (29Kovalev G.I. Franklin D.S. Coffield V.M. Xiong Y. Su L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3285-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, cervical, umbilical, and axial lymph nodes from each mouse were harvested and pooled. About 5 × 105 LN cells or 1 × 105 purified CD4+CD25- T cells were plated in each well of a 96-well plate. The plate was previously coated with goat anti-hamster antibody (10 μg/ml). Thirty-six to 48 h later, the cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine and harvested after 12 h of incubation. For cytokine production assay, about 2 × 106 anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb-stimulated LN cells were plated in a 24-well plate and cultured for 4 days before harvesting of the supernatant. The cytometric bead array was performed according to manufacturer's instruction (BD Biosciences). For Th differentiation, CD4+ T cells were purified from pooled spleen and LN cells using the CD4+ purification kit follow up AutoMACS™ cell separation (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). 2 × 106 CD4+ cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAb, as described, in the presence of recombinant human IL-2 (100 units/ml) (nonpolarized condition). In addition, for Th1 differentiation, cells were stimulated in the presence of recombinant mouse IL-12 (5 ng/ml) and anti-IL-4 (4 μg/ml) (Pharmingen). For Th2 differentiation, cells were stimulated in the presence of mouse IL-4 (50 ng/ml), anti-IL-12 (5 μg/ml), and anti-IFN-γ (4 μg/ml) mAbs (Pharmingen). After 7 days of culture, cells were washed and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) for 6 h in the presence of BD GolgiPlug containing brefeldin A (Pharmingen) for the last 4 h. IL-4 and IFN-γ expression was assessed by intracellular staining. Harvested cells were stained with anti-CD4 mAb, permeabilized with BD FACS Permeabilizing Solution 2 (BD Bioscience), and stained with anti-IL4 and anti-IFN-γ mAbs. Samples were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by FACSscan (BD Bioscience). 1 × 105 cells from each polarization condition were harvested and analyzed for IL-4 expression by real-time PCR. Reconstituted SCID Mice—To reconstitute SCID mice, bone marrow (BM) cells from 11-week-old Mta2 WT and Mta2 null mice were injected into irradiated (250R) SCID-NOD mice (5 × 106 bone marrow cells per mouse). LN T cells in the reconstituted mice were harvested at 8 weeks post-reconstitution, and standard FACS and T cell proliferation assays were performed. Quantitative Real-time PCR— Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. RNAs were denatured for 3 min at 70 °C and cDNAs were synthesized in Ambion RT buffer with random decamers and 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 42 °C followed by 10 min at 95 °C to inactivate the enzyme. Real-time PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan primer/probe mixtures (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer and analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT system. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was modified from a previously described protocol (24Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peripheral T cells were purified by the CD4+ T cell purification kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). IL-4 PCR primers were: 1 forward GCCAATCAGCACCTCTCTTC, 1 reverse, TAAAGCCTCATTCCATGGTC; 2 forward, CATCGCTACACCTCCCAC, 2 reverse, CCTTGGTTTCAGCAACTTTAAC. Statistics—Chi-square tests were used for genotype distribution analysis. T tests were used for statistical analysis of mouse bodyweight, different type of T cell analysis, and T cell proliferation assay. Wilcoxon rank test was used for survival analysis. Generation of the Mta2 Mutant Mice—Although the composition and biochemical properties of the mammalian NuRD complex have been extensively characterized (4Feng Q. Zhang Y. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 274: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar), its biological function is not well understood. To gain insight into its function, we generated a mouse model in which a component of the NuRD complex is deleted by gene targeting. We chose to inactivate Mta2 because the protein encoded by this gene appears to be present only in the NuRD complex. We made a conditional gene targeting vector in which Mta2 exons 4–11 were flanked by two loxP sites (Fig. 1A). Cre-mediated recombination at these two loxP sites resulted in deletion of exons 4–11 and a frameshift in exon 12. As a result, the Mta2 mutant allele would only encode the N-terminal 63 amino acids of the Mta2 protein (Fig. 1A). To investigate the function of Mta2 in whole animal, the Mta22lox/+ mice were crossed with EIIa-Cre transgenic mice. The Mta21lox mice carrying one completely recombined allele (equal to conventional heterozygous knock-out mice) were selected for breeding. The Mta21lox mice will be referred to as Mta2 heterozygous mice and the Mta21lox/1lox mice will be referred to as Mta2 null or Mta2 conventional null mice in this report. As shown in Fig. 1B, the Mta22lox, Mta21lox, and Mta2 wild-type allele can be distinguished by PCR. Western blot analysis of protein extracts derived from Mta2 knockout mice confirmed the lack of Mta2 protein (Fig. 1C). Mta2 Knock-out Mice Exhibit Multiple Phenotypes Including Lupus-like Autoimmune Diseases—Inactivation of the Mta2 gene caused embryonic and perinatal lethality in about half of Mta2 null mice. Fewer than 50% of Mta2 null mice (in 129/C57/B6 mixed genetic background) survived to adulthood (Table 1). Backcross of the Mta2 null mice onto a C57/B6 background caused more severe embryonic lethality. The Mta2 knock-out embryos exhibited defects in axial skeleton, skin, and craniofacial structure with different penetrance (data not shown). The Mta2 null mice that survived postnatally exhibited smaller body size and female infertility.TABLE 1Inactivation of the Mta2 gene causes partial embryonic lethality Numbers and percentages of newborn mice with three possible Mta2 genotypes (+/+, +/–, and –/–) from Mta2+/– breeding pairs or male Mta2–/– and female Mta2+/– breeding pairs. The percentages of newborn Mta2–/– mice are significantly lower than Mendelian distribution (p < 0.01), indicating some Mta2–/– mice died at embryonic stage.Mta2 genotype+/++/––/–Mta2+/– × Mta2+/– Number5317126 Percentage21.2%68.4%10.4%Mta2–/– × Mta2+/– Number9026 Percentage77.6%22.4% Open table in a new tab Adult Mta2 mice also developed erosive skin lesions at multiple locations with high penetrance. More than 90% of the Mta2 null mice showed periorbital erosion by 1 month of age (Fig. 2, A and B). From 4 months of age, ∼75% of Mta2 null mice developed additional skin lesions in areas surrounding the mouth and nose, and about 30% of Mta2 null mice showed skin lesions in the neck region (Fig. 2A, upper panels). Histological sections of skin from the neck lesions of the Mta2 mutant mice revealed hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of epidermal cells, as well as a chronic inflammatory response (Fig. 2A, compare two lower panels). The periorbital skin from null mice also showed hyperkeratosis and inflammation. In some regions there were immature hair follicles and a reduced number of hair follicles although frank alopecia was not evident at these early stages. Often there was evidence of dermal and subcutaneous inflammation (panniculitis) and the overall changes could be characterized as a chronic spongiotic dermatitis. The similarity between the skin lesions of Mta2 null mice and those of mice with lupus-like autoimmune disease (30Kanauchi H. Furukawa F. Imamura S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Lomvardas S. Thanos D. Cell. 2002; 110: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) implies possible defects in the immune system of the Mta2 null mice. A histological examination of internal organs revealed that most Mta2 null mice developed global mesangial cell proliferation in kidney (Fig. 2B, compare upper panels) and some of them also showed a significant lymphocyte-rich chronic inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 2B, compare lower panels). These renal abnormalities are consistent with histopathological changes occurring with glomerulonephritis seen in murine lupus models. Consistent with above symptoms observed in Mta2 null kidneys, about 40% of adult Mta2 knock-out mice showed moderate (>30 mg/dL) or high (>100 mg/dL) urine protein levels (n = 20). Control mice showed only trace or negative urine protein levels. This phenotype is more severe in female null mice than in the male null mice. In addition, liver inflammation was also found in more than half of the adult Mta2 null mice. The lymphocyte infiltration was generally limited to the portal regions (Fig. 2C). Consistent with injury to hepatocytes in the Mta2 null mice, ELISA results showed that the serum alanine aminotransferase activity level is increased when compared with that of wild-type and heterozygous littermates (Fig. 2D). However, the activity levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase did not exhibit a significant difference between wild-type and Mta2 null mice (Fig. 2D). To further characterize the autoimmune disease observed in Mta2 null mice, we collected serums from mutant and control mice at different ages and examined them for the different autoantibodies. The Crithidia Luciliae assay demonstrated the presence of anti-dsDNA antibody in the Mta2 null serum (Fig. 3A). ELISA analysis showed significantly higher levels of anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-SSA, and anti-SSB antibodies (Fig. 3B). No difference in autoantibody level had been observed between Mta2 heterozygous mice and wild-type mice. Anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies are markers of human and murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies are often evident with Sjogren disease or SLE. Furthermore, Mta2 null mice are smaller than their littermates. The extent of difference depends on mouse development stages. From perinatal to weaning stage, Mta2 null mice are about half to 2/3 size of the heterozygous or wild-type littermates. When they reach mature age (after 2 months old), both male and female null mice are about 75% of the size of their wild-type littermates (Fig. 3C). Mta2 null mice also have shortened lifespans when compared with their wild-type or heterozygous littermates (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, female knock-out mice exhibit a shorter lifespan than male knock-out mice. Given that 90% of SLE patients are female (32Whitacre C.C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), and some lupus mouse models have shown more severe phenotype in females than in males (33Roubinian J.R. Talal N. Greenspan J.S.

Immunity. 2002; 16: 499-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), it is very likely that autoimmune-related symptoms are important factors causing early death in Mta2 null mice. However, our results do not exclude other factors in causing premature death. In summary, our observations strongly suggest that Mta2 null mice develop an autoimmune disease that resembles systemic lupus erythematosus in human. Bone Marrow Transplantation Recipient Mice Partially Recapitulate the Autoimmune Phenotypes— To test if the autoimmune phenotypes observed in the Mta2 null mice is caused by bone marrow derived from Mta2 null cells; we transferred Mta2 null bone marrow progenitor cells into SCID mice and monitored hematopoietic reconstitution over time. No significant defects were observed in lymphoid and myeloid reconstitution with Mta2 mutant progenitor cells (data not shown). However, recipient mice transplanted with Mta2 null hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell developed skin lesions and reduced body weight (Fig. 4, A and B), similar to Mta2 null mice. When mice were analyzed 8–12 weeks post bone marrow transplantation, normal T cells were present in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs (Fig. 4C). However, these Mta2 null T cells were hyperproliferative when stimulated with T cell mitogens (Fig. 4D). The phenotypes are, however, less severe compared with Mta2 null mice, and no obvious liver inflammation or glomerulonephritis was detected in the transplanted mice. No increased level of autoantibodies was observed either (data not shown). These results indicate that hematopoietic cells derived from Mta2 null bone marrow stem cells contribute to but are not sufficient to cause the autoimmune diseases. Therefore, nonhematopoietic cells must have also contributed to the autoimmune phenotypes of Mta2 null mice. T Cell Hyperproliferation in Mta2 Null Mice—The autoimmun"

Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of Ras-related small G-proteins, plays key roles in the regulation of cell shape, motility, and growth. Here we describe the high resolution x-ray crystal structure for Cdc42 bound to the GTP analog guanylyl β,γ-methylene-diphosphonate (GMP-PCP) (i.e. the presumed signaling-active state) and show that it is virtually identical to the structures for the signaling-inactive, GDP-bound form of the protein, contrary to what has been reported for Ras and other G-proteins. Especially surprising was that the GMP-PCP- and GDP-bound forms of Cdc42 did not show detectable differences in their Switch I and Switch II loops. Fluorescence studies using a Cdc42 mutant in which a tryptophan residue was introduced at position 32 of Switch I also showed that there was little difference in the Switch I conformation between the GDP- and GMP-PCP-bound states (i.e. <10%), which again differed from Ras where much larger changes in Trp-32 fluorescence were observed when comparing these two nucleotide-bound states (>30%). However, the binding of an effector protein induced significant changes in the Trp-32 emission specifically from GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42, as well as in the phosphate resonances for GTP bound to this G-protein as indicated in NMR studies. An examination of the available structures for Cdc42 complexed to different effector proteins, versus the x-ray crystal structure for GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42, provides a possible explanation for how effectors can distinguish between the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of this G-protein and ensure that the necessary conformational changes for signal propagation occur.

Cdc42 is a member of the Rho family of Ras-related small G-proteins and is an essential protein found in all eukaryotic organisms, including yeast, flies, and mammals (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar), Cdc42 undergoes a GTP-binding/GTP-hydrolytic cycle that enables it to act as a molecular switch in cells. It is activated to undergo GDP-GTP exchange by members of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (5Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 6Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

GTP-bound Cdc42 can bind and/or activate over 20 downstream effector proteins that are responsible for mediating a diversity of cellular functions, including actin cytoskeletal remodeling, cell polarity, intracellular trafficking, epidermal growth factor receptor degradation, and cell cycle progression (1Johnson D.I.

These different signals are terminated when Cdc42 is deactivated through its ability to hydrolyze GTP, a reaction that is catalyzed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 2The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GMP-PCP, guanylyl β,γ-methylenediphosphonate; GMP-PNP, guanosine-5′-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; PBD, p21-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding; Pak, p21-activated kinase.

Structural studies of a number of GTP-binding proteins, beginning with the bacterial elongation factor Ef-Tu, and including H-Ras and the α subunits of various members of the family of large G-proteins, have shown that a conserved architecture exists for GTP binding and hydrolytic activity, comprising five α-helices and six β-strands (10Jurnak F. Science. 1985; 230: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 11de Vos A.M. Tong L. Milburn M.V. Matias P.M. Jancarik J. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Kim S.H.

Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Moreover, comparisons of the x-ray crystal structures for many of these proteins bound to GDP and GTP analogs highlighted two regions called Switch I and Switch II that change their conformation upon GDP-GTP exchange. In the case of H-Ras and related small G-proteins, Switch I encompasses residues 30-38 within the α1-β2 loop, whereas Switch II is made up of residues 60-76 within β3-α2 (12Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 15Milburn M.V. Tong L. deVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). It has been commonly assumed that changes in these Switch regions represent the underlying basis for GTP-dependent signal propagation, and indeed Switch I has been shown to be a principal site used by Ras and related small G-proteins, including Cdc42, to engage their downstream effectors. Given the shared architecture between Ras, Cdc42, and other Rho family small G-proteins, there was every reason to expect that Cdc42 would exhibit the same types of GTP-dependent changes in Switch I and II, as originally described for H-Ras. However, surprisingly, we found that this was not the case. The high resolution x-ray crystal structure for Cdc42 complexed to the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GMP-PCP was virtually identical to that for Cdc42 bound to GDP, despite the fact that only GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42 and not its GDP-bound counterpart was able to productively engage effector proteins. Likewise, we found that Cdc42 molecules containing a tryptophan residue inserted into position 32 of Switch I, in place of the normal tyrosine residue, showed little or no change in their tryptophan fluorescence, when comparing the GMP-PCP- and GDP-bound forms of the protein. These results again differed from those obtained with the corresponding Switch I mutant of H-Ras, which showed significant changes in the fluorescence of the Switch I tryptophan residue when comparing the GDP- and GMP-PCP-bound states. Thus taken together, these findings raised the question as to how effector proteins are able to selectively recognize the GTP analog-bound form of Cdc42, and whether effectors might be capable of inducing and/or stabilizing specific conformational transitions within a Cdc42 species that appears to start off predominantly in a signaling-inactive conformation. Here we show that despite the GDP- and GMP-PCP-bound forms of Cdc42 sharing a similar Switch I conformational state, the tryptophan fluorescence of the GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42(Y32W) mutant undergoes a specific and significant change upon the binding of an effector protein. NMR experiments also showed that effector proteins were able to specifically promote conformational changes within Cdc42 molecules bound to GTP analogs. When this structure-function information is considered together with the structures for Cdc42 complexed to effectors that either use the conventional Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB) domain, such as is the case for p21-activated kinase (Pak) (16Morreale A. Venkatesan M. Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Laue E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), or a nonconventional Cdc42/Rac-binding domain, as occurs with Par6 (for Partitioning-defective protein-6) (17Garrard S.M. Capaldo C.T. Gao L. Rosen M.K. Macara I.G. Tomchick D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it becomes apparent how effector proteins help to ensure that Cdc42 undergoes the necessary conformational changes for signal propagation. Overall, our findings support the idea that there is a spectrum of possibilities regarding the conformational states that G-proteins can assume following the exchange of GDP for GTP (or GTP analogs), i.e. what is commonly referred to as the G-protein activation event. One end of the spectrum represents cases like Cdc42 where, in the absence of an effector protein, the majority of the population of the GTP-bound (or GTP analog-bound) G-protein exists in conformational states that are minimally changed from those for the GDP-bound form of the protein. Thus, Cdc42 relies heavily upon effector proteins to induce the correct conformational changes to enable signal propagation to occur. At the other end of the spectrum are the Gα subunits of heterotrimeric (large) G-proteins and small G-proteins like H-Ras where, upon GDP-GTP exchange, the majority of the G-protein population assumes conformational states that clearly differ from the GDP-bound protein and more closely approximate the signaling-active conformational states that are formed upon the binding of effectors. Protein Purification—Escherichia coli cells expressing pET15b-his-Cdc42, pGEX-KG-Cdc42(Y32W,W97H), pGEX-KG-PBD(W98F), and pGEX-KG-PBD were grown at 37 °C until an OD of 0.8. Induction was initiated by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), and the cells were allowed to grow for another 3 h. Cells were pelleted at 6000 × g for 10 min and frozen at -80 °C. Cell pellets were homogenized in HMA buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NaN3) and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was saved. Supernatants containing His6-tagged Cdc42 were incubated briefly with chelating-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+ and equilibrated with HMA. Beads were washed with HMA plus 20 mm imidazole before elution with HMA plus 200 mm imidazole. GST-tagged proteins were incubated with glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with HMA for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed with HMA containing 500 mm NaCl and again with HMA. Protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in HMA. The His-tagged proteins were incubated with thrombin (Hematological Technologies Inc.) at 4 °C for 3-4 h. Clipped proteins were further purified by chromatography on a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences), and protein fractions were pooled. Nucleotide Loading—Mutant and wild-type Cdc42 concentrations were measured using Bradford reagent (Pierce). Nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs were added to an ∼5-fold excess relative to the protein concentration. Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 200 mm along with 100 units of alkaline phosphatase-bound acrylic beads (Sigma P0927). After a 4-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed with HMA, and the flow-through was collected. The buffer was exchanged on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with HMA. Nucleotide content was confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, using a previously published protocol (18Majumdar S. Ramachandran S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GST-Cdc42 Pulldown Assays—Equal amounts of glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) were saturated with GST-Cdc42 bound to GMP-PCP, GMP-PNP, GTPγS, or GDP. After incubation for 1 h at 4°C, the beads were washed three times with HMA, and an equivalent amount of the limit Cdc42/Rac-binding domain from Pak3 (PBD) was added to a 10-fold molar excess of Cdc42. Beads were washed three times with HMA after a 3-h incubation at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each assay were boiled and loaded on a 4-20% gradient gel (Invitrogen). X-ray Crystallography—Cdc42-GMP-PCP (80 mg/ml) crystals were grown in 12% PEG 6K, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium acetate, and 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, at 18 °C. Data were collected at the Cornell MacCHESS beamline A1 using an ADSC Quantumn-210 CCD Detector. Data processing was performed using Mosfilm, and initial phases were solved by molecular replacement using MolRep from the CCP4 suite (19Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The model structure used to find the initial phases was Cdc42-GDP (PDB ID 1AN0) without nucleotide. Structure refinement was completed using CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and validated with Procheck (21Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). 31P NMR—Samples were prepared by dissolving wild-type Cdc42 (1 mm) or the Cdc42(T35A) mutant pre-exchanged with GMP-PNP or GMP-PCP, either with or without the PBD (1 mm), in HMA containing 10% D2O. 31P spectra were obtained at 5 °C on a Varian INOVA spectrometer operating at 202.37 MHz using a 5-mm Varian DBG probe head. 1H broadband decoupling was applied throughout the acquisition. A relaxation delay of 8 s was used between scans, with 3000-4000 scans summed prior to analysis. Data were zero-filled to 128K points, and an exponential multiplication (5-10 Hz) was performed prior to Fourier transform. Spectra were referenced externally to 85% phosphoric acid (0 ppm). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All experiments were performed on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter. Excitation and emission slit widths were ±5 and ±10 nm, respectively. Cdc42 and H-Ras emission scan experiments were performed in HMA at 30 °C, using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm in HMA. Excitation and emission wavelengths for the binding assays of Cdc42(Y32W,W97H) with PBD(W98F) were 295 and 353 nm, respectively. The X-ray Crystal Structure for GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42—The original x-ray crystal structures for the signaling-active (GTP-bound) form of H-Ras were obtained using the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs GMP-PNP and GMP-PCP (11de Vos A.M. Tong L. Milburn M.V. Matias P.M. Jancarik J. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Miura K. Ohtsuka E. Kim S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 888-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 12Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), because GTP as well as GTPγS are hydrolyzed during the crystallization procedure. As is the case for Ras, these two nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs enable Cdc42 to interact with its downstream effector proteins. Fig. 1 presents some examples that show the selective ability of GST-Cdc42, when bound to different GTP analogs, to pull down the Cdc42/Rac-binding domains from Pak3 (i.e. the PBD), whereas the GDP-bound form of GST-Cdc42 was unable to bind to the effector. We therefore used the Cdc42-GMP-PCP complex for high resolution structural analysis of the signaling-active form of this G-protein. Fig. 2A shows the ribbon diagram for the x-ray crystal structure for GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42 solved to 2.4 Å resolution (see Table 1 for statistics on data collection and refinement). The structure conforms to an α/β fold consisting of six β-strands, six α-helices, and one 310 helix, and in general displays an architecture that is characteristic of other small G-proteins. Stabilization of the GMP-PCP molecule inside the nucleotide-binding pocket is achieved through hydrogen bonds between the guanine ring and surrounding residues, π-π stacking interactions with Phe-28, and hydrogen bonds with the phosphate oxygen atoms. Fig. 2B shows a representative electron density for a portion of the GMP-PCP-binding site.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for Cdc42-GMPPCPSpace groupP41212Unit cell (Å)98.5, 98.5, 102.4Resolution (Å)2.4Average redundancy (highest resolution)4.1 (2.8)I/σI6.8 (2)RsymaRsym = ∑hkl ∑i[Ii(hkl) - <I(hkl)>]/∑hkl∑i (hkl).

Open table in a new tab There are two molecules of GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42 within the asymmetric unit. Crystal contacts involving Switch I from chain A help to stabilize the loop, specifically at residues Tyr-32 and Phe-37. A cleft is formed by Met-1, Pro-50, and Met-45 in a symmetry-related molecule which provides a hydrophobic interface for the phenyl group of Tyr-32 in Switch I. The formation of a hydrogen bond between Tyr-32 and Thr-35 from chain A helps to prevent Thr-35 from coordinating the Mg2+ (also see below), whereas Phe-37 is stabilized by π-π interactions with Tyr-64 from a symmetry-related molecule. The individual temperature factors for residues within Switch I are higher than those found in adjacent areas of the protein where secondary structure stabilizes the residues. Moreover, the temperature factors for Switch I residues in chain B are higher than those for the corresponding residues in chain A. This is probably because of the fact that Phe-37 in chain B does not undergo π-π interactions with a symmetry-related molecule.

Thus, it has been generally assumed that changes occurring in Switch I and Switch II underlie the molecular switch function of both small and large G-proteins, enabling them to selectively engage their downstream signaling effector proteins. However, the x-ray crystal structure for the GMP-PCP-bound form of Cdc42 was immediately intriguing because when it was compared with signaling-inactive forms of Cdc42, these structural differences were not evident. The overall topology of the Cdc42-GMP-PCP complex, and its Switch I and II conformations in particular, were virtually identical to both the x-ray crystal structure that we had earlier solved for the GDP-bound form of Cdc42 (PDB ID 1AN0), as well as the reported structure for a signaling-inactive Cdc42(G12V)-GDP complex (22Rudolph M.G. Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C compares the Cdc42-GMP-PCP and Cdc42(G12V)-GDP complexes. A structural alignment of all the C-α atoms between these two complexes yielded an r.m.s.d. of ∼0.75 Å. The coordination of the Mg2+ ion is also virtually identical in the structures for the signaling-inactive GDP-bound form of Cdc42 versus the Cdc42-GMP-PCP complex (Fig. 2, D and E, respectively). It is interesting that in GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42, Thr-35 does not participate in Mg2+ coordination, given that it has been suggested to be critical for the structural change imparted by GTP analogs within the Switch I loop of H-Ras (23Geyer M. Schweins T. Herrmann C. Prisner T. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10308-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 24Spoerner M. Nuehs A. Ganser P. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2225-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Specifically, Thr-35 appears to interact with the γ-phosphate of GTP in Ras with this interaction being lost upon GTP hydrolysis and thereby possibly accounting for the observed change in the orientation of Switch I. In the structure for the Cdc42-GMP-PCP complex, Thr-35 is not in position to coordinate the Mg2+ ion; however, a water molecule is visible and substitutes for the hydroxyl group of the threonine residue. The same is true for the structure for the GDP-bound form of Cdc42, as well as for the Cdc42(G12V)-GDP complex (22Rudolph M.G. Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 778-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The Cdc42-GMP-PCP complex crystallized in the same space group and unit cell dimensions as the Cdc42(G12V)-GDP complex. As a result, both the GDP- and GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42 structures share similar crystal contacts that help to stabilize Switch I. Many of these crystal contacts are absent in the second Cdc42-GMP-PCP molecule that is present within the asymmetric unit for the GTP analog-bound form of the G-protein. Although the electron density for Switch I from the second Cdc42 molecule shares a similar backbone conformation with Switch I from the first Cdc42 molecule within the asymmetric unit, it possesses elevated B factors. This leads us to suspect that Switch I is probably highly mobile in both the GDP- and GMP-PCP-bound forms of Cdc42, an idea supported by NMR findings (25Feltham J.L. Dötsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Loh A.P. Guo W. Nicholson L.K. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12547-12557Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, crystal contacts have probably enabled us to view one conformational state from possibly a number of states that may be shared by these two nucleotide-bound forms of Cdc42. Fluorescence Studies of GDP-bound Versus GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42—We have taken advantage of the sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy to further examine the Switch I conformations for the GDP- and GMP-PCP-bound forms of Cdc42. The basic strategy was to first eliminate any background tryptophan fluorescence from Cdc42 by changing the tryptophan at position 97 to a histidine, and then to introduce a tryptophan residue at position 32 of Switch I, in place of the usual tyrosine residue. The expectation was that the Trp-32 residue would serve as a conformational probe for Switch I in Cdc42. This approach has been successfully used with H-Ras to detect conformational changes within Switch I upon GDP-GTP exchange (although in the case of H-Ras there are no tryptophan residues in the wild-type protein and so only the single substitution at position 32 was necessary) (27Resland H. John J. Linke R. Simon I. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Indeed, Fig. 3A shows that there is a significant difference in the intrinsic fluorescence measured for the H-Ras(Y32W) mutant when comparing its GDP- and GMP-PCP-bound states, such that the binding of the GTP analog results in an ∼30% quenching in the Trp-32 fluorescence. On the other hand, the differences in the intrinsic fluorescence for the corresponding forms of the Cdc42(Y32W,W97H) mutant were much more subtle with GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42 showing at most a 5-10% decrease in Trp-97 fluorescence compared with its signaling-inactive, GDP-bound counterpart (Fig. 3B). Thus, these findings corroborated the results from x-ray crystal studies that showed the differences between the GDP- and GTP analog-bound forms of Ras were much more pronounced than the differences for the corresponding forms of Cdc42. Nonetheless, effector proteins are still able to distinguish between the GDP- and GMP-PCP-bound forms of Cdc42, as we observed a significant change in the fluorescence of the GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42(Y32W,W97H) protein (Fig. 4A), but not in the GDP-bound form of the protein (Fig. 4B), upon the addition of a recombinant form of the PBD in which its sole tryptophan residue was changed to a phenylalanine (PBD(W98F)). Successive additions of PBD(W98F) resulted in a dose-dependent quenching of the fluorescence from GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42(Y32W, W97H) that saturated at about 20% (Fig. 4C). Identical experiments were carried out with GMP-PNP-bound Cdc42(Y32W, W97H) with similar results (not shown). The NMR structure for GMP-PNP-bound Cdc42(Q61L) complexed to the CRIB domain of Pak1 shows that the nearest effector residue to position 32 in Switch I is ∼12 Å away (16Morreale A. Venkatesan M. Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Laue E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The same is true when examining the coordinates from the recently determined x-ray structure for Cdc42-GMP-PCP bound to its limit-binding domain on Pak6 (PDB ID 2ODB). Thus, the fluorescence changes seen upon the addition of the PBD construct are likely a direct reflection of effector-induced conformational changes that are specific for the GTP analog-bound forms of Cdc42.FIGURE 4Effector-induced changes in the Switch I conformation of GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42.A, addition of the limit Cdc42/Rac-binding domain of Pak3 (PBD) (1 μm) to GMP-PCP-bound Cdc42(Y32W,W97H) (1 μm) causes a quenching of Trp-32 fluorescence.

It was not clear whether genes in these ""oncogenic signatures"" would show coordinate expression patterns in human prostate tumors, particularly as most of the signatures were derived from cell types other than prostate.The above oncogenic pathway signatures were examined in four different gene expression profile datasets of human prostate tumors (representing approximately 250 patients in all), using both Q1-Q2 and one-sided Fisher's exact enrichment analysis methods. A significant fraction (approximately 5%) of genes up-regulated experimentally by Myc, c-Src, HER2, Akt, or androgen were co-expressed in human tumors with the oncogene or biomarker corresponding to the pathway signature. Genes down-regulated experimentally, however, did not show anticipated patterns of anti-enrichment in the human tumors.Significant subsets of the genes in these experimentally-derived oncogenic signatures are relevant to the study of human prostate cancer. Both molecular biologists and clinical researchers could focus attention on the relatively small number of genes identified here as having coordinate patterns that arise from both the experimental system and the human disease system."

Accordingly, we used an erythropoietin (EPO) receptor chimeric receptor system in which IL-2-dependent HT-2 T cells expressed a mutant EPO-IL-2Rβ construct where Tyr-338 is mutated to Phe.

Microarray analyses revealed differential regulation of numerous genes compared with cells expressing a wild-type IL-2Rβ, including up-regulation of the IL-17 receptor subunit IL-17RA.

Cytokine receptors exhibit remarkable redundancy in their signaling cascades, in part because of widespread sharing of receptor subunits (1Ozaki K. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29355-29358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, individual cytokines are generally found to have unique, non-redundant activities in vivo, despite considerable overlap in signaling cascades. A striking case in point is interleukin (IL) 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; EPO, erythropoietin; PH, pleckstrin homology; Th, T helper; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Abs, antibodies; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PI, propidium iodide. 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; EPO, erythropoietin; PH, pleckstrin homology; Th, T helper; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Abs, antibodies; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PI, propidium iodide.-2 and IL-15, members of the “γc-superfamily” of cytokines. IL-2 and IL-15 use identical receptor subunits, IL-2Rβ and the common γ (γc) chain, to mediate downstream signals. Both receptor complexes also contain unique affinity-modulating subunits, IL-2Rα and IL-15Rα, which mediate high affinity ligand binding. However, the “private” α subunits have very short cytoplasmic domains and are generally not thought to contribute directly to signal transduction (reviewed in Refs. 2Ma A. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 102-104Google Scholar, 3Waldmann T. Nat. Rev. 2006; 6: 595-601Google Scholar). Despite sharing signaling subunits, IL-2 and IL-15 mediate distinct events in vivo. Differential expression of their respective private subunits causes NK cells and CD8+ memory cells to be more sensitive to IL-15, whereas newly activated CD4+ T cells and Treg cells express high levels of CD25/IL-2Rα and thus are regulated by IL-2. Moreover, IL-2 and IL-15 exert opposing effects on survival and expansion of the T cell memory population (3Waldmann T. Nat. Rev. 2006; 6: 595-601Google Scholar). Because they share IL-2Rβ and γc, IL-2 and IL-15 have long been presumed to trigger the same signaling pathways in target cells, which may then be interpreted differently depending on cell type. IL-2 and IL-15 activate the Janus (JAK) kinases-1 and -3 leading to activation of the STAT-5 transcription factor (3Waldmann T. Nat. Rev. 2006; 6: 595-601Google Scholar, 4Johnston J.A. Kawamura M.

This event leads to formation of a high affinity IL-2 receptor and preferential expansion of antigen-specific naïve T cells. The PI3K pathway is activated via the Shc adaptor binding to a single tyrosine within IL-12Rβ, leading to recruitment and phosphorylation of the regulatory subunits of PI3K, p85α/β (15Lord J.D. McIntosh B.C. Greenberg P.D. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4627-4633PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K leads to phosphorylation of the membrane lipid PIP2 converting it to PIP3, and subsequent recruitment of pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing kinases such as PDK1 and Akt/PKB. Akt in turn phosphorylates a number of downstream targets that cumulatively serve to promote cell survival, including GSK3α/β, FOXO proteins, and Bad (reviewed in Ref. 16Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4650) Google Scholar). The PI3K pathway is also upstream of mTOR and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), rapamycin-sensitive signaling molecules that contribute to IL-2-mediated growth signaling (8Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L.

Therefore, the JAK-STAT-5 and PI3K pathways mediate distinct signaling events, and are critical components of the IL-2 and IL-15 signaling pathways. IL-2 is produced primarily by newly activated CD4+ T cells, although CD8+ T cells and B cells are also sources of IL-2 (11Gaffen S.L. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently, a paradigm shift in how T cells produce cytokines occurred with the discovery of a new subset of CD4+ T helper (Th) cells distinct from Th1 and Th2, termed Th17. Differentiation and expansion of these cells is driven by TGFβ, IL-6, and IL-23. As the name implies, these cells produce IL-17 as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-17F and IL-22. Interestingly, Th17 cells differentiate in opposition to Treg cells, in part because development of Th17 cells requires TGFβ and IL-6, whereas TGFβ without IL-6 promotes Treg development (reviewed in Refs. 18Weaver C.T. Harrington L.E. Mangan P.R. Gavrieli M. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 2006; 24: 677-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 19Cua D.J. Kastelein R.A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly clear that the Th17 population plays a major role in driving autoimmunity, and efforts to block IL-17 or its receptor are under serious consideration for anti-cytokine therapy (20Kikly K. Liu L. Na S. Sedgwick J.D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 21Afzali B. Lombardi G. Lechler R. Lord G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2007; 148: 32-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many γc cytokines regulate the IL-17/IL-17 receptor system. For example, IL-4 derived from Th2 cells inhibits Th17 development (22Dong C. Nat. Rev. 2006; 6: 329-333Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and IL-2 activation of STAT-5 appears to inhibit Th17 differentiation in favor of Treg expansion, although this is still somewhat controversial (23Laurence A.

Conversely, IL-21 up-regulates the IL-17 receptor (25Zeng R. Spolski R. Finkelstein S.E. Oh S. Kovanen P.E. Hinrichs C.S. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M.F. Brady J.N. Restifo N.P. Berzofsky J.A.

However, the connections between γc cytokines and the IL-17 family remain poorly understood. IL-17 binds to a specific receptor on target cells composed of IL-17RA and IL-17RC, and IL-17 activates a pro-inflammatory signaling cascade leading to expression of chemokines, cytokines and other inflammatory effector molecules (30Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.-M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 31Gaffen S.L. Kramer J.M. Yu J.J. Shen F. Vitam. Horm. 2006; 74: 255-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the IL-17 receptor is ubiquitously expressed, its function has mainly been evaluated on non-immune cells, particularly epithelial cells and fibroblasts. The role of IL-17 in lymphocytes is unknown, and almost nothing is known about how the IL-17 receptor is regulated. The initial goal of the present study was to define specific molecular events mediated by the IL-2R-mediated PI3K pathway in T cells. Microarray analyses revealed that activation of a mutant IL-2 receptor that cannot activate PI3K leads to the up-regulation of numerous immune genes, including IL-17RA. Moreover, IL-15 and IL-21 induce IL-17RA preferentially compared with IL-2, and IL-17RA expression is limited by the PI3K pathway. Consistent with this finding, IL-2 but not IL-15 mediates prolonged activation of the PI3K p85 regulatory subunit. Further studies revealed that signaling by PI3K through Akt but not p70S6K leads to up-regulation of IL-17RA. Thus, there are intrinsic signaling differences between IL-2 and IL-15 that can be attributed to differences in molecular activation of the PI3K pathway. Cell Culture, Cell Lines, and Cytokine Stimulations—HT-2, Jurkat, A20, and primary cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Woodland, CA), 2 mm glutamine, 0.05 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 nm recombinant human IL-2 (provided by the Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA). HT-2.EPOβγ, HT-2.EPOβ5Y/γ, and HT-2.EPOβ1Y/γ cells were maintained in this medium with human EPO (a kind gift of Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) in place of IL-2. ST2 cells were maintained in α-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HT-2 cells were transfected by electroporation (32Lindemann M.J. Benczik M. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol.

For stimulations, HT-2 cells were starved in phosphate-buffered saline, stripped with 10 mm sodium citrate/140 nm NaCl, and incubated in RPMI 1640/1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 2-4 h. Stimulations used IL-2 (5 nm), IL-15 (50 nm), IL-21 (50 nm), IL-17 (100 ng/ml), TNFα (2 ng/ml), or EPO (50 units/ml) unless otherwise indicated. Other cytokines were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) or Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Primary CD8+ T cells were obtained from mouse spleen with a CD8+ T Cell Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). All animal protocols were approved by the University at Buffalo IACUC. Microarray Analysis—To generate expression summary values from Affymetrix GeneChips, MAS5.0 software in the “Affy” package of Bioconductor in the R statistical computing environment was used with its default settings, followed by global normalization to bring the median expression values of all four GeneChips to the same scale. This was done by selecting a baseline GeneChip from the dataset and scaling each GeneChip to the median of the baseline GeneChip (m̃) as in Equation 1. xi′=m~basem~ixi For data quality control, MAS5.0 “present calls” was used to filter out probe sets whose expression intensities were close to background noise across the majority of samples before performing differential gene analysis. Filtering of 2 “present calls” was applied to either the EPOβ5Y/γ or EPOβγ group, which led to ∼47% data reduction for the comparisons. Further filtering was performed to reduce variance between replicates of the same condition by first ranking those selected probe sets based on their intensity for each of the 4 GeneChips, followed by filtering out those probe sets with 10% rank order differences for replicated GeneChips in the same group. This led to another ∼1% data reduction. Regularized Student's t test was employed to detect gene expression values significantly different between groups. For multiple test correction, the false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated using SAM, and was 0 for all data sets (33Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IL-17RA staining was performed with rat anti-mouse IL-17RA M751 mAbs (kindly provided by Amgen, Seattle WA) as described (36Shen F. Hu Z. Goswami J. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol.

Genes Regulated by the IL-2-induced PI3K Pathway—IL-2 induces multiple signaling events in T cells, the best studied of which are the JAK1/3-STAT-5 and PI3K pathways (37Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Cur. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). While many of the downstream targets of these pathways have been defined, these pathways also exert overlapping functions in terms of cellular survival and growth signaling (11Gaffen S.L. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to delineate STAT-5-independent functions for the IL-2-induced PI3K pathway in T cells. All known IL-2-dependent signaling events proceed from tyrosine residues located within the IL-2Rβ andγc subunits (11Gaffen S.L. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 32Lindemann M.J. Benczik M. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10239-10249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have extensively examined the mechanisms by which the IL-2R complex initiates these pathways using a chimeric receptor system, in which the extracellular domains of IL-2Rβ and γc have been replaced with the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor and expressed stably in IL-2-dependent HT-2 T cells. In this system, treating cells with EPO faithfully recapitulates IL-2-dependent signaling (7Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol.

Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21729-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Former studies demonstrated that activation of STAT-5 occurs independently through three Tyr residues within IL-2Rβ (Tyr-338, Tyr-392, and Tyr-510, also termed “1Y,” “5Y,” and “6Y,” Fig. 1A) (9Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21381-21390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Friedmann M.C. Migone T.-S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, activation of PI3K occurs only through Tyr-338 (1Y) via the Shc adaptor protein (Fig. 1B and Ref. 39Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 309-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these chimeric receptors demonstrated that the PI3K pathway is not required for proliferative signaling, as HT-2.EPOβ5Y/γ or HT-2.EPOβ6Y/γ cells can be maintained indefinitely in EPO and show similar growth kinetics to a wild-type receptor (9Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21381-21390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To define genes regulated by the PI3K pathway that are not required for proliferation, we compared gene expression in HT-2 cells expressing the EPOβγ (wild-type) chimera to the EPOβ5Y/γ chimera and cultured in EPO, using replicate Affymetrix Mouse Expression Array 430A GeneChips. There was a high replicate correlation between chips (r = 0.98, data not shown). 883 genes were differentially regulated with p values <0.05 (data not shown), and 222 genes were differentially regulated with p values <0.01 (Fig. 1, C and D and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). As expected, many genes were up-regulated in HT-2.EPOβγ cells compared with HT-2.EPOβ5Y/γ cells, indicating that these are direct or indirect targets of the PI3K pathway. The most strongly enhanced of these genes (∼100-fold) was that encoding the E1A enhancer-binding protein (E1AF), an ets oncogene transcription factor involved in Ewings sarcoma (supplemental Table S1) (40Shindoh M. Higashino F. Kohgo T. Cancer Lett. 2004; 216: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, many genes were up-regulated in HT-2.EPOβ5Y/γ cells, suggesting that signals mediated by IL-2RβY338 inhibit expression of certain genes. The strongest of these (32-fold) was the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 17 (supplemental Table S2), which is thought to play an immunoregulatory role during pregnancy (41Ha C. Waterhouse R. Wessells J. Wu J. Dveksler G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 77: 948-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, genes involved in known IL-2-mediated signaling pathways were differentially regulated, including STAT-5A, Bcl-x, and FK506-binding proteins. In addition, T cell receptor (TCR)-associated signaling genes were differentially regulated, including TCRα, Lck-interacting transmembrane protein 1 (LIME-1), PKCθ, Bcl-10, and Cot-2 (Fig. 1D) (42Wang D. Matsumoto R. You Y. Che T. Lin X. Gaffen S. Lin X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 43Hur E.M. Son M. Lee O.H. Choi Y.B. Park C. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Of particular interest to us was the enhancement of the gene encoding IL-17RA, the receptor for IL-17, in HT-2.EPOβ5Y/γ cells (Fig. 1D). Although IL-17RA is expressed ubiquitously (30Yao Z. Fanslow W.C. Seldin M.F. Rousseau A.-M. Painter S.L. Comeau M.R. Cohen J.I. Spriggs M.K. Immunity. 1995; 3: 811-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), its surface expression varies widely (36Shen F. Hu Z. Goswami J. Gaffen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24138-24148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and nothing is known about mechanisms of IL-17RA gene regulation. By flow cytometry, HT-2 cells express quite high baseline levels of IL-17RA when cultured in IL-2 (Fig. 1E). Normal CD8+ and CD4+ T cells also express IL-17RA (data not shown, Ref. 25Zeng R. Spolski R. Finkelstein S.E. Oh S. Kovanen P.E. Hinrichs C.S. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M.F. Brady J.N. Restifo N.P. Berzofsky J.A. Leonard W.J. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). HT-2.EPOβγ and HT-2.EPOβ1Y/γ cells expressed similar levels of IL-17RA whether grown in EPO or IL-2 (Fig. 1E). However, HT-2.EPOβ5Y/γ cells expressed a higher level of IL-17RA when cultured in EPO compared with IL-2, consistent with the microarray results. Moreover, IL-17RA expression was suppressed when EPOβ5Y/γ cells were co-cultured with EPO and IL-2 together, suggesting that the PI3K pathway (in this case, activated through the endogenous IL-2R) inhibits IL-17RA expression (Fig. 1E). IL-17RA Is Induced by IL-15 and IL-21 and Is Inhibited by IL-2—In a published microarray screen of CD8+ T cell genes, the γc cytokine IL-21 was reported to up-regulate IL-17RA mRNA, which was the first suggestion that IL-17RA is subject to immune regulation (25Zeng R. Spolski R. Finkelstein S.E. Oh S. Kovanen P.E. Hinrichs C.S. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M.F. Brady J.N. Restifo N.P. Berzofsky J.A. Leonard W.J. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined IL-17RA regulation by γc cytokines in HT-2 cells. Indeed, both IL-21 and IL-15 up-regulated IL-17RA compared with IL-2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, IL-2 dominantly suppressed the effects of either IL-15 or IL-21, at the level of both surface expression and mRNA (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2IL-17RA is induced by IL-15 and IL-21 but not by IL-2.

Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 102-104Google Scholar). However, a recent study suggested that IL-2 and IL-15 differ in the ability to activate the PI3K pathway, at least with respect to p70S6K activation (44Cornish G.H. Sinclair L.V. Cantrell D.A.

Our findings indicate that the modification of tryptophan to kynurenine and its involvement in copper binding is an innate property of M. capsulatus MopE*. Copper is an essential nutrient for all living organisms, and molecular systems have been developed by all cells to maintain adequate supplies of copper. Copper-containing proteins play a key role in cellular respiration and are involved in biological processes such as pigment formation, neurotransmitter synthesis, and antioxidant defense. Recently, they have received increasing attention due to their role in human pathogenesis, in particular in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and prion diseases (1Gaggelli E. Kozlowski H. Valensin D. Valensin G. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1995-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar).In Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and other methane-oxidizing bacteria, copper is important for both regulation and catalytic activity of the particulate methane-monooxygenase (2Hakemian A.S. Rosenzweig A.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). An equivalent of this enzyme is used by almost all methanotrophs to catalyze the oxidation of methane to methanol, the initial and obligate step for all carbon fixation and energy production in these bacteria. A subset of methanotrophs, including M. capsulatus, produces a second soluble monooxygenase. Soluble monooxygenase does not require copper for activity and is produced only when the level of copper in the growth medium is very low (3Choi D.W. Kunz R.C. Boyd E.S. Semrau J.D. Antholine W.E. Han J.I. Zahn J.A. Boyd J.M. de la Mora A.M. DiSpirito A.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 4Murrell J.C. McDonald I.R. Gilbert B. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The particulate methane-monooxygenase is the most growth effective of the monooxygenases, and hence, copper is required at relatively high levels for methanotrophs to grow optimally (3Choi D.W. Kunz R.C. Boyd E.S. Semrau J.D. Antholine W.E. Han J.I. Zahn J.A. Boyd J.M. de la Mora A.M. DiSpirito A.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Copper is most likely actively accumulated from the growth medium (3Choi D.W. Kunz R.C. Boyd E.S. Semrau J.D. Antholine W.E. Han J.I. Zahn J.A. Boyd J.M. de la Mora A.M. DiSpirito A.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and thus, the copper-homeostatic activity of methanotrophs differs from that of other prokaryotes in which systems handling extracellular copper is mainly involved in detoxification and elimination (5Rensing C. Grass G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar).Both methanobactin and the MopE protein have been postulated to have a role in copper uptake in M. capsulatus (6Karlsen O.A. Berven F.S. Stafford G.P. Larsen O. Murrell J.C. Jensen H.B. Fjellbirkeland A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 2386-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Kim H.J. Graham D.W.

Methanobactin is a small, siderophore-like compound that binds a single copper ion with high affinity (7Kim H.J. Graham D.W. DiSpirito A.A. Alterman M.A. Galeva N. Larive C.K. Asunskis D. Sherwood P.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). When copper is present in the growth medium, methanobactin is mainly associated with the membranes, possibly in direct association with the particulate methane-monooxygenase, whereas at copper-limited growth conditions, methanobactin accumulates in the growth medium. The MopE protein was originally identified as one of five outer membrane-associated proteins, designated MopA-E, Mop being short for M. capsulatus outer membrane protein (8Fjellbirkeland A. Kleivdal H. Joergensen C. Thestrup H. Jensen H.B. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Later it was discovered that an N-terminal-truncated version (MopE*) of the cell surface-associated protein (MopEc) was secreted in large amounts to the growth medium under copper-limited growth conditions (6Karlsen O.A. Berven F.S. Stafford G.P. Larsen O. Murrell J.C. Jensen H.B. Fjellbirkeland A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 2386-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Fjellbirkeland A. Kruger P.G. Bemanian V. Hogh B.T. Murrell J.C. Jensen H.B. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). MopEc is composed of 512 amino acids, whereas MopE* represents the 336 C-terminal amino acids of MopEc. A MopE* homologue, designated CorA, has been isolated from the membranes of the methanotroph Methylomicrobium album BG8 (10Berson O. Lidstrom M.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 148: 169-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of both MopE and CorA is negatively regulated by copper, indicating an involvement in copper-homeostatic activities. Importantly, a copper binding motif could not be predicted with significance from the primary sequence of the two proteins (9Fjellbirkeland A. Kruger P.G. Bemanian V. Hogh B.T. Murrell J.C. Jensen H.B. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10Berson O. Lidstrom M.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 148: 169-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study we determined the crystal structure of MopE* to 1.35 Å of resolution and demonstrate that the protein has a novel protein fold and contains a mononuclear copper site. Importantly, we present evidence that one of amino acids in the copper-binding site is kynurenine, a tryptophan derivate not previously described in protein metal-binding sites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth Conditions and Purification of MopE*—MopE* was obtained from spent medium of M. capsulatus (Bath) strain NCIMB 11132 grown in continuous cultures in nitrate mineral salts medium containing no added copper, as described previously (6Karlsen O.A.

Mass spectrometric analyses (MALDI-TOF 2The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectroscopy; ICP, inductively coupled plasma. MS and MS/MS) were performed at PROBE, University of Bergen. A detailed description is given in the supplemental information.Metal Determination—The amount of copper bound per MopE* molecule was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at the Center for Element and Isotope Analyses, University of Bergen, Norway (see the supplemental information).The Copper Binding Affinity of MopE—Information on the dissociation constant of copper binding to MopE* was obtained using the Cu(I) chelator bathocuproine. Bathocuproine disulfonic acid (Sigma) and ascorbate were added to MopE* (∼10 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm CaCl2 to final concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mm, respectively. Ascorbate was included in the assay to ensure that the copper ions were maintained in the Cu(I) state. Samples were incubated either at room temperature or at 45 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking every 5 min. The protein was subsequently isolated using a 5-ml Hitrap desalting column (GE Healthcare), and the concentration of copper in the protein fraction was determined by ICP-MS analyses.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of MopE* in Escherichia coli—MopE* was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pETM41 vector using BamHI and NcoI restriction sites. Large-scale protein expression was performed using E. coli BL21 Star™ (DE3) and the pETM41 vector. Purification of MopE* is described in the supplemental information.Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—All variants of MopE* were crystallized from ammonium sulfate in the pH range 7.0–7.75. Data were collected at 100–120 K, and the data were processed in XDS (14Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3213) Google Scholar), MOSFLM (13Powell H.R.

The crystal structure of MopE* was determined using single anomalous dispersion data to 1.9 Å collected on a HgCl2 derivative (Hg-MopE*). The structures of the wild-type protein (MopE*) and MopE* recombinantly expressed in E. coli (Rec-MopE*) were determined to 1.35 and 1.65 Å, respectively, by molecular replacement using the mercury derivative as starting model. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1. The three structures of MopE* are essentially similar but with a significant difference in the metal-binding site.The present structure (Fig. 1) includes the 290 C-terminal residues of the protein, and the structures have been refined to crystallographic R-factors of about 18–21% (Rwork) and Rfree of 20–24% (Table 1). Main chain atoms of MopE* and Rec-MopE* residues 47–336 superimpose on each other with a root mean square deviation value of 0.57 Å. The differences are caused by the loops formed by residues 75–80 (β2–β3 loop), 105–110 (β3–β4 loop), 115–119 (β4–β5 loop), and 308–312 (β19–β21 loop). Different crystal packing environments in the β2–β3 and β4–β5 loops and poorly defined electron density in the solvent-exposed β19–β20 loops of both proteins are expected to cause the different conformations in three of the four loops. Only the conformation of the β3–β4 loops is expected to be caused by differences in the metal-binding sites of the wild-type and recombinant proteins. The 46 N-terminal amino acids of MopE* were not identified in the electron density maps in any of the structures.The protein forms a nest-like structure with dimensions of about 40 × 45 × 55 Å3 (Fig. 1, A and C). The majority of the MopE* structure folds into a coiled structure where only a third of the residues forms 21 β-strands (Fig. 1B). Eight of these build the only extensive secondary structure motif, an antiparallel β-sandwich. The MopE* structure also contains four 310 helical segments. The polypeptide is folded such that regions of the N-terminal, the middle, and C-terminal parts all are included in the β-sandwich (Fig. 1). One of the strands of the sandwich extends into a second 3-stranded sheet such that the central core of the protein is a 6-stranded sheet. Of the remaining β-strands, seven consist of only two residues each being involved in stabilizing the MopE* structure. The structure is also stabilized by a calcium ion octahedrally coordinated by three aspartic acid residues (Asp-250, Asp-252, Asp-274), two main chain carbonyl oxygens (Thr-276, Ala-279), and a solvent molecule (Fig. 1).The copper-binding site contains a single partially buried copper ion (Fig. 1C) located in a trigonal arrangement by the side groups of His-132, His-203, and intriguingly, Trp-130. Tryptophan has been shown to bind various metals in chemical systems (23Kaminskaia N.V. Kostic N.M. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 40: 2368-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Takani M. Takeda T. Yajima T. Yamauchi O. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 45: 5938-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); the indole side chain has not been reported to coordinate metal ions in biological systems. The electron density maps revealed a broken bond between the CD1 and NE1 atoms of Trp-130 (Fig. 2). In addition, the planar arrangement around the CG atom and the distances from the atom at the CD1 position to the main chain amine nitrogen atoms of residues 130, 131, and 132 suggested oxidation of the tryptophan to kynurenine. Kynurenines are formed by oxidative cleavage of the tryptophan indole ring with subsequent hydrolysis of the CD1 carbon, resulting in a mass increase of 4 Da compared with the unmodified tryptophan (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 2Electron density maps of the copper-binding site of MopE*.

The oxidized tryptophan is displayed as kyn in the amino acid sequence of the 2789-Da peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The copper ion is also coordinated by an axial water molecule, forming a distorted tetrahedral arrangement of the copper-binding site with the copper ion located almost in the middle of the base of the pyramid and the solvent molecule in the apical position (Fig. 2). Trigonal, tetrahedral, and trigonal bipyramidal are all geometries previously observed for copper-binding proteins (25Holm R.H. Kennepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). The distances between the copper ion and the ND1 atoms of the histidines are in the range 1.99–2.17 Å, indicating covalent/ionic interactions. This is also in the same order as copper-histidine distances found in most other copper-binding proteins (26Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 27Rulisek L. Vondrasek J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 71: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The distance between the copper ion and the nitrogen atom of the kynurenine is about 3 Å, somewhat longer than what is usually considered a copper-nitrogen interaction. The amino group of the kynurenine side chain would generally be considered a poor cooper ligand. The amino group is ∼6 degrees off a linear phenyl-amino-copper interaction and, as such, does not coincide with a possible amino-metal interaction previously described (25Holm R.H. Kennepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar). The copper to solvent distance in MopE* refines to about 2.5 Å, similar to what is found in other copper proteins. The occupancy of the copper ion is refined to about 0.65, which corresponds well with the ICP-MS analyses on purified MopE* revealing a copper-to-protein ratio between 0.5 and 0.6.Identification of Kynurenine by Mass Spectrometry—To verify the oxidation of tryptophan to kynurenine, purified MopE* was digested with Lys-C, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Computer-generated Lys-C peptide maps of MopE* calculated theoretical m/z ions of 2785 and 2789 for tryptophan and kynurenine, respectively. The MS analyses revealed a MALDI molecular ion at m/z 2789, consistent with the theoretically predicted ion for the kynurenine-containing peptide (Fig. 3, A and B, upper panels). Subsequent fragmentation of the m/z 2789 ion produced an MS/MS spectrum corresponding to the amino acid sequence Trp-112—Lys-135 of MopE* (Fig. 3C, left panel). From both the y-ion and b-ion series it was possible to identify a mass increase of 4 Da at residue 130. No distinct peak was observed at m/z 2785 (Fig. 3, A and B, upper panels).Analyses of Recombinant MopE*—Crystallization and MS studies were also carried out on MopE* heterologously expressed and purified from E. coli (Rec-MopE*). The MS spectrum and MS/MS fragmentation pattern on peptides derived from Rec-MopE* revealed solely the unmodified m/z 2785 peptide, demonstrating that the post-translational formation of kynurenine in MopE* had not occurred when expressed in E. coli (Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels, and C, right panel). This was confirmed by crystal structure analysis of Rec-MopE*. The electron density clearly displayed an intact CD1–NE1 bond (Fig. 4A). In addition, the side chain was rotated about 60 degrees in χ1 and 180 degrees in χ2 relative to kynurenine in wild-type MopE* (Fig. 4B). To accommodate the tryptophan side chain in this position, the β3–β4 loop (residues 105–110) is displaced about 1.5 Å. Thus, the metal-binding site is sufficiently disrupted to prevent binding of copper in Rec-MopE*, as demonstrated by the lack of electron density at the wild-type copper position. The latter was confirmed by ICP-MS; Rec-MopE* did not bind detectable levels of copper. These findings substantiate that the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine is an endogenous modification that specifically takes place in M. capsulatus and that the oxidation of Trp-130 to kynurenine is a prerequisite for copper binding in wild-type MopE*.FIGURE 4A, electron density maps covering the residues forming the copper-binding site of Rec-MopE*.

The copper found in MopE* is illustrated as a yellow sphere.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Copper Binding Affinity of MopE*—Bathocuproine disulfonic acid was used to obtain information on the copper binding affinity of MopE*. Bathocuproine disulfonic acid forms a stable 2:1 complex with Cu(I) with an association constant of ∼1020 (28Xiao Z. Loughlin F. George G.N. Howlett G.J. Wedd A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). No significant decrease in the amount of copper bound to MopE* could be observed after treatment with the copper chelator either at room temperature or at 45 °C, thus indicating a high affinity binding (Kd < 10-20 m).DISCUSSIONWe present here x-ray diffraction and mass spectrometry data on the M. capsulatus-secreted protein, MopE*. The protein presents a unique kynurenine-containing copper-binding site and a novel protein fold, of which only about a third of the MopE* structure displays similarity to known proteins. The only extensive secondary structure element previously observed is an 8-stranded antiparallel β-sandwich formed by about 25% of the residues. This motif is often found in virus capsid proteins and sugar binding and hydrolyzing proteins as well as in oxidoreductases, cupredoxins (proteins with Type I copper center), and proteins involved in electron transport (DALI data base (29Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar), ProFunc (30Laskowski R.A. Watson J.D. Thornton J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W89-W93Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and CATH protein classification data base (31Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones S. Jones D.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The remaining residues form an extensive coil-like structure interspersed with 13 short β-strands. Particularly interesting is the copper-binding site located in a depression on the molecular surface about 8–10 Å from the β-sandwich and relatively distant from any secondary structure element. The partially buried copper ion is located between two histidines and an oxidized tryptophan (kynurenine) in a planar trigonal arrangement and displays, therefore, similarities to Type I (blue copper proteins) and CuB copper centers (25Holm R.H. Kennepohl P. Solomon E.I. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2239-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2325) Google Scholar, 32Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). Type I copper centers are characterized by two histidines and a cysteine in a planar trigonal arrangement and a variable axial ligand. CuB copper centers coordinate copper by three histidines in a trigonal pyramidal geometry, and the axial ligand forms a bridge to the iron ion of the cytochrome heme. Two and three histidine ligands are frequently observed in copper-binding proteins, but to our knowledge this is the first observation of a tryptophan or a tryptophan metabolite involved in metal binding.When previously detected in proteins, kynurenine was considered the result of oxidative damage, and in most studies on proteins containing modified tryptophan residues, the kynurenine modification was formed by exposing the proteins to oxidative stress in vitro (33Yang C. Gu Z.W. Yang M. Lin S.N. Siuzdak G. Smith C.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15903-15908Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Zhang H. Joseph J. Crow J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2092229228,"Class II MHC molecules display peptides on the cell surface for the surveillance by CD4+ T cells. To ensure that these ligands accurately reflect the content of the intracellular MHC loading compartment, a complex processing pathway has evolved that delivers only stable peptide/MHC complexes to the surface. As additional safeguard, MHC molecules quickly acquire a ‘non-receptive’ state once they have lost their ligand. Here we show now that amino acid side chains of short peptides can bypass these safety mechanisms by triggering the reversible ligand-exchange. The catalytic activity of dipeptides such as Tyr-Arg was stereo-specific and could be enhanced by modifications addressing the conserved H-bond network near the P1 pocket of the MHC molecule. It affected both antigen-loading and ligand-release and strictly correlated with reported anchor preferences of P1, the specific target site for the catalytic side chain of the dipeptide. The effect was evident also in CD4+ T cell assays, where the allele-selective influence of the dipeptides translated into increased sensitivities of the antigen-specific immune response. Molecular dynamic calculations support the hypothesis that occupation of P1 prevents the ‘closure’ of the empty peptide binding site into the non-receptive state. During antigen-processing and -presentation P1 may therefore function as important “sensor” for peptide-load. While it regulates maturation and trafficking of the complex, on the cell surface, short protein fragments present in blood or lymph could utilize this mechanism to alter the ligand composition on antigen presenting cells in a catalytic way."
https://openalex.org/W2094122762,"Background Osteosarcoma (OSA) is lethal when metastatic after chemotherapy and/or surgical treatment. Thus animal models are necessary to study the OSA metastatic spread and to validate novel therapies able to control the systemic disease. We report the development of a syngeneic (Balb/c) murine OSA model, using a cell line derived from a spontaneous murine tumor. Methodology The tumorigenic and metastatic ability of OSA cell lines were assayed after orthotopic injection in mice distal femur. Expression profiling was carried out to characterize the parental and metastatic cell lines. Cells from metastases were propagated and engineered to express Luciferase, in order to follow metastases in vivo. Principal Findings Luciferase bioluminescence allowed to monitor the primary tumor growth and revealed the appearance of spontaneous pulmonary metastases. In vivo assays showed that metastasis is a stable property of metastatic OSA cell lines after both propagation in culture and luciferase trasduction. When compared to parental cell line, both unmodified and genetically marked metastatic cells, showed comparable and stable differential expression of the enpp4, pfn2 and prkcd genes, already associated to the metastatic phenotype in human cancer. Conclusions This OSA animal model faithfully recapitulates some of the most important features of the human malignancy, such as lung metastatization. Moreover, the non-invasive imaging allows monitoring the tumor progression in living mice. A great asset of this model is the metastatic phenotype, which is a stable property, not modifiable after genetic manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2037191521,"The energetic equivalence rule, which is based on a combination of metabolic theory and the self-thinning rule, is one of the fundamental laws of nature. However, there is a progressively increasing body of evidence that scaling relationships of metabolic rate vs. body mass and population density vs. body mass are variable and deviate from their respective theoretical values of 3/4 and −3/4 or −2/3. These findings questioned the previous hypotheses of energetic equivalence rule in plants. Here we examined the allometric relationships between photosynthetic mass (Mp) or leaf mass (ML) vs. body mass (β); population density vs. body mass (δ); and leaf mass vs. population density, for desert shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, respectively. As expected, the allometric relationships for both photosynthetic mass (i.e. metabolic rate) and population density varied with the environmental conditions. However, the ratio between the two exponents was −1 (i.e. β/δ = −1) and followed the trade-off principle when local resources were limited. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the energetic equivalence rule of plants is based on trade-offs between the variable metabolic rate and population density rather than their constant allometric exponents."
https://openalex.org/W2077535199,"Dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes has become an important public health and biodefense threat. Plasmids are important contributors to the rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance by pathogenic bacteria.The nucleotide sequence of the Klebsiella pneumoniae multiresistance plasmid pMET1 comprises 41,723 bp and includes Tn1331.2, a transposon that carries the bla(TEM-1) gene and a perfect duplication of a 3-kbp region including the aac(6')-Ib, aadA1, and bla(OXA-9) genes. The replication region of pMET1 has been identified. Replication is independent of DNA polymerase I, and the replication region is highly related to that of the cryptic Yersinia pestis 91001 plasmid pCRY. The potential partition region has the general organization known as the parFG locus. The self-transmissible pMET1 plasmid includes a type IV secretion system consisting of proteins that make up the mating pair formation complex (Mpf) and the DNA transfer (Dtr) system. The Mpf is highly related to those in the plasmid pCRY, the mobilizable high-pathogenicity island from E. coli ECOR31 (HPI(ECOR31)), which has been proposed to be an integrative conjugative element (ICE) progenitor of high-pathogenicity islands in other Enterobacteriaceae including Yersinia species, and ICE(Kp1), an ICE found in a K. pneumoniae strain causing primary liver abscess. The Dtr MobB and MobC proteins are highly related to those of pCRY, but the endonuclease is related to that of plasmid pK245 and has no significant homology with the protein of similar function in pCRY. The region upstream of mobB includes the putative oriT and shares 90% identity with the same region in the HPI(ECOR31).The comparative analyses of pMET1 with pCRY, HPI(ECOR31), and ICE(Kp1 )show a very active rate of genetic exchanges between Enterobacteriaceae including Yersinia species, which represents a high public health and biodefense threat due to transfer of multiple resistance genes to pathogenic Yersinia strains."
https://openalex.org/W2072408203,"Viruses lack self-propulsion. To move in multi-cellular hosts they must therefore manipulate infected cells. Herpesviruses provide an archetype for many aspects of host manipulation, but only for alpha-herpesviruses in is there much information about they move. Other herpesviruses are not necessarily the same. Here we show that Murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) induces the outgrowth of long, branched plasma membrane fronds to create an intercellular network for virion traffic. The fronds were actin-based and RhoA-dependent. Time-lapse imaging showed that the infected cell surface became highly motile and that virions moved on the fronds. This plasma membrane remodelling was driven by the cytoplasmic tail of gp48, a MHV-68 glycoprotein previously implicated in intercellular viral spread. The MHV-68 ORF58 was also required, but its role was simply transporting gp48 to the plasma membrane, since a gp48 mutant exported without ORF58 did not require ORF58 to form membrane fronds either. Together, gp48/ORF58 were sufficient to induce fronds in transfected cells, as were the homologous BDLF2/BMRF2 of Epstein-Barr virus. Gp48/ORF58 therefore represents a conserved module by which gamma-herpesviruses rearrange cellular actin to increase intercellular contacts and thereby promote their spread."
https://openalex.org/W2091065137,"Background Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) derived from dietary and salivary inorganic nitrogen oxides foment innate host defenses associated with the acidity of the stomach. The mechanisms by which these reactive species exert antimicrobial activity in the gastric lumen are, however, poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings The genetically tractable acid tolerance response (ATR) that enables enteropathogens to survive harsh acidity was screened for signaling pathways responsive to RNS. The nitric oxide (NO) donor spermine NONOate derepressed the Fur regulon that controls secondary lines of resistance against organic acids. Despite inducing a Fur-mediated adaptive response, acidified RNS largely repressed oral virulence as demonstrated by the fact that Salmonella bacteria exposed to NO donors during mildly acidic conditions were shed in low amounts in feces and exhibited ameliorated oral virulence. NO prevented Salmonella from mounting a de novo ATR, but was unable to suppress an already functional protective response, suggesting that RNS target regulatory cascades but not their effectors. Transcriptional and translational analyses revealed that the PhoPQ signaling cascade is a critical ATR target of NO in rapidly growing Salmonella. Inhibition of PhoPQ signaling appears to contribute to most of the NO-mediated abrogation of the ATR in log phase bacteria, because the augmented acid sensitivity of phoQ-deficient Salmonella was not further enhanced after RNS treatment. Conclusions/Significance Since PhoPQ-regulated acid resistance is widespread in enteric pathogens, the RNS-mediated inhibition of the Salmonella ATR described herein may represent a common component of innate host defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2110749146,"Atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSEs) are recently recognized prion diseases of cattle. Atypical BSEs are rare; approximately 30 cases have been identified worldwide. We tested prion gene (PRNP) haplotypes for an association with atypical BSE.Haplotype tagging polymorphisms that characterize PRNP haplotypes from the promoter region through the three prime untranslated region of exon 3 (25.2 kb) were used to determine PRNP haplotypes of six available atypical BSE cases from Canada, France and the United States. One or two copies of a distinct PRNP haplotype were identified in five of the six cases (p = 1.3 x 10(-4), two-tailed Fisher's exact test; CI(95%) 0.263-0.901, difference between proportions). The haplotype spans a portion of PRNP that includes part of intron 2, the entire coding region of exon 3 and part of the three prime untranslated region of exon 3 (13 kb).This result suggests that a genetic determinant in or near PRNP may influence susceptibility of cattle to atypical BSE."

We used kinematics to explicitly test the influence of olfactory stimuli on reach-to-grasp movements.Subjects were requested to reach towards and grasp a small or a large visual target (i.e., precision grip, involving the opposition of index finger and thumb for a small size target and a power grip, involving the flexion of all digits around the object for a large target) in the absence or in the presence of an odour evoking either a small or a large object that if grasped would require a precision grip and a whole hand grasp, respectively. When the type of grasp evoked by the odour did not coincide with that for the visual target, interference effects were evident on the kinematics of hand shaping and the level of synergies amongst fingers decreased. When the visual target and the object evoked by the odour required the same type of grasp, facilitation emerged and the intrinsic relations amongst individual fingers were maintained.This study demonstrates that olfactory information contains highly detailed information able to elicit the planning for a reach-to-grasp movement suited to interact with the evoked object. The findings offer a substantial contribution to the current debate about the multisensory nature of the sensorimotor transformations underlying grasping."
https://openalex.org/W2077282651,"In vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) is an immuno-screening technique that identifies bacterial antigens expressed during infection and not during standard in vitro culturing conditions. We applied IVIAT to Bacillus anthracis and identified PagA, seven members of a N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase autolysin family, three P60 family lipoproteins, two transporters, spore cortex lytic protein SleB, a penicillin binding protein, a putative prophage holin, respiratory nitrate reductase NarG, and three proteins of unknown function. Using quantitative real-time PCR comparing RNA isolated from in vitro cultured B. anthracis to RNA isolated from BALB/c mice infected with virulent Ames strain B. anthracis, we confirmed induced expression in vivo for a subset of B. anthracis genes identified by IVIAT, including L-alanine amidases BA3767, BA4073, and amiA (pXO2-42); the bacteriophage holin gene BA4074; and pagA (pXO1-110). The exogenous addition of two purified putative autolysins identified by IVIAT, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases BA0485 and BA2446, to vegetative B. anthracis cell suspensions induced a species-specific change in bacterial morphology and reduction in viable bacterial cells. Many of the proteins identified in our screen are predicted to affect peptidoglycan re-modeling, and our results support significant cell wall structural remodeling activity during B. anthracis infection. Identification of L-alanine amidases with B. anthracis specificity may suggest new potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2085578990,"The E2F1 transcription factor activates S-phase-promoting genes, mediates apoptosis, and stimulates DNA repair through incompletely understood mechanisms. XRCC1 (x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1) protein is important for efficient single strand break/base excision repair. Although both damage and proliferative signals increase XRCC1 levels, the mechanisms regulating XRCC1 transcription remain unclear. To study these upstream mechanisms, the XRCC1 promoter was cloned into a luciferase reporter. Ectopic expression of wild-type E2F1, but not an inactive mutant E2F1(132E), activated the XRCC1 promoter-luciferase reporter, and deletion of predicted E2F1 binding sites in the promoter attenuated E2F1-induced activation. Endogenous XRCC1 expression increased in cells conditionally expressing wild-type, but not mutant E2F1, and methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage stimulated XRCC1 expression in E2F1+/+ but not E2F1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Additionally, E2F1-/- MEFs displayed attenuated DNA repair after methyl methanesulfonate-induced damage compared with E2F1+/+ MEFs. Moreover, Chinese hamster ovary cells with mutant XRCC1 (EM9) were more sensitive to E2F1-induced apoptosis compared with Chinese hamster ovary cells with wild-type XRCC1 (AA8). These results provide new mechanistic insight into the role of the E2F pathway in maintaining genomic stability.

The E2F family of transcription factors plays an important role in promoting both cellular proliferation and cell death.

Mounting evidence implicates E2F1 as an important component of the DNA damage response as E2F1 protein is phosphorylated and stabilized via ATM/ATR and Chk2-dependent pathways (9Lin W.-C. Lin F.-T.

Moreover, it has also been suggested that E2F1 protein may be a component of repair complexes (22Maser R. Mirzoeva O. Wells J. Olivares H. Williams B. Zinkel R. Farnham P. Petrini J. Mol. Cell.

Importantly, E2F1 has a functional in vivo role in promoting DNA repair and suppressing apoptosis after UVB (24Berton T. Mitchell D. Guo R. Johnson D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Together, these studies implicate E2F1 in DNA repair, although the actual mechanisms and specific repair pathways remain obscure. DNA SSBs 4The abbreviations used are: SSB, single strand break; SSBR, single strand break repair; BER, base excision repair; IP, immunoprecipitation; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 4The abbreviations used are: SSB, single strand break; SSBR, single strand break repair; BER, base excision repair; IP, immunoprecipitation; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; GFP, green fluorescent protein. are one of the most common DNA lesions and pose a major threat to genetic stability and survival through accumulation of mutations or through conversion to double-stranded breaks (25Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Kroken H. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). SSBs can arise by direct damage to DNA bases or sugar moieties or indirectly as intermediates during the process of BER (26Caldecott K. DNA Rep. 2003; 2: 955-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). SSBR/BER requires highly coordinated overlapping enzymatic steps dependent on the nature and origin of the SSB lesion (25Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Kroken H. Mutat.

Furthermore, XRCC1 polymorphisms are associated with variable cancer risk, which suggests a possible role in cancer development (41Ladiges W. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1612-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). XRCC1-mediated repair includes an S-phase SSBR pathway that operates at replication forks and a rapid cell cycle independent SSBR/BER pathway (42Fan J. Otterlei M. Wong H.-K. Tomkinson A. Wilson D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2193-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 43Moore D. Taylor R. Clements P. Caldecott K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additional mechanisms may also regulate XRCC1, since mRNA and protein levels increase after DNA damage in part through a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (48Yacoub A. Park J. Qiao L. Dent P. Hagan H. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2001; 77: 1067-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 49Yacoub A. McKinstry R. Hinman D. Chung T. Dent P. Hagan H. Radiat. Res. 2003; 159: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, although both cell cycle-specific and DNA damage signals are upstream of XRCC1, the mechanisms regulating XRCC1 expression remain incompletely characterized. In this report, we demonstrate that XRCC1 is a direct E2F target gene and that E2F1 enhances SSBR/BER. These results provide new mechanistic insight into the role of E2F1 in the maintenance of genomic stability and cell survival. XRCC1 Promoter and Plasmids—The 5′-region from -881 to +158, relative to the transcription start site (GI:21624595) (50Thompson L. Brookman K. Jones N. Allen S. Carrano A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6160-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), was cloned by PCR of genomic DNA (forward primer, 5′-ggacgcagaacccttctcttttgg-3′; reverse primer, 5′-accgagtcctggctgctgcaggac-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the pGL3-Basic luciferase vector (Promega) using standard techniques. Deletions of the XRCC1 promoter region were similarly engineered. All constructs were sequence-verified. The E2F expression constructs, DP1 and pRSV β-galactosidase expression vectors were gifts from Drs. William Kaelin (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), W. C. Lin (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL), and Rosalie Sears (Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR). Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells at 60% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with the specified XRCC1 luciferase reporter plasmid, together with indicated amounts of specified E2F expression vector, pRSV β-galactosidase expression vector (0.1 μg), and an appropriate amount of empty plasmid vector, for a total of 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA per transfection. Luciferase assays were performed 36 h post-transfection with an AutoLumatB95 luminometer and relative luciferase light units were normalized to β-galactosidase activity as described previously (51Chen D. Padiernos E. Ding F. Lossos I. Lopez C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Total cellular lysates were prepared, quantitated, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with the specified primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visualized with chemiluminescence (Pierce SuperSignal) as previously described (51Chen D. Padiernos E. Ding F. Lossos I. Lopez C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Anti-XRCC1 mouse monoclonal antibody was from NeoMarkers, anti-E2F1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-tubulin antibody was from Sigma, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunological. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was prepared using the Total RNA preparation kit (Promega, Madison, MI) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Twenty μg total RNA was resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred, and UV-cross-linked to a Zeta-Probe®GT membrane (Bio-Rad), hybridized to a randomly primed 32P-labeled XRCC1 cDNA probe, and visualized with autoradiography using standard techniques. Reverse Transcription-PCR—XRCC1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels were determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR using standard techniques. Briefly, equivalent amounts of total RNA were prepared from the indicated cells at the specified conditions described, and oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA synthesis was performed with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed on equivalent amounts of reverse transcription product with TaqDNA polymerase for 30 cycles (95 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 40 s) (XRCC1 forward primer, 5′-gtatgcaggctccacggatgagaa-3′; XRCC1 reverse primer, 5′-aggcttgcggcaccaccccatagagc-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward primer, 5′-acggccgcatcttcttgtgc-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse primer, 5′-gtgcaggatgcattgctgac-3′). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis on Saos2 cells was performed as described (51Chen D. Padiernos E. Ding F. Lossos I. Lopez C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, stopped with 0.125 m glycine, lysed (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA plus fresh protease inhibitors), and sonicated to yield 600-1000 nucleotide chromatin fragments. Extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min and precleared with protein A-Sepharose/salmon sperm DNA slurry (1:1) for 30 min at 4 °C. 2 μg of anti-E2F1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control antibody (normal rabbit IgG) added and incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by protein A/G-agarose for 2 h. Beads were washed twice with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, four times with ice-cold IP wash buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid), and twice more with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer. IP elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS freshly made) was added for 15 min at room temperature, beads were spun out, and supernatant was collected. This was repeated, and supernatants were combined. Cross-links were reversed, and then DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. PCR of XRCC1 promoter sequence was performed with 25 cycles (94 °C for 15 s, 65 °C for 45 s) and analyzed on a 2% TAE-agarose gel. XRCC1-specific primers were as follows: forward, 5′-ggacgcagaacccttctcttttgg-3′; reverse, 5′-ggctcaggcggctgcactcttctc-3′. XRCC1 control primers were 5′-ctggggagtaggacgtcagtgctg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggcttgcggcaccaccccatagagc-3′ (reverse). Cell Culture—Cells were grown in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium or McCoyŉs medium supplemented with 10% heat-treated fetal bovine serum and 290 μg of l-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin per ml at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Saos2 cells stably transfected with various tetracycline-regulated E2F1 expression vectors (a gift from Dr. Karen Vousden, Beatson Institute, UK) were maintained in tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum (Clontech). E2F1+/+ and E2F1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were gifts from Dr. Joseph Nevins (Duke University, Durham, NC). Chinese hamster ovary cell lines AA8 and EM9 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Comet Assay—Single cell agarose alkaline gel electrophoresis was performed per standard methods with minor modifications (52Speit G. Hartmann A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 113: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent numbers of cells (1 × 105) were collected at the indicated time points, mixed with low melt temperature agarose (Sigma), and then layered onto agarose-coated glass slides. Slides were maintained at 4 °C to solidify and for all subsequent steps. Slides were submerged in lysis buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1% DMSO) for 1 h, washed with nanopure H2O, and incubated for 45 min in alkaline electrophoresis buffer (50 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 1% DMSO, pH 12.8). After electrophoresis (25 min, 25 V), air-dried and neutralized slides were stained with 2 μg/ml propidium iodide. Average comet tail moment was scored for duplicate slides (50 cells/slide) in randomly selected fields, and automated calculations were performed using Comet Assay II software (Perceptive Instruments, Suffolk, UK). In Situ DNA Strand Break Detection—A DNA polymerase I-mediated labeling assay was performed as described previously with minor modifications (53Chen J. Jin K. Chen M. Pei W. Kawaguchi K. Greenberg D. Simons R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 69: 232-245Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. Cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, and then incubated in a moist air chamber at 37 °C for 90 min in a labeling mixture containing 10 μm each dGTP, dATP, and dCTP and 7 μm dTTP, 3 μm FITC-dUTP, 20 units/ml Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Sigma) in reaction buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was terminated by washing the slides twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific labeling was determined by incubation in the reaction buffer without the enzyme. Apoptosis Assay—Equivalent numbers of indicated cells were plated and allowed to settle for 24 h at 50% confluence. Adenovirus infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 1 × 1010 (Stratagene AdEasy system). E2F1-expressing and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing adenoviruses were a gift from Dr. Rosalie Sears (Oregon Health and Science University). Forty-eight h after infection, cells were harvested and subjected to Annexin V and flow cytometry as previously described (54Zhu S. Ramos J. Kampa K. Sirisawad M. Yu Z. Chen D. Naumovski L. Lopez C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34473-34480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, attached and floating cells were collected and resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Allophycocyanin-conjugated Annexin V was immediately added, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the increase in Annexin V-allophycocyanin signal on stained cells over the base-line signal (defined on unstained cells) per standard flow cytometry convention.

Res. 2003; 159: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we wondered if E2F1 could stimulate endogenous XRCC1 expression (Fig. 1). To test this, we utilized a Saos2 stable cell line containing an E2F1 cDNA expression vector under control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (55Bates S. Phillips A. Clark P. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R. Vousden K. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). We found that tetracycline-induced E2F1 expression stimulated an increase in XRCC1 protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2) and mRNA levels (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). To demonstrate that E2F1 transcription function was required to induce endogenous XRCC1 expression, we additionally utilized a tetracycline-regulated Saos2 stable cell line containing a DNA binding-incompetent mutant E2F1(132E) (55Bates S. Phillips A. Clark P. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R. Vousden K. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Conditional expression of mutant E2F1(132E) could not stimulate endogenous XRCC1 protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4) or mRNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that E2F1 stimulates endogenous XRCC1 expression by a transcription-mediated mechanism. XRCC1 Promoter Has Features Suggestive of an E2F Target Gene—Since transcription-competent wild-type E2F1 was capable of stimulating XRCC1 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1), we examined the genomic sequence encompassing the XRCC1 promoter (Fig. 2A). Sequence analysis from -881 to +158 relative to the putative transcription start site (green sequence) (50Thompson L. Brookman K. Jones N. Allen S. Carrano A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6160-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) revealed a CpG island (boxed sequence) as well as putative E2F binding sites from -819 to -803 (red sequence). To verify that an active promoter was present in this region, we cloned this genomic fragment into the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector. After transfection into Saos2 cells, we found that this genomic region stimulated the luciferase reporter nearly 6-fold relative to empty vector (Fig. 2B). Sequential deletions from the 5′-end attenuated luciferase activation relative to empty vector. This finding suggests that a functional XRCC1 promoter is contained within this region, although the possibility of other control elements outside of this region cannot be excluded. The XRCC1 Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Is Stimulated by E2F1—Since the XRCC1 promoter sequence was typical for an E2F target gene (Fig. 2), we reasoned that the XRCC1 promoter-luciferase reporter would be stimulated by E2F. Co-transfection of increasing amounts of E2F1 expression vector with the XRCC1 promoter-luciferase reporter caused a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activation (Fig. 3A). In contrast, DNA binding-incompetent E2F1(132E) could not activate the XRCC1 promoter-luciferase reporter (Fig. 3A). We also found that E2F1 more efficiently stimulated the XRCC1 promoter-reporter relative to other family members (E2F2, E2F3, and E2F4) (Fig. 3B). To determine the contribution of the predicted E2F binding sites for their ability to influence XRCC1 promoter activation, we co-transfected E2F1 expression vector with an XRCC1 promoter-luciferase reporter, which lacked the E2F binding sites (ΔE2F1-XRCC1), as shown in Fig. 3C. We found that in response to E2F1 co-transfection, stimulation of the XRCC1 promoter-luciferase reporter containing the E2F binding sites was over 15-fold higher than the ΔE2F1-XRCC1 promoter-reporter (Fig. 3C, left). As a further control for specificity, mutant E2F1(132E) did not stimulate either promoter (Fig. 3C, right). Together, these results suggest that the XRCC1 promoter is stimulated by E2F. Endogenous XRCC1 Promoter Binds Endogenous E2F1—Since XRCC1 transcription is stimulated by E2F overexpression (Figs. 1 and 3), we wanted to demonstrate that endogenous E2F1 could bind the endogenous XRCC1 promoter in its native chromatin context. To examine this, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay on the proximal XRCC1 promoter region (Fig. 4). XRCC1 promoter-specific PCR primers amplified this region after chromatin IP with an anti-E2F1-specific antibody but not nonimmune IgG (Fig. 4, lanes 1-3). To further demonstrate that this was a specific interaction, XRCC1-specific primers that amplify a region that does not contain E2F-binding sites (control primers) could not generate a PCR product after chromatin IP with anti-E2F-1-specific antibody (Fig. 4, lanes 4-6). These findings demonstrate that the XRCC1 promoter, in its native chromatin context, can specifically bind E2F1 protein and that XRCC1 is a bona fide E2F target gene. Endogenous E2F1 Stimulates the XRCC1 Promoter after DNA Damage—Since XRCC1 is an E2F target gene (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4) and E2F1 is a DNA damage-inducible protein (9Lin W.-C. Lin F.-T. Nevins J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 10Stevens C. Smith L. La Thangue N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 11Blattner C. Sparks A. Lane D.

DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we wondered whether MMS, which causes heat-labile DNA damage repaired by an XRCC1-mediated BER pathway (56Lundin C. North M. Erixon K. Walters K. Jenssen D. Goldman A. Helleday T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3799-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), could stimulate XRCC1 transcription in an E2F1-dependent manner (Fig. 5). To investigate this, we transfected E2F1-/- and E2F1+/+ MEFs with the XRCC1 promoter-luciferase reporter and then treated them with MMS. Compared with no treatment, we found that the XRCC1 promoter-luciferase reporter was stimulated by MMS in E2F1+/+ but not E2F1-/- cells (Fig. 5A). Consistent with transcriptional activation, an increase in XRCC1 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 5B, left and right, respectively) was observed after MMS treatment in E2F1+/+ but not E2F1-/- cells. These results demonstrate that MMS-induced DNA damage stimulates XRCC1 transcription at least in part through an E2F1-dependent pathway. E2F1 Enhances DNA Repair after MMS-induced Damage—Since XRCC1 is a bona fide E2F1 target gene (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), we wished to determine if loss of E2F1 would result in attenuated DNA repair after MMS-induced DNA damage (Fig. 6). To investigate this, we treated E2F1-/- and E2F1+/+ MEFs with MMS and then measured strand break repair by single cell alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (comet assay) (52Speit G. Hartmann A.

https://openalex.org/W2034915097,"To explore guinea pigs as models of chymase biology, we cloned and expressed the guinea pig ortholog of human chymase. In contrast to rats and mice, guinea pigs appear to express just one chymase, which belongs to the α clade, like primate chymases and mouse mast cell protease-5. The guinea pig enzyme autolyzes at Leu residues in the loop where human chymase autolyzes at Phe. In addition, guinea pig α-chymase selects P1 Leu in a combinatorial peptide library and cleaves Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-4-nitroanilide but has negligible activity toward substrates with P1 Phe and does not cleave angiotensin I. This contrasts with human chymase, which cleaves after Phe or Tyr, prefers P1 Phe in peptidyl 4-nitroanilides, and avidly hydrolyzes angiotensin I at Phe8 to generate bioactive angiotensin II. The guinea pig enzyme also is inactivated more effectively by α1-antichymotrypsin, which features P1 Leu in the reactive loop. Unlike mouse, rat, and hamster α-chymases, guinea pig chymase lacks elastase-like preference for P1 Val or Ala. Partially humanized A216G guinea pig chymase acquires human-like P1 Phe- and angiotensin-cleaving capacity. Molecular models suggest that the wild type active site is crowded by the Ala216 side chain, which potentially blocks access by bulky P1 aromatic residues. On the other hand, the guinea pig pocket is deeper than in Val-selective chymases, explaining the preference for the longer aliphatic side chain of Leu. These findings are evidence that chymase-like peptidase specificity is sensitive to small changes in structure and provide the first example of a vertebrate Leu-selective peptidase.

Chymases are serine peptidases expressed and secreted mainly by mast cells. They are proposed to play a variety of roles in host defense, homeostasis and disease, including anti-parasite defense (1Knight P.A. Wright S.H. Lawrence C.E. Paterson Y.Y. Miller H.R. J. Exp.

Most chymases can cleave a variety of extracellular peptides and proteins, including endogenous targets like angiotensin I and exogenous pathogen or allergen-derived targets like profilin (12Mellon M.B. Frank B.T. Fang K.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the pool of cleavable host and pathogen targets is large, chymases have the potential to influence a broad range of events associated with mast cell activation and secretion. The closest relatives of chymases are cathepsin G and granzyme B-like proteins, which are expressed in myelomonocytes and cytolytic lymphocytes, respectively, in addition to mast cells. Genes encoding these enzymes are tightly clustered in mammalian genomes. In humans, four genes in this group are expressed: chymase (CMA1), cathepsin G (CTSG), granzyme B (GZMB), and granzyme H (GZMH). In mice and rats, however, chymase and granzyme B-like genes markedly expanded and diversified by gene duplication, conversion, and point mutation (13Caughey G.H. Curr. Resp. Med. Rev. 2006; 2: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Gallwitz M. Reimer J.M. Hellman L. Immunogenetics. 2006; 58: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The rat locus has an estimated 66 genes, of which 28 may be expressed (15Puente X.S. Lopez-Otin C. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although products of chymase, cathepsin G, and granzyme genes are structurally and phylogenetically related, they have a range of roles and target specificities. Granzyme B, for example, is an Aspase that cleaves specific host proteins and kills tumor and other target cells by triggering apoptosis, although humans and mice differ in this regard (16Kaiserman D. Bird C.H. Sun J. Matthews A. Ung K. Whisstock J.C. Thompson P.E. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Cathepsin G, on the other hand, has broad activity (tryptic, chymotryptic, Met-ase) (17Polanowska J. Krokoszynska I. Czapinska H. Watorek W. Dadlez M. Otlewski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and regulates adhesion-dependent function of neutrophils (18Raptis S.Z. Shapiro S.D. Simmons P.M. Cheng A.M. Pham C.T. Immunity. 2005; 22: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Within the chymase group, expressed proteins examined to date are either primarily chymotryptic (hydrolyzing peptides after residues with aromatic side chains) or elastolytic (hydrolyzing after residues with small, aliphatic side chains) (19Kunori Y. Koizumi M. Masegi T. Kasai H. Kawabata H. Yamazaki Y. Fukamizu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5921-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Karlson U. Pejler G. Tomasini-Johansson B. Hellman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39625-39631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Even among chymotryptic chymases, there is a range of catalytic competence and target preference. For example, mammalian chymotryptic chymases vary in their tendency to hydrolyze after one or the other of two aromatic residues in angiotensin I (21Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Muilenburg D.J. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Caughey G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cleavage at one site activates angiotensin I to angiotensin II, whereas cleavage at the other destroys activity. These preferences are influenced by sometimes subtle variations of amino acids in the vicinity of the substrate-binding site (22Muilenburg D.J. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Caughey G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the case of elastolytic chymases, notably the mouse chymase MCP-5 and its rat ortholog, the switch from chymotryptic to elastolytic specificity is attributable to natural mutation of a single amino acid (19Kunori Y. Koizumi M. Masegi T. Kasai H. Kawabata H. Yamazaki Y. Fukamizu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5921-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Karlson U. Pejler G. Tomasini-Johansson B. Hellman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39625-39631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similar elastolytic properties have recently been described for hamster α chymase (23Kervinen J. Abad M. Crysler C. Kolpak M. Mahan A.D. Masucci J.A. Bayoumy S. Cummings M.D. Yao X. Olson M. de Garavilla L. Kuo L. Deckman I. Spurlino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, small changes in structure, including alteration of just one amino acid in the vicinity of the substrate-binding site, can cause large changes in function. Guinea pigs are used to model allergic events and a variety of other phenomena. Although the properties of trypsin-like mast cell tryptases have been explored in guinea pigs, the enzymatic properties of their chymases have been an enigma, especially because unlike in primates, dogs, and hamsters, there is little evidence that chymase-like enzymes in guinea pigs contribute to angiotensin I-induced vascular contraction (24Miyazaki M. Takai S. Jin D. Muramatsu M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 112: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, guinea pigs can respond to exogenous chymotryptic peptidase, because human chymase injected into guinea pig skin increases microvascular permeability and provokes neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation (25He S. Walls A.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1491-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The present work shows that guinea pigs express an α-chymase-like peptidase with novel specificity for Leu in peptide and protein targets. Cloning and Sequencing of Guinea Pig Chymase cDNA— Fresh guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) heart muscle was harvested into RNAlater (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted from homogenates following the RNeasy Mini procedure (Qiagen). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers. To amplify a portion of guinea pig chymase by homology PCR, rodent mast cell protease consensus sequence was used to design the following primers: 5′-GAGTCAAAGCCACACTCCCGCCCTTACATGG and 5′-KYRCACASDARDGGNCCNCCDGAGTCYCC. Amplimers were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO-TA (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Primers for rapid amplification of cDNA ends were designed from the obtained sequence. Amplimers obtained by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using primer 5′-GAGAAAGACTGTAGTGGTTTCTTGATAC were cloned and sequenced. To obtain complete cDNA sequence, nested reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol (Invitrogen), using 5′-ACCCCTAGGTTGACTGTTAG and 5′-GTATCAAGAAACCACTACAGTCTTTCTC as first and second stage primer, respectively. The resulting amplimer was cloned and sequenced. To assess for potential polymorphisms, protein-coding sequence was verified by PCR cloning and DNA sequencing of a transcript from a guinea pig from an alternate supplier. Phylogenetic Analysis—Guinea pig chymase amino acid sequence was compared with that of cathepsin G and 27 other chymase-like mammalian peptidases using Geneious software (Biomatters). Rooted dendrograms were prepared from aligned sequences using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) 2The abbreviations used are: UPGMA, unweighted pair group with arithmetic mean; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; NA, nitroanilide; MCP, mast cell protease; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; contig, group of overlapping clones. or neighbor-joining techniques with bootstrap resampling. Generation of Humanized Mutant Guinea Pig Chymase cDNA—Guinea pig chymase was partially humanized using a QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primer 5′-GCCCAGGGCATTGTATCCTATGGTCATCGGAATG. This changes the codon encoding specificity triad residue Ala216 into a codon for Gly. The resulting A216G mutant cDNA was used to express recombinant mutant enzyme, as described below. Expression and Mutagenesis of Recombinant Chymases—For expression of guinea pig chymases in BL21(DE3) E. coli, primers 5′-CATATGGATGACGACGACAAGCTCCCATTACCGGCCGTG and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTAATTTGCTTTCAAGATCTTGTTGATC were used to PCR-clone mature peptide-coding sequence into NdeI and NotI sites of vector pET28a (Stratagene). Primers were designed so that enteropeptidase cleavage of expressed product, which has a 26-residue prosequence containing hexahistidine and an enteropeptidase cleavage recognition sequence, yields a peptide matching that of predicted wild type mature protein. Inclusion bodies containing recombinant guinea pig chymase were isolated and purified from E. coli extracts. Insoluble protein from lysed cells was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 6 m guanidine HCl and chromatographed in the same buffer over an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Purified, denatured protein then was incubated with a mixture of oxidized glutathione (150 mm) and reduced glutathione (1.5 mm) and then dialyzed overnight against H2O (pH 4–4.5) at 4 °C. Precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm EDTA (pH 4.5). Refolding was accomplished by dilution into a large volume of refolding buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m arginine, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm cysteine. After incubation for 2 days at 4 °C, the preparation was concentrated and dialyzed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 0.3 m NaCl and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, and activated by incubation with enteropeptidase. The activated preparation was further purified by gel filtration in Superdex 75 using running buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, and 10% glycerol, followed by rechromatography in 50 mm MES (pH 5.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, and 10% glycerol. The purified protein was monomeric by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation. For kinetic and inhibitor studies, recombinant human chymase expressed in insect cells was prepared, activated, and purified as described (21Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Active chymase concentration in samples used in kinetic studies was estimated using the specific activity of highly purified recombinant human chymase assayed under standard conditions (21Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Protein Sequencing—Purified, self-incubated, recombinant wild type guinea pig chymase (∼100 pmol) was desalted by application to and washing of a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membrane-bound protein was subjected directly to N-terminal amino acid sequencing on a Procise 494 HT sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Combinatorial Peptide Library Survey of Cleavage Site Preferences—Fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate combinatorial libraries were synthesized on PEGA1900 resin via split synthesis after standard Fmoc chemistry using 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate as the condensing reagent. Fmoc-Gly-OH, Fmoc-Glu-Lucifer Yellow, and all Fmoc-protected amino acids were coupled to amino PEGA1900 resin in the presence of diisopropylethylamine in N-methylpyrrolidone. Double coupling was performed using O-(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-1-pyridyl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate in the presence of diisopropylethylamine in N-ethylpyrrolidone. Synthesis was performed on a semiautomated shaking vessel machine. For variable positions in the peptide sequences, the resin was split into 19 portions, to each of which a different Fmoc-protected amino acid (except Fmoc-Cys-OH) was coupled. The portions then were mixed together and washed. Depending on the library, splitting was repeated, or the synthesis proceeded in a single portion. The last building block was t-butoxycarbonyl-Lys-(dabsyl)-OH. Protecting groups were removed by incubation with trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/triisopropylsilane (95:3:2 by volume). For screening of the Lys(dabsyl)-QAXXXXAQQG-Glu(Gly-PEGA)-Lucifer Yellow peptide library, ∼5000 beads were washed with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine, 10% glycerol). Purified enzyme (50 μg/ml in 1 ml) in reaction buffer was added to the resin. After shaking for 2–3 h at room temperature, beads were filtered and washed first with reaction buffer and then with 100 mm MES (pH 4.8) containing 5% glycerol and 0.05% Triton X-100. Brightly fluorescent beads identified by microscopy were isolated and submitted for N-terminal sequencing. Screening of the SSVXAXSAPG peptide library was similar. Analysis of Inhibitor Sensitivity—Enzymes were preincubated for 15 min at 25 °C with or without a potential inhibitor and then assayed for residual activity, as assessed with Suc-AAPL-4-NA (wild type guinea pig chymase) and Suc-AAPF-4-NA (A216G guinea pig mutant, human chymase, bovine chymotrypsin) substrates (Sigma). Concentrations of wild type and mutant guinea pig chymase, human chymase, and chymotrypsin (Sigma) were 110, 58, 29, and 8.4 nm, respectively. Concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, chymostatin (Sigma), α1-antitrypsin, α1-antichymotrypsin (EMD Chemicals), and E-64 (MP Biomedical) were 70 μm, 0.25 mm, 2.5 μm, 0.25 μm, 0.25 mm, and 0.5 mm, respectively. Active Site Titration—To estimate active enzyme concentration, amidolytic activity of purified preparations of wild type and A216G mutant guinea pig chymase was titrated with α1-antichymotrypsin as described by Karlson et al.

Active site-titrated preparations were assayed under standard conditions to obtain a specific activity, which was used to determine the concentration of active enzyme in future studies. Determination of Hydrolysis Kinetics—Kinetic parameters, including catalytic constant kcat and Michaelis constant Km, were derived from double reciprocal plots of substrate concentration versus reaction velocity for wild type and A216G mutant guinea pig chymase and human chymase cleaving a panel of peptidyl 4-NA substrates and angiotensin I. Hydrolysis of 4-NA substrates was assessed spectophotometrically at 410 nm. Assay buffers contained phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Triton X-100 and 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide, with concentrations of 4-NA substrates ranging from 71 to 425 μm. Cleavage of angiotensin I was monitored by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography of fragments generated by incubation with guinea pig and human chymases using modifications of approaches described previously (21Caughey G.H. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1480: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Muilenburg D.J. Raymond W.W. Wolters P.J. Caughey G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Peptidases were incubated with angiotensin I (8–24 nm) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) in aliquots of 50 μl at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 12 n HCl and then diluted with 60 μl of an aqueous solution of 10% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Outflow of samples chromatographed on a 2.1 × 250-mm Thermo Fisher Scientific BioBasic C-18 column with a linear gradient of 10–40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was monitored at 280 nm. Peak areas were determined using Unicorn 5.0 software (GE Healthcare). Molecular Modeling—Models of human and hamster 2 chymases were prepared from crystal-based coordinates from Protein Data Bank 1pjp (27Pereira P.J.B. Wang Z.M. Rubin H. Huber R. Bode W. Schechter N.M.

Homology models of wild type and A216G guinea pig chymase were built by Swiss-Model (available on the World Wide Web) starting with the 1pjp scaffold. Images were produced using Chimera (available on the World Wide Web) from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco and rendered with POV-Ray (available on the World Wide Web). Amino Acid Sequence of Guinea Pig Preprochymase—As shown in Fig. 1, the guinea pig chymase cDNA and gene sequence predict a 337-amino acid protein identical in length to human chymase and to the mouse ortholog MCP-5, both of which are α-chymases (see Fig. 2). Overall, the guinea pig sequence is slightly more similar (77% identical) to human chymase than to mouse chymase MCP-5 (75% identical), which is its closest relative among several chymase-like proteins in rodents. The guinea pig protein features a typical 19-residue signal peptide followed by an acidic dipeptide (Gly-Glu) similar or identical to the propeptide featured in other chymases and in cathepsin G, B-type granzymes, and neutrophil elastase-related peptidases, all of which are thought to be activated by dipeptidylpeptidase I (cathepsin C) (28Wolters P.J.

Invest. 2002; 109: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The propeptide is followed by a 226-residue catalytic domain with an N-terminal Val, which is atypical for chymase and its relatives (which usually have an Ile at this site) but is present in some other trypsin family serine peptidases. Catalytic triad residues (His57, Asp102, and Ser195 using chymotrypsinogen numbering) essential for the amidolytic function of all serine peptidases are intact. However, “specificity triad” residues (189, 216, and 226 of chymotrypsinogen) that influence preferences for the amino acid at the site of hydrolysis in target peptides (31Wouters M.A. Liu K. Riek P. Husain A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) are unique among enzymatically characterized serine peptidases (Table 1). The guinea pig triad differs in two residues from human chymase, which is chymotryptic, and in all triad residues in comparison with mouse MCP-5, which is elastolytic. A chymase-like peptidase we deduced from recently deposited whole genome shotgun sequence of the pika contains an identical specificity triad. However, this pika chymase is not closely related to guinea pig chymase in overall structure, as demonstrated by the phylogenetic analysis in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Tree of α/β chymases. Phylogenetic relationships between guinea pig chymase and other chymases are probed with this rooted dendrogram generated by UPGMA analysis of aligned mature chymase amino acid sequences using 1000 iterations of bootstrap resampling. The threshold for node assignment was 70%. Tines of peptidases belonging to α and β clades are black and gray, respectively, except for guinea pig chymase, which is forward-hatched. Examples of cathepsin G, the closest relative of chymases, are included for comparison. Accession numbers of sequences used in tree construction are as follows: human and mouse cathepsin G (NP_001902 and CAA55290), mouse MCP-1, -2, -4, and -5 (AAB23194, NP_032597, NP_034909, and NP_034910), rat MCP-I and -II (AAB48268 and P00700), rat MCP-4 and -5 (U67907 and NP_037224), rat vascular chymase (AAC16657), hamster chymase 1 and 2 (BAA19932 and BAA28615), gerbil chymase 1 and 2 (P50340 and P50341), opossum chymase (XP_001369716), guinea pig chymase (this work; AM851020), cattle chymase 2 (XP_593156), sheep MCP-2 (P79204), dog chymase (NP_001013442), baboon chymase (AAA91159), rhesus chymase (BAA22070), M. fascicularis chymase (crab-eating macaque; BAA22070), chimpanzee chymase (XP_001170224), and human chymase (M64269). We deduced the sequence of additional chymases from unannotated whole genome shotgun sequence as follows: American pika (Ochotona princeps, AAYZ01164217), tree shrew (AAPY01734039), mouse lemur (ABDC01231172), galago (AAQR01659070), and marmoset (contig 1790.4 from the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center, available on the World Wide Web).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Comparison of specificity triad residuesPeptidaseSpecificity triadP1 preferenceSource/ReferenceGuinea pig chymaseSAVLeu >> Met > PheThis workGuinea pig chymase A216GSGVPhe, Tyr >> Leu > MetThis workHuman chymaseSGAPhe, Tyr >> Leu, Trp > MetRef. 43Raymond W.W.

https://openalex.org/W1994066024,"Background Plants, fungi, bacteria and the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum are able to synthesize vitamin B6 de novo, whereas mammals depend upon the uptake of this essential nutrient from their diet. The active form of vitamin B6 is pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP). For its synthesis two enzymes, Pdx1 and Pdx2, act together, forming a multimeric complex consisting of 12 Pdx1 and 12 Pdx2 protomers. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report amino acid residues responsible for stabilization of the structural and enzymatic integrity of the plasmodial PLP synthase, identified by using distinct mutational analysis and biochemical approaches. Residues R85, H88 and E91 (RHE) are located at the Pdx1:Pdx1 interface and play an important role in Pdx1 complex assembly. Mutation of these residues to alanine impedes both Pdx1 activity and Pdx2 binding. Furthermore, changing D26, K83 and K151 (DKK), amino acids from the active site of Pdx1, to alanine obstructs not only enzyme activity but also formation of the complex. In contrast to the monomeric appearance of the RHE mutant, alteration of the DKK residues results in a hexameric assembly, and does not affect Pdx2 binding or its activity. While the modelled position of K151 is distal to the Pdx1:Pdx1 interface, it affects the assembly of hexameric Pdx1 into a functional dodecamer, which is crucial for PLP synthesis. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our data suggest that the assembly of a functional Pdx1:Pdx2 complex follows a defined pathway and that inhibition of this assembly results in an inactive holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1981770438,"Background The development of the Drosophila eye imaginal disc requires complex epithelial rearrangements. Cells of the morphogenetic furrow are apically constricted and this leads to a physical indentation in the epithelium. Posterior to the furrow, cells start to rearrange into distinct clusters and eventually form a precisely patterned array of ommatidia. These morphogenetic processes include regulated changes of adhesion between cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that two transmembrane adhesion proteins, Capricious and Tartan, have dynamic and complementary expression patterns in the eye imaginal disc. We also describe novel null mutations in capricious and double null mutations in capricious and tartan. We report that they have redundant functions in regulating the architecture of the morphogenetic furrow and ommatidial spacing. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that Capricious and Tartan contribute to the adhesive properties of the cells in the morphogenetic furrow and that this regulated adhesion participates in the control of spacing ommatidial clusters."

https://openalex.org/W2078247928,"Human body height is a complex genetic trait with high heritability. We performed an association study of 17 candidate genes for height in the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) that consists of 1153 elderly men of age 70 born in the central region of Sweden. First we genotyped a panel of 137 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) evenly distributed across the candidate genes in the ULSAM cohort. We identified 4 SNPs in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) on chromosome 6q25.1 with suggestive signals of association (p<0.05) with standing body height. This result was followed up by genotyping the same 25 SNPs in the ESR1 gene as in ULSAM in a second population cohort, the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) cohort that consist of 507 males and 509 females of age 70 from the same geographical region as ULSAM. One SNP, rs2179922 located in intron 4 of ESR1 showed and association signal (p = 0.0056) in the male samples from the PIVUS cohort. Homozygote carriers of the G-allele of the SNP rs2179922 were on average 0.90 cm taller than individuals with the two other genotypes at this SNP in the ULSAM cohort and 2.3 cm taller in the PIVUS cohort. No association was observed for the females in the PIVUS cohort."
https://openalex.org/W1990330870,"Background Inhibition of Akt signaling is considered one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for many cancers. However, rational target-orientated approaches to cell based drug screens for anti-cancer agents have historically been compromised by the notorious absence of suitable control cells. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to address this fundamental problem, we have developed BaFiso, a live-cell screening platform to identify specific inhibitors of this pathway. BaFiso relies on the co-culture of isogenic cell lines that have been engineered to sustain interleukin-3 independent survival of the parental Ba/F3 cells, and that are individually tagged with different fluorescent proteins. Whilst in the first of these two lines cell survival in the absence of IL-3 is dependent on the expression of activated Akt, the cells expressing constitutively-activated Stat5 signaling display IL-3 independent growth and survival in an Akt-independent manner. Small molecules can then be screened in these lines to identify inhibitors that rescue IL-3 dependence. Conclusions/Significance BaFiso measures differential cell survival using multiparametric live cell imaging and permits selective inhibitors of Akt signaling to be identified. BaFiso is a platform technology suitable for the identification of small molecule inhibitors of IL-3 mediated survival signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1980878706,"This work investigated the replication kinetics of the four dengue virus serotypes (DEN-1 to DEN-4), including dengue virus type 4 (DEN-4) recovered from an infectious cDNA clone, in Vero cells and in MRC-5 cells grown on Cytodex 1 microcarriers. DEN-1 strain Hawaii, DEN-2 strain NGC, DEN-3 strain H-87, and DEN-4 strain H-241 , and DEN-4 strain 814669 derived from cloned DNA, were used to infect Vero cells and MRC-5 cells grown in serum-free or serum-containing microcarrier cultures. Serum-free and serum-containing cultures were found to yield comparable titers of these viruses. The cloned DNA-derived DEN-4 started genetically more homogeneous was used to investigate the genetic stability of the virus propagated in Vero cells and MRC-5 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the DEN-4 propagated in MRC-5 cells maintained a high genetic stability, compared to the virus propagated in Vero cells. Amino acid substitutions of Gly104Cys and Phe108Ile were detected at 70%, 60%, respectively, in the envelope (E) protein of DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells, whereas a single mutation of Glu345Lys was detected at 50% in E of the virus propagated in MRC-5 cells. Sequencing of multiple clones of three separate DNA fragments spanning 40% of the genome also indicated that DEN-4 propagated in Vero cells contained a higher number of mutations than the virus growing in MRC-5 cells. Although Vero cells yielded a peak virus titer approximately 1 to 17 folds higher than MRC-5 cells, cloned DEN-4 from MRC-5 cells maintained a greater stability than the virus from Vero cells. Serum-free microcarrier cultures of MRC-5 cells offer a potentially valuable system for the large-scale production of live-attenuated DEN vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1999325273,"The role of the cellular protein LRP6 in anthrax toxin entry is controversial. Previous studies showed that LRP6 was important for efficient intoxication of human M2182 prostate carcinoma cells but other studies performed with cells from gene-knockout mice demonstrated no role for either LRP6 or the related LRP5 protein in anthrax toxin entry. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that LRP6 may be important for anthrax toxin entry into human, but not mouse, cells. To test this idea we have investigated the effect of knocking down LRP6 or LRP5 expression with siRNAs in human HeLa cells. We show here that efficient knockdown of either LRP6, LRP5, or both proteins has no influence on the kinetics of anthrax lethal toxin entry or MEK1 substrate cleavage in these cells. These data argue against a human-specific role for LRP6 in anthrax toxin entry and suggest instead that involvement of this protein may be restricted to certain cell types independently of their species of origin."
https://openalex.org/W2093166619,"Functional MRI resting state and connectivity studies of brain focus on neural fluctuations at low frequencies which share power with physiological fluctuations originating from lung and heart. Due to the lack of automated software to process physiological signals collected at high magnetic fields, a gap exists in the processing pathway between the acquisition of physiological data and its use in fMRI software for both physiological noise correction and functional analyses of brain activation and connectivity. To fill this gap, we developed an open source, physiological signal processing program, called PhysioNoise, in the python language. We tested its automated processing algorithms and dynamic signal visualization on resting monkey cardiac and respiratory waveforms. PhysioNoise consistently identifies physiological fluctuations for fMRI noise correction and also generates covariates for subsequent analyses of brain activation and connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2071822556,"A persistent controversy surrounds the flightless island hen of Tristan da Cunha, Gallinula nesiotis. Some believe that it became extinct by the end of the 19th century. Others suppose that it still inhabits Tristan. There is no consensus about Gallinula comeri, the name introduced for the flightless moorhen from the nearby island of Gough. On the basis of DNA sequencing of both recently collected and historical material, we conclude that G. nesiotis and G. comeri are different taxa, that G. nesiotis indeed became extinct, and that G. comeri now inhabits both islands. This study confirms that among gallinules seemingly radical adaptations (such as the loss of flight) can readily evolve in parallel on different islands, while conspicuous changes in other morphological characters fail to occur."
https://openalex.org/W2092206663,"Polymerization into amyloid fibrils is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative syndromes. Amyloid assembly is governed by properties of the sequence backbone and specific side-chain interactions, since fibrils from unrelated sequences possess similar structures and morphologies. Therefore, characterization of the structural determinants driving amyloid aggregation is of fundamental importance. We investigated the forces involved in the amyloid assembly of a model peptide derived from the oligomerization domain of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), AChE586-599, through the effect of single point mutations on β-sheet propensity, conformation, fibrilization, surfactant activity, oligomerization and fibril morphology. AChE586-599 was chosen due to its fibrilization tractability and AChE involvement in Alzheimer's disease. The results revealed how specific regions and residues can control AChE586-599 assembly. Hydrophobic and/or aromatic residues were crucial for maintaining a high β-strand propensity, for the conformational transition to β-sheet, and for the first stage of aggregation. We also demonstrated that positively charged side-chains might be involved in electrostatic interactions, which could control the transition to β-sheet, the oligomerization and assembly stability. Further interactions were also found to participate in the assembly. We showed that some residues were important for AChE586-599 surfactant activity and that amyloid assembly might preferentially occur at an air-water interface. Consistently with the experimental observations and assembly models for other amyloid systems, we propose a model for AChE586-599 assembly in which a steric-zipper formed through specific interactions (hydrophobic, electrostatic, cation-π, SH-aromatic, metal chelation and polar-polar) would maintain the β-sheets together. We also propose that the stacking between the strands in the β-sheets along the fiber axis could be stabilized through π-π interactions and metal chelation. The dissection of the specific molecular recognition driving AChE586-599 amyloid assembly has provided further knowledge on such poorly understood and complicated process, which could be applied to protein folding and the targeting of amyloid diseases."

Additionally, there is limited data on the awareness and use of Benzodiazepines from developing countries making it impossible to devise meaningful health policies.This was an Observational, Cross-Sectional study. conducted at Aga Khan University. A total of 475 (58.5% males, 41.5% females) people visiting a tertiary care hospital were interviewed by means of a structured questionnaire. The results showed that majority of population was aware of one or more Benzodiazepines (80.4%) and 30.4% had used them at some point in life. 42.4% of the users had been using it for more than a year. Commonest reason for use was sleep disturbance. Frequency of usage was higher for females, married individuals, educated (>Grade12), high socioeconomic status and housewives. More (59%) were prescribed than not and of them most by GP (58.5%). Only 36.5% of them were particularly told about the long-term addiction potential by the use of these drugs.Easy availability, access to re-fills without prescription and self prescription compounded with the lack of understanding of abuse potential of benzodiazepines constitutes a significant problem demanding serious consideration from health policy makers."
https://openalex.org/W2070417409,"Heregulin beta-1 (HRG) is an extracellular ligand that activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways through ErbB receptors. MAPK and Akt have been shown to phosphorylate the estrogen receptor (ER) at Ser-118 and Ser-167, respectively, thereby mimicking the effects of estrogenic activity such as estrogen responsive element (ERE)-dependent transcription. In the current study, integrative analysis was performed using two tiling array platforms, comprising histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation and RNA mapping, together with array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis in an effort to identify HRG-regulated genes in ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Through application of various threshold settings, 333 (326 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated) HRG-regulated genes were detected. Prediction of upstream transcription factors (TFs) and pathway analysis indicated that 21% of HRG-induced gene regulation may be controlled by the MAPK cascade, while only 0.6% of the gene expression is controlled by ERE. A comparison with previously reported estrogen (E2)-regulated gene expression data revealed that only 12 common genes were identified between the 333 HRG-regulated (3.6%) and 239 E2-regulated (5.0%) gene groups. However, with respect to enriched upstream TFs, 4 common TFs were identified in the 14 HRG-regulated (28.6%) and 13 E2-regulated (30.8%) gene groups. These results indicated that while E2 and HRG may induce common TFs, the regulatory mechanisms that govern HRG- and E2-induced gene expression differ."
https://openalex.org/W2061214760,"The assembly methods used for whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data have a major impact on the quality of resulting draft genomes. We present a novel algorithm to generate a set of “reliable” overlaps based on identifying repeat k-mers. To demonstrate the benefits of using reliable overlaps, we have created a version of the Phrap assembly program that uses only overlaps from a specific list. We call this version PhrapUMD. Integrating PhrapUMD and our “reliable-overlap” algorithm with the Baylor College of Medicine assembler, Atlas, we assemble the BACs from the Rattus norvegicus genome project. Starting with the same data as the Nov. 2002 Atlas assembly, we compare our results and the Atlas assembly to the 4.3 Mb of rat sequence in the 21 BACs that have been finished. Our version of the draft assembly of the 21 BACs increases the coverage of finished sequence from 93.4% to 96.3%, while simultaneously reducing the base error rate from 4.5 to 1.1 errors per 10,000 bases. There are a number of ways of assessing the relative merits of assemblies when the finished sequence is available. If one views the overall quality of an assembly as proportional to the inverse of the product of the error rate and sequence missed, then the assembly presented here is seven times better. The UMD Overlapper with options for reliable overlaps is available from the authors at http://www.genome.umd.edu. We also provide the changes to the Phrap source code enabling it to use only the reliable overlaps."
