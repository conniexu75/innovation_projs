https://openalex.org/W3009151774,"The role that women play in fisheries around the world is receiving increasing international attention yet the contributions by women to fisheries catches continues to be overlooked by society, industry and policy makers. Here, we address this lack of visibility with a global estimation of small-scale fisheries catches by women. Our estimates reveal that women participate in small-scale fishing activities in all regions of the world, with approximately 2.1 million (± 86,000) women accounting for roughly 11% (± 4%) of participants in small-scale fishing activities, i.e., catching roughly 2.9 million (± 835,000) tonnes per year of marine fish and invertebrates. The landed value of the catch by women is estimated at USD 5.6 billion (± 1.5 billion), with an economic impact of USD 14.8 billion per year (± 4 billion), which is equivalent to 25.6 billion real 2010 dollars (± 7.2 billion). These catches are mostly taken along the shoreline, on foot, or from small, non-motorized vessels using low-technology, low-emission gears in coastal waters. Catches taken by women are often for home consumption, and thus considered part of the subsistence sub-sector. However, in many contexts, women also sell a portion of their catch, generating income for themselves and their families. These findings underscore the significant role of women as direct producers in small-scale fisheries value chains, making visible contributions by women to food and livelihood security, globally."

https://openalex.org/W3009276911,"We assessed the mechanism of mammalian breathing rhythmogenesis in the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) in vitro, where experimental tests remain inconsistent with hypotheses of canonical rhythmogenic cellular or synaptic mechanisms, i.e., pacemaker neurons or inhibition. Under rhythmic conditions, in each cycle, an inspiratory burst emerges as (presumptive) preBötC rhythmogenic neurons transition from aperiodic uncorrelated population spike activity to become increasingly synchronized during preinspiration (for ∼50-500 ms), which can trigger inspiratory bursts that propagate to motoneurons. In nonrhythmic conditions, antagonizing GABAA receptors can initiate this synchronization while inducing a higher conductance state in nonrhythmogenic preBötC output neurons. Our analyses uncover salient features of preBötC network dynamics where inspiratory bursts arise when and only when the preBötC rhythmogenic subpopulation strongly synchronizes to drive output neurons. Furthermore, downstream propagation of preBötC network activity, ultimately to motoneurons, is dependent on the strength of input synchrony onto preBötC output neurons exemplifying synchronous propagation of network activity."
https://openalex.org/W3009425238,"Hyperlipidemia and hypertension are modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Approximately 25% of adults over age 65 use both antihypertensives (AHTs) and statins for these conditions. While a growing body of evidence found statins and AHTs are independently associated with lower ADRD risk, no evidence exists on simultaneous use for different drug class combinations and ADRD risk. Our primary objective was to compare ADRD risk associated with concurrent use of different combinations of statins and antihypertensives.In a retrospective cohort study (2007-2014), we analyzed 694,672 Medicare beneficiaries in the United States (2,017,786 person-years) who concurrently used both statins and AHTs. Using logistic regression adjusting for age, socioeconomic status and comorbidities, we quantified incident ADRD diagnosis associated with concurrent use of different statin molecules (atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) and AHT drug classes (two renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-acting AHTs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), vs non-RAS-acting AHTs).Pravastatin or rosuvastatin combined with RAS-acting AHTs reduce risk of ADRD relative to any statin combined with non-RAS-acting AHTs: ACEI+pravastatin odds ratio (OR) = 0.942 (CI: 0.899-0.986, p = 0.011), ACEI+rosuvastatin OR = 0.841 (CI: 0.794-0.892, p<0.001), ARB+pravastatin OR = 0.794 (CI: 0.748-0.843, p<0.001), ARB+rosuvastatin OR = 0.818 (CI: 0.765-0.874, p<0.001). ARBs combined with atorvastatin and simvastatin are associated with smaller reductions in risk, and ACEI with no risk reduction, compared to when combined with pravastatin or rosuvastatin. Among Hispanics, no combination of statins and RAS-acting AHTs reduces risk relative to combinations of statins and non-RAS-acting AHTs. Among blacks using ACEI+rosuvastatin, ADRD odds were 33% lower compared to blacks using other statins combined with non-RAS-acting AHTs (OR = 0.672 (CI: 0.548-0.825, p<0.001)).Among older Americans, use of pravastatin and rosuvastatin to treat hyperlipidemia is less common than use of simvastatin and atorvastatin, however, in combination with RAS-acting AHTs, particularly ARBs, they may be more effective at reducing risk of ADRD. The number of Americans with ADRD may be reduced with drug treatments for vascular health that also confer effects on ADRD."
https://openalex.org/W3009426980,"Skeletal muscle is comprised of a heterogeneous population of muscle fibers which can be classified by their metabolic and contractile properties (fiber “types”). Fiber type is a primary determinant of muscle function along with fiber size (cross-sectional area). The fiber type composition of a muscle responds to physiological changes like exercise and aging and is often altered in disease states. Thus, analysis of fiber size and type in histological muscle preparations is a useful method for quantifying key indicators of muscle function and for measuring responses to a variety of stimuli or stressors. These analyses are near-ubiquitous in the fields of muscle physiology and myopathy, but are most commonly performed manually, which is highly labor- and time-intensive. To offset this obstacle, we developed Myosoft, a novel method to automate morphometric and fiber type analysis in muscle sections stained with fluorescent antibodies. Methods Muscle sections were stained for cell boundary (laminin) and myofiber type (myosin heavy chain isoforms). Myosoft, running in the open access software platform FIJI (ImageJ), was used to analyze myofiber size and type in transverse sections of entire gastrocnemius/soleus muscles. Results Myosoft provides an accurate analysis of hundreds to thousands of muscle fibers within 25 minutes, which is >10-times faster than manual analysis. We demonstrate that Myosoft is capable of handling high-content images even when image or staining quality is suboptimal, which is a marked improvement over currently available and comparable programs. Conclusions Myosoft is a reliable, accurate, high-throughput, and convenient tool to analyze high-content muscle histology. Myosoft is freely available to download from Github at https://github.com/Hyojung-Choo/Myosoft/tree/Myosoft-hub."
https://openalex.org/W3009434233,"Intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) may contribute to functional disability in ICU survivors, yet performance-based data for general ICU patients are lacking. This study explored functional outcomes of (1) and risk factors for (2) weakness at ICU discharge.Data from a randomised controlled trial that investigated two early exercise regimes in previously independent, ventilated adults (n = 115) without any significant outcome-differences were used for the present analysis. ICUAW was clinically diagnosed in cooperative participants (n = 83) at ICU discharge with the Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) using a cut-off <48 for moderate or <36 for severe weakness. Primary outcomes were the 6-Minute Walk Test and Functional Independence Measure at hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life after six months. Risk factors during the ICU stay were explored for their effect on MRC-SS with linear regression.Functional outcomes and length of hospital stay significantly differed in patients with severe, moderate to no weakness (6-Minute Walk test: p = 0.013; 110m [IQR 75-240], 196m [90-324.25], 222.5m [129-378.75], Functional Independence Measure: p = 0.001; 91[IQR 68-101], 113[102.5-118.5], 112[97-123], length of stay after ICU discharge: p = 0.008; 20.9d [IQR 15.83-30.73], 16.86d [13.07-27.10], 11.16d [7.35-19.74]). However, after six months participants had similar values for quality of life regardless of their strength at ICU discharge (Short-Form 36 sum-scores physical health: p = 0.874, mental health: p = 0.908). In-bed immobilisation was the most significant factor associated with weakness at ICU discharge in the regression models (MRC-SS: -24.57(95%CI [-37.03 to -12.11]); p<0.001).In this general, critically ill cohort, weakness at ICU discharge was associated with short-term functional disability and prolonged hospital length of stay, but not with quality of life, which was equivalent to the values for patients without ICUAW within six months. Immobilisation may be a modifiable risk factor to prevent ICUAW. Prospective trials are needed to validate these results.German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) identification number: DRKS00004347, registered on September 10, 2012."
https://openalex.org/W3009429827,"Background The early use of broad-spectrum antibiotics remains the cornerstone for the treatment of neonatal late onset sepsis (LOS). However, which antibiotics should be used is still debatable, as relevant studies were conducted more than 20 years ago, recruited in single centres or countries, evaluated antibiotics not in clinical use anymore and had variable inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures. Moreover, antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a major problem in many countries worldwide. We hypothesized that efficacy of meropenem as a broad-spectrum antibiotic is superior to standard of care regimens (SOC) in empiric treatment of LOS and aimed to compare meropenem to SOC in infants aged <90 days with LOS. Methods and findings NeoMero-1 was a randomized, open-label, phase III superiority trial conducted in 18 neonatal units in 6 countries. Infants with post-menstrual age (PMA) of ≤44 weeks with positive blood culture and one, or those with negative culture and at least with two predefined clinical and laboratory signs suggestive of LOS, or those with PMA >44 weeks meeting the Goldstein criteria of sepsis, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive meropenem or one of the two SOC regimens (ampicillin+gentamicin or cefotaxime+gentamicin) chosen by each site prior to the start of the study for 8–14 days. The primary outcome was treatment success (survival, no modification of allocated therapy, resolution/improvement of clinical and laboratory markers, no need of additional antibiotics and presumed/confirmed eradication of pathogens) at test-of-cure visit (TOC) in full analysis set. Stool samples were tested at baseline and Day 28 for meropenem-resistant Gram-negative organisms (CRGNO). The primary analysis was performed in all randomised patients and in patients with culture confirmed LOS. Proportions of participants with successful outcome were compared by using a logistic regression model adjusted for the stratification factors. From September 3, 2012 to November 30th 2014, total of 136 patients (instead of planned 275) in each arm were randomized; 140 (52%) were culture positive. Successful outcome at TOC was achieved in 44/136 (32%) in the meropenem arm vs. 31/135 (23%) in the SOC arm (p = 0.087). The respective numbers in patients with positive cultures were 17/63 (27%) vs. 10/77 (13%) (p = 0.022). The main reason of failure was modification of allocated therapy. Treatment emergent adverse events occurred in 72% and serious adverse events in 17% of patients, the Day 28 mortality was 6%. Cumulative acquisition of CRGNO by Day 28 occurred in 4% of patients in the meropenem and 12% in the SOC arm (p = 0.052). Conclusions Within this study population, we found no evidence that meropenem was superior to SOC in terms of success at TOC, short term hearing disturbances, safety or mortality were similar in both treatment arms but the study was underpowered to detect the planned effect. Meropenem treatment did not select for colonization with CRGNOs. We suggest that meropenem as broad-spectrum antibiotic should be reserved for neonates who are more likely to have Gram-negative LOS, especially in NICUs where microorganisms producing extended spectrum- and AmpC type beta-lactamases are circulating."
https://openalex.org/W3009836971,"Halophiles are the organisms that thrive in extreme high salt environments. Despite the extensive studies on their biotechnological potentials, the ability of halophilic prokaryotes for the synthesis of nanoparticles has remained understudied. In this study, the archaeal and bacterial halophiles from a solar saltern were investigated for the intracellular/extracellular synthesis of silver and selenium nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles were produced by the archaeal Haloferax sp. (AgNP-A, intracellular) and the bacterial Halomonas sp. (AgNP-B, extracellular), while the intracellular selenium nanoparticles were produced by the archaeal Halogeometricum sp. (SeNP-A) and the bacterial Bacillus sp. (SeNP-B). The nanoparticles were characterized by various techniques including UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, DLS, ICP-OES, Zeta potentials, FTIR, EDX, SEM, and TEM. The average particle size of AgNP-A and AgNP-B was 26.34 nm and 22 nm based on TEM analysis. Also, the characteristic Bragg peaks of face-centered cubic with crystallite domain sizes of 13.01 nm and 6.13 nm were observed in XRD analysis, respectively. Crystallographic characterization of SeNP-A and SeNP-B strains showed a hexagonal crystallite structure with domain sizes of 30.63 nm and 29.48 nm and average sizes of 111.6 nm and 141.6 nm according to TEM analysis, respectively. The polydispersity index of AgNP-A, AgNP-B, SeNP-A, and SeNP-B was determined as 0.26, 0.28, 0.27, and 0.36 and revealed high uniformity of the nanoparticles. All of the synthesized nanoparticles were stable and their zeta potentials were calculated as (mV): ˗33.12, ˗35.9, ˗31.2, and ˗29.34 for AgNP-A, AgNP-B, SeNP-A, and SeNP-B, respectively. The nanoparticles showed the antibacterial activity against various bacterial pathogens. The results of this study suggested that the (extremely) halophilic prokaryotes have great potentials for the green synthesis of nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W3009664949,"Background The aim of this study was to characterize the time-resolved progression of clinical laboratory disturbances days-following an exertional heat stroke (EHS). Currently, normalization of organ injury clinical biomarker values is the primary indicator of EHS recovery. However, an archetypical biochemical recovery profile following EHS has not been established. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of EHS patient records in US military personnel from 2008–2014 using the Military Health System Data Repository (MDR). We focused on commonly reported clinical laboratory analytes measured on the day of injury and all proceeding follow-up visits. Results Over the prescribed period, there were 2,529 EHS episodes treated at 250 unique treatment locations. Laboratory results, including a standardized set of blood, serum and urine assays, were analyzed from 0–340 days following the initial injury. Indicators of acute kidney injury, including serum electrolyte disturbances and abnormal urinalysis findings, were most prevalent on the day of the injury but normalized within 24-48hours (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and blood and protein in urine). Muscle damage and liver function-associated markers peaked 0–4 days after injury and persisted outside their respective reference ranges for 2–16 days (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase, myoglobin, prothrombin time). Conclusion Biochemical recovery from EHS spans a 16-day time course, and markers of end-organ damage exhibit distinct patterns over this period. This analysis underscores the prognostic value of each clinical laboratory analyte and will assist in evaluating EHS patient presentation, injury severity and physiological recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3009151641,"Background We investigated changes in clinical characteristics of SGLT2i and GLP-1RA real-world initiators in Denmark before/after landmark cardiovascular outcome trials. Methods We compared first-time SGLT2i (25,070) and GLP-1RA (14,671) initiators to initiators of DPP-4i (n = 34,079), a class without proven cardiovascular benefits. We used linked population-based healthcare data to examine initiation incidence, medication patterns, and pre-existing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) during 2014–2017. Results Nationwide incidence of SGLT2i initiators increased 3.6-fold (53/100,000 to 172/100,000 per year) vs. a 1.5-fold increase for GLP-1RA. DPP-4i initiation remained stable. From the end of 2015, SGLT2i was increasingly used as 2nd-line therapy, while medication patterns were much more stable for GLP-1RA. Among SGLT2i users, ASCVD increased slightly from 28% to 30%; age- and gender-adj. prevalence ratio (aPR) = 1.03 (95% CI:0.97–1.10). In contrast, among GLP-1RA initiators, baseline ASCVD declined from 29% to 27% (aPR: 0.90 (95% CI:0.84–0.97)), and in DPP-4i initiators from 31% to 29% (aPR: 0.91 (95% CI:0.88–0.96)). Conclusions Following the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial in 2015, SGLT2i have become increasingly used as 2nd-line treatment in everyday clinical practice, with only minor increases in patient proportions with ASCVD. For GLP-1RA, we observed more stable therapy lines and slightly decreasing ASCVD in new users despite the LEADER trial."

Prevalent CKD was defined as a serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate l60 mL/min/1.73m2 or proteinuria (urine dipstick ≥1+). We used inverse-weighting to estimate the population prevalence of CKD, and multivariable log-link Poisson models to assess the associations of potential risk factors with CKD.ResultsThe estimated CKD prevalence was 6.8% (95% CI 5.7-8.1%) overall and varied by region, being 12.5% (10.1-15.4%) in eastern Uganda, 3.9% (2.2-6.8%) in southwestern Uganda and 3.7% (2.7-5.1%) in western Kenya. Risk factors associated with greater CKD prevalence included age ≥60 years (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 3.5 [95% CI 1.9-6.5] compared with age 18-29 years), HIV infection (aPR 1.6 [1.1-2.2]), and residence in eastern Uganda (aPR 3.9 [2.6-5.9]). However, two-thirds of individuals with CKD did not have HIV, diabetes, or hypertension as risk factors. Furthermore, we noted many individuals who did not have proteinuria had dipstick positive leukocyturia or hematuria.ConclusionThe prevalence of CKD is appreciable in rural East Africa and there are considerable regional differences. Conventional risk factors appear to only explain a minority of cases, and leukocyturia and hematuria were common, highlighting the need for further research into understanding the nature of CKD in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3010320768,"Most people living with HIV (PLHIV) with reliable access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) have a life expectancy similar to uninfected populations. Despite this, HIV can negatively affect their social and psychological wellbeing. This study aimed to enhance understanding of the expectations PLHIV hold for HIV cure research and the implications this has for HIV cure research trials. We interviewed 20 Australian PLHIV about their expectations for HIV cure research outcomes and the impact a potential cure for HIV may have on their everyday lives. Data were analysed thematically, using both inductive and deductive approaches. The significance of a cure for HIV was expressed by participants as something that would offer relief from their sense of vigilance or uncertainty about their health into the future. A cure was also defined in social terms, as alleviation from worry about potential for onward HIV transmission, concerns for friends and family, and the negative impact of HIV-related stigma. Participants did not consider sustained medication-free viral suppression (or remission) as a cure for HIV because this did not offer certainty in remaining virus free in a way that would alleviate these fears and concerns. A cure was seen as complete elimination of HIV from the body. There is an ethical need to consider the expectations of PLHIV in design of, and recruitment for, HIV cure-related research. The language used to describe HIV cure research should differentiate the long-term aspiration of achieving complete elimination of HIV from the body and possible shorter-term therapeutic advances, such as achieving medication free viral suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3010476095,"Obesity and elevation of circulating free fatty acids are associated with an accumulation and proinflammatory polarization of macrophages within metabolically active tissues, such as adipose tissue, muscle, liver, and pancreas. Beyond macrophages, neutrophils also accumulate in adipose and muscle tissues during high-fat diets and contribute to a state of local inflammation and insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms by which neutrophils are recruited to these tissues are largely unknown. Here we used a cell culture system as proof of concept to show that, upon exposure to a saturated fatty acid, palmitate, macrophages release nucleotides that attract neutrophils. Moreover, we found that palmitate up-regulates pannexin-1 channels in macrophages that mediate the attraction of neutrophils, shown previously to allow transfer of nucleotides across membranes. These findings suggest that proinflammatory macrophages release nucleotides through pannexin-1, a process that may facilitate neutrophil recruitment into metabolic tissues during obesity.

https://openalex.org/W3037657093,"We aimed to investigate the difference in serum uric acid(SUA)levels between subtypes of depression and normal population, and whether SUA can be used to identify bipolar disorder depressive episode and major depressive disorder and predict the length of hospital stay.1543 depression patients and 1515 healthy controls were obtained according to the entry and exclusion criteria from one mental health center of a tertiary hospital in southwestern China. The diagnosis and classification of depression was in accordance with ICD-10. The SUA value was derived from fasting plasma samples analysis. The level of SUA of all the participants was quantified using Roche cobas8000-c702-MSB automatic biochemical analyzer. Data were analyzed by SPSS18.0 statistical software package.Overall, the level of SUA in patients with depression was lower than that in normal control. Specifically, males' SUA levels were in the interval of [240, 323.3) and [323.3, 406.6), and women were in the [160, 233.3] levels. The SUA level of bipolar disorder depressive episode was higher compared to major depressive disorder level. Interestingly, male patients who were hospitalized for two weeks had higher SUA than those who were hospitalized for three weeks or four weeks.Our results suggest that the length of hospital stay may be associated with SUA, and when it is difficult to make a differential diagnosis of bipolar disorder depressive episode and major depressive disorder, the level of SUA may be considered. The adjustment of SUA as a method for treating depression needs to be carefully assessed."

https://openalex.org/W3010052010,"Background & aim In clinical practice, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been widely used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) beyond as well as within guideline recommendations. Here we aimed to verify whether two consecutive non-responses could be an optimal criterion for creating a rule to stop TACE being performed on these patients. Methods This study evaluated 200 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria, initially treated with TACE. TACE response was determined using the mRECIST criteria via dynamic CT or MRI. Median follow-up duration was 23.9 months. Results Within the 200 patients analyzed, 183 (91.5%) were male, with a total median age of 59.8 years. The mean size of the largest tumor was 6.8 cm, with 80 (40.0%) patients with ≥4 tumors. After the first TACE procedure, complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease were observed in 48 (24.0%), 87 (43.5%), 59 (29.5%) and 6 (3.0%) of patients, respectively. 45 (22.5%) patients showed no objective response (OR) following two consecutive TACE sessions. Of these, 28 received a subsequent TACE, with a 10.7% OR rate. Patients without OR showed poorer survival when compared to patients who achieved OR after repeated TACE. Multivariable analysis showed that size of the largest tumor >5cm and high alpha-fetoprotein of >200 ng/mL were significant factors associated with failure of OR to two consecutive TACE sessions. Conclusion Patients showing no OR to two consecutive TACE sessions will present a poor OR to subsequent TACE procedures. Early transition to systemic therapy may be advocated in such cases."
https://openalex.org/W3009116159,"Rationale, aims and objectives In recent years, the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI), especially omeprazole, has been associated with development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). These drugs are widely used worldwide. Although some studies have found an association between the use of PPI and the onset of acute renal failure and CKD. This study aims to analyze the association between the continuous use of omeprazole and the progression of CKD in adult and elderly individuals. Method A retrospective cohort study was conducted with patients followed up at a nephrology clinic in Brazil, in 2016 and 2017. Information about clinical and sociodemographic data, health behaviors, and medication use were collected from all patients diagnosed with CKD through consultation of medical charts and the Brazilian health information system (SIS). The participants were allocated into two groups: users and non-users of omeprazole, and the progression of CKD was then evaluated for each group. In the bivariate analysis, the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the quantitative variables between groups, and the Pearson/Fisher two-tailed chi-square test to compare the categorical variables were applied. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox regression. Results A total of 199 CKD patients were attended in the polyclinic, and of these, 42.7% were omeprazole users. There was a higher percentage of CKD progression in users (70.6%) compared to non-users (10.5%). The hazard ratio was 7.34 (CI: 3.94–13.71), indicating a higher risk of progression to worse stages of CKD in omeprazole users than in non-users. As for the other variables, no statistically significant difference was found between groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion An association between omeprazole use and progression of CKD stage was identified, showing a higher risk of disease evolution among omeprazole users."
https://openalex.org/W3010226827,"Background Online Cancer Support Groups (OCSG) are becoming an increasingly vital source of information, experiences and empowerment for patients with cancer. Despite significant contributions to physical, psychological and emotional wellbeing of patients, OCSG are yet to be formally recognised and used in multidisciplinary cancer support programs. This study highlights the opportunity of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in OCSG to address psychological morbidity, with supporting empirical evidence from prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Methods A validated framework of AI techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, was used to investigate PCa patient activities based on conversations in ten international OCSG (18,496 patients- 277,805 conversations). The specific focus was on activities that indicate psychological morbidity; the reasons for joining OCSG, deep emotions and the variation from joining through to milestones in the cancer trajectory. Comparative analyses were conducted using t-tests, One-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis. Findings PCa patients joined OCSG at four key phases of psychological distress; diagnosis, treatment, side-effects, and recurrence, the majority group was ‘treatment’ (61.72%). The four groups varied in expression of the intense emotional burden of cancer. The ‘side-effects’ group expressed increased negative emotions during the first month compared to other groups (p<0.01). A comparison of pre-treatment vs post-treatment emotions showed that joining pre-treatment had significantly lower negative emotions after 12-months compared to post-treatment (p<0.05). Long-term deep emotion analysis reveals that all groups except ‘recurrence’ improved in emotional wellbeing. Conclusion This is the first empirical study of psychological morbidity and deep emotions expressed by men with a new diagnosis of cancer, using AI. PCa patients joining pre-treatment had improved emotions, and long-term participation in OCSG led to an increase in emotional wellbeing, indicating a decrease in psychological distress. It is opportune to further investigate AI in OCSG for early psychological intervention as an adjunct to conventional intervention programs."
https://openalex.org/W3010272123,"A community outbreak of human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains was observed in Myanmar in 2017. We investigated the circulation patterns, antigenicity, and drug resistance of 2017 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Myanmar and characterized the full genome of influenza virus strains in Myanmar from in-patients and out-patients to assess the pathogenicity of the viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from out-patients and in-patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Yangon and Pyinmana City in Myanmar during January-December 2017. A total of 215 out-patients and 18 in-patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detected by virus isolation and real-time RT-PCR. Among the positive patients, 90.6% were less than 14 years old. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Myanmar were similar to the recommended Japanese influenza vaccine strain for 2017-2018 seasons (A/Singapore/GP1908/2015) and WHO recommended 2017 southern hemisphere vaccine component (A/Michigan/45/2015). Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin sequence showed that the Myanmar strains belonged to the genetic subclade 6B.1, possessing mutations of S162N and S164T at potential antigenic sites. However, the amino acid mutation at position 222, which may enhance the severity of disease and mortality, was not found. One case with no prior history of oseltamivir treatment possessed H275Y mutated virus in neuraminidase (NA), which confers resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir with elevated IC50 values. The full genome sequence of Myanmar strains showed no difference between samples from in-patients and out-patients, suggesting no additional viral mutations associated with patient severity. Several amino acid changes were observed in PB2, PB1, and M2 of Myanmar strains when compared to the vaccine strain and other Asian strains. However, no mutations associated with pathogenicity were found in the Myanmar strains, suggesting that viral factors cannot explain the underlying reasons of the massive outbreak in Myanmar. This study reported the first detection of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus in Myanmar, highlighting the importance of continuous antiviral monitoring and genetic characterization of the influenza virus in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W3010303536,"To investigate mosquito larval habitats and resistance to common insecticides in areas with high incidence rates of mosquito-borne diseases in Jining, Shandong Province, and to provide a scientific basis for the future prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases and the rational use of insecticides.From June to September 2018, mosquito habitat characteristics and species compositions in Jintun town were studied through a cross-sectional survey. Larvae and pupae were collected in different habitats using the standard dipping technique. A total of 7,815 mosquitoes, comprising 7 species from 4 genera, were collected. Among them, Culex pipiens pallens (n = 5,336, 68.28%) was the local dominant species and found in all four habitats (rice paddies, irrigation channels, water containers, drainage ditches). There were 1,708 Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (21.85%), 399 Anopheles sinensis (5.11%), 213 Armigeres subalbatus (2.72%), 124 Aedes albopictus (1.59%), and 35 other (Cx. bitaeniorhynchus and Cx. halifaxii) (0.45%) mosquito samples collected. Spearman correlation analysis was employed to evaluate the relationship between larval density and the physicochemical characteristics of the breeding habitat. It was found that the larval density of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus correlated positively with water depth (r = 0.927 p = 0.003), the larval density of An. sinensis correlated positively with dissolved oxygen (DO) (r = 0.775 p = 0.041) and the larval density of Cx. p. pallens correlated positively with ammonia nitrogen (r = 0.527 p = 0.002). Resistance bioassays were carried out on the dominant populations of Cx. p. pallens: mosquitoes presented very high resistance to cypermethrin and deltamethrin, moderate resistance to dichlorvos (DDVP), and low resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), with decreased susceptibility to propoxur.We showed that mosquito species vary across habitat type and that the mosquito larval density correlated positively with certain physicochemical characteristics in different habitats. In addition, Cx. p. pallens developed different levels of resistance to five insecticides. Vector monitoring should be strengthened after an epidemic, and further research should be conducted to scientifically prevent and kill mosquitoes."
https://openalex.org/W3010506244,"Background We aimed to examine the association between shift work and sleep quality in a diverse occupational type. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of self-reported sleep quality in 424 workers aged ≥21 using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We divided workers into two categories based on their PSQI score: (a) ≤5 (good sleep quality) and (b) >5 (poor sleep quality). We used multiple logistic regressions to assess the association between shift work and sleep quality adjusted for potential confounders. Results The mean age was 39.2 (SD = 11.3) years, with shift workers being older than their counterparts. Most workers were of Chinese ethnicity (63.9%). Males were significantly more likely to undertake shift work than females (89% v 11%, p-value<0.001), but it should be noted that the majority of workers was male (78.8%) in this sample of workers. Shift workers had a 198% increased odds of poor sleep quality compared to non-shift workers (OR = 2.98; 95% CI:1.53–5.81). Conclusion Shift work was significantly and independently associated with increased odds of poor sleep quality in this sample of workers. The present findings may inform employment guidelines and help develop workplace health promotion interventions aimed at improving sleep quality among workers and ultimately lead to a healthier workforce."
https://openalex.org/W3009734645,"Increasing traffic congestion and the advancements in technology have fostered the growth of alternative transportation modes such as dynamic ride-sharing. Smartphone technologies have enabled dynamic ride-sharing to thrive, as this type of transportation aims to establish ride matches between people with similar routes and schedules on short notice. Many automated matching methods are designed to improve system performance; such methods include minimizing process time, minimizing total system cost or maximizing total distance savings. However, the results may not provide the maximum benefits for the participants. This paper intends to develop an algorithm for optimizing matches when considering participants’ gender, age, employment status and social tendencies. The proposed matching algorithm also splits unmatched parts of drivers’ routes and creates new travel requests to find additional matches using these unmatched parts. Accordingly, this paper performs an extensive simulation study to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results indicate that route splits may increase the number of matches significantly when there is a shortage of drivers. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates the effects and potential benefits of utilizing a social compatibility score in the objective function."
https://openalex.org/W3010602450,"Background Despite increasing political will to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), there is a paucity of empiric data describing what health system indicators are useful surrogates of country-level progress towards UHC. We sought to determine what public health interventions were useful tracers of country-level UHC progress. Methods Across 183 countries we evaluated the extent to which 16 service delivery indicators explained variability in the UHC Service Coverage Index, (UHC SCI) a WHO-validated indicator of country-level health coverage. Dominance analyses, stratifying countries by World Bank income criteria, were used to determine which indicators were most important in in predicting UHC SCI scores. Findings Health workforce density ranked first overall, provision of basic sanitation and access to clean water ranked second, and provision of basic antenatal services ranked third. In analysis stratified by World Bank income criteria, health workforce density ranked first in Lower Middle Income-Countries (LMICs) (n = 45) and third in Upper Middle Income-Countries (UMICs) (n = 51). Conclusions While each country will have a different approach to achieving UHC, strengthening the health workforce will need to be a key priority if they are to be successful in achieving UHC."
https://openalex.org/W3009222562,"Aim To evaluate the serum concentrations of inflammatory mediators in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with or without renal alteration (RA) function. Methods Serum samples from 76 patients with T2DM and 24 healthy individuals were selected. Patients with T2DM were divided into two groups according to eGFR (> or < 60mL/min/1.73m2). Cytokines, chemokines and adipokines levels were evaluated using the Multiplex immunoassay and ELISA. Results TNFR1 and leptin were higher in the T2DM group with RA than in the T2DM group without RA and control group. All patients with T2DM showed increased resistin, IL-8, and MIP-1α compared to the control group. Adiponectin were higher and IL-4 decreased in the T2DM group with RA compared to the control group. eGFR positively correlated with IL-4 and negatively with TNFR1, TNFR2, and leptin in patients with T2DM. In the T2DM group with RA, eGFR was negatively correlated with TNFR1 and resistin. TNFR1 was positively correlated with resistin and leptin, as well as resistin with IL-8 and leptin. Conclusion Increased levels of TNFR1, adipokines, chemokines and decrease of IL-4 play important role in the inflammatory process developed in T2DM and decreased renal function. We also suggest that TNFR1 is a strong predictor of renal dysfunction in patients with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3010250857,"We have earlier reported that cell-free chromatin (cfCh) particles that are released from dying cells, or those that circulate blood, can readily enter into healthy cells, illegitimately integrate into their genomes and induce dsDNA breaks, apoptosis and intense activation of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that sepsis is caused by cfCh released from dying host cells following microbial infection leading to bystander host cell apoptosis and inflammation which are perpetuated in a vicious cycle with release of more cfCh from dying host cells. To test this hypothesis we used three cfCh inactivating agents namely 1) anti-histone antibody complexed nanoparticles which inactivate cfCh by binding to histones; 2) DNase I which inactivates cfCh by degrading its DNA component, and 3) a novel pro-oxidant combination of Resveratrol and Copper which, like DNase I, inactivates cfCh by degrading its DNA component. Female C57 BL/6 mice, 6-8 weeks old, were administered a single i.p. injection of LPS at a dose of 10 mg/Kg or 20 mg/Kg with or without concurrent treatment with the above cfCh inactivating agents. Administration of cfCh inactivating agents concurrently with LPS resulted in prevention of following pathological parameters: 1) release of cfCh in extra-cellular spaces of brain, lung and heart and in circulation; 2) release of inflammatory cytokines in circulation; 3) activation of DNA damage, apoptosis and inflammation in cells of thymus, spleen and in PBMCs; 4) DNA damage, apoptosis and inflammation in cells of lung, liver, heart, brain, kidney and small intestine; 5) liver and kidney dysfunction and elevation of serum lactate; 6) coagulopathy, fibrinolysis and thrombocytopenia; 7) lethality. We conclude that cfCh that are released from dying host cells in response to bacterial endotoxin represents a global instigator of sepsis. cfCh inactivation may provide a novel approach to management of sepsis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3010484680,"Background More than 80% of premature deaths due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) occur in low- and middle-income countries. However, access to, and affordability of medications remain a challenge in these countries. Objective To assess the availability, cost and affordability of essential cardiovascular medicines in the South West region of Cameroon. Methods In an audit of 63 medicine outlets, twenty-six essential medicines were surveyed using the World Health Organisation (WHO) /Health Action International methodology. Availability, costs and the ratio of the median price to the international reference price were evaluated in public, confessional, private facility medicine outlets, and community pharmacies. Affordability was assessed by calculating the number of days’ wages it will cost the lowest-paid unskilled government worker to purchase a month worth of chronic treatment. Findings Availability ranged from 25.3% (public facility outlets) to 49.2% (community pharmacies) for all medicines. This was higher in urban and semi-urban compared to rural outlets. Cost of medicines was highest in community pharmacies and lowest in public facility outlets. Aspirin, digoxin, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine were affordable (cost a day’s wage or less). Medicines for heart failure and dyslipidaemia (beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and statins) required 2–5 days and 6–13 days wages respectively for one month of chronic treatment. Conclusion Overall availability of CVD essential medicines was lower than WHO recommendations, and medicines were largely unaffordable. While primary prevention is pivotal, improving availability and affordability of medicines especially for public facilities would provide additional benefit in curbing the CVD burden."
https://openalex.org/W3010441134,"Background Antibiotic resistance is one of the major global health emergencies. One potential source of dissemination of resistant bacteria is mass gatherings, e.g. mass bathing events. We evaluated the physicochemical parameters of water quality and the antibiotic resistance pattern in commensal Escherichia coli from river-water and river-sediment in pre-, during- and post-mass bathing events in river Kshipra, Central India. Method/Design Water and sediment samples were collected from three selected points during eight mass bathing events during 2014–2016. Water quality parameters (physical, chemical and microbiological) were analyzed using standard methods. In river water and sediment samples, antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isolated E. coli to 17 antibiotics were tested. Results pH, turbidity and dissolved oxygen were significantly lower and total dissolved solid, free carbon dioxide were higher during mass bathing, whilst TSS, BOD and COD were lowest in pre-bathing and highest in post-bathing period. E.coli with multi drug resistance (MDR) or extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production were between 9–44% and 6–24%, respectively in river-water as well as river-sediment. Total coliform count/ml and E. coli count were higher during-and post-bathing in river water than in pre-bathing period. Thus, the percentage of resistance was significantly higher during and post-bathing period (p<.05) than in pre-bathing. Colony forming unit (CFU)/ml in river-sediment was much higher than in river-water. Percentage of resistance was significantly higher in river-water (p<.05) than in river-sediment. Conclusions Antibiotic resistance in E.coli isolated from the Kshipra River showed significant variation during mass bathing events. Guidelines and regulatory standards are needed to control environmental dissemination of resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3009829673,"In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), oncogenic driver mutations including those in KRAS and EGFR are typically mutually exclusive. However, recent reports indicate that multiple driver mutations are found in a certain percentage of cancers, and that the therapeutic responses of such cases with co-mutations of driver genes are largely unclear. Here, using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, we generated isogenic cell lines harboring one or two copies of an EGFR-activating mutation from the human NSCLC cell line A549, which is known to harbor a homozygous KRAS gene mutation. In comparison with parent cells with KRAS mutation alone, cells with concomitant EGFR mutation exhibited higher sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but not to conventional anti-cancer drugs. In particular, cells with two copies of EGFR mutation were markedly more sensitive to EGFR-TKIs compared with parent cells. Thus, the presence of concomitant EGFR mutation can affect the TKI response of KRAS-mutated cells, implying that EGFR-TKI may represent an effective treatment option against NSCLC with EGFR/KRAS co-mutation."
https://openalex.org/W3009846311,"To effectively reduce traffic violations that often cause severe crashes at signalized intersections, exploring their contributing factors seems hugely urgent and essential. This study attempted to investigate the influence factors of wrong-way driving (WWD), red-light-running (RLR), violating traffic markings (VTM), and driving in the inaccurate oriented lane (DIOL) at signalized intersections by using data collected from traffic enforcement camera in Hohhot, China. To this end, an ordinary multinomial logit model was developed. By considering the unobserved heterogeneity between observations, a random effects multinomial logit model was proposed as well. After that, the marginal effects of explanatory variables were computed. The outcomes showed that non-local vehicles were more likely to commit WWD and VTM than local vehicles. WWD and RLR frequently occurred in the daytime and evening (6:00-23:59), and on most days within a week. RLR and DIOL mainly happened in June and July. The left-turn lane ratio significantly increased RLR and DIOL. The cloudy, partly cloudy, and rainy days obviously increased WWD and VTM. The temperature from 21 to 30 degrees centigrade was apparently associated with the higher likelihoods of RLR and DIOL. According to the findings of this study, some intervention measures, targeting different vehicle types and considering temporal factors, road, and weather conditions, were recommended to reduce WWD, RLR, VTM, and DIOL at signalized intersections."
https://openalex.org/W3010338916,"Music and language have long been considered two distinct cognitive faculties governed by domain-specific cognitive and neural mechanisms. Recent work into the domain-specificity of pitch processing in both domains appears to suggest pitch processing to be governed by shared neural mechanisms. The current study aimed to explore the domain-specificity of pitch processing by simultaneously presenting pitch contours in speech and music to speakers of a tonal language, and measuring behavioral response and event-related potentials (ERPs). Native speakers of Mandarin were exposed to concurrent pitch contours in melody and speech. Contours in melody emulated those in speech were either congruent or incongruent with the pitch contour of the lexical tone (i.e., rising or falling). Component magnitudes of the N2b and N400 were used as indices of lexical processing. We found that the N2b was modulated by melodic pitch; incongruent item evoked significantly stronger amplitude. There was a trend of N400 to be modulated in the same way. Interestingly, these effects were present only on rising tones. Amplitude and time-course of the N2b and N400 may suggest an interference of melodic pitch contours with both early and late stages of phonological and semantic processing."

This study aimed to characterize the epidemiology and risk factors for poor outcome of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in people living with HIV (PLHIV) in a rural setting in Tanzania.We included PLHIV >18 years of age enrolled into the Kilombero and Ulanga antiretroviral cohort (KIULARCO) from 2013 to 2017. We assessed the diagnosis of tuberculosis by integrating prospectively collected clinical and microbiological data. We calculated prevalence- and incidence rates and used Cox regression analysis to evaluate the association of risk factors in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) with a combined endpoint of lost to follow-up (LTFU) and death.We included 3,129 subjects (64.5% female) with a median age of 38 years (interquartile range [IQR] 31-46) and a median CD4+ cell count of 229/μl (IQR 94-421) at baseline. During the median follow-up of 1.25 years (IQR 0.46-2.85), 574 (18.4%) subjects were diagnosed with tuberculosis, whereof 175 (30.5%) had an extrapulmonary manifestation. Microbiological evidence by Acid-Fast-Bacillus stain (AFB-stain) or Xpert® MTB/RIF was present in 178/483 (36.9%) patients with pulmonary and in 28/175 (16.0%) of patients with extrapulmonary manifestations, respectively. Incidence density rates for pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB and EPTB were 17.9/1000person-years (py) (95% CI 14.2-22.6) and 5.8/1000 py (95% CI 4.0-8.5), respectively. The combined endpoint of death and LTFU was observed in 1058 (33.8%) patients, most frequently in the subgroup of EPTB (47.2%). Patients with EPTB had a higher rate of the composite outcome of death/LTFU after TB diagnosis than with PTB [HR 1.63, (1.14-2.31); p = 0.006]. The adjusted hazard ratios [HR (95% CI)] for death/LTFU in EPTB patients were significantly increased for patients aged >45 years [HR 1.95, (1.15-3.3); p = 0.013], whereas ART use was protective [HR 0.15, (0.08-0.27); p <0.001].Extrapulmonary tuberculosis was a frequent manifestation in this cohort of PLHIV. The diagnosis of EPTB in the absence of histopathology and mycobacterial culture remains challenging even with availability of Xpert® MTB/RIF. Patients with EPTB had increased rates of mortality and LTFU despite early recognition of the disease after enrollment."

https://openalex.org/W3009193245,"Microbes alter their transcriptomic profiles in response to the environment. The physiological conditions experienced by a microbial community can thus be inferred using meta-transcriptomic sequencing by comparing transcription levels of specifically chosen genes. However, this analysis requires accurate reference genomes to identify the specific genes from which RNA reads originate. In addition, such an analysis should avoid biases in transcript counts related to differences in organism abundance. In this study we describe an approach to address these difficulties. Sample-specific meta-genomic assembled genomes (MAGs) were used as reference genomes to accurately identify the origin of RNA reads, and transcript ratios of genes with opposite transcription responses were compared to eliminate biases related to differences in organismal abundance, an approach hereafter named the “diametric ratio” method. We used this approach to probe the environmental conditions experienced by Escherichia spp. in the gut of 4 premature infants, 2 of whom developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a severe inflammatory intestinal disease. We analyzed twenty fecal samples taken from four premature infants (4–6 time points from each infant), and found significantly higher diametric ratios of genes associated with low oxygen levels in samples of infants later diagnosed with NEC than in samples without NEC. We also show this method can be used for examining other physiological conditions, such as exposure to nitric oxide and osmotic pressure. These study results should be treated with caution, due to the presence of confounding factors that might also distinguish between NEC and control infants. Nevertheless, together with benchmarking analyses, we show here that the diametric ratio approach can be applied for evaluating the physiological conditions experienced by microbes in situ. Results from similar studies can be further applied for designing diagnostic methods to detect NEC in its early developmental stages."
https://openalex.org/W3009737181,"The Kura-Araxes cultural tradition (ca. 3500-2200 BCE) was one of the most widespread archaeological horizons in Southwest Asian prehistory, spanning from the Caucasus to the southern Levant. Although several decades of research have considerably increased our knowledge about this Early Bronze Age tradition, the social and economic organization of its communities remains a matter of much debate. Interpretations of the organization of Kura-Araxes craft economies range from need-based household production to extra-household specialized production for exchange and elite consumption. This issue stems from the absence of a systematic approach to studying the spatial organization of craft production; that is the study of the spatial distribution of archaeological material across multiple contexts to reconstruct the location of various activities involved in craft production. Extensive evidence for craft production at Köhne Shahar (KSH)-one of the largest Kura-Araxes sites ever discovered-provides an opportunity for such a study. Faunal remains are among the most abundant types of remains recovered at KSH Phases IV and V (ca. 2800-2500 BCE), where bone and antler were cached and then shaped into tools that were used to manufacture other objects like beads. We use zooarchaeology to study the spatial distribution of worked and unworked animal remains to analyze the function of several structures and spaces in the craft production areas to ultimately gain better insight into the organization of labor and the social organization of the community. We identify evidence for two antler storage units, numerous waste dumps, and several workshops. Some workshops manufactured a similar range of small, possibly ornamental objects, while others specialized in the manufacture of certain goods, textiles, and objects made of animal horn. When combined with other lines of evidence, our observations point to a community-wide production economy with little direct evidence for a stratified social organization. We argue that the absence of a strict social hierarchy at KSH and across the Kura-Araxes world is not evidence of the absence of social complexity, but the presence of a horizontal or heterarchical social order."
https://openalex.org/W3010419777,"Inhibition of the key glycolytic activator 6-phosphofructokinase 2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (PFKFB3) by 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO) strongly attenuates pathological angiogenesis in cancer and inflammation. In addition to modulating endothelial proliferation and migration, 3PO also dampens proinflammatory activation of endothelial cells and experimental inflammation in vivo, suggesting a potential for 3PO in the treatment of chronic inflammation. The aim of our study was to explore if the anti-inflammatory action of 3PO in human endothelial cells was mediated by inhibition of PFKFB3 and glycolysis and assess if other means of PFKFB3 inhibition reduced inflammatory activation in a similar manner. We found that 3PO caused a rapid and transient reduction in IL-1β- and TNF-induced phosphorylation of both IKKα/β and JNK, thus inhibiting signaling through the NFκB and the stress-activated kinase pathways. However, in contrast to 3PO-treatment, neither shRNA-mediated silencing of PFKFB3 nor treatment with the alternative PFKFB3 inhibitor 7,8-dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-chromen-4-one (YN1) prevented cytokine-induced NFκB signaling and upregulation of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and E-selectin, implying off target effects of 3PO. Collectively, our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory action of 3PO in human endothelial cells is not limited to inhibition of PFKFB3 and cellular glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W3009209832,"Due to inadequate human and financial resource support, the development of mental health services in Cambodia has been undertaken by various non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Schizophrenia is the most common functional psychotic disorder, causing severe and chronic symptoms, and the programs provided by the NGOs should have enhanced the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their caregivers; however, epidemiological research, which is a driving force behind the recognition of mental health as a global public health concern, is lacking for schizophrenia in Cambodia. This study therefore aimed to create QoL evaluation questionnaires available in Khmer (the Cambodian language) for patients with schizophrenia and family caregivers, and to identify the social determinants and predictors of their QoL. This cross-sectional study recruited 59 patients and 59 caregivers attending three clinics operated by two NGOs: the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) Cambodia and the Supporters for Mental Health (SUMH) Cambodia. We conducted linguistic validation of the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Questionnaire 18-item version (S-QoL 18) and the Schizophrenia Caregiver Questionnaire (SCQ), then analyzed correlations between the QoL dimensions and socio-demographic factors. The main findings of this study were as follows: 1) the newly created Khmer versions of S-QoL 18 and SCQ are relatively good psychometric tools that are suitable for research to identify patients’ and caregivers’ needs to improve their QoL; and 2) engaging in paid work or being of the post-Khmer Rouge generation results in higher QoL for patients, but having low household economic status or being affected by chronic disease leads to lower QoL for family caregivers. These findings are useful for enabling community mental health professionals and aid organizations to create programs to lessen the patient and caregiver burden in Cambodia. Further research is necessary to develop practical projects that will improve patients’ and caregivers’ QoL in various clinical settings in Cambodia."

Lp(a) is composed of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) covalently bound to apolipoprotein B of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Many of apo(a)'s potential pathological properties, such as inhibition of plasmin generation, have been attributed to its main structural domains, the kringles, and have been proposed to be mediated by their lysine-binding sites. However, available small-molecule inhibitors, such as lysine analogs, bind unselectively to kringle domains and are therefore unsuitable for functional characterization of specific kringle domains. Here, we discovered small molecules that specifically bind to the apo(a) kringle domains KIV-7, KIV-10, and KV. Chemical synthesis yielded compound AZ-05, which bound to KIV-10 with a Kd of 0.8 μm and exhibited more than 100-fold selectivity for KIV-10, compared with the other kringle domains tested, including plasminogen kringle 1. To better understand and further improve ligand selectivity, we determined the crystal structures of KIV-7, KIV-10, and KV in complex with small-molecule ligands at 1.6–2.1 Å resolutions. Furthermore, we used these small molecules as chemical probes to characterize the roles of the different apo(a) kringle domains in in vitro assays. These assays revealed the assembly of Lp(a) from apo(a) and LDL, as well as potential pathophysiological mechanisms of Lp(a), including (i) binding to fibrin, (ii) stimulation of smooth-muscle cell proliferation, and (iii) stimulation of LDL uptake into differentiated monocytes.

We conducted this study to evaluate the risk factors affecting the development of CHD in Xinjiang, and to obtain valuable information for formulating appropriate local public health policies.We conducted a nested case-control study with 277 confirmed CHD cases and 554 matched controls. The association of the risk factors with the risk of CHD was assessed using the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Multiplicative interactions were evaluated by entering interaction terms in the Cox proportional hazard model. The additive interactions among the risk factors were assessed by the index of additive interaction.The risk of CHD increased with frequent high-fat food consumption, dyslipidemia, obesity, and family history of CHD after adjustment for drinking, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, family history of hypertension, and family history of diabetes. We noted consistent interactions between family history of CHD and frequent high-fat food consumption, family history of CHD and obesity, frequent high-fat food consumption and obesity, frequent high-fat food consumption and dyslipidemia, and obesity and dyslipidemia. The risk of CHD events increased with the presence of the aforementioned interactions.Frequent high-fat food consumption, family history of CHD, dyslipidemia and obesity were independent risk factors for CHD, and their interactions are important for public health interventions in patients with CHD in Xinjiang."
https://openalex.org/W3010035568,"Skin Replacement Technologies (SRTs) emerged as skin alternatives for burns, large excisions or trauma. The original publications represent the available knowledge on a subject and can be modeled as a logistic S-curve which depicts the technology's evolution life-cycle. The Technology Innovation Maturation Evaluation (TIME) model was previously introduced to study the life-cycles of biotechnologies.PubMed database was searched 1900-2015 to review relevant publications. All skin replacement or regeneration products on the US market were included. The TIME model was applied to assess evolutionary patterns for each technology.Three SRT clusters were identified: processed biologics technologies (PBT), extracellular matrix technologies (EMT), and cell-based technologies (CBT). Publications on EMTs and CBTs start decades after PBTs, however, are greater in number and follow an ascending trend. PBTs reached a plateau, suggesting near-senescence. The CBT curve was non-logarithmic and the TIME model could not be applied. The technology initiation point (Ti) for PBTs was 1939 and the establishment point (Te) 1992. For EMT, Ti was 1966 and Te 2010. Sixty-one products were identified (49 EMTs, 7 CBTs, 5 PBTs). PBTs appeared 11 years after Te and EMTs four years prior Te. Thirty-seven products in the EMT category, and one in the PBT category, were developed before Te. The most common FDA regulatory mechanism for SRT was found to be 510(k) followed by HCT/P 361.Innovation is an indicator of the evolution of technology. The number of publications can be used as a metric of this evolution and the fact that the SRT field falls under such pattern demonstrates that SRT is an innovation-based industry. EMT is the most efficient cluster. Few products from SRT registered a commercial success, and from those that did, those technologies were generally found to be part of the most productive cluster, 1st in concept, conceptually simple, easily regulated and produced, cost and clinically efficient, reimbursable, able to solve a specific problem efficiently, had a platform technology design that allowed for further innovation and adaptation for other uses and, as found by application of the TIME model, appear prior to technology establishment."
https://openalex.org/W3009398727,"A homozygous mutation in growth hormone 1 (GH1) was recently identified in an individual with growth failure. This mutation, c.705G>C, causes replacement of cysteine at position 53 of the 191-amino-acid sequence of 22 kDa human GH (hGH) with serine (p.C53S). This hGH molecule (hereafter referred to as GH-C53S) lacks the disulfide bond between p.Cys-53 and p.Cys-165, which is highly conserved among species. It has been reported previously that monomeric GH-C53S has reduced bioactivity compared with WT GH (GH-WT) because of its decreased ability to bind and activate the GH receptor in vitro. In this study, we discovered that substitution of p.Cys-53 in hGH significantly increased formation of hGH dimers in pituitary cells. We expressed His-tagged hGH variants in the cytoplasm of genetically modified Rosetta-gami B DE3 Escherichia coli cells, facilitating high-yield production. We observed that the bioactivity of monomeric GH-C53S is 25.2% of that of GH-WT and that dimeric GH-C53S–His has no significant bioactivity in cell proliferation assays. We also found that the expression of GH-C53S in pituitary cells deviates from that of GH-WT. GH-C53S was exclusively stained in the Golgi apparatus, and no secretory granules formed for this variant, impairing its stimulated release. In summary, the unpaired Cys-165 in GH-C53S forms a disulfide bond linking two hGH molecules in pituitary cells. We conclude that the GH-C53S dimer is inactive and responsible for the growth failure in the affected individual.

https://openalex.org/W3010603432,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are membrane channels that provide for transport of water and other small molecules across the lipid bilayer of cells. Their function is essential for physiologic processes such as cell volume regulation, chondrocyte hypertrophy during appendicular skeletal growth, water reabsorption in the kidney tubules, and water excretion by the salivary glands. The ten AQP isoforms show tissue specificity and are involved in different pathologies and inflammatory diseases. This study addresses the hypothesis that arthritis, periodontitis, and temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) can be influenced by variation in the AQP genes at 12q13.12 locus. Salivary samples of 688 individuals were obtained from the Dental Registry and DNA Repository project at the University of Pittsburgh. Ten polymorphisms in four AQP genes (AQP1, 2, 5, and 6) were genotyped and correlated to disease status as reported by patients. Associations were found between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs467323 in AQP2 and TMD in both genotypic (p = 0.03) and recessive (p = 0.02) models, and between rs1996315 in AQP6 and periodontitis (p = 0.05). Combined analysis of TMD and periodontitis showed an association with rs3741559 in AQP2 (p = 0.02). When conducting haplotype analysis of rs467323 and rs10875989 in AQP2, the haplotype CT showed an association with the TMD phenotype (p = 0.007). Our results suggest that the aquaporin locus at 12q13.12 may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory conditions such as periodontitis and TMD. Thus, oral and skeletal health are correlated and potential susceptibility screening strategies may be developed."
https://openalex.org/W3009770692,"Background Delivery by cesarean section (C-section) is associated with adverse short-term and long-term infant outcomes. Given that antibiotics during early life are prescribed for infant outcomes that are more likely among c-section deliveries, we hypothesized that postnatal antibiotic exposure will be greater among c-section infants compared to vaginally delivered infants. Objective The aim of this paper was to evaluate if mode of infant delivery was associated with patterns of systemic antibiotic exposure in children during their first three years. Methods Pediatric electronic health records from UFHealth, 2011 to 2017 were reviewed. We included singleton, term infants (37–42 weeks gestation) with a birth weight ≥ 2500 grams, with documented mode of delivery and well visits on record. Infants with a neonatal intensive care unit stay were excluded. Both oral and intravenous antibiotics for a 10-day duration were classified as a single episode. The primary outcome was antibiotic episodes in the first three years of life, and a sub-analysis was performed to compare broad-spectrum versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic exposures. Results The mean number of antibiotic episodes in 4,024 full-term infants was 0.34 (SD = 0.79) and 24.1% of infants had at least one antibiotic episode. Penicillins were the most prescribed antibiotic in children 0–1 years (66.9%) and cephalosporins were the most common antibiotic prescribed for children 1–3 years (56.2%). We did not detect a meaningful or significant rate ratio (RR) between mode of delivery and overall antibiotic episodes 1.14 (95% CI 0.99, 1.31), broad-spectrum episodes 1.19 (95% CI 0.93, 1.52, or narrow-spectrum episodes 1.14 (95% CI 0.97, 1.34). Conclusion Our results do not support the hypothesis that postnatal antibiotic exposure was greater among infants delivered by cesarean section compare to infants delivered vaginally during the first three years of life."

https://openalex.org/W3010265463,"Climate change is exacerbating drought and water stress in several global regions, including some parts of the United States. During times of drought in the U.S., municipal governments, private water suppliers and non-profits commonly deploy advocacy campaigns and incentive programs targeting reductions in residential water use through actions including: repairing leaks, shutting off taps, and installing new water-saving appliances. We asked whether these campaigns have the potential to alleviate water stress during drought at the county scale by estimating the potential impact of full adoption of such actions. In 2010, we show that the maximum potential use reductions from these residential actions may only alleviate water stress in 6% (174) of U.S. counties. The potential impact of domestic programs is limited by the relative dominance of agriculture water withdrawal, the primary water user in 50% of U.S. counties. While residential actions do achieve some water demand savings, they are not sufficient to alter water stress in the majority of the continental U.S. We recommend redirecting advocacy efforts and incentives to individual behaviors that can influence agricultural water use."
https://openalex.org/W3010409312,"Controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) can cause diaphragmatic motionlessness to induce diaphragmatic dysfunction. Partial maintenance of spontaneous breathing (SB) can reduce ventilation-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). However, to what extent SB is maintained in CMV can attenuate or even prevent VIDD has been rarely reported. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between SB intensity and VIDD and to identify what intensity of SB maintained in CMV can effectively avoid VIDD. Adult rats were randomly divided according to different SB intensities: SB (0% pressure controlled ventilation (PCV)), high-intensity SB (20% PCV), medium-intensity SB (40% PCV), medium-low intensity SB (60% PCV), low-intensity SB (80% PCV), and PCV (100% PCV). The animals underwent 24-h controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV). The transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), the maximal Pdi (Pdi max) when phrenic nerves were stimulated, Pdi/Pdi max, and the diaphragmatic tonus under different frequencies of electric stimulations were determined. Calpain and caspase-3 were detected using ELISA and the cross-section areas (CSAs) of different types of muscle fibers were measured. The Pdi showed a significant decrease from 20% PCV and the Pdi max showed a significant decrease from 40% PCV (P<0.05). In vivo and vitro diaphragmatic tonus exhibited a significant decrease from 40% PCV and 20% PCV, respectively (P<0.05). From 20% PCV, the CSAs of types I, IIa, and IIb/x muscle fibers showed significant differences, which reached the lowest levels at 100% PCV. SB intensity is negatively associated with the development of VIDD. Maintenance of SB at an intensity of 60%-80% may effectively prevent the occurrence of VIDD."
https://openalex.org/W3010602034,"This study aims to provide basic data on the types and frequency of chemical ingestions and the clinical outcomes of chemical ingestion injury.This study retrospectively analyzed the data obtained from the Emergency Department-Based Injury In-depth Surveillance of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (South Korea) from 2011 to 2016. Patients ingesting chemicals aged ≥ 18 years were included, but those ingesting unknown chemical substances or with unknown clinical outcomes were excluded.This study included 2,712 (47.2% were men and 52.8% were women, mean age, 47.05 years) patients ingesting chemicals. Unintentional and intentional ingestions were reported in 1,673 (61.7%) and 1,039 (38.3%), respectively. The most commonly ingested chemical substances were hypochlorites, detergents, ethanol, and acetic acid. In the unintentional ingestion group, the most common chemicals upon admission were hypochlorites (74), glacial acetic acid (60), and detergent (33). The admission rates were 60% for glacial acetic acid, 58.3% ethylene glycol, and 30.4% other alkali agents. In the intentional ingestion group, the most common chemicals upon admission were hypochlorites (242), glacial acetic acid (79), ethylene glycol (42), and detergent (41). The admission rates were 91.9% for glacial acetic acid, 87.5% ethylene glycol, 85.7% potassium cyanide, and 81.4% hydrochloric acid. In total, 79 deaths (10 unintentional ingestions, 69 intentional ingestion) were reported, and glacial acetic acid had an odds ratio of 9.299 for mortality.We compared the intentional and unintentional ingestion groups, and analyzed the factors affecting hospital admission and mortality in each group. The types and clinical outcomes of chemical ingestion varied depending on the purpose of chemical ingestion. The findings are considered beneficial in establishing treatment policies for patients ingesting chemicals."
