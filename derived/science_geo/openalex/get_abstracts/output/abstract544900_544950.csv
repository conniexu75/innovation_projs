While it is agreed that these pressures are increasing, views divide on how they may be alleviated. Some suggest technological advances will automatically keep us from transgressing key environmental thresholds; others that policy reform can reconcile economic and ecological goals; while a third school argues that only a fundamental shift in societal values can keep human demands within the Earth's ecological limits. Here we use novel integrated analysis of the energy-water-food nexus, rural land use (including biodiversity), material flows and climate change to explore whether mounting ecological pressures in Australia can be reversed, while the population grows and living standards improve. We show that, in the right circumstances, economic and environmental outcomes can be decoupled. Although economic growth is strong across all scenarios, environmental performance varies widely: pressures are projected to more than double, stabilize or fall markedly by 2050. However, we find no evidence that decoupling will occur automatically. Nor do we find that a shift in societal values is required. Rather, extensions of current policies that mobilize technology and incentivize reduced pressure account for the majority of differences in environmental performance. Our results show that Australia can make great progress towards sustainable prosperity, if it chooses to do so."
https://openalex.org/W2166143354,"We have used homozygous albumin enhancer/promoter-driven urokinase-type plasminogen activator/severe combined immunodeficient (uPA/SCID) mice as hosts for chimeric mice with humanized livers. However, uPA/SCID mice show four disadvantages: the human hepatocytes (h-heps) replacement index in mouse liver is decreased due to deletion of uPA transgene by homologous recombination, kidney disorders are likely to develop, body size is small, and hemizygotes cannot be used as hosts as more frequent homologous recombination than homozygotes. To solve these disadvantages, we have established a novel host strain that has a transgene containing albumin promoter/enhancer and urokinase-type plasminogen activator cDNA and has a SCID background (cDNA-uPA/SCID). We applied the embryonic stem cell technique to simultaneously generate a number of transgenic lines, and found the line with the most appropriate levels of uPA expression-not detrimental but with a sufficiently damaged liver. We transplanted h-heps into homozygous and hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice via the spleen, and monitored their human albumin (h-alb) levels and body weight. Blood h-alb levels and body weight gradually increased in the hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice and were maintained until they were approximately 30 weeks old. By contrast, blood h-alb levels and body weight in uPA/SCID chimeric mice decreased from 16 weeks of age onwards. A similar decrease in body weight was observed in the homozygous cDNA-uPA/SCID genotype, but h-alb levels were maintained until they were approximately 30 weeks old. Microarray analyses revealed identical h-heps gene expression profiles in homozygous and hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice were identical to that observed in the uPA/SCID mice. Furthermore, like uPA/SCID chimeric mice, homozygous and hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID chimeric mice were successfully infected with hepatitis B virus and C virus. These results indicate that hemizygous cDNA-uPA/SCID mice may be novel and useful hosts for producing chimeric mice for use in future long-term studies, including hepatitis virus infection analysis or drug toxicity studies."
https://openalex.org/W2125836759,"The lemurs of Madagascar are among the most threatened mammalian taxa in the world, with habitat loss due to shifting cultivation and timber harvest heavily contributing to their precarious state. Deforestation often leads to fragmentation, resulting in mixed-habitat matrices throughout a landscape where disturbed areas are prone to invasion by exotic plants. Our study site, the Mandena littoral forest (southeast Madagascar), is a matrix of littoral forest, littoral swamp, and Melaleuca swamp habitats. Here, Melaleuca quinquenervia has invaded the wetland ecosystem, creating a mono-dominant habitat that currently provides the only potential habitat corridor between forest fragments. We sought to understand the role of this invasive Melaleuca swamp on the behavioral ecology of a threatened, small-bodied folivore, the southern bamboo lemur (Hapalemur meridionalis). We collected botanical and behavioral data on four groups of H. meridionalis between January and December 2013. Our results confirm Melaleuca swamp as an important part of their home range: while lemurs seasonally limited activities to certain habitats, all groups were capable of utilizing this invasive habitat for feeding and resting. Furthermore, the fact that Hapalemur use an invasive plant species as a dispersal corridor increases our knowledge of their ecological flexibility, and may be useful in the conservation management of remaining threatened populations."
https://openalex.org/W2179880336,"Soil microbial communities play a critical role in nutrient transformation and storage in all ecosystems. Quantifying the seasonal and long-term temporal extent of genetic and functional variation of soil microorganisms in response to biotic and abiotic changes within and across ecosystems will inform our understanding of the effect of climate change on these processes. We examined spatial and seasonal variation in microbial communities based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition across four biomes: a tropical broadleaf forest (Hawaii), taiga (Alaska), semiarid grassland-shrubland (Utah), and a subtropical coniferous forest (Florida). In this study, we used a team-based instructional approach leveraging the iPlant Collaborative to examine publicly available National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) 16S gene and PLFA measurements that quantify microbial diversity, composition, and growth. Both profiling techniques revealed that microbial communities grouped strongly by ecosystem and were predominately influenced by three edaphic factors: pH, soil water content, and cation exchange capacity. Temporal variability of microbial communities differed by profiling technique; 16S-based community measurements showed significant temporal variability only in the subtropical coniferous forest communities, specifically through changes within subgroups of Acidobacteria. Conversely, PLFA-based community measurements showed seasonal shifts in taiga and tropical broadleaf forest systems. These differences may be due to the premise that 16S-based measurements are predominantly influenced by large shifts in the abiotic soil environment, while PLFA-based analyses reflect the metabolically active fraction of the microbial community, which is more sensitive to local disturbances and biotic interactions. To address the technical issue of the response of soil microbial communities to sample storage temperature, we compared 16S-based community structure in soils stored at -80°C and -20°C and found no significant differences in community composition based on storage temperature. Free, open access datasets and data sharing platforms are powerful tools for integrating research and teaching in undergraduate and graduate student classrooms. They are a valuable resource for fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, testing ecological theory, model development and validation, and generating novel hypotheses. Training in data analysis and interpretation of large datasets in university classrooms through project-based learning improves the learning experience for students and enables their use of these significant resources throughout their careers."

https://openalex.org/W2116463796,"Early embryonic loss and altered gene expression in in vitro produced blastocysts are believed to be partly caused by aberrant DNA methylation. However, specific embryonic stage which is sensitive to in vitro culture conditions to alter the DNA methylation profile of the resulting blastocysts remained unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the stage specific effect of in vitro culture environment on the DNA methylation response of the resulting blastocysts. For this, embryos cultured in vitro until zygote (ZY), 4-cell (4C) or 16-cell (16C) were transferred to recipients and the blastocysts were recovery at day 7 of the estrous cycle. Another embryo group was cultured in vitro until blastocyst stage (IVP). Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of ZY, 4C, 16C and IVP blastocyst groups were then determined with reference to blastocysts developed completely under in vivo condition (VO) using EmbryoGENE DNA Methylation Array. To assess the contribution of methylation changes on gene expression patterns, the DNA methylation data was superimposed to the transcriptome profile data. The degree of DNA methylation dysregulation in the promoter and/or gene body regions of the resulting blastocysts was correlated with successive stages of development the embryos advanced under in vitro culture before transfer to the in vivo condition. Genomic enrichment analysis revealed that in 4C and 16C blastocyst groups, hypermethylated loci were outpacing the hypomethylated ones in intronic, exonic, promoter and proximal promoter regions, whereas the reverse was observed in ZY blastocyst group. However, in the IVP group, as much hypermethylated as hypomethylated probes were detected in gene body and promoter regions. In addition, gene ontology analysis indicated that differentially methylated regions were found to affected several biological functions including ATP binding in the ZY group, programmed cell death in the 4C, glycolysis in 16C and genetic imprinting and chromosome segregation in IVP blastocyst groups. Furthermore, 1.6, 3.4, 3.9 and 9.4% of the differentially methylated regions that were overlapped to the transcriptome profile data were negatively correlated with the gene expression patterns in ZY, 4C, 16C and IVP blastocyst groups, respectively. Therefore, this finding indicated that suboptimal culture condition during preimplantation embryo development induced changes in the DNA methylation landscape of the resulting blastocysts in a stage dependent manner and the altered DNA methylation pattern was only partly explained the observed aberrant gene expression patterns of the blastocysts."
https://openalex.org/W2134549630,"Physical activity (PA) is associated with health enhancement. The aim of this study was to assess: 1) levels and patterns of PA in university students by using accelerometers; and 2) the percentage of fulfilment of PA recommendations for adults, according to different public health guidelines.Observational cross-sectional study (Cuenca's Adults Study) involving 296 (206 women) healthy Spanish university students aged 18-25 years old. Participants wore the ActiGraph GT1M accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Total PA, steps and time spent in sedentary time, light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was assessed, and the prevalence of sufficient PA was calculated according to various public health guidelines.No sex differences in total PA were found. University students were more sedentary during weekend days than weekdays (p<0.05). Only 30.3% of participants accumulated 30 min/day at least five days a week of MVPA. A total of 5.4% of students met the recommendation of 150 min/week of MVPA or 75 min/week of vigorous PA, in PA bouts of at least 10 min. using the same definition, but on five or more days a week, only 0.5% students were found to meet the recommendation. In addition, only 0.5% of students met the recommendation of 30 min/day of MVPA, at least five days a week and in bouts of at least 10 min. Finally, 28.1% of the students met the recommendation of 10,000 steps/day.Our study shows a high incidence of sedentary time in university students. The number of students meeting PA recommendations significantly differed depending on the recommendation proposed. Specific strategies to promote PA in this population are necessary as well as an agreement as to which PA guidelines should be used."

https://openalex.org/W2108509308,"The loss of mass from protostars, in the form of a jet or outflow, is a necessary counterpart to protostellar mass accretion. Outflow ejection events probably vary in their velocity and/or in the rate of mass loss. Such `episodic' ejection events have been observed during the Class 0 protostellar phase (the early accretion stage), and continue during the subsequent class I phase that marks the first one million years of star formation. Previously observed episodic-ejection sources were relatively isolated; however, the most common sites of star formation are clusters. Outflows link protostars with their environment and provide a viable source of turbulence that is necessary for regulating star formation in clusters, but it is not known how an accretion-driven jet or outflow in a clustered environment manifests itself in its earliest stage. This early stage is important in establishing the initial conditions for momentum and energy transfer to the environment as the protostar and cluster evolve. Here we report that an outflow from a very young class 0 protostar, at the hub of the very active and filamentary Serpens South protostellar cluster, shows unambiguous episodic events. The $^{12}$CO (J=2-1) emission from the protostar reveals 22 distinct features of outflow ejecta, the most recent having the highest velocity. The outflow forms bipolar lobes --- one of the first detectable signs of star formation --- which originate from the peak of 1-mm continuum emission. Emission from the surrounding C$^{18}$O envelope shows kinematics consistent with rotation and an infall of material onto the protostar. The data suggest that episodic accretion-driven outflow begins in the earliest phase of protostellar evolution, and that the outflow remains intact in a very clustered environment, probably providing efficient momentum transfer for driving turbulence."
https://openalex.org/W2175501639,"Representing brain morphology as a network has the advantage that the regional morphology of 'isolated' structures can be described statistically based on graph theory. However, very few studies have investigated brain morphology from the holistic perspective of complex networks, particularly in individual brains. We proposed a new network framework for individual brain morphology. Technically, in the new network, nodes are defined as regions based on a brain atlas, and edges are estimated using our newly-developed inter-regional relation measure based on regional morphological distributions. This implementation allows nodes in the brain network to be functionally/anatomically homogeneous but different with respect to shape and size. We first demonstrated the new network framework in a healthy sample. Thereafter, we studied the graph-theoretical properties of the networks obtained and compared the results with previous morphological, anatomical, and functional networks. The robustness of the method was assessed via measurement of the reliability of the network metrics using a test-retest dataset. Finally, to illustrate potential applications, the networks were used to measure age-related changes in commonly used network metrics. Results suggest that the proposed method could provide a concise description of brain organization at a network level and be used to investigate interindividual variability in brain morphology from the perspective of complex networks. Furthermore, the method could open a new window into modeling the complexly distributed brain and facilitate the emerging field of human connectomics."
https://openalex.org/W1935701661,"Given the role of infectious disease in global pollinator decline, there is a need to understand factors that shape pathogen susceptibility and transmission in bees. Here we ask how urbanization affects the immune response and pathogen load of feral and managed colonies of honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), the predominant economically important pollinator worldwide. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we measured expression of 4 immune genes and relative abundance of 10 honey bee pathogens. We also measured worker survival in a laboratory bioassay. We found that pathogen pressure on honey bees increased with urbanization and management, and the probability of worker survival declined 3-fold along our urbanization gradient. The effect of management on pathogens appears to be mediated by immunity, with feral bees expressing immune genes at nearly twice the levels of managed bees following an immune challenge. The effect of urbanization, however, was not linked with immunity; instead, urbanization may favor viability and transmission of some disease agents. Feral colonies, with lower disease burdens and stronger immune responses, may illuminate ways to improve honey bee management. The previously unexamined effects of urbanization on honey-bee disease are concerning, suggesting that urban areas may favor problematic diseases of pollinators."

For instance, loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 or PARKIN can cause autosomal recessive PD. Recently, PINK1 and PARKIN have been implicated in the same signaling pathway to regulate mitochondrial clearance through recruitment of PARKIN by stabilization of PINK1 on the outer membrane of depolarized mitochondria. The precise mechanisms that govern this process remain enigmatic. In this study, we identify Bcl2-associated athanogene 2 (BAG2) as a factor that promotes mitophagy. BAG2 inhibits PINK1 degradation by blocking the ubiquitination pathway. Stabilization of PINK1 by BAG2 triggers PARKIN-mediated mitophagy and protects neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced oxidative stress in an in vitro cell model of PD. Collectively, our findings support the notion that BAG2 is an upstream regulator of the PINK1/PARKIN signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2163205192,"GPBAR1 is a bile acids activated receptor expressed in entero-hepatic tissues. In the liver expression of GPBAR1 is restricted to sinusoidal and Kuppfer cells. In the systemic circulation vasodilation caused by GPBAR1 agonists is abrogated by inhibition of cystathione-γ-liase (CSE), an enzyme essential to the generation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a vasodilatory agent. Portal BAR501 is a semisynthetic bile acid derivative endowed with a potent and selective agonistic activity toward GPBAR1.Cirrhosis was induced in mice by carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) administration for 9 weeks. Liver endothelial dysfunction was induced by feeding wild type and Gpbar1-/- mice with methionine for 4 weeks. In both models, mice were administered BAR501, 15 mg/kg/day.By transactivation assay we demonstrate that BAR501 is a selective GPBAR1 agonist devoid of any FXR agonistic activity. In naïve rats, BAR501 effectively reduced hepatic perfusion pressure and counteracted the vasoconstriction activity of norepinephrine. In the CCl4 model, 9 weeks treatment with BAR501 effectively protected against development of endothelial dysfunction by increasing liver CSE expression and activity and by reducing endothelin (ET)-1 gene expression. In mice feed methionine, treatment with BAR501 attenuated endothelial dysfunction and caused a GPBAR1-dependent regulation of CSE. Using human liver sinusoidal cells, we found that modulation of CSE expression/activity is mediated by both genomic (recruitment of CREB to CRE in the CSE promoter) and non-genomic effects, involving a Akt-dependent phosporylation of CSE and endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS). BAR501, phosphorylates FOXO1 and inhibits ET-1 transcription in liver sinusoidal cells.BAR501, a UDCA-like GPBAR1 agonist, rescues from endothelial dysfunction in rodent models of portal hypertension by exerting genomic and non-genomic effects on CSE, eNOS and ET-1 in liver sinusoidal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2281626507,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play crucial roles in maintaining immune tolerance. The transcription factor Foxp3 is a critical regulator of Treg development and function, and its expression is regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Acetylation by lysine acetyl transferases/lysine deacetylases is one of the main post-translational modifications of Foxp3, which regulate Foxp3's stability and transcriptional activity. However, the mechanism(s) by which the activities of these lysine acetyl transferases/lysine deacetylases are regulated to preserve proper Foxp3 acetylation during Treg development and maintenance of Treg function remains to be determined. Here we report that Mst1 can enhance Foxp3 stability, its transcriptional activity, and Treg function by modulating the Foxp3 protein at the post-translational level. We discovered that Mst1 could increase the acetylation of Foxp3 by inhibiting Sirt1 activity, which requires the Mst1 kinase activity. We also found that Mst1 could attenuate Sirt1-mediated deacetylation of Foxp3 through directly interacting with Foxp3 to prevent or interfere the interaction between Sirt1 and Foxp3. Therefore, Mst1 can regulate Foxp3 stability in kinase-dependent and kinase-independent manners. Finally, we showed that treatment of Mst1−/− Tregs with Ex-527, a Sirt1-specific inhibitor, partially restored the suppressive function of Mst1−/− Tregs.

Although phosphorylation of Foxo1/3 at the Forkhead domains by Mst1 augments their nuclear entry in 293T cells and granule neurons (21Lehtinen M.K. Yuan Z. Boag P.R. Yang Y. Villén J. Becker E.B. DiBacco S. de la Iglesia N. Gygi S. Blackwell T.K. Bonni A. A conserved MST-FOXO signaling pathway mediates oxidative-stress responses and extends life span.Cell. 2006; 125: 987-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), we have recently shown that Mst1 promotes Foxp3 expression at the transcription level through regulating the protein stability of Foxo1/3 by phosphorylating Foxo1/3 in T cells (30Du X. Shi H. Li J. Dong Y. Liang J. Ye J. Kong S. Zhang S. Zhong T. Yuan Z. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Zheng B. Geng J.G. Tao W.

Immunol. 2014; 192: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Foxp3 is also a Forkhead protein. Therefore, it remains unknown whether Mst1 can affect Foxp3 protein expression at the post-translational level to regulate Treg development and function. Here we show that Mst1 can stabilize the Foxp3 protein and increase its transcriptional activity and Treg function by modulating the protein at the post-translational level. We demonstrate that Mst1 enhances Foxp3 acetylation by inhibiting Sirt1 activity in a kinase-dependent manner. We also found that Mst1 or Mst1K59R (a kinase-inactive mutant functioning as a dominant negative form) could attenuate Sirt1-mediated Foxp3 deacetylation by preventing or interfering with the interaction between Sirt1 and Foxp3 in a kinase-independent manner. Finally, we uncovered that the suppressive function of Mst1−/− Tregs was partially restored when they were treated with Ex-527, a Sirt1-specific inhibitor. Our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which Mst1 enhances Foxp3 expression and Treg function through post-translational modification. Mst1−/− mice are described in previous work (28Dong Y. Du X. Ye J. Han M. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Tao W. A cell-intrinsic role for Mst1 in regulating thymocyte egress.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained on a 129/Sv genetic background and raised in a specific pathogen-free facility. Experiments were conducted with consent from the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Developmental Biology and Molecular Medicine at Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from Mst1+/+ and Mst1−/− mice. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. CD4+CD25+ Treg cells and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. Human Mst1K59R gene was derived from a human Mst1 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. A HA-tagged human Mst1 and Mst1K59R genes were then cloned into expression vector pCDNA3.1. The Mst1 RNA interference (shMst1) plasmid is described previously (32Yuan F. Xie Q. Wu J. Bai Y. Mao B. Dong Y. Bi W. Ji G. Tao W. Wang Y. Yuan Z. MST1 promotes apoptosis through regulating Sirt1-dependent p53 deacetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 6940-6945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The IL-2 luciferase reporter plasmid was derived via inserting a PCR-amplified IL-2 promoter fragment (−305 to +39) from Jurkat cells into a luciferase reporter vector, pGL4.20 (Promega). The plasmids expressing Foxp3, or shSirt1, or Sirt1, or Ep300 were gifts from Drs. Bin Li (Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shanghai, China), Qiwei Zhai (Institute for Nutritional Sciences, CAS, Shanghai, China), and Shimin Zhao (Fudan University, Shanghai, China). Antibodies against the following proteins were used for our studies: CD4, CD25, Foxp3, IL-2, and IFN-γ (eBioscience); CD3 and CD28 (BD Biosciences); phospho-Ser (Millipore); acetylated lysine, ubiquitin, and Sirt1 (Cell Signaling); HA and FLAG (Sigma); Myc (SC-40), GFP, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and GAPDH (Beyotime). CD4+ T cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were purified using the mouse CD4 kit or CD4+CD25+ Treg cells kit (11461D and 11463D; Invitrogen). CD4+CD25− cells were purified by depleting CD25+ cells with an anti-CD25/anti-rat IgG kit (11035; Invitrogen), followed by further purification using a mouse CD4 kit. Intracellular staining for Foxp3, Il-2, and IFN-γ was performed using a kit (00-5523; eBioscience) or as described elsewhere (33Vanvalkenburgh J. Albu D.I. Bapanpally C. Casanova S. Califano D.

Med. 2011; 208: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 7-Aminoactinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to label dead cells. All samples were analyzed with a FACSCalibur or CyAn ADP analyzer and FlowJo software (TreeStar). Total RNA was extracted from purified peripheral CD4+CD25+ Treg cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was carried out with TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (AMV) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR reactions were performed on Mx3000P (Stratagene) with the Fast SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene), and data were analyzed with the MxPro software. Expression of Gapdh was used as internal control for real-time PCR. The primer sequences are as follows: Nrp1-F, 5′-TCCTGCGATTCGTTACTGCTG-3′; Nrp1-R, 5′-ACTCCTAAGACAACATCTGTGGGG-3′; Pde3b-F, 5′-GCAACTCCTATGATGCTGCTGG-3′; Pde3b-R, 5′-CCTGCCTTTCCTTCTTTGTGG-3′; Gapdh-L, 5′-TGTTCCTACCCCCAATGTGTCC-3′; and Gapdh-R, 5′-GGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAG-3′. A total of 6 × 104 splenic CD4+CD25− T cells labeled with CFSE were cultured with mitomycin C-treated T cell-depleted splenocytes and concanavalin A (2 mg/ml) in the presence of 3 × 104 Tregs (spleen CD4+CD25+ cells) for 72 h and then analyzed by FACS. The suppressive capacity of Tregs was calculated using the following formula: (100 × (1 − % of CFSElowCD4+CD25− T cells in co-culture/% of CFSElow CD4+CD25− T cells alone)), as described previously (34Venken K. Thewissen M. Hellings N. Somers V. Hensen K. Rummens J.L. Stinissen P.

Methods. 2007; 322: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Relative Treg suppression was calculated using the following formula: (Mst1−/− Tregs suppressive capacity/Mst1+/+ Tregs suppressive capacity) × 100%, respectively, in DMSO or Ex-527. The luciferase reporter driven by the IL-2 promoter was co-transfected with NFAT2, Foxp3, Sirt1, and Mst1 expression plasmids as indicated (see Fig. 5A) into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection. Jurkat T cells were transfected with the same luciferase reporter only, or co-transfected with plasmids expressing Mst1, shMst1, Foxp3, Mst1/Foxp3, or shMst1/Foxp3, respectively by electroporation (Pulser II, Bio-Rad). 40 h after electroporation, the cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for another 6 h. Luciferase activity was analyzed as described previously (35Yan S. Berquin I.M. Troen B.R. Sloane B.F. Transcription of human cathepsin B is mediated by Sp1 and Ets family factors in glioma.DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). β-gal was used for control for determining transfection efficiency. The GST-Foxp3 fusion protein (GST-Foxp3) and the His6-tagged Mst1 protein (His-Mst1) were expressed in Escherichia coli. The GST-Foxp3 and His-Mst1 were purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) or Ni-NTA Agarose (Clontech), respectively. The GST pulldown assay was performed as described previously (36Einarson M.B. Pugacheva E.N. Orlinick J.R. GST pull-down.CSH Protoc. 2007; (pdb.prot4757)Google Scholar). GST and the GST-Foxp3 protein were visualized by GST antibody, and His-Mst1 was detected by His antibody on Western blots. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (28Dong Y. Du X. Ye J. Han M. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Tao W. A cell-intrinsic role for Mst1 in regulating thymocyte egress.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the transfected 293T cells or T cells freshly isolated from mice were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics)). Then, Mst1 or Foxp3 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatants with anti-HA, FLAG, or Myc-agarose beads or the appropriate antibodies with protein A-agarose beads and analyzed by immunoblotting. Images were collected with a Tanon-5200 or by x-ray film exposure. For quantification of protein levels, the appropriate film exposures were scanned, and the density of bands was determined with ImageJ and normalized with endogenous GAPDH or exogenous EGFP. Kinase assay was performed as described by Tao et al. (37Tao W. Zhang S. Turenchalk G.S. Stewart R.A. St John M.A. Chen W. Xu T. Human homologue of the Drosophila melanogaster lats tumour suppressor modulates CDC2 activity.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-tagged Mst1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate of 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-Mst1 using anti-HA-agarose beads and incubated with 1 μg of GST-Foxp3 purified from E. coli in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography to visualize signals of phosphoproteins. Statistical analysis was conducted using an unpaired t test by GraphPad Prism 4. A p value<0.05 was considered significant. It has been shown that Mst1 enhances the stability of Foxo1/3 proteins in T cells (30Du X. Shi H. Li J. Dong Y. Liang J. Ye J. Kong S. Zhang S. Zhong T.

Mst1 deficiency impairs Treg development and results in autoimmunity in mice by diminishing Foxo1/3-mediated Foxp3 transcription (30Du X. Shi H. Li J. Dong Y. Liang J. Ye J. Kong S. Zhang S. Zhong T. Yuan Z. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Zheng B. Geng J.G. Tao W. Mst1/Mst2 regulate development and function of regulatory T cells through modulation of Foxo1/Foxo3 stability in autoimmune disease.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because Foxo1/3 and Foxp3 proteins share a conserved Forkhead domain, we tested whether the Foxp3 protein could also be a substrate of the Mst1 kinase. Although we failed to detect obvious Mst1-mediated Foxp3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A), Foxp3 was found to be co-immunoprecipitated with Mst1 when co-transfected in 293T cells (Fig. 1, B and C). This result was also repeated for endogenous Foxp3 and Mst1 proteins in mouse lymphoid T cells (Fig. 1D). To assess the potential consequences of Mst1-Foxp3 interaction, we expressed exogenous GFP-Foxp3 fusion protein in WT and Mst1−/− MEFs. We found that the GFP-Foxp3 fusion protein was located in 100% of nuclei of both WT and Mst1−/− MEFs (Fig. 1E), indicating that Mst1 deficiency does not affect the subcellular localization of the Foxp3 protein. Although Mst1 deficiency has no effect on the Foxp3 nuclear localization, the Foxp3 protein level was higher when Foxp3 and Mst1 were co-expressed in 293T cells when compared with that in the control cells transfected with Foxp3 alone (Fig. 2A). Conversely, the Foxp3 protein level was significantly lower in 293T cells co-transfected with Foxp3 and shMst1 (with a Mst1 knockdown plasmid) (Fig. 2B), or Foxp3 and dominant negative Mst1K59R, than the controls (Fig. 2C). The Foxp3 protein level was also significantly lower in Mst1-deficient Tregs (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the lower levels of Foxp3 proteins in Mst1 knockdown 293T cells (Fig. 2E) or in Mst1-deficient Tregs (Fig. 2F) could be recovered when the cells were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggest that Mst1 enhances Foxp3 stability. To further confirm the effect of Mst1 on Foxp3 stability, we evaluated the degradation of Foxp3 when protein production was blocked by cycloheximide. Our results reveal that the degradation of ectopically expressed Foxp3 protein was significantly slowed in the cells co-transfected with Mst1 when treated by cycloheximide (Fig. 2G). Altogether, our studies show that Mst1 can up-regulate the expression of Foxp3 protein at the post-translational level, in addition to at the transcriptional level through enhancing the stability of Foxo1/3 proteins (30Du X.

Our data also suggest that the Mst1 kinase activity may be required for Mst1-mediated Foxp3 post-translational regulation (Fig. 2C). To further investigate the effect of Mst1 protein on the function of Foxp3 protein, we first evaluated Foxp3 transcriptional repressor activity in vitro using a luciferase reporter dri"
https://openalex.org/W2134224068,"Bacteria communicate with each other by the use of signaling molecules, a process called 'quorum sensing'. One group of quorum sensing molecules includes the oligopeptides, which are mainly produced by Gram-positive bacteria. Recently, these quorum sensing peptides were found to biologically influence mammalian cells, promoting i.a. metastasis of cancer cells. Moreover, it was found that bacteria can influence different central nervous system related disorders as well, e.g. anxiety, depression and autism. Research currently focuses on the role of bacterial metabolites in this bacteria-brain interaction, with the role of the quorum sensing peptides not yet known. Here, three chemically diverse quorum sensing peptides were investigated for their brain influx (multiple time regression technique) and efflux properties in an in vivo mouse model (ICR-CD-1) to determine blood-brain transfer properties: PhrCACET1 demonstrated comparatively a very high initial influx into the mouse brain (Kin = 20.87 μl/(g×min)), while brain penetrabilities of BIP-2 and PhrANTH2 were found to be low (Kin = 2.68 μl/(g×min)) and very low (Kin = 0.18 μl/(g×min)), respectively. All three quorum sensing peptides were metabolically stable in plasma (in vitro) during the experimental time frame and no significant brain efflux was observed. Initial tissue distribution data showed remarkably high liver accumulation of BIP-2 as well. Our results thus support the potential role of some quorum sensing peptides in different neurological disorders, thereby enlarging our knowledge about the microbiome-brain axis."
https://openalex.org/W2264047581,"Following the unconventional gas revolution, the forecasting of natural gas prices has become increasingly important because the association of these prices with those of crude oil has weakened. With this as motivation, we propose some modified hybrid models in which various combinations of the wavelet approximation, detail components, autoregressive integrated moving average, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, and artificial neural network models are employed to predict natural gas prices. We also emphasize the boundary problem in wavelet decomposition, and compare results that consider the boundary problem case with those that do not. The empirical results show that our suggested approach can handle the boundary problem, such that it facilitates the extraction of the appropriate forecasting results. The performance of the wavelet-hybrid approach was superior in all cases, whereas the application of detail components in the forecasting was only able to yield a small improvement in forecasting performance. Therefore, forecasting with only an approximation component would be acceptable, in consideration of forecasting efficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2240332871,"Dietary isoflavones, a group of secondary plant compounds that exhibit phytoestrogenic properties, are primarily found in soy. Prunetin, a representative isoflavone, was recently found to affect cell signaling in cultured cells; however, in vivo effects remain elusive. In this study, the model organism Drosophila melanogaster was used to investigate the effects of prunetin in vivo with respect to lifespan, locomotion, body composition, metabolism, and gut health. Adult flies were chronically administered a prunetin-supplemented diet. Prunetin improved median survival by 3 d, and climbing activity increased by 54% in males. In comparison with the females, male flies exhibited lower climbing activity, which was reversed by prunetin intake. Furthermore, prunetin-fed males exhibited increased expression of the longevity gene Sirtuin 1 (Sir2) (22%), as well as elevated AMPK activation (51%) and triglyceride levels (29%), whereas glucose levels decreased (36%). As females are long-lived compared with their male counterparts and exhibit higher triglyceride levels, prunetin apparently ""feminizes"" male flies via its estrogenicity. We conclude that the lifespan-prolonging effects of prunetin in the male fruit fly depend on changes in AMPK-regulated energy homeostasis via male ""feminization."" Collectively, we identified prunetin as a plant bioactive compound capable of improving health status and survival in male D. melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W2148701444,"Objective The primary purpose of this study was to clarify the influence of the early response to surgery on brain structure and cognitive function in patients with breast cancer. It was hypothesized that the structure of the thalamus would change during the early response after surgery due to the effects of anesthesia and would represent one aspect of an intermediate phenotype of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Methods We examined 32 postmenopausal females with breast cancer and 20 age-matched controls. We assessed their cognitive function (attention, memory, and executive function), and performed brain structural MRI 1.5 ± 0.5 days before and 5.6 ± 1.2 days after surgery. Results We found a significant interaction between regional grey matter volume (rGMV) in the thalamus (P < 0.05, familywise error (FWE), small volume correction (SVC)) and one attention domain subtest (P = 0.001, Bonferroni correction) after surgery in the patient group compared with the control group. Furthermore, the changes in attention were significantly associated with sevoflurane anesthetic dose (r2 = 0.247, β = ‒0.471, P = 0.032) and marginally associated with rGMV changes in the thalamus (P = 0.07, FWE, SVC) in the Pt group. Conclusion Our findings suggest that alterations in brain structure, particularly in the thalamus, may occur shortly after surgery and may be associated with attentional dysfunction. This early postoperative response to anesthesia may represent an intermediate phenotype of POCD. It was assumed that patients experiencing other risk factors of POCD, such as the severity of surgery, the occurrence of complications, and pre-existing cognitive impairments, would develop clinical POCD with broad and multiple types of cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2121206835,"We validate that the 28 days after hospital-discharge are high-risk for drugs-related death (DRD) among drug users in Scotland and investigate key risk-factors for DRDs soon after hospital-discharge. Using data from an anonymous linkage of hospitalisation and death records to the Scottish Drugs Misuse Database (SDMD), including over 98,000 individuals registered for drug treatment during 1 April 1996 to 31 March 2010 with 705,538 person-years, 173,107 hospital-stays, and 2,523 DRDs. Time-at-risk of DRD was categorised as: during hospitalization, within 28 days, 29–90 days, 91 days–1 year, >1 year since most recent hospital discharge versus ‘never admitted’. Factors of interest were: having ever injected, misuse of alcohol, length of hospital-stay (0–1 versus 2+ days), and main discharge-diagnosis. We confirm SDMD clients’ high DRD-rate soon after hospital-discharge in 2006–2010. DRD-rate in the 28 days after hospital-discharge did not vary by length of hospital-stay but was significantly higher for clients who had ever-injected versus otherwise. Three leading discharge-diagnoses accounted for only 150/290 DRDs in the 28 days after hospital-discharge, but ever-injectors for 222/290. Hospital-discharge remains a period of increased DRD-vulnerability in 2006–2010, as in 1996–2006, especially for those with a history of injecting."
https://openalex.org/W2115545606,"Chronic liver disease and liver cancer associated with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are leading causes of death among adults in China. Although newborn hepatitis B immunization has successfully reduced the prevalence of CHB in children, about 100 million Chinese adults remain chronically infected. If left unmanaged, 15–25% will die from liver cancer or liver cirrhosis. Antiviral treatment is not necessary for all patients with CHB, but when it is indicated, good response to treatment would prevent disease progression and reduce disease mortality and morbidity, and costly complications. The aim of this study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of generic and brand antiviral drugs for CHB treatment in China, and assessing various thresholds at which a highly potent, low resistance antiviral drug would be cost-saving and/or cost-effective to introduce in a national treatment program. We developed a Markov simulation model of disease progression using effectiveness and cost data from the medical literature. We measured life-time costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and clinical outcomes. The no treatment strategy incurred the highest health care costs ($12,932-$25,293) per patient, and the worst health outcomes, compared to the antiviral treatment strategies. Monotherapy with either entecavir or tenofovir yielded the most QALYs (14.10–19.02) for both HBeAg-positive and negative patients, with or without cirrhosis. Threshold analysis showed entercavir or tenofovir treatment would be cost saving if the drug price is $32–75 (195–460 RMB) per month, highly cost-effective at $62–110 (379–670 RMB) per month and cost-effective at $63–120 (384–734 RMB) per month. This study can support policy decisions regarding the implementation of a national health program for chronic hepatitis B treatment in China at the population level."
https://openalex.org/W2171243607,"Social insect colonies use interactions among workers to regulate collective behavior. Harvester ant foragers interact in a chamber just inside the nest entrance, here called the 'entrance chamber'. Previous studies of the activation of foragers in red harvester ants show that an outgoing forager inside the nest experiences an increase in brief antennal contacts before it leaves the nest to forage. Here we compare the interaction rate experienced by foragers that left the nest and ants that did not. We found that ants in the entrance chamber that leave the nest to forage experienced more interactions than ants that descend to the deeper nest without foraging. Additionally, we found that the availability of foragers in the entrance chamber is associated with the rate of forager return. An increase in the rate of forager return leads to an increase in the rate at which ants descend to the deeper nest, which then stimulates more ants to ascend into the entrance chamber. Thus a higher rate of forager return leads to more available foragers in the entrance chamber. The highest density of interactions occurs near the nest entrance and the entrances of the tunnels from the entrance chamber to the deeper nest. Local interactions with returning foragers regulate both the activation of waiting foragers and the number of foragers available to be activated."

https://openalex.org/W2150066382,"Oxaliplatin has widely been used as a key drug in the treatment of colorectal cancer; however, it causes peripheral neuropathy. Exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, is an incretin mimetic secreted from ileal L cells, which is clinically used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this study, we investigated the effects of exenatide on oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy in rats and cultured cells.Oxaliplatin (4 mg/kg) was administered intravenously twice per week for 4 weeks, and mechanical allodynia was evaluated using the von Frey test in rats. Axonal degeneration was assessed by toluidine blue staining of sciatic nerves.Repeated administration of oxaliplatin caused mechanical allodynia from day 14 to 49. Although the co-administration of extended-release exenatide (100 μg/kg) could not inhibit the incidence of oxaliplatin-induced mechanical allodynia, it facilitated recovery from the oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy with reparation of axonal degeneration. Inhibition of neurite outgrowth was evaluated in cultured pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells. Exenatide inhibited oxaliplatin-induced neurite degeneration, but did not affect oxaliplatin-induced cell injury in cultured PC12 cells. Additionally, extended-release exenatide had no effect on the anti-tumor activity of oxaliplatin in cultured murine colon adenocarcinoma 26 (C-26) cells or C-26 cell-implanted mice.These results suggest that exenatide may be useful for treating peripheral neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer patients with type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1917533840,"The advent of targeted therapy for cancer treatment has brought about a paradigm shift in the clinical management of human malignancies. Agents such as erlotinib used for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer or imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia, for instance, lead to rapid tumor responses. Unfortunately, however, resistance often emerges and renders these agents ineffective after a variable amount of time. The FDA-approved dosing schedules for these drugs were not designed to optimally prevent the emergence of resistance. To this end, we have previously utilized evolutionary mathematical modeling of treatment responses to elucidate the dosing schedules best able to prevent or delay the onset of resistance. Here we expand on our approaches by taking into account dose-dependent mutation rates at which resistant cells emerge. The relationship between the serum drug concentration and the rate at which resistance mutations arise can lead to non-intuitive results about the best dose administration strategies to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance.We used mathematical modeling, available clinical trial data, and different considerations of the relationship between mutation rate and drug concentration to predict the effectiveness of different dosing strategies.We designed several distinct measures to interrogate the effects of different treatment dosing strategies and found that a low-dose continuous strategy coupled with high-dose pulses leads to the maximal delay until clinically observable resistance. Furthermore, the response to treatment is robust against different assumptions of the mutation rate as a function of drug concentration.For new and existing targeted drugs, our methodology can be employed to compare the effectiveness of different dose administration schedules and investigate the influence of changing mutation rates on outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2227307923,"Pinus massoniana bark proanthocyanidins (PMBPs), an active component isolated from Pinus massoniana bark, has been reported to possess a wide range of biochemical properties. Here, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of PMBPs on ovarian cancer. The results indicated that PMBPs significantly reduced the growth of ovarian cancer cells and induced dose-dependent apoptosis. The underlying mechanisms involved were elucidated to include the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the activation of Caspase 3/9, suggesting that PMBPs triggered apoptosis through activation of mitochondria-associated apoptotic pathway. In addition, wound healing and transwell chamber assays revealed that PMBPs could suppress migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. PMBPs dramatically inhibited MMP-9 activity and expression, blocked the activity of NFκB and the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Our findings suggest that PMBPs has the potential to be developed as an anti-tumor drug for ovarian cancer treatment and/ or disease management."
https://openalex.org/W2097766968,"Ecological approaches have highlighted the importance of the built environment as a factor affecting physical activity. However, knowledge on children's activity patterns is still incomplete. Particularly, data on the spatial context of physical activity is limited, which limits the potential to design location-based interventions effectively. Using global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometry, this study aimed to identify locations where children engage in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).Participants included 119 children (11-14 years, 57% girls) from public schools in Winterthur, Switzerland. During a regular school week between February and April 2013, children wore an accelerometer and GPS sensor for seven consecutive days. Time-matched accelerometer and GPS data was mapped with a geographic information system and each data point was assigned to one of seven defined activity settings. Both the absolute amount of MVPA and proportion of time in MVPA were calculated for every setting. Multilevel analyses accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data were conducted to investigate any gender differences.Children achieved most MVPA on streets (34.5%) and on school grounds (33.4%). The proportion children spent in MVPA was highest in recreational facilities (19.4%), at other schools (19.2%) and on streets (18.6%). Boys accumulated significantly more MVPA overall and on other school grounds (p < 0.05) and showed a significantly higher proportion of time in MVPA at own school and outside of Winterthur (p < 0.05).The results indicate the importance of streets and school grounds as activity-promoting environments. The high use of streets may be an indicator for active transportation, which appears to contribute to an active lifestyle in both genders. In contrast, the school setting is more likely to encourage physical activity in boys. Recreational facilities seem to be conducive for MVPA among both genders, although infrequently visited during the week of measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2137306866,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) continues to account for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis, as well as less serious infections such as sinusitis, conjunctivitis and otitis media. Current polysaccharide vaccines are strictly serotype-specific and also drive the emergence of non-vaccine serotype strains. In this study, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression patterns of either serotype 4 or serotype 6A pneumococci in the nasopharynx and blood of mice, as a model to identify genes involved in invasion of blood in the context of occult bacteremia in humans. In this manner, we identified 26 genes that were significantly up-regulated in the nasopharynx and 36 genes that were significantly up-regulated in the blood that were common to both strains. Gene Ontology classification revealed that transporter and DNA binding (transcription factor) activities constitute the significantly different molecular functional categories for genes up-regulated in the nasopharynx and blood. Targeted mutagenesis of selected genes from both niches and subsequent virulence and pathogenesis studies identified the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (SodA) as most likely to be essential for colonization, and the cell wall-associated serine protease (PrtA) as important for invasion of blood. This work extends our previous analyses and suggests that both PrtA and SodA warrant examination in future studies aimed at prevention and/or control of pneumococcal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2225487310,"Vertebrate evolution is accompanied by a substantial conservation of transcriptional programs with more than a third of unique orthologous genes showing constrained levels of expression. Moreover, there are genes and exons exhibiting excellent expression stability according to RNA-seq data across a panel of eighteen tissues including the ovary (Human Body Map 2.0).We hypothesized that orthologs of these exons would also be highly uniformly expressed across neonatal ovaries of the horse, which would render them appropriate reference genes (RGs) for normalization of reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) data in this context. The expression stability of eleven novel RGs (C1orf43, CHMP2A, EMC7, GPI, PSMB2, PSMB4, RAB7A, REEP5, SNRPD3, VCP and VPS29) was assessed by RT-qPCR in ovaries of seven neonatal fillies and compared to that of the expressed repetitive element ERE-B, two universal (OAZ1 and RPS29) and four traditional RGs (ACTB, GAPDH, UBB and B2M). Expression stability analyzed with the software tool RefFinder top ranked the normalization factor constituted of the genes SNRPD3 and VCP, a gene pair that is not co-expressed according to COEXPRESdb and GeneMANIA. The traditional RGs GAPDH, B2M, ACTB and UBB were only ranked 3rd and 12th to 14th, respectively.The functional diversity of the novel RGs likely facilitates expression studies over a wide range of physiological and pathological contexts related to the neonatal equine ovary. In addition, this study augments the potential for RT-qPCR-based profiling of human samples by introducing seven new human RG assays (C1orf43, CHMP2A, EMC7, GPI, RAB7A, VPS29 and UBB)."
https://openalex.org/W2108256459,"The planarian Dugesia japonica tends to stay near the walls of its breeding containers and experimental dishes in the laboratory, a phenomenon called ""wall preference"". This behavior is thought to be important for environmental adaptation, such as hiding by planarians in nature. However, the mechanisms regulating wall-preference behavior are not well understood, since this behavior occurs in the absence of any particular stimulation. Here we show the mechanisms of wall-preference behavior. Surprisingly, planarian wall-preference behavior was also shown even by the head alone and by headless planarians. These results indicate that planarian ""wall-preference"" behavior only appears to be a ""preference"" behavior, and is actually an outcome of spontaneous behaviors, rather than of brain function. We found that in the absence of environmental cues planarians moved basically straight ahead until they reached a wall, and that after reaching a wall, they changed their direction of movement to one tangential to the wall, suggesting that this spontaneous behavior may play a critical role in the wall preference. When we tested another spontaneous behavior, the wigwag movement of the planarian head, using computer simulation with various wigwag angles and wigwag intervals, large wigwag angle and short wigwag interval reduced wall-preference behavior. This indicated that wigwag movement may determine the probability of staying near the wall or leaving the wall. Furthermore, in accord with this simulation, when we tested planarian wall-preference behavior using several assay fields with different curvature of the wall, we found that concavity and sharp curvature of walls negatively impacted wall preference by affecting the permissible angle of the wigwag movement. Together, these results indicate that planarian wall preference may be involuntarily caused by the combination of two spontaneous planarian behaviors: moving straight ahead until reaching a wall and then moving along it in the absence of environmental cues, and wigwag movements of the head."
https://openalex.org/W2228586441,"Background Yersinia pestis initiates infection by parasitism of host macrophages. In response to macrophage infections, intracellular Y. pestis can assume a filamentous cellular morphology which may mediate resistance to host cell innate immune responses. We previously observed the expression of Y. pestis tellurite resistance proteins TerD and TerE from the terZABCDE operon during macrophage infections. Others have observed a filamentous response associated with expression of tellurite resistance operon in Escherichia coli exposed to tellurite. Therefore, in this study we examine the potential role of Y. pestis tellurite resistance operon in filamentous cellular morphology during macrophage infections. Principal Findings In vitro treatment of Y. pestis culture with sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3) caused the bacterial cells to assume a filamentous phenotype similar to the filamentous phenotype observed during macrophage infections. A deletion mutant for genes terZAB abolished the filamentous morphologic response to tellurite exposure or intracellular parasitism, but without affecting tellurite resistance. However, a terZABCDE deletion mutant abolished both filamentous morphologic response and tellurite resistance. Complementation of the terZABCDE deletion mutant with terCDE, but not terZAB, partially restored tellurite resistance. When the terZABCDE deletion mutant was complemented with terZAB or terCDE, Y. pestis exhibited filamentous morphology during macrophage infections as well as while these complemented genes were being expressed under an in vitro condition. Further in E. coli, expression of Y. pestis terZAB, but not terCDE, conferred a filamentous phenotype. Conclusions These findings support the role of Y. pestis terZAB mediation of the filamentous response phenotype; whereas, terCDE confers tellurite resistance. Although the beneficial role of filamentous morphological responses by Y. pestis during macrophage infections is yet to be fully defined, it may be a bacterial adaptive strategy to macrophage associated stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2264589059,"Preservation of liverworts in amber, a fossilized tree resin, is often exquisite. Twenty-three fossil species of liverworts have been described to date from Eocene (35-50 Ma) Baltic amber. In addition, two inclusions have been assigned to the extant species Ptilidium pulcherrimum (Ptilidiales or Porellales). However, the presence of the boreal P. pulcherrimum in the subtropical or warm-temperate Baltic amber forest challenges the phytogeographical interpretation of the Eocene flora. A re-investigation of one of the fossils believed to be P. pulcherrimum reveals that this specimen in fact represents the first fossil evidence of the genus Tetralophozia, and thus is re-described here as Tetralophozia groehnii sp. nov. A second fossil initially assigned to P. pulcherrimum is apparently lost, and can be reassessed only based on the original description and illustrations. This fossil is morphologically similar to the extant North Pacific endemic Ptilidium californicum, rather than P. pulcherrimum. Divergence time estimates based on chloroplast DNA sequences provide evidence of a Miocene origin of P. pulcherrimum, and thus also argue against the presence of this taxon in the Eocene. Ptilidium californicum originated 25-43 Ma ago. As a result, we cannot rule out that the Eocene fossil belongs to P. californicum. Alternatively, the fossil might represent a stem lineage element of Ptilidium or an early crown group species with morphological similarities to P. californicum."
https://openalex.org/W2118334294,"Saprophagous (feeding on decaying matter) insects often use carbon dioxide (CO2) as a cue for finding food. Humus-feeding larvae of the giant rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus exhibit a clumped distribution in natural microhabitats, but the mechanisms driving the distribution were unknown. Herein, I examined whether larvae use CO2 as a cue for fermented humus and aggregate in the vicinity of the food. I found that (i) larvae of T. dichotomus are strongly attracted to CO2, (ii) larvae orient toward highly fermented humus when given a choice between highly and poorly fermented humus, (iii) the highly fermented humus emits more CO2 than the poorly fermented humus, and (iv) larvae grow larger when fed highly fermented humus rather than poorly fermented humus. The clumped distribution of larvae is probably formed along the concentration gradient of CO2 induced by heterogeneity of fermented organic materials in soil. My laboratory experiments also revealed that larvae are chemically attracted to each other. Moreover, CO2 concentrations in soil were increased by the larval respiration, and small amounts of CO2 (much less than emitted during respiration by a single larva) were sufficient for larval attraction. These results suggest that not only response to fermented food resources, but also respiratory CO2 from conspecifics may lead to aggregation. Enhanced densities resulted in reduced weight gain under experimental conditions. However, exploiting a high-value resource at enhanced densities still led to greater body weight compared to individually exploiting a low-value resource. This demonstrates the adaptive value of the response to CO2 sources in this species."

The predominant species present in amyloid plaques is β-amyloid (Aβ), a 4.5-kDa peptide generated through amyloidogenic processing (sequential cleavage by β- and γ-secretases) of the parent amyloid precursor protein (APP). This produces two forms of Aβ, comprising either 40 or 42 amino acids, where the relative amount of the longer 42-amino acid form (Aβ42) is especially critical for AD progression, given its higher propensity to aggregate and form neurotoxic species (3Burdick D.

We have previously reported a novel 15-amino acid peptide isolated by subtractive phage display screening, which bound the toxic human Aβ42 peptide, but not the related, non-toxic rat Aβ42 peptide. This peptide was shown to target Aβ42 and attenuate its neurotoxicity (1Taddei K. Laws S.M. Verdile G. Munns S. D'Costa K. Harvey A.R. Martins I.J. Hill F. Levy E. Shaw J.E. Martins R.N. Novel phage peptides attenuate β amyloid-42 catalysed hydrogen peroxide production and associated neurotoxicity.Neurobiol. Aging. 2010; 31: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In an effort to generate a novel, specific and stable candidate peptide capable of targeting Aβ42 oligomers, we have exploited the known ability of this peptide to target Aβ42 and aimed to increase its utility using two approaches: (i) reduced length for improved permeability across the blood-brain barrier and peptidomimetic design; and (ii) increased proteolytic resistance. The stability of these analogues was assessed in vitro and their Aβ42 binding and activity was assessed biochemically. We have further provided proof-of-principle experiments to demonstrate that the lead candidate peptide shows potential as a preclinical AD imaging agent, given its ability to bind Aβ42 oligomers in vitro, amyloid plaques ex vivo, and its potential for transport across the blood-brain barrier in vivo.

Tetramethyl rhodamine (TMR)-labeled 15M S.A. and CTL2 S.A. were also obtained from Mimotopes (Melbourne, Australia). Tritium labeling of 15M S.A. peptide was performed by American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Aβ42 assemblies were prepared as preciously described (22Stine W.B. Jungbauer L. Yu C. LaDu M.J. Preparing synthetic Aβ in different aggregation states.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 670: 13-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ42 was solubilized in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (Sigma), dried, and reconstituted in dry dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) to 5 mm concentration. For monomeric Aβ42, the 5 mm stock was diluted to 100 μm in ice-cold Milli-Q water and used immediately. For oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ42, the 5 mm stock was diluted to 100 μm in either ice-cold Ham's F-12 media (C-72110, PromoCell GmbH, Germany) or 10 mm HCl, respectively, and incubated for 24 h at either 4 or 37 °C, respectively. Peptides were prepared as either 1 or 4 mm solution in PBS. 20 μl of the peptide solution was diluted in either 10% rat brain homogenate (in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100) or 100% serum. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for different times, and the reaction was stopped by adding cOmplete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). For 9-mer and 9M S.A., the bulk of the brain proteins (but not the peptides) were precipitated in cold methanol (1:4 (v/v) mixture/methanol) for 1 h at −20 °C. The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant containing the peptide was concentrated five times under vacuum and separated by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). Due to recovery issues with the longer 15-mer and 15M S.A. peptides, samples were instead lyophilized, extracted in TFA, centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and separated by RP-HPLC. The area of the peak (UV absorbance at 205 nm) corresponding to the intact peptide was measured and compared with an equivalent sample incubated in PBS. This method was adapted from Ref. 23Cerf E. Gustot A. Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.M. Raussens V.

Briefly, Aβ42 oligomers were centrifuged (18,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 min) to pellet insoluble material. The clarified supernatant (4.5 μg/10 μl of 100 μm stock) was added to a black-walled, clear bottom 96-well microplate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in triplicate. 200 μl of thioflavin T (ThT) (5 μm in 50 mm glycine NaOH, pH 8.5, 0.22 μm filtered) was added and the plates were read at 3–5 min post-addition in a FLUOSTAR OPTIMA instrument (excitation filter: 450 nm; emission filter: 490 nm; 30 s mix before reading; gain-adjust to highest reading). Samples were assayed in triplicate and the blank ThT fluorescence was subtracted from all readings. Candidate peptides were also assayed in the absence of Aβ42 for interference in the assay. M17 neuroblastoma cells were cultured similar to Ref. 1Taddei K. Laws S.M. Verdile G. Munns S. D'Costa K. Harvey A.R. Martins I.J. Hill F. Levy E. Shaw J.E. Martins R.N. Novel phage peptides attenuate β amyloid-42 catalysed hydrogen peroxide production and associated neurotoxicity.Neurobiol. Aging. 2010; 31: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. Briefly, M17 cells were seeded in a 48-well plate (25,000 cells/well in 500 μl of 1:1 DMEM/Nutrient Mixture F12 (DMEM/F-12) (Life Technologies) + 10% fetal calf serum) overnight. 100 μm Aβ42 oligomer stocks (± candidate peptides) were diluted to 20 μm concentration in treatment medium (20% (v/v) Ham's F-12, 80% (v/v) DMEM (no phenol red)) and used to treat cells (50–60% confluence) for 4 days (37 °C, 5% CO2). On the fourth day, the evaluation of neurotoxicity was performed by measuring release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (CytoTox-ONETM Homogeneous Membrane Integrity Assay, Promega) and cell viability (CellTiter96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS), Promega), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Samples were assayed in triplicate. Samples for gel analysis were prepared in two ways, i.e. denaturing and nondenaturing conditions.

Samples were diluted in MOPS loading buffer (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tris, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Coomassie, pH 7.7) without reducing agent and were not heat denatured prior to PAGE separation. Where insoluble material was present in the samples, denaturing conditions were employed to solubilize this material. In the denaturing conditions, samples were diluted in LDS sample buffer plus reducing agent (NuPAGE®), and heat denatured (72 °C, 10 min) prior to separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE® Novex 4–12% BisTris gradient gels and MES SDS running buffer (Life Technologies).

Briefly, Aβ samples were spotted on freshly cleaved grade V1 muscovite mica and incubated for 5 min. Samples were then rinsed with 0.22-μm syringe-filtered double-distilled water and blow dried with several gentle pulses of compressed air (N2). Samples were then visualized under the AFM (NT-MDT) using semi-contact mode with the following parameters: a minimum contact force, amplitude between 0.5 and 2 V (depending on the cantilever) to generate magnitude ∼20 nA, and scan rates ∼0.5–1 Hz. All data were processed using Nova NT-MDT Software version 1.1.0.1780. These experiments were performed using a Biacore 3000 Instrument (GE Healthcare) with a protocol modified from Ref. 26Taylor M.

Either 15M S.A. peptide, or Aβ42 monomer/aggregates, were immobilized on separate CM5 sensorchips (GE Healthcare). The 15M S.A. peptide was immobilized on a CM5 sensorchip via amine coupling, according to the manufacturer's instructions, to a level of 245 resonance units (RU) (1 RU = 1 pg of protein/mm2). Monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar Aβ42 preparations were immobilized on another CM5 sensorchip (10 μm in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0), injection for 5 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min) to final levels of 9,084, 11,467, and 4,924 RU, respectively. Note that the oligomeric Aβ42 and fibrillar Aβ42 preparations were prepared 24 h prior to immobilization, whereas the monomeric Aβ42 was prepared immediately prior to immobilization to minimize its aggregation. For both sensorchips, a reference surface was prepared in parallel (with no addition of peptide), and used for subtraction of nonspecific binding. Sensorgrams were obtained using standard conditions of 30 μl/min flow rate and HBS-EP running buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare)) as outlined under “Results.” Alexa 488-labeled oAβ42 was prepared as described in Ref. 27Jungbauer L.M.

After the removal of the freezing medium by serial changes of TBS (pH 7.4), the slide was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (10% goat serum in TBS). The slides were then stained with 1 μm TMR-labeled 15M S.A. peptide in 2% goat serum/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Excess unbound peptide was removed prior to mounting by extensive washing with TBS. The coverslip was mounted using Prolong Gold mounting media (Life Technologies). Animal experiments were approved by the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences Animal Ethics Committee and were performed in accordance with the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes. Male Swiss Outbred mice (6–8 weeks of age; 25–30 g) were used in the studies and had free access to food and water during the experimental periods. An aliquot (50 μl) containing 10 μCi of 3H-labeled 15M S.A. peptide was administered to mice by tail vein (intravenous) injection. Brain and plasma samples were collected over a 0.5–4-h period and the concentration of 15M S.A. peptide in plasma and brain homogenate was performed by liquid scintillation counting (Tri-Carb 2800 TR; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The brain concentrations were corrected by subtracting the brain microvascular volume (0.035 ml/g) using [14C]sucrose as a vascular marker (31Jin L. Li J. Nation R.L. Nicolazzo J.A.

Computational prediction of CNS drug exposure based on a novel in vivo dataset.Pharm. Res. 2012; 29: 3131-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the brain to plasma ratio of 3H-labeled 15M S.A. peptide was determined using the following formula: (corrected number of disintegrations per minute (dpm) per g of brain tissue)/(number of dpm per ml of plasma). The intactness of 3H-15M S.A. at post-dose time points following intravenous administration was assessed by HPLC. Briefly, brain samples were homogenized in a volume of MilliQ water (in ml) equal to twice the weight (in g) of the tissue using a glass rod. To 300 μl of brain homogenate or 100 μl of plasma, the same volume of acetonitrile was added prior to centrifugation at 14,100 × g for 5 min. An aliquot (100 μl) of the supernatant was then loaded onto a Waters Symmetry C18 column (5 × 4.6 mm). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% (v/v) TFA in MilliQ water and mobile phase B consisted of 60% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) TFA in MilliQ water. 3H-15M S.A. peptide was analyzed using the following gradient profile: 0 min, 95% A; 0–10 min, 70% A; 10–12 min, 95% A. The eluant from the column was collected every 0.5 min and the dpm of each fraction was measured by liquid scintillation counting.

https://openalex.org/W2140525517,"Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductases (FabG) are ubiquitously expressed enzymes that catalyse the reduction of acyl carrier protein (ACP) linked thioesters within the bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway. The products of these enzymes, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, are essential components of the bacterial cell envelope. The FASII reductase enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) has been the focus of numerous drug discovery efforts, some of which have led to clinical trials, yet few studies have focused on FabG. Like FabI, FabG appears to be essential for survival in many bacteria, similarly indicating the potential of this enzyme as a drug target. FabG enzymes are members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, and like other SDRs, exhibit highly conserved secondary and tertiary structures, and contain a number of conserved sequence motifs. Here we describe the crystal structures of FabG from Yersinia pestis (YpFabG), the causative agent of bubonic, pneumonic, and septicaemic plague, and three human pandemics. Y. pestis remains endemic in many parts of North America, South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa, and a threat to human health. YpFabG shares a high degree of structural similarity with bacterial homologues, and the ketoreductase domain of the mammalian fatty acid synthase from both Homo sapiens and Sus scrofa. Structural characterisation of YpFabG, and comparison with other bacterial FabGs and the mammalian fatty acid synthase, provides a strong platform for virtual screening of potential inhibitors, rational drug design, and the development of new antimicrobial agents to combat Y. pestis infections."
https://openalex.org/W2342315515,"Diabetes is a chronic inflammatory disease that carries a high risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the pathophysiological link between these disorders is not well known. We hypothesize that TLR4 signaling mediates high fat diet (HFD)-induced peripheral and cardiac glucose metabolic derangements. Mice with a loss-of-function mutation in TLR4 (C3H/HeJ) and age-matched control (C57BL/6) mice were fed either a high-fat diet or normal diet for 16 weeks. Glucose tolerance and plasma insulin were measured. Protein expression of glucose transporters (GLUT), AKT (phosphorylated and total), and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α and SOCS-3) were quantified in the heart using Western Blotting. Both groups fed a long-term HFD had increased body weight, blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as impaired glucose tolerance compared to mice fed a normal diet. TLR4-mutant mice were partially protected against long-term HFD-induced insulin resistance. In control mice, feeding a HFD decreased cardiac crude membrane GLUT4 protein content, which was partially rescued in TLR4-mutant mice. TLR4-mutant mice fed a HFD also had increased expression of GLUT8, a novel isoform, compared to mice fed a normal diet. GLUT8 content was positively correlated with SOCS-3 and IL-6 expression in the heart. No significant differences in cytokine expression were observed between groups, suggesting a lack of inflammation in the heart following a HFD. Loss of TLR4 function partially restored a healthy metabolic phenotype, suggesting that TLR4 signaling is a key mechanism in HFD-induced peripheral and cardiac insulin resistance. Our data further suggest that TLR4 exerts its detrimental metabolic effects in the myocardium through a cytokine-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2105739771,"With the continuous diversification of recombinant DNA technologies, the possibilities for new tailor-made protein engineering have extended on an on-going basis. Among these strategies, the use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a fusion domain has been widely adopted for cellular imaging and protein localization. Following the lead of the direct head-to-tail fusion of GFP, we proposed to provide additional features to recombinant proteins by genetic fusion of artificially derived binders. Thus, we reported a GFP-ready fusion tag consisting of a small and robust fusion-friendly anti-GFP Nanofitin binding domain as a proof-of-concept. While limiting steric effects on the carrier, the GFP-ready tag allows the capture of GFP or its blue (BFP), cyan (CFP) and yellow (YFP) alternatives. Here, we described the generation of the GFP-ready tag from the selection of a Nanofitin variant binding to the GFP and its spectral variants with a nanomolar affinity, while displaying a remarkable folding stability, as demonstrated by its full resistance upon thermal sterilization process or the full chemical synthesis of Nanofitins. To illustrate the potential of the Nanofitin-based tag as a fusion partner, we compared the expression level in Escherichia coli and activity profile of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) constructs, fused to a SUMO or GFP-ready tag. Very similar expression levels were found with the two fusion technologies. Both domains of the GFP-ready tagged TNFα were proved fully active in ELISA and interferometry binding assays, allowing the simultaneous capture by an anti-TNFα antibody and binding to the GFP, and its spectral mutants. The GFP-ready tag was also shown inert in a L929 cell based assay, demonstrating the potent TNFα mediated apoptosis induction by the GFP-ready tagged TNFα. Eventually, we proposed the GFP-ready tag as a versatile capture and labeling system in addition to expected applications of anti-GFP Nanofitins (as illustrated with previously described state-of-the-art anti-GFP binders applied to living cells and in vitro applications). Through a single fusion domain, the GFP-ready tagged proteins benefit from subsequent customization within a wide range of fluorescence spectra upon indirect binding of a chosen GFP variant."

The specimens fall into the morphological range of the fossil species P. favonii, which has been observed in other Cenozoic sites in the Northern Hemisphere. The present discovery represents the lowest latitude distribution of P. favonii in the world, and we are presenting the first P. favonii fossil described with detailed cuticular characteristics from China. Further, this finding demonstrates that the genus existed in the Oligocene Ningming region, South China, and provides new information for understanding the fossil history.

https://openalex.org/W2127351003,"South Africa has legally exported substantial quantities of lion bones to Southeast Asia and China since 2008, apparently as part of the multinational trade substituting bones and body parts of other large cats for those of the tiger in wine and other health tonics. The legal sale of lion bones may mask an illegal trade, the size of which is only partially known. An observed component of the illegal trade is that quantities of skeletons are sometimes declared falsely/fraudulently on CITES export permits. Furthermore, there are emerging concerns that bones from tigers reared in captivity in South Africa and elsewhere are being laundered as lion bones using CITES Appendix II permits. There is therefore a need for tools to monitor the trade in lion body parts and to distinguish between lions and tigers. Our research indicates that it is possible to use skeletons, skulls and cranial sutures to detect misdeclarations in the lion bone trade. It is also possible to use the average mass of a lion skeleton to corroborate the numbers of skeletons declared on CITES permits, relative to the weight of the consolidated consignments stated on the air waybills. When the mass of consolidated consignments of skeletons destined for export was regressed against the number of skeletons in that consignment, there was a strong correlation between the variables (r2 = 0.992) that can be used as a predictor of the accuracy of a declaration on a CITES permit. Additionally, the skulls of lions and tigers differ: two cranial sutures of lions align and their mandibles rock when placed on a flat surface, whereas the cranial sutures of tigers are not aligned and their mandibles rest naturally on two contact points. These two morphological differences between the skulls of tigers and lions are easy to observe at a glance and provide a method for distinguishing between the species if illegal trade in the bones is suspected and the skulls are present. These identifications should ideally be confirmed by a DNA test to provide rigorous evidence to prosecute offenders violating CITES regulations."
https://openalex.org/W2115365619,"Organismal diversity among and within species may affect ecosystem function with effects transmitting across ecosystem boundaries. Whether recipient communities adjust their composition, in turn, to maximize their function in response to changes in donor composition at these two scales of diversity is unknown. We use small stream communities that rely on riparian subsidies as a model system. We used leaf pack experiments to ask how variation in plants growing beside streams in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, USA affects stream communities via leaf subsidies. Leaves from red alder (Alnus rubra), vine maple (Acer cinereus), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) were assembled in leaf packs to contrast low versus high diversity, and deployed in streams to compare local versus non-local leaf sources at the among and within species scales. Leaves from individuals within species decomposed at varying rates; most notably thin leaves decomposed rapidly. Among deciduous species, vine maple decomposed most rapidly, harbored the least algal abundance, and supported the greatest diversity of aquatic invertebrates, while bigleaf maple was at the opposite extreme for these three metrics. Recipient communities decomposed leaves from local species rapidly: leaves from early successional plants decomposed rapidly in stream reaches surrounded by early successional forest and leaves from later successional plants decomposed rapidly adjacent to later successional forest. The species diversity of leaves inconsistently affected decomposition, algal abundance and invertebrate metrics. Intraspecific diversity of leaf packs also did not affect decomposition or invertebrate diversity. However, locally sourced alder leaves decomposed more rapidly and harbored greater levels of algae than leaves sourced from conspecifics growing in other areas on the Olympic Peninsula, but did not harbor greater aquatic invertebrate diversity. In contrast to alder, local intraspecific differences via decomposition, algal or invertebrate metrics were not observed consistently among maples. These results emphasize that biodiversity of riparian subsidies at the within and across species scale have the potential to affect aquatic ecosystems, although there are complex species-specific effects."
https://openalex.org/W2145092189,"Burgmer and Englich (2012) have reported that manipulating feelings of power can substantially improve performance on two motor tasks: golf and darts. We conducted two high-powered direct replications of the effects of power on golf, two online conceptual replications using mirror-tracing as a performance measure, and an additional conceptual replication using a cognitive performance measure (word-search). Overall, we found little to no effect of power on motor skill (d = 0.09, 95% CI[-0.07, 0.22], n = 603). We varied task difficulty, re-analyzed data without participants showing weak responses on manipulation checks, and tried adjusting performance scores for age, gender, and initial task skill. None of these secondary analyses revealed a strong effect of power on performance. A meta-analysis integrating our data with Burgmer & Englich leaves open the possibility that manipulating power could provide a modest boost in motor skill (d = 0.19, 95% CI [0.001, 0.38], n = 685). Unfortunately, the pattern of performance changes we observed was unrelated to group differences in perceived and rated power, suggesting that what motor effects do occur with this protocol may not be directly related to the construct of power.

In this study we characterize the PaaI thioesterase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpPaaI), including structural analysis based on crystal diffraction data to 1.8-Å resolution, to reveal two double hotdog domains arranged in a back to back configuration. Consistent with the crystallography data, both size exclusion chromatography and small angle x-ray scattering data support a tetrameric arrangement of thioesterase domains in solution. Assessment of SpPaaI activity against a range of acyl-CoA substrates showed activity for both phenylacetyl-CoA and medium-chain fatty-acyl CoA substrates. Mutagenesis of putative active site residues reveals Asn37, Asp52, and Thr68 are important for catalysis, and size exclusion chromatography analysis and x-ray crystallography confirm that these mutants retain the same tertiary and quaternary structures, establishing that the reduced activity is not a result of structural perturbations. Interestingly, the structure of SpPaaI in the presence of CoA provides a structural basis for the observed substrate specificity, accommodating a 10-carbon fatty acid chain, and a large conformational change of up to 38 Å in the N terminus, and a loop region involving Tyr38-Tyr39. This is the first time PaaI thioesterases have displayed a dual specificity for medium-chain acyl-CoAs substrates and phenylacetyl-CoA substrates, and we provide a structural basis for this specificity, highlighting a novel induced fit mechanism that is likely to be conserved within members of this enzyme family.

https://openalex.org/W1929282580,"Sheep is an important livestock in the world for meat, dairy and wool production. The third version of sheep reference genome has been recently assembled, but sheep DNA methylome has not been profiled yet. In this study, we report the comprehensive sheep methylome with 94.38% cytosine coverage at single base resolution by sequencing DNA samples from Longissimus dorsi of dizygotic Sunit sheep, which were bred in different habitats. We also compared methylomes between the twin sheep. DNA methylation status at genome-scale differentially methylated regions (DMRs), functional genomic regions and 248 DMR-containing genes were identified between the twin sheep. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG annotations of these genes were performed to discover computationally predicted function. Lipid metabolism, sexual maturity and tumor-associated categories were observed to significantly enrich DMR-containing genes. These findings could be used to illustrate the relationship between phenotypic variations and gene methylation patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2162688532,"Purpose Little is known about the susceptibility of posterior segment tissues, particularly the human retinal pigment epithelium (hRPE), to Chlamydia trachomatis. The purpose of the study was to investigate the possibility of infecting the hRPE with Chlamydia trachomatis, and to examine the infectivity of different Chlamydia trachomatis clinical isolates for hRPE cells and the hRPE cell response to the infection. Methods Cultured hRPE and McCoy cells were inoculated with eight Chlamydia trachomatis (serovar E) clinical isolates at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2.0 or 0.3. To detect Chlamydia trachomatis, samples were stained immunohistochemically with anti-major outer membrane protein antibodies at 24h, 48h, and 72h postinoculation (PI). The changes in the expression of signaling molecules and proteins of cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix in hRPE cells were examined immunohistochemically. Results All eight clinical isolates demonstrated ability to infect hRPE cells. At equal MOI of 0.3, the infectivity of Chlamydia trachomatis clinical isolates for RPE culture was found to be at least as high as that for McCoy cell culture. At 24h PI, the percentage of inclusion-containing cells varied from 1.5 ± 0.52 to 14.6 ± 3.3% in hRPE cell culture infected at MOI of 2.0 against 0.37 ± 0.34 to 8.9 ± 0.2% in McCoy cell culture infected at MOI of 0.3. Collagen type I, collagen type IV, basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin–8 expression at 48h PI were maximally increased, by 2.1-, 1.3-, 1.5-, 1.5- and 1.6-fold, respectively, in the Chlamydia trachomatis-infected compared with control hRPE cell culture specimens (P < 0.05). Conclusions This study, for the first time, proved the possibility of infecting hRPE cultured cells with Chlamydia trachomatis, which leads to proproliferative and proinflammatory changes in the expression of signaling molecules and extracellular matrix components."

In Shakespeare's play, the Duke of Albany warns that “striving to better, oft we mar what's well”. In the search for a solution, in other words, we can let the perfect become the enemy of the good. In his 1945 book Why You Lose at Bridge, S. J. Simon called it the half-loaf strategy: the most successful players aim for the best possible result, rather than the best result possible. In human and political crises, the best possible result is often one of damage limitation — an outcome that avoids or delays the chance of a large-scale and catastrophic change. So, the question then becomes: how can we achieve such an outcome? Language: en"
